               WHO begins (my most Noble
Lord) and not ends the
Race, receiues no Crowne.
I haue begunne to submit to
your Patronage, my former
endeauours: And therefore
thus continue their grace,
with prescription of your honorable
name. Your most
Noble disposition neuer giuing ouer free and honest
seruices; T'were inconstancie, respectlesse, and rude
to relinquish, or not euer to celebrate you: Or to
an encreasing Nobilitie and merit, to decrease in obseruance
and Tribute. I haue chosen now to present
your Lordship with the Life of one of those
Kings, which my former French disfranchisements,
and makings free in our English, haue in other sort
toucht at: Now selected, augmented, and more particularly

illustrated, by the neerer, and more labor'd
insight of one of their learned'st, and most profit-making
Obseruers. All obiections to his labours, he hath
answered himselfe in Sequell; my paines being onely
to render him truely, and with as much grace of our
English representation as I might. Nought rests
but your Lordships leasurable perusall, and examination
of both: Together with my zealous desire of
your honorable conceit; that all Offices, performed
on my part, in this or any other worthy subiect, shall
euer be particularly confined to your chosen seruice,
and noble acceptance. So euer remaining

ADVERTISEMENT.
            
               ALthough that all Bookes which are presented vnto the
King, proceed not from those excellent pens which haue taken
life vnder his raigne, to aduance the French eloquence to the
height of glory, no more then all Statues which were dedicated
to Apollo, in Creet, Rhodes and Cypres, were not made by
the hands of Zeuxis or of Phidias, nor the wine which
was offered to Iupiter, in his sacrifice, did not alwaies come
out of the cup, nor grew in those Vines which he desired: yet
this History, being but in her Infancy, hath merited the fauour
of his iudgement, and of the greatest of his Court, who haue taken delight to
see, as in an Astro
                  •
               ab, the rising and fall of those which are on earth as the Sunne is
in Heauen. This is the rampier wherein shee fortifies her selfe against so many affronts
wherewith she hath been threatned, for curious spirits are not pleased with all
kinds of writing, no more then the Planets feed vpon all sorts of vapours.
            The most difficult to please will obiect against her, and mee thinkes I vnderstand
these words proceeding out of their mouthes, or from their thoughts: why the History
of Lewis the eleuenth more then of any other? can they giue vs a better then that of
Philip de Commines? to all these exceptions she hath but one answere.
            
               What though I giue not all humors content?
               A worke that's great cannot please eu'ry taster:
               But of so many tasts, so different,
               Let it suffice me that it likes my Master.
            
            I haue not affected in this worke the glory of mine owne wit, I haue contented my
selfe with that of obedience. I haue made it such as you see it, his commandement carries
his reasons, and staies the curiositie of such as desires others. This great Prince,
who entertained himselfe and slept sometimes vpon the actions of this King, as Alexander
did vpon those of Achilles, and who made no lesse esteeme of Phil. de Com.
then the Emperor Charles the fift had done, would haue his History beautified and illustrated
in the same manner that I present it vnto you, to the end that being compared
with his, Iudgement might make the difference, and that of two they might
frame a liuely Image of that which might serue for the conduct of a Prince. The
brightnes of truth appeares by the opposition of her contrary, and shadowes giue grace
to liuely coulours, examples are of more force then precepts. Cowards instruct the
Couragious, and lyars make Men speake the truth. He that turnes from vice encounters

vertue. Ismenias mingled both good and bad Flute-players together, to
the end that the diuersitie of their musick might be a lesson to imitate the one and
leaue the other, and that comparison might make the difference. There is nothing so
difficult as to paralel Princes; if there be any conformitie in their fortunes, it is found
in their vertues, if they haue attained to one end, it hath not been by the same course,
and therefore they say there are a hundreth yeares required to breed a great Prince
or a great Captaine. Lewis hath carried, and Henry doth yet carry the glorious
Title of the most renowned and magnanimous Princes of their ages: but they haue
not purchased it by the selfe same meanes, the difference hath beene great in their
humours, and in their kinde of gouernement: Both had one kinde of beginning, the
one of the house of Valois, the other of that of Bourbon, two branches of S. Lewis.
There was some conformitie in their first fortunes; being both retired from Court,
and both instructed in patience in the schoole of necessitie: The beginning of their
reignes had some resemblance, for both had seene a great and mighty faction raised
against them, vnder two goodly pretexts, the one of the Common-weale, the other of
Religion: both haue been in paine to expell forraine enemies, to pacifie domestique, and
to diuide their humors; but what the one hath done by policie and force, the other
hath effected by the iustnes of his armes, and the mildnes of his clemencie. Both were
troubled to moderate those spirits, which had yet a feeling of ciuill diuisions: they
haue tried the infidelitie of their seruants, and haue made themselues to bee feared
and redoubted; but the one hath maintained the respect of his Maiestie by feare and
seueritie, and the other by wisedome and loue. The raigne of the one was a Sea of
sto
                  •
               mes and tempest, the other a calme, milde, and cleare hauen. Lewis of much did
little, Henry of nothing did wonders; Lewis thrust himselfe into apparant dangers
to reap doubtfull fruits, Henry was neuer seene in any place but fortunate and victorious
Lewis medled with all things and would see and know all; Henry is a
Prince of all howers and for all affaires: Lewis feared the fat of his people, Henry
beleeues that the felicitie of the subiect is the glory of the Prince. Lewis the eleuenth
had royall vertues, but they were not all pure; his wisedome had a touch of oun
                  •
               ing,
his iustice of seueritie, his valour of rashnes, his clemencie of feare, his liberaliti
                  •
                of
profusion, and his pietie of dissimulation: Henry takes delight to be what he appeares,
and to appeare what he is, wise and fore-seeing without deceit, iust without rigor, couragious
without feare or indiscretion, courteous, milde, magnanimous without pusillanimitie,
liber all with iudgement, and religious without hypocrisie.
            
               Lewis the eleuenth contemned the Sciences, and learning, Henry fauours them,
makes choise of the best wits to restore the exercises, peoples the Colledges, and labors
to make the famous Academies of France to flourish, and the Vniuersitie of Paris, the
eldest daughter of Kings, the Queene of the Academies of Christendome. Lewis was
blamed for the little care he had in the breeding, and institution of his son: Henry
considering how much it doth imp
                  •
               rt that the generous inclinations of my Lord the
Dauphin, should be seconded with good instruction, hath committed the care to a
Noble-man, which abounds in wisedome, generositie, experience and fidelitie for the
greatnes of that charge. Hee doth alwaies hold the minde of this Prince elleuated to
things worthy of his birth and courage. France is bound vnto the King, who could
make so good a choice; the election proues the dignitie of the person chosen, makes the
excellencie of the choosers iudgement to bee seene, and shewes that heauen hath conspired
with him to make so happy an accord of two such different ages. Lewis would
not suffer his sonne to vnderstand aboue two words of Latin: Henry wils that his

deare sonne should haue as much knowledge as a Prince ought to haue; he causeth his
yonger yeeres to be instructed in learning, by the diligence of a great and excellent
wit, who carefully and indiciously doth shew him vvhat he should know, and vvhat he
should be ignorant of: he giues him the whole vvorld for a lesson; for companions, the
study of Emperors and Kings; for a table, the image of glory; for Philosophy, the knowledge
of humors and manners, and entertaining him sweetly in the varietie of Historie,
vvhich is onely the Booke of Kings, frames his mind to a knowledge vvhich should
shew it selfe more by actions then by discourse: for as he himselfe saies,

                  For one that's not wedded to Arts, nor of them is vnknowing,
                  Tis skill enough to render them such honor as is owing.
               
            
            
               Lewis had more care then his predecessors to fortefie his frontiers, and forts. Henry
hath made great workes for the beautifying of his royall houses, and for the commoditie
of his people he makes his forts vnexpugnable, and hath freed his affaires
from the outrages and violence of necessitie. Lewis was inconstant in his resolutions,
and did sometime impaire them by change. Henry in his greatest affaires saies
nothing but vvhat he does, and doth nothing without premeditation, calling vppon
God in his thoughts. That vvhich is framed in his minde remaines firme. He hath
so much foresight as he preuents all impediments, and hath so great power as nothing
is impossible vnto him. Lewis loued a country ruined rather then lost, Henry, giuen
from heauen for the generall good of the earth, hath saued, enricht and preserued
the townes, which by the iustice of his armes he might haue spoiled and ruined. Lewis
neuer left offences vnpunished, Henry hath lost no part of his memory but iniuries.
Lewis tooke a delight to cut off the heads of poppy and eares of corne which doe ouertop
the rest, the torrent of his iustice hath often carried away the innocent with the
guiltie. Henry hath so vsed his clemencie towards his greatest enemies, as if the
Iustice of God should demand of him the number, he would easily giue him an account.
Lewis left France so weake, so ruinous and so deiected, as it had nothing remaining
but the tongue to complaine: Henry hath chased ne
                  •
               de, idlenes and pouerty out of
France, and from the necessitie of his affaires: and to conclude the paralel, there is
not any nation which doth not reuerence the name, admire the fortune, extoll the vertues,
enuie the triumphs, sing or vveepe for the victories, loue the gouernment, and
feare and redoubt the power of this great and incomparable Prince.
            This Historie doth truely show the diuersitie of the two portraits, and giues the
King an incredible content, to see that the raigne of a great, mighty, redouted; and
wise King, may not enter into comparion with his, by the difference which hee hath
set in the order of his treasure, in the number of his forces, in the force of his armes,
in the fortification of his frontiers, in the structures of his great buildings, and in the
restablishment of the publike safety and felicitie. As for the other obiection which I
haue made as done, it is true that Philip de Commines hath related the life of this
Prince so exactly and iudiciously, as if Statius, who hath written the life of Achilles
after Homer, did not maintaine my designe by his example, I should yeeld my selfe
vanquished of indiscretion and presumption.
            
               Quamquam acta Viri multum inclita cantu
               Moeonio, sed plura vacant, nos ire per omnem
               Sic amor est, heroa velis, Sciroque latentem,
               Dulichia proferre tuba, nec in Hectore tracto
               Sistere, sed tota iuuenem deducere Troia.
            
            
               Though his great deeds by Homers lofty vaine
               Be highly sung, yet much is left vnsaied:
               Weele trace him all, and in Dulichian straine,
               Sound how this peere was close in Scyros laid;
               Nor in his dragging Hector stop our verse;
               But his yong Acts in all Troyes siege rehearse.
            
            Iudgement must be the poulder of separation to reduce euery thing to his element,
and will show that he hath not so reapt his field, but he hath left some eares to gather:
In like manner I doe not thinke that I haue spoken all things so fully, and cleerely, after
him, but there will yet remaine something to exercise others after me. The huntsman
is commended that hunts and takes, but he is not blamed if hee hath not taken
all: We must yeeld something to the curiositie and diligence of others. He teacheth
not well that teacheth all. Another spirit will happily finde somethings wherewith
to please himselfe in this goodly ample field of the life of this Prince. I confesse I ha
                  •
               e
drawne the principall pieces of this building from Philip de Commines, but the order
of the work, the Architecture, and the Ornaments are mine owne. He could not
speake, of his owne knowledge, of the affaires of Lewis the eleuenth but from the yeare,
1472. when as he left the D. of Bourgundy to serue him; but this History speaketh of
the infancy of this Prince, of his retreat into Flanders, and of all that had happened
memorable throughout the world, during the three and twenty yeeres of his raigne,
and, besides many manuscripts, I haue seene the forraine Histories of those times.
            The ten bookes are extended vpon that which concernes his life, and the eleuenth
vpon the obseruation of that which was done in those times, and of that which is done
now, to show that Lewis hath been as much inferiour to Henry, as he was held superior
to other Kings. If all things haue not bin exactly and curiously digested, if in many places
there be found defects, it sufficeth to say that the worke hath been made following
the Court, and printed in my absence: To conclude, mens mindes should not be more
difficult to please then the Gods of the ancients; Hee that had no milke gaue them water,
and he that found no wine offered milke, salt for incense, leaues and flowers for
fruits, and fruits for beasts. He that giues what he hath, and doth what he can, is
bound to no more. They that content not themselues with that which seemes good,
trouble themselues to seeke for better. Whatsoeuer happen, all these disgraces shall neuer
tire nor daunt me: Wee doe not leaue to till and sow the ground, although the seasons
be bad and the haruest vnfruitfull. Hee that cannot content all the world must
endeuour to content himselfe.
         
         
            
            AN ELOGIE OF LEWIS THE
eleuenth French King.
            
               
                  LEWIS of Valois only like vnto him-selfe and vnlike
to all other Kings, was borne at Bourges, and
presented at the font by Iohn Duke of Alancon; he
past his infancy in the ruines & miseries of France,
and the most sensible afflictions of his father, to
whom there was a part of the Crowne remaining.
At eleuen yeares the greatest of the Realme, abusing the innocency of
his first age, to couer their discontentment and ambition, made him
the head of a faction, which was so vniust, vnnaturall & odious vnto
the French, as it was presently abandoned euen by them that were
the Authors, and lasted but nine months. At fourteene yeares hee
was married to the Princesse of Scotland, at fifteene Generall of a
royall Army into Normandy and Languedoc: At twenty one hee
put all Germany in alarum, tooke Mombeliart, besieged Basill, defeated
sixe thousand Swisses & ouer-run Alsa
                  •
               ia. The bayes of this
triumph were all couered with bloud, and soone after with tears, by
the death of the Princesse of Scotland his wife.
            The difficuly which hee felt to submit his yong and boyling humors
to the temper of reason, and his will to that of his father, drew
him from the Court, and intertained him some yeares in Dauphine,
whereas he married Charlotte of Sauoy, and made warre against the
Duke of Sauoy his father in law, drawing vnto his seruice some by
promises, others by fauour and presents, but most of all by rigour &
seuerity, oppressing his subiects of Dauphine with vnknowne charges,
so as the cyment of his designes was tempered with bloud, sweat
& teares. The King, who was not insensible of Complaints, and wept
by his subiects teares, made it knowne that he did loue his estate better
then his sonne. He came into Dauphine, and at the first glance of
his eyes he dispersed the designes of such as would trouble the order
of nature and the Lawes of the Realme.
            
               Lewis, desiring rather to trust the enemies of his house then his fathers
bounty, retires to Bruxelles to Duke Phillip, wheras he liued six
yeares with Charlotte of Sauoy his wife, and there receiued the first
blessing of his marriage, by the birth of his sonne Ioachim of Valois,
who dyed presently. All this time taught him a lesson of patience,
being forced to make a vertue of necessity, learning to be wise in prosperity

and constant in aduersity. In the end Charles gaue him place
and left him the Realme vnited vnder the obedience of one, the English
being expelled, and hauing nothing remaining vnto them but
Calis. All the forces of this powerfull house of Bourgondy did accompany
him vntill hee had the Crowne set vpon his head, which
he tooke at Rhemes. Paris receiued him as it were in triumph, and all
France seemed to reuiue againe at the rising of this Starre.
            The contempt of Princes of the bloud, & the change of officers, the
seueritie in searching out things past, with the oppression of the people,
were the cause of a league which was made against him betwixt
the Duke of Berry his brother, and the dukes of Burgundy, Brittany,
Calabria, and Bourbon, with the greatest of the realme. A powerfull
and famous faction, which abused the simple, made the wicked mad,
and thrust good men into despaire. The bad successe of the Battell of
Montlehery was not able to shake the constancy and fidelitie of the
subiect. Paris, whose motions had alwaies caused the rest of France
to wauer, held firme, and this great storme fel, and was dispersed before
her wals. The greatest Cities of the realme, and the chiefe Prouinces
cōtinued constant in their duties, & the interest of priuat men
being contented, the pursute of the publike good was staied. These arrowes
being vnbound, Lewis had good meanes to breake them. The
D. of Normandy is forced to quit Roan, & the D. of Brittaine auoids
the storme by his submission. The duke of Burgundy is troubled with
the mutinies of his subiects, who desirous of innouations & change
did more affect the Earle of Charolois then the Duke of Bourgundy.
            
               Lewis to be reuenged kindles a fire in his estate, and stirs vp them of
Liege, yet making shew that he desired nothing more then the obseruation
of the treaty of Conflans: relying too much vpon his wit and
forces, he ingaged himselfe indiscreetly in Peronne, where the Castle
was in show his lodging, and in effect his prison; he saw himselfe forced
to arme against his friends, & to receiue a law from him to whom
he thought to giue it. The assembly of the estates at Tours iudge of
the iniury of his promises, and cannot yeeld that Normandy (one of
the goodliest flowers of the crowne of France) should be dismembred:
they declare war against the D. of Bourgundy. The King takes the
towne of S. Quintin, then Amiens, and seeing that the Duke of
Burgundy, in the desolation of his affaires, was prest to giue his
daughter in marriage to the Duke of Guienne, he doth not in this prosperitie
imbrace the opportunitie, but is content to haue amazed his

enemy, and grants him a truce, during the which he sees, as from the
shore, that cruell tempest of England which ouerthrew the house of
Lancaster, whom he fauoured, & assured the Scepter in that of Yorke,
succoured and supported by the D. of Burgundy. The Duke of Guiennes
death brake the truce and hopes of peace, and brought all them
to the brinke of death and despaire which had followed his fortune,
who were reduced to such misery, as then the most miserable, hearing
the discourse, found therein consolation and amazement. Many families
were ouerthrowne, and that rich and famous house of Armagnac
was full of strange tragedies and reuolutions. The warre,
furiously inhumane, began againe, and the Duke of Bourgundy
armed to reuenge his death vpon innocents. The towne of Nesle
saw heapes of dead carkasses in her streets, and streames of bloud
in her Churches: Beauuais stayed the torrent of his fury, and diuerted
it vpon Normandy.
            The D. of Brittany, although he were gouerned by another head,
considering the danger wherein hee was, submitted himselfe to the
stronger, and seeing the K. at Angiers with an army of 50000. men
came vnto him to demand a peace. The King of Sicily was dispos
                  •
               est
of his country of Anjou, beeing forced to retire into Prouence with
griefe to suruiue his Son Iohn D. of Calabria & Lorraine, & Nicholas
Marques of Ponte his grand-child. Hee doth represent the estate of his
age & house in the deuice which he carried of an old stock which had
no greene sprout to make it liue, it was Rene D. of Lorraine, Son to Yoland
of Anjou his daughter. The Constable, who would diuide his
heart in two to nourish & entertaine the warre, thrust the duke of Burgundy
into fury & the King into distrust of him, & hauing left the path
of moderation & wisedome, he came vnto the king by that of pride &
distrust, refusing to represent himselfe vnto his maiesty but armed, nor
to speake vnto him but by a barre, & vpon a causey well garded with
soldiers.
            The D. of Burgondy not able to liue idly during this Truce seekes
for worke in Germany, passeth to Treues, propounds to change his
dukes Crowne for a Kings, & is offended with the Emperor for refusing
it: He besiegeth Nuze, and seeing that the crosses, which he had
in his affaires proceeded onely from the King, he perswades the K. of
England to passe the seas, to renew the pretensions of his predecessors,
and to make a fatall combustion of all France. But Lewis diuerts this
storme, and makes a bridge of gold for this King to repasse the sea, sending

him home as wel content with peace as he was come resolute to
war. The King reapt both honor & profit, and by his foresight disappointed
the great designes which were laid vnder fauor of this army,
and although it had diuers pretexts, as diuers branches of the same
stock of sedition and ambition, they were all dangerous; all the kinds
of this poison were mortall.
            The Duke of Bourgundy was forced to accept a peace of the king,
against whom he had proclaimed warre: The coale, which entertained
the fire of discord was quenched, and this head that made the
windes to blow; which caused the quiet of France to tremble, was
cut off at the Greue.
            The Duke of Bourgundy, to reuenge a light iniury done vnto the
Earle of Romond, vndertakes a great warre against the Sui
                  •
               les, which
by the vnfortunate euent of three battels, made him to loose his baggage
at Granson; his reputation, his forces and his hopes at Morat;
and at Nancy his life, with a part of his estate. The King reapt the
fruit of this warre, hauing fauoured and supported the Duke of Lorraine
against the great designes of this Conqueror. Hee seased vpon
both Burgundies, and vpon a part of Artois, and had forced the Archduke
Maximilian to leaue the low countries, and to leade the Princesse
his wife into Germany, with repentance of his mariage, if the battell
of Guinegaste had not troubled the face of his affaires, and changed
the designes of warre into resolutions of peace, which was confirmed
by the marriage of Charles Dauphin of France with Margaret of
Austria.
            Age, which neuer comes alone, suffers not the King to vndertake
any long and difficult conque
                  •
               s, and binds him to thinke vpon the
meanes to leaue his crowne peaceably vnto his Sonne, as it was rich,
mighty, and more assured then hee had receiued it from his father,
hauing beautified it with many goodly flowers, as Burgundy, Anjou,
Barre, Prouence, and the recouerie of the Townes in Picardy, and of
some in Artois.
            
            Being prest with troubles of mind as much as with the languishing
of the body, and reduced to an estate more lamentable then lamented,
in the which he could not liue, & would not dye: he straue foure
whole yeares against the force of an incurable disease, and repulst
by strange meanes the approches of death, to retaine life, which was
but too long for his miseries, and infirmities, as it had beene too short
for his designes and hopes. He was forced to yeeld himselfe to discretion

the 30th. day of August 1483. the 22th. yeare of his raigne, and
of his age the sixtith. He carried nothing from the place which hee
left, but the proud title to haue freed the Kings of France from subiection
or wardship, capable to command, not a Realme only, but the
whole world. He was interred at our Lady of Clery, hauing obtained
from Pope Sixtus the fourth an excommunication against all such as
would lay his body in any other tombe then in that which hee had
built for himselfe, and Charlotte of Sauoy his wife. He did often visit
this last abode, and did lye in it sōmetimes, that by the meditation of
death, he might descend liuing into the graue.
            The triumphant Chariot of the prosperities of his life was drawn
by Wisdome, Iustice, Liberality and Reputation; wisdome made him
victorious ouer his enemies, Iudge of the controuersie betwixt the
Crownes of Castile, and Nauarre: Protector of the liberty of the
Common-weales of Italy: Arbitrator of the peace betwixt Rome and
Florence, and then betwixt Rome and Venice, He added the county
of Prouence to the Crowne: Hee vndertooke strange impossible designes.
Iustice, alwayes in heat by his extreame seuerity, did more often
put the sword of execution into his hand, then the ballance of
due consideration: hee caused many great men to feele his rigour
whose processe he began by the execution.
            Liberality, opened him the hearts and gates of townes, which hee
battered with his money; caused many which were distracted from
him to come like Bees at the sound of a bason: hee vsed it to bind the
English to his friendship, the Suisses to his succors, and the Brittaines
to his seruice: Reputation hath held all the powers of Europe in admiration
of him, and hath made him to bee redoubted of strangers,
and feared of his Subiects.
            Yet the differences betwixt the priuate and publike fortunes of this
Prince were great; his fortunes were of long Time in fauour amidst
his prosperities: In his raigne, he was a wise, happy King, a good and
a bountifull maister, a distrustfull friend, a cruell enemy, and a terrible
neighbour; in his house a bad son, a bad father, & a bad husband: he
had no children by Margret Steward his first wife, and by Charlotte of
Sauoy, his second, hee had Ioachim, Charles, Francis, Anne and
Ioane.

Duke of Burgundy, who had drawn the Queene vnto his party, had

Earle of Vertus was married to the Duke of Burgundies daughter.
            But all the parts of France recouer not their former health: The
warre renues againe, and the Dauphin is no more for the Burgundian,
whose principall force consists in the sedition of Paris and the
succours of the English, who making their profit of ciuill diuisions,
win the battell of Azingcourt, which was called the vnfortunate
day of the 25. of October, 1415.The battle of Azing-Court. The Duke of Orleans, armed to reuenge
his fathers death and the libertie of his country, was led prisoner
into England, and if religion had not comforted him, he had
no lesse reason then Pompey,

libertie, and couetousnes against freedome:Death of the Dolphin and Duke of Turraine. This losse was
followed by the death of Lewis the Dauphin, and of Iohn Duke of
Touraine, the Kings second sonne.
            By the death of these two, Charles Earle of Ponthieu saw himselfe
in the first degree of the Princes of the bloud, and presently
made show that he had been bred vp to apprehend the iniury which
the Duke of Burgundy had done vnto his vncle. All the Princes
and Noble men which had followed the house of Orleans

came vnto him, and among others, the Constable of Armagnac:
but his greatest affliction was, for the vnnaturall hatred
which the Queene his mother bare him, who declared her selfe against
him Regent of the Realme, & was maintained in that quarrel
by the Duke of Burgundy: vnder her was that cruell massacre committed
the 12. of Iune 1418: whereas theAmassacre at Paris vpon the Armagnacks from 4 of the clock in the morning the 12 of Iune vntil the next day 10. of the clock. To note the Constable by the scarse which he carried they flead a bend of his skin and tyed it crosse his body, his office was confirmed to the Duke of Lorraine, and the Chancellors to Eustace de Lastre. Constable of Armagnac
and the Chancellor de Marle were slaine, and the Dauphin ranne
a daungerous fortune, if Tanneguy du Chastel; Prouost of Paris, and
his faithfull seruant had not saued him in the Bastille. Paris saw
it selfe reduc'd to that miserable estate, as it seemed a retrait for
Beares and Tigers.
            During this fatall diuision, the English preuailed in Normandy

and the Duke of Burgundy; vnder the assurance whereof the

The 10. of Nouember, 1419. he came & was slaine vpon the bridge, which was fortified with 3. barres. The Duke hauing past the first entred into some apprehension of his fortune, and meeting Tanreguy du Chastel, he laid his hand vpon his shoulder, saying: Behold h

               ,
and presenting himselfe vpon his knee, Robert de Loire, taking him by
the arme, sayd vnto him: rise, you are but too honourable; who rising,
laid his hand vpon his sword to drawe it forward, for that it hung
too much back, then said de Loire vnto him; Doe you lay your hand vpon
your sword before my Lord the Dauphin? whereupon Tanneguy du
Chastell stroke him so forceably vpon the face with a battell-axe,
as he made him to fall vpon his knee and cut off his chin, another
thrust his sword into his belly: The body being stript was drawne into
a mill, and buryed the next day.
            This death reuenged the house of Orleans, but it gaue so great a
share of the Realme to strangers, as there remained very little for
Charles, who presently after the death of the Duke of Burgundy was
declared by the king his father (at the perswasion of his mother)
vnworthy to succeede vnto the crowne of France.
            Hee might iustly haue appealed from these declarations to the
Kings good sence; but seeing him decay daily, and that hee was still
vnder the gouernment of this Medea, he chose rather to appeale to

fearing to be abandoned,Euery one desires grace of the King. their partie growing weake and decreasing

was so good as he gloried to be vndeseruedly offended, by men

            When the King saw that he came not, that the prefixed day was
past, and that the English, who besieged Harfleu, called him into
Normandie, hee would temporise no longer, but suffered his Armie
to spoile the Duke of Bourbons Countrie. His foreward did
besiege and take Vichy. Cusset and Varennes yeelded. The whole

            The wilfulnes of this Prince ruined the countrey, euery man
found his desseigne vniust, and the affection he bare vnto his seruants
vniust, the consideration of whom should bee of more force
then that of the publicke good, for the which they might sometimes

Earle of Eu to bee a meanes that the king would be pleased that

            But hee protracted no time to reprehend the Duke of Bourbon,Repreh

notes him the place and the number, being fiue, hee reprocheth
vnto him the iniustice and indiscretion of a designe which sought
to put the father vnder the sonnes gouernment; adding that if that

loue and respect of some did not withhold him, hee would make
him feele his displeasure.
            What could hee answere? The very feeling of his fault did
presse him. The offender must yeeld to the iustice, and the Innocent
to the force of the stronger. He renues all the vowes of his
obedience, and affection, and submits his will vnto the kings, hee
commends his bountie, so apparant by the number of his offences,
and so necessarie for them that had offended, whose preseruation
did serue as an increase to his glorie, and a trophee to his
clemencieThey to whome the Prince giues life, liue not but to the glorie of his clemencie..
            The next day the Dauphin presents himselfe vnto the king,
who did not entreat him as nurses doe children which flatter
them when they fall. Hee did let him vnderstand that his fall
had carried him to the ineuitable ruine of his honour and fortune,
if the bountie of a father had not as much will to retire him, as
the iustice of a king had reason to punish him: In a word, he said
he would cease to be a good father vnto him, if hee did not begin

            The Dauphin assuring himselfe of his fathers bountie and clemencie
speakes no more but for his seruants,The Dauphin will not leaue his seruants to whom safe conducts
had beene refused. The king declared that they had made
themselues vnworthy of his grace; that they had deserued to bee
made an example to others, as the authors of this rebellion, which
had made the wicked impudent, and brought good men to despaire:

but when hee saw himselfe a prisoner in the Dauphins power, hee
said that whatsoeuer hee had confest was against his owne conscience

his goods which the King had seazed on. After hee had expiated
this offence in prison, the King restored him his liberty giuing the
Earledome of Foix for a caution. The Dauphin at his returne from
this voiage was sent into Normandy with the title of Lieftenant
Generall. But we must obserue that he was twenty yeares old before
he had any gouernment, and that the King gaue it him only to

not vntill he did aduance, but looke which way he would turne
the head of his forces. The Lord of Ramstein receiues him at
Altkilch, a Towne which he held by engagement of the Bishop of
Basill for 12000. florens. The Nobillity of the Country comes
vnto him, and to be reuenged of the people, and to preserue their
howses, they offer him the seruice of their swords. The Armies
vsed incredible inhumanities vpon this poore people, who gaue

            The Towne of Bassil knew well that the councill would draw
this storme vpon them,Good order of them of Basill. and that King Charles the seuenth would
reuenge the degradation of Eugenius the Pope: and therefore
they omitted nothing that might serue for their defence & safety:
they made a bulwarke at the Port of Spalen, and rased all that
was about the Towne which might help the besiegers: they appointed
two Bels, one for warre, and the other for fire, by the first
euery one knew whither hee should goe, by the second Churchmen
and Monkes onely were bound to runne to the fire. They
caused a proclamation to be made in the country, that whosoeuer
would bring his goods and prouision into the Towne, the Bourguemasters
would bee bound to restore it againe, or to pay the iust

            The house of Austria had cast the Apple of discord among
the Suisses. ZurichSuisses besiege was allyed to Sygismond Archduke of Austria, the
Cantons of Berne, Lucerne, Vry, Suuitz, Vnderual, and Glaris, came
to besiege Zurick, to force them to renounce this allyance. Beeing
at this siege they are aduertised that Iohn of Rechberg in the beginning
of August had surprised the Towne of Bruck, in the Country
of Ergueu, belonging to the Canton of Berne, that hee had committed
great cruelties there, and had sent the spoile by water to
Laustemberg: and the chiefe prisoners to Farnsberg. The common
feeling they had of the priuate offences of their Allies, suffers
them not to dissemble this iniurie. Hee that attempts against the
least Hamlet of this common-weale, giues an Alarum to all the
Cantons: they ranne thither as if the fire had beene in their owne
houses.The Lawe of alliance, which is that of friendship, requires that friends and allies should apprehend

            They of Basill gaue them notice that they should bee carefull
how they did aduance, that it would bee a great rashnes for them
to seeke to force through so mighty an Armie, which held all the
passages. But the Suissees beleeue that the Lion is not so furious
as he is painted: Being incouraged, and glorious of that which had
so happily succeeded, in the morning they will not heare speake of
staying, and much lesse of retyring. The brauest courages shew
themselues in dangers:Not to yeeld, but to resist the sharpest and most dangerous accidents, is a signe of a great courage. Romanum est agere et pati fortia.
                It belongs onely vnto them to doe and endure
difficult things. They are more inquisitiue of the place where
the enemies are, then of their numbers, and holding all manner of
stay for a kinde of cowardise, they marche directly towards the
Towne, and finding the passage at the bridge stopt, they swimme
ouer the riuer of BisreinThe Townes-men of Basill were in counsell how to draw in their succors without danger. Munster saith that the Suisses beeing vpon a little

            The Romans would not haue commended this furie; they held
it vnfitting for the greatnes and Maiestie of the Empire, and Emperour
of their armies, to passe riuers otherwise then vpon bridges,
hauing gardes set at eyther end

               . For this onely reason, and without
any other necessitie Cesar made a bridge vpon the Rhin, and
was nothing amazed at the bredth, swiftnes, nor depth of this riuer·
The Suisses were much troubled with the water and the enemy,
before they could recouer the bankes,Battell of S. Ieams Hospitall. and then by the fauour of a
little Hill they slip into S. Iames Hospitall. They of the Towne, for
that they would not faile to releieue them who came so freely and
generously to their succors, sent forth two troopes to meete them:
but there was an Ambush of eight thousand horses layed for them,
able to haue broken the Battalions of Suissees, if they had beene
as equall in numberThe number of souldiours in a Legion, haue been diuers. In the time of Romulus it was of six thousand foote and 600. horse, of 4000. during the Commonweale. That which Scipio led into Affrike was of 6000. And two Legions in Caesars Armie made not 7000. men. as they did imitate in order the Roman Legions.
They that were in garde in the Towers of the Towne aduertised
them of the danger, and made them returne.
            
               
The Suisses had barticadoed themselues in the Church and
Hospitall of S. Iames;Suisses defeated. But the French forced them out by fire.
They fought long at the hedges and walles of the gardens, they
indured three assaults, and repulst the two first valiantly, but they
were charged with great resolution, and at the third they were forced
and all cut in pieces: yet the most miserable sold his skin dearely.

all bloody out of their bodies, and stabd them furiously into their
enemies bowels and so died together. No man was slaine but hee slew.
No man breathed forth his last gaspe without the content of being
reuenged, comforting his death in that of his enemy. The Dauphin
said that he had neuer seene men more furious, more strong,
nor more resolute: there were but sixtene saued, who comming into
the Contry were taken for runawayes which had forsaken the
Camp. And notwithstanding any thing they could alledge yet euery

heads from the danger where their companions, had been slaine, as

was in time of peace for an exercise, and in the time of warre for
necessitie and glorie, euery man returned to his affayres hauing
yeelded an account of his Armes, witnessing still, that hee carried
them not for his owne priuate good, but for the seruice of his
country. The ciuill warres troubled this order, and therefore they
said that Caesar and Pompey were held better Captaines then good
Citizens, and greater in valour then in integritie. France was

            During this Truce a marriage was made betwixt Henry the sixt
King of England,Marriage of Henry the sixth and Margaret of Aniou. and Margaret of Aniow Daughter to Rene King
of Sicile. The Earle of Suffolk came to fetch her at Nancy, the King
was there present, and the ioy was great: but as any great ioy hath

            But there was more then teares to witnesse that hee loued this

with all kindes of honor, whom she had greatly desired to see. They
came at the time of her Funerals, and finding themselues, as it were

to Sigismond Archduke of Austria.
                  Iohn Duke of Brittanie sent Ambassadors into Scotland to treat the marriage of his Sonne with Isabel daughter to the King of Scotland, at whose returne he enquired what the Princesse was? Who made report, That shee had beautie sufficient, a bodie well disposed to beare children, but shee had no ready speech. To whom he answered, That she was as he demanded, and that he held a woman learned enough, if she could make a difference betwixt her husbands doublet and shirt. Annal. of Aquitaine.
            
            It is impossible to finde truth in an enemies tongue.The iudgement of two Historians of England. Hony how
sweet soeuer it be, is sharpe and offensiue to a mouth vlcered with
passion and slander. Edward Hall, and Grafton, two writers of England,
seeing that their imposture would take no hold vpon the manners
and actions of this Princesse, haue indiscreetly written, that
she was vnpleasing to her husband.
                  Buchanan in the tenth booke of the Historie of Scotland, saith that two Historians of England, hauing as little sufficiencie as modestie, haue beene so Impudent as not finding any thing wherewith to slander this Princes haue said: Ob oris graueolentiam marito fuisse ingratam.
                But there are records yet to
be seene both in France and Scotland of the griefe which Charles
the seuenth, and the Dauphin his Sonne had for her death, and
Monstrelet speakes as of a Princesse who excelled in beautie both

of minde and bodie. She fauoured the good wits of her age, Alain
Charretier was held at that time one of the first of the Court,
and this Princes did esteeme him so rare, as shee honoured him
with a singular fauour, for passing by a Chamber whereas he slept

himselfe most curiously of his most inward seruants, making some of
them sweare whether the common brute were true, from whom hee had
learned what hee had written. That Charles loued her onely for her
gallant humor, Shee was excellent in many pleasant conceits, but
especially in her speech and incounters, which is one of the gestures
of Loue.

traine comparable to that of great Princesses, and the Duke was very
louing, and had many base children both sonnes and daughters But who
sees not that flatterie hath falsified the Annales of those times? And
that the little which they report is sufficient to assure that Charles
and Agnes knew where to meete and to haue newes one of another;
they were not troubled to write vppon the marbles of Churches
and on the Mercuries of the high waies. Pithius is on the right
hand, and Pithias on the left: Princes who thinke they may say, if it
please it is lawfull, haue sometime greater want of enterprises then

            The King, which held a peace miserable which gaue not some
rest, stole some howers in his affayres to imploy them in his loues &
gardeus. He went no farther to seek for palmes and bayes, he would
not haue any but from the hands of this Lady. Shee had a daughter:
Mont strellet saith that she was not auowed,

of Lewis the eleuenths Chronicle, writes that she was married to the
Seneshall of Normandies sonne.
            Yong Princes haue alwaies discoursers, which speake of euery

eares, and raise vp in his soule vnlawfull murmurings against
the Kings delights. They made him beleeue that Charles could
neither loue himself, nor any other, so long as he loued faire Agnes.
               
The Dauphin could not dissemble his discontent,The Dauphin enemy to fayre Agnes.

woman, for the safetie of her fortune, did all shee could to
seaze vpon the fathers loue: And that hee should not receiue any
grace but at her discretion, least that her disgrace should grow by
their accord.
            The King by the bad offices of this Lady, who incensed the Fathers
wrath against the Sonne, and sought occasions to content
his dislike, who by the iealousie which hee had conceiued, that a
sonne of thirtie yeares of Age did tread vpon his heeles, saw him
no more, but with an eye troubled with way wardnes and despight,

There are saith Michael de Montagne so many defects in age, so great weaknes and it is so subiect to contempt as the best purchase item make is the affection and loue of his owne: command & feare are no more his armes. life: For whom doe they keep this
loue and proofe of affection? Feare they that it will shorten their
power? and that God and Nature and the Lawes haue not well
prouided to maintaine it? If they haue loued them in their infancie,
when as they could not distinguish of the force and respect therof,
why doe they take from them the knowledge when as age giues
them the feeling, and commands them to yeeld vnto this loue
the tributes of the same loue, feare and obedience? Many young
Princes, dying, haue left vnto their Fathers this troublesome griefe,
nay rather this reproch, that they haue neuer let them know that
they loued them amidst these austere courses. The Dauphin, by reason
of his age and his disposition, being tractable and quick, was
carried to sodaine alterations, during the which hee onely considered
the qualitie of the first Sonne of France, and not the authoritie
of the King,Although the father stray in many things frō that which he ought, yet the sones ought rather to think of that which hee is bound to doe rather then of that the father hath not done. nor the reuerence of the Father. R. Gaguin,

writes, that during these impatiencies, he stroke fayre Agnes
at Chinon.
            They adde to these discontents an other occasion which made
him leaue the Court. Anthony de Chabanes Earle of Dammartin,
a man valiant, but not able to endure, was in the greatest fauour
in Court, and these fauours had taken such deepe rootesThe fauour of Courtiers must take deepe rooting before it be setled. This seed of a Princes fauour lies long before it springs. It seemes often to flourish when it hath no roof, so as the first paffe of choller or disgrace ouer throwes it. as they
were able to resist the most violent stormes of Enuie: Vertue and
good fortune had alwaies held the helme and sailes of his nauigation.
The troupes which he led had been well beaten vpon the
fronter of Bourgundy. The Dauphin said vnto him by way of iest,
yet without bitternes, (for he knew that this spirit would be easily
moued)Euery iest that containes truth in it offends, although it he spoken by a superiour. The more mens cour ages are raised vp, the lesse they endure, and the longer they remember it.

He was very inward with him, and of that credit, as meaning
to be reuenged of any one that had offended him,Reuenge against the Seneshall of Normandy. he imparted
his deseine vnto him and gaue him mony to execute it.The Chronicle Martinienne speakes plainely of this proceeding. A rack which euery Prince should shun if hee will not make shipwrack of his reputation. To cause an enemy to be slaine is an act of feare and not of brauery. It is a
proud abstinency to refuse his prince, but a great misery when it is
for the recompence of a seruice which subiects the consience vnder
the tyranie of repentance and remorse. Iames of Chabannes
Lord Steward of France blamed his brother for this match making,

not how to shed blood neither for delight nor reuenge, but onely
for necessity,Tyrants saith Seneca shed blood for pleasure, and Kings for necessity. reprehended him bitterly. The Dauphin to excuse
himselfe accused the Earle of Dammartin saying, that it was by
his counsell. The Earle, desuring rather to wrong his fortune then
his honour, did not accord with the Dauphin, but tolde the King
that therein he had but giuen eare and obayed. The Dauphin
seeing himselfe discouered and contradicted, saide vnto the Earle,
reseruing my duty to the King my Lord, you haue lyed. The reproch
of a lye is the most sensible offence that may be done by words, but
it is neither weaknes nor basenes to endure it of his prince, it were
indiscretion to be moued therewith. Yet the Earle of Dammartin
sought to reuēge those words with this speach. Reseruing the respect
I owe vnto the King, if you were not the Kings sonne, I would make
answer with my person against yours,The Dauphin leaues the Court. but if there be any gentleman of
your howse that will charge me with this matter, I will make him say
the contrary. The King iudging by their countenances the truth of
their intentions, commanded the Dauphin to absent himselfe for

promises of reuenge. He did neuer loue that which he had hated,

            Whether the Kinges iealousie, or the dislike of faire Agnes, the
wordes of the Earle of Dammartin, or spies, or flatterers, had
caused the absence of Lewis, the father bare it with much greefe
and repented himselfe that he had no more regarded his owne age

face but fraught with waiwardnes, not opened his heart but full of
wrath and disdaine.The youth of Primers hath their lawes and priuiledges. The fathers seuerity should not seeke to breake them quite, but to bend them gently. He that had nothing refused to his owne youth, should not deny all thinges to his sonnes.

knew how to order his desires to his power, and that he had no other, but
to his maiesties contentment. The Dauphin had married his daughter,
and yet the Kings respect was greater with the Duke then the
consideration of this alliance.
            The King sends to the Dauphin to haue him come, and the Dauphin
promiseth at a certaine time, but the terme being come, the
effects of his promise are excuses and delayes. The King sends the
Earle of Damartin to seaze on his person, and the Lord Chastillon

to comand in the Prouince. The dilligence in the execution of this
comandement put the Dauphin in danger to be taken at Oranges,
but hauing made shew to go a hunting he deceiued the ambush
which the Earle had laid for him,The Dauphin did rely in two noble men who did counsell & conduct him. Lewis of Chalons; and Iohn de Lestore a bastard of the house of Armagnac. He was at Oranges when hee was aduertised of the Earle of Dammatius comming. and escaping their snares he
tooke another way, and with sixe or seauen gentlemen recouered
St. Claud. If he had fallen into his fathers collor, hee would haue
vsed him with more rigour then he thought. But he went nor without
making it knowne that hee would one day make the Earle of
Dammartin repent it.The offence which Princes receiue are deeply ingrauen in their memories in brasse, gratia onori vltio in quaestu habetur. The Dauphin had a feeling of that which the Earle of Dammartia did him, in executing his fathers comandements and was reuenged so soone as hee came to the Crowne. And that it was not the respect of his father
made him flye from his fathers wrath, but the very weaknes of
the Earle of Dammartin, saying, that if he had had halfe his forces
hee would haue met him.

haue imployed to serue the King and the Realme, or to make new
Empires tributary to France. Hee should not haue beene in any

               Lewis auoiding one danger fell into another, and as Caesar found
himselfe among Pirats thinking to flye from Scilla,He trusts his enemy. so he saw himselfe
at the discretion of the Marshall of Bourgondy, after that he
had escapedthe ambush of the Earle of Dammartin, who loued him
not, and had charged his troupes when as they aduanced vpon the
marches of Bourgundy, whereof the Duke was so iealous as hee
could not endure that the French should approch them, knowing

not feared by strangers is not well obeyed by subiects.

they conduct him with safety vnto Brussels.

from Deuenter, hee sent the Earle of Estampes vnto Louuaine to
meet him, and soone after the Earle of Charalois to accompanie

and the Lady of Rauestain receiued him at Bruxelles. A day or
two after the Duke arriues, and the Dauphin gets downe the

held this honour greater then hee should receiue of a Sonne of
France, the presumptiue heyre of the first crowne of the world.
And hee knew well that they that were issued from thence did not
conceiue any thing greater then themselues, and did not humble
themselues to other Princes but by eurtesie.

Duke lodged him at Gueneppe, neere to Bruxells, and sent his Ambassador
to the King to aduertise him thereof, and to beseech him
to pardon Lewis, The King made no other answere, but that the
Duke should haue a care not to feede the Foxe which would deuoure his
hens. Many thought that the Father and Sonne had intelligence
one with another, and that Charles was glad that Lewis should discouer
the desseignes, and obserue the actions of the Duke of Bourgundy
and his sonnes. Whatsoeuer it were, they kept him carefully,

            The King beleeuing that if he were prest by necessitie in a forraine
country,He is disposest of his reuenues in Dauphiny? hee would returne the sooner to his fathers house,
went into Dauphiny to seaze vpon the Townes and meanes wherewith

would bring him backe in furie, as he had gone away in choller,
and that he would fortifie himselfe in some place: He assured himselfe

vpon all the passages and frontiers: he did prohibite the gouernors

Father, neither did he accord well with Lewis: He had been much
gouerned by them of the house of Croüi, the which was one of
the most apparant in the country, as drawing their extraction
from the crowne of Hungarie. Lewis a great Prince to insinuate,
did not cease till hee had wonne, and drawne them to his affections.
The Earle of Charrolois found it, and aduertised the
Duke his Father, who would not beleeue it, and if hee did, yet
hee dissembled the beliefe, applying himselfe to the humors of
this Prince, for we must not feede a Lyon, or we must please
himIt is indiscretion to bandy against a power which we haue supported and raised: Aristophanes brings in Pericles ghost aduising the Athenians not to feed the Lyon or to please him..
            The Earle of Charrolois from that time frowned at them of
Croüi, and there grew so great an Antipathie of wils in the minds
of these two Princes, as all the remainder of their liues they were
but fained friends. They of Croüi made an altar of refuge of the
Dauphins fauour, against the Earle of Charalois, and thought
that, notwithstanding that they were great, both in Alliances and

indignation which hee durst not euaporate against Lewis who fauoured

in the absence of the Lord of Auchy the first, and of the Lord
of Formelles the second Chamberlaine. The Earle of Charrolois

That which was betwixt Chimay of Emeries, who should haue the first place in the absence of the L. of Auchy, first Chamberlaine to the Duke, was so affected as the father was for the one & the son for the other.. The Duke
seeing the danger which might grow by this adoration of the sunne
rising, made it knowne that he was both master and father, commanding
his Sonne to bring him the Rowle, and in his presence
cast it into the fire, and then willed him to goe forth. Monstrelet
saith, that the Duke commanded the Earle of Charolois to cause
Croui to martch in his ranke. I will not, answered the Earle, they of

Croui shall neuer gouerne as they haue done, and that the Father (being
offended at an answer so bold and of so little respect) he would haue

lost himselfe in a wood and lay all night in a Collyars cabbin, with
hunger in his belly, and choller in his head. He came the next day
to Seuenbergh, a little towne of Brabant, whereas he found one of
his huntsmen, who conducted him to Guinneppe, where as the
Dauphin (the cause of all this trouble) besought him to pardon
the Earle of Charrolois. The Duke would haue held the refusall
of so iust a request cruell, being made, by, and for a person so neere
vnto him,As it is vnpleasing to intreat a stranger, so is it a very sensible discipleasure to bee refused of his owne., for he could not but loue his onely Sonne, in despight
of his youthfull & wayward affections. He required no other satisfaction,
but that hee should dismisse two seruants William Bithe and
Guiot of Vsie, who retired themselues into France.

and found him on the way to Bruzells conducted by a
Pesant.The Dauphins wandring was in the night abeue eight leagues from Brussels. The Duke caused him to bee sought for with torches: the next day hee gaue a crowne to the Pesant which had conducted him..
            The Duke was exceeding glad to see him returne, for he knew
that he should be alwaies bound to yeeld an account of so precious

Tac. saith, Populum per tot annos moliter habitum non audebit ad durio

               . The Duke would not leaue a doubtfull
peace with his subiects, he desired to be satisfied of the Kings intention,
saying, that if they forced him to raise an armie, they
should bury him in his armes, that he had no will vnto it vnlesse he
were forced, that the Trumper should make no noise, if violence
were not offered, and that this Eccho should remaine quiet in the
ease of solitarines, but if they moued him hee would not be silent
vntill that they who had caused him to speake did first hold their
peace.
            These practises past away, and the King was glad that they
raised no stormes, not holding it reasonable to resolue to warre
more by the occasion which hee had, then by the inconueniences
which he did foreseeAll occasion to make warre should not be rashly nor ambitiously sought for, what shew of profit soeuer they had. It is better to haue a care to keepe subiects in peace, is people townes, and to increase the commerce, so discipline souldiers and together tre

but with cares, which seemes to be inseparable accidents of the life
of great men, and the excesse of those pleasures which Nature had
made short, for that they are pernicious, hee suffered himselfe to
be carried away with melancholly and waywardnes, two rockes
against which the vessell suffered shipwracke, Hee grew wayward
after the condemnation of Iohn Duke of Alençon to lose his head
the tenth of October 1458. After which, melancholly and heauines
had seazed on him, hee changed the troubles of his life into a
perpetuall prison at Loches, and gaue his goods to his wife and
children

            The Dauphin being wel aduertised of al that passed at Court, grieued
at the misfortunes of his godfather whom he loued. The desire
to see a change did much disquiet him. Claude of Seyssel Bishop
of Marceilles vnder the raigne of Lewis the twelfth saith, that the

Dauphin and they that followed him, desired nothing more then
his Fathers death: some enquired by Astrologie, some by Negromancie.
He had many politique inuentions to augment his Fathers
cares and caused his suspition to turne into fearesGreat courage should not easily receiue suspitions, and Seneca saith that it is the act of a timerous soule to turne suspition into feare.. He knew
that the Earle of Dammartin was as it were the Kings King, and
he found meanes to bring him into iealousie with the King, whose
braine beeing weake and very moist, did easily receiue such impressions
In matters of state Princes enter easily into icalousies of their most trusty seruants, and suspition is a bone which age of it selfe doth willingly gnaw vpon., He wrote a letter vnto a Lady whom the King loued
and sent it vnto her by a Franciscane Fryer which hee wittingly deliuered
to the Earle of Mayne, enemie to Dammartin, who shewed
it to the King
                  The chiefe points of this letter reported by the Chronicle Marti

I pray you tell him that hee serue mee still wel, as he hath alwaies done, I will thinke of those matters whereof hee did write vnto me, and hee shall very shortly receiue newes from me.: It was full of termes of so great trust in the Earle
of Dammartin, as the King not considering from whom it came,
nor by whom it was presented, commanded the Earle of Dammartin
to retire himselfe, then being informed by the Dauphins secretaries
that this Prince had no greater enemie, & that he had not
written vnto him, he did easily beleeue that it was an act of his bad
Sonne who had so much troubled him, as it was the ordinary argument
of his complaints. Some few daies before his death hee
recalled him: apprehension bred no lesse amazement in him, then his
life gaue him affliction.
            The aduise which a Captaine gaue him that hee could not liue
long,K. Charles resolues to dye of hunger. and that there was a conspiracie plotted against his life, did
so distemper and torment him, as he could not liue without feare
and tremblingThere is no tormēt so much to bee feared as feare, & what auailes it to feare that which is ineuitable? to feare death is to call it, for the feare of death is a perpetuall death.. And imagining that they ment to poyson him,
he depriued himselfe of eating, and brought himselfe to so great a
weakenes, as when they would haue caused him to take any thing
to restore him, the passages were so shrunke, as that which hee
would haue done willingly happened vnto him by force and against
his will, and it may be said that he died of hungerThe Earle of Dammartin who was retired to his house at St. Forgeau came to see the King the day before his death, perswading him to take something, who told him that he would take a Cullis from his hand, if he saw it made, the which hee presented vnto him, but he could not swallow any thing, the conduits were so stopt., the 21.

            Dying he recommended to the Earle of Dammartin his yonger
Sonne, whom he called the little Lord, to whom hee desired to
leaue the Crowne, knowing the spirit of Lewis to be terrible & an
implacable enemie to his best seruants. God would not suffer him
to trouble the Order of Nature, to reuenge his priuate affections,
nor to runne the fortune of Alphonso
               
                  Alphonso beleeuing by the rules of his Astrologie that the youger of his sonnes would be the more capable to raigne, named him his successor, whercat the elder was soineensed as be caused the Father to dye in prison, and slew his Brother. King of Castill, who hauing
preferred the yonger before the elder, forced him to bee a parricide
and a fratricide.

such strange and terrible confusion as no man could say that Rome

and past at the councell of Basill, the pragmaticke sanctionThe orders which the councell of Basill made for the gouernment & discipline of the Church were not generally receiued, Germany and Italy would none of them. King Charles caused as assembly to be made at Burges, by the aduise whereof they were obserued and published in Parliament the seuenth of Iuly 1438 vnder the name of the Pragmatick Sanction..
            With the like zeale as he laboured for the peace of the Church,
he desired to reuenge the iniurie which it had receiued in Asia
and Europe by the armes of Amurath & Mahomet. Pope Nicholas,
and Pius the second, exhorted this Prince, as Elezeus did Ioas, to
shoote his arrowes against the East, but he was so troubled for his
iust defence against his neighbours, as he had no meanes to think
theron.Among the obseruations which they giue for the leuies of Souldiers, they haue respect to the ayre and the place; hot countries produce men of more vnderstanding then courage, and could doe the contrary. A good rule for them that haue diuers prouinces to choose, but to make it generall they must take them where they finde them. They also giue vnto this Prince the honor to haue set an
order for his troupes, for seeing that the number of his souldiers
were so diminished, as his could not equall those of his enemies,
hee made leuies throughout all his villages, taking one labouring
man out of threescore, who were bound to arme and pay him, and
he was freed from taxes. Necessitie, in whose schoole hee had learned
great experience, dispenst with him for the obseruations which
are made in the choice of souldiers. These were called Franke
Archers, who being well led did great seruices, being able to indure
all paine, as beeing bred vp in discommodities and wants,
without cunning or malice. They beganne their profession at the

               A Death which brings Scepters & Crownes,1461
doth not alwaies meete with sorrow and
teares. When there is a question of the
succession of the Realme,An heyres teares are sone dried vppe. a desire to raigne
doth presently dry vp the teares which the
law of Nature drawes from the eyesThere is no water whose spring is sooner dryed vp, then that which flowes from a profitable mourning.. Lewis
longed too much to be at home, to be
grieued when as they brought him newes
that Charles the seuenth had quit him the
lodging. Hee had already spent two third parts of his age in
obeying, hee held the rest very short to command and to end at;
in great enterprises worthy of his qualitieLife is very short for great entrriprises; and inconstancie makes it much shorter.. Hee entertained the
Iuie of his hopes in the ruines of this old building: he did not
hope for any light but by the ecclipse of this Sunne, and his
vowes were no let, that his Father was not already among the
GodThe Romans held their Fathers dead in the number of the Gods, and their Images were reuerenced as persons deysied. Wherfore among the predictions which Antonin had of his adoption and successim to the Empire, they note that, In somrio saepe monitus suit penatibus suis Adriani simulacrum inserere. Capitol. Hee was often admonished in his sleepe that hee should place Adrians Image among his boushould Gods..
            And what can a Kings eldest Son desire but to raigne? euery obiect
lesse thē a crown is vnworthy of his birth,Lewis comes into France. but the wishes are vnnaturall
& monstrous vpon vniust effects. To desire for a crownes cause
the death of him of whom he holds his life, is ingratitude & impiety.
The same day that Charles dyed, Lewis was aduertised of his deathThey that haue written that these newes were sent by Charles Duke of Aniou, Father in lawe to Charles the seuenth, are mistaken, both in the name and matter, for Lewis Duke of Anion liued since the yeare 1417..
He went presently to horse to goe into France, fearing least Charles
his brother should make his profit of his absence. The Duke of
Bourgundy and the Earle of Chartolis accompany him with
foure thousand horse, chosen out of the flower of all the forces
of their Estates and the Princes their friends.He makes his entry into Rheims. Hee entred into
Rheims the fourteeene of August,The King arriued at Rheims the 14. August, and caused himself to be annointed the next day. A remarkable diligence. They cannot goe too speedily to so great a Feast. The Duke of Bourgundy being followed by the Earl of Charolois, the Earle of Neuers, the Earle of Estampes, the Duke of Cleues, the Earle of St. Pol, and many other Noblemen, went out of Rheimes to the Abbcy of Saint Thierry to meet the King. being attired in white and crimsin
damask, vpon a white courser caparonessed with the armes of
France. The next day he was anoynted and crowned. The peeres
of the Church were there in person. The Duke of Burgundy Deane
of the peeres. The Duke of Burbon held the place of the Duke of

Normandy. The Earle of Angolesme for the Duke of Guienne.
The Earle of Eu for the Earle of Tholousa. The Earle of Neuers
for the Earle of Flaunders, and the Earle of Vandosme for the Earle
of Champagne.The King is anoin

                  ed and Crowned.
            
            The ceremony of his coronation was beautified with an other
which they found very new and strange.The King is anointed and Crowned. The King drawing his
sword presented it to the Duke of Bourgundy and intreates him to
make him Knight. He gaue this honour of Knight-hood to an hundred
and seauenteene Gentlemen, the first were the Lord of Beauieu,
Iames of Burbon, the Earle of Geneua, the Earle of Pontieu, the
Earle of Witembergh, Iohn of Luxembergh, and to the Marques of
Saluces Sonne. From the Coronation they went to the Royall
feast, whereas the twelue peeres were set on either side the King.
At the end the Duke of Bourgundy kneeled downe, intreating the
King to forget the iniuries of such as had offended him during his
Fathers raigne.
                  This request is reported by Monstrelet in these termes. When the tables were taken away, the noble duke of Burgundy, vsing his accustomed gentlenes, in the nobillity of his courage, kneeled downe before the King, and intreated him for the honor, passion and death of our Sauior, that he would pardon all those which he held suspect to haue set discord betwixt his father and him, which request he granted reseruing seauen persons He answered there are seauen which I cannot pardon.
Reuenge had mounted with him to the Royall throne, he had
not trod it vnder foote, he carryed it in his head, it was in his mind,
like vnto those starres that were fixed about the pole. Hee findes it
not so sweet to recompence the good as to reuenge the bad. The
King cannot forget the iniuries which they had done vnto the
Dauphin.A royalty should make mē forget forepassed iniuries. The Emperour Adrian being come to the Empire said vnto his enemy which was before him. Euasisti, thou hast escaped. Quos in vita priuata

            Two daies after the ceremony of the Coronation the Duke did
him homage for his countries which held of the crowne of France,
and offered him others which he held in Souerainty.The Duke of Burgundy was receiued to fealty and homage by King Lewis the eleuenth and to be Peere and Deane of the Peeres of France, by reason of the D

                  ie of Burgundy the 17. of August. 1461. From Rheims
the King went to Meaux, then to Saint Dennys, and made his
entry into Paris, where they did number twelue thousand horse
which followed him.
            All the pompe and magnifficence which was made at this entry
did represent aswell the simplicity and ignorance of those times, as
the greatnesse and State of Paris. Good witts in such occasions
do not represent all things so plainely to the eye, as there doth not
remaine some thing where-with to content curiosity, by the paine
it hath to seeke, and the pleasure to finde and to deuine at the intelligence
of their inuentions. Brokers were then more necessary
then paynters, for they did only set persons of diuers ages and sexes
for all kinds of histories. A Virgin was sufficient to represent the
Citty of Paris, as we finde not any more in bookes, nor in auncient
medalls for Rome, nor Athens; and there were fiue to signifie Paris,
euery one carrying a letter of it name. They were conducted on
horsebacke by a Herald, towards Saint Ladros Church, and there
presented vnto the King. The Cronicle saith, that they had all personages
fitted to the signification of fiue letters making Paris, and that all
spake vnto the King as they were appointed.
            
            The Frontispice of S. Denis gate was beautified with a great ship

in the which were the three Estates in three Persons which made
the Prosopopeia,Ridiculous representations. and Iustce sate in the prow who spake vnto the
King. On the toppe of the Mast there was a Lilly, out of the which
came a King conducted by two Angells. At the fountaine du Ponceau,
they gaue wine and Ippocras to them that past.The Chronicle vseth thee wordes in this place. A little within the Towne at Fo

And to refresh such as entred into the said Towne there were diuers pipes in the said Fountain casting mike, wine and lippocras, wherof euery man dranke that would: And beneath the said Fountain right against the Trinity there was a passion by men without speech, Christ being hanged on the Crosse and the two theeues on the right and left hand. There were
also three Virgins like Mermaides all naked, and at the Trinity was
the passion of Iesus Christ represented by a liuing man, being tyed
vnto a Crosse betwixt two theeues. At S. Innocents Fountaine
there was a Hinde put forth, beeing followed by a great cry of
Hounds and Huntsmen. At the Burchery was the Bastille of Diepe,
as the most glorious trophee of this Princes youth. Passing ouer
the Changers Bridge, which was couered ouer head, they let flye
two hundred dozen of small Birdes.
            The King went to pray in our Ladies Church, he supt and lodged
in the Pallace, and the next day he went to the Tournelles in
St. Anthonies street, where hee made a new world, changing his
chiefe Officers, The Duke of Bourgondy and the Earle of Charolois
made a great part of the pompe, they and their traines being
so ritchly appointed, as there were not any more stately. The King
made shew of great loue both to the father and sonne, but there
was so great a diuersity of manners and humors betwixt Lewis and
Charles, as this harmony lasted not long.En

            The Pompe and magnificence of this publike ioy being ended
the Duke of Bourgondy and the Earle of Charolois tooke their
leaues of the king to returne. The Duke went into Flanders and the
Earle of Charolois to Diion,Death of Mary of Aniou Queene of France. and then to St. Claude, the King
to Ambois to see the Queene his mother, whose dowry he assigned
vppon the County to Xaintonge and the Towne of Rochell: shee
did not long inioy this assignation, passing from this life vnto a
better. Her death aflicted them, who knowing that this King did
all of his owne head, and that he had no other Law then his will,
desired her a longer life, for her presence had been a causey to stop
these torrents.The great name of mother well bred and of vnderstanding is a great restraint vnto a Prince: Tacitus saith that after that Nero had lost his mother he fell to all dissolutions and excesse. Qua

It falls out ill with a Prince who sees nothing betwixt
God and himselfe whereof the respect should restraine him,
and be a bridle vnto him. She had endured much before her death.

The Chronicle of Lewis the eleuenth commends her patience vnder
her husbands raigne and humors, but she could not dissemble
the discontent which she receiued at the pleasure of her Augustus
               They demanded of Liuia, Augustus wife, how shee had done to win and enioy Augustus. To whom she answered, in doing willingly whatsoeuer pleased him, & dissembling the plesures which he tooke in secret Dion.
               
As a good constitution of the body doth easily endure both heat
and cold, so the force and vigour of the mind doth without any
great paine resist these crosses and discontents, which are thornes
amidst the roses of marriage. This passion seazing vppon a weake
spirit and without defence, transports it to dislikes and extreame
hatred.
            About the end of the yeare he went to Tours, the Earle of Charolois
after his returne from pilgrimage came thither to him;
where after they had spent some daies in the pleasure of hunting,
he had the Commission of Lieftenant Generall in Normandy with
36000. Crownes for his entertainement. This guift was without
asking. The benefits of Princes are sweeter offred then granted. He
had but one third part paid, which defect made him to faile in his
affection, and transported him to other thoughts.Men are more discontented to see themselues frustrated of thinges promised then of those which are but hoped for. In the one there is but mis

Rouen to take possession of his gouernment, It was at Tours that
he began to frame his intelligences with the Duke of Brittanny.
These two Princes were yong, both discontented, and they which
know one another, salute a farre off. The Earle of Charolois did
conferre secretly with Romille Vicechancellor and Ambassador
of Brittany, to whom he gaue the seale of alliance wherewith hee

was not any but Pope Pius 2

how France hath lost that which she had preserued so deerely, we
must take the discourse somwhat higher. The Pope had called an

make warre against the Turke, land to preuent the great deseignes
which hee had against Christendome. King Charles the seauenth
sent his Ambassadors thither, Prelates, Knightes, and Doctors, to
let them vnderstand his intentions for the generall good of the
Church. They made a priuate request vnto the Pope, that if hee
would be pleased to giue the inuestiture of the Realmes of Naples
and Sicile to King Rene, who had beene wrongfully dispossest against
the hereditary rightes of the house of Aniou, the which the
King desired the more earnestly, for that besides the affection of
blood which bound him to loue his kinsman and brother in Law,
he saw that the generall cause of Christendome would bee much
fortefied against the common enemy, for the Duke of Calabria
(the sonne of Renne) entring into the inheritance of his predecessors
propounded to aduance his armes, and to expell the Ottomans
out of the Empire of Constantinople, when as they thought that

the Christian Religion was at her period, and could go no farther.

                  Albunasat said that the Christian Relligion should last vnto the yeare, 1460. Abraham the Iewe said that in the yeare, 1464. the Iewish religion should bee in her glory & liberity, when as it was most afflicted. An enterprise whereof they had great hope, as well for the generosity
of this Princes courage, as for that he was in an age fit and
capable of such actions whereby the holy Sea might reape great
profit, the possessions depending of his patrimony being by this
meanesrestored vnto him.
            The Pope vpon this proposition
                  This Act was imparted vnto mee by Gaspar Dauvet Siegneur of Marets Stuard of the kings house. The chiefe clauses are reported here in the margent Post quā plurimade laudibus Francorum. S. D. N. praeclare dixerat, adiecit etiam loqui in fanorem partis aduersae antedicti. D.

in commendation of the French,The Popes affection to the house of Arragon hee added many things touching
bastards, fauoring couertly those which vsurped the rights of the
house of Aniou, and then falling vpon the decrees of the councile
of Basill and of the Pragimatike sanction, he said, that it was a spot
which did blemish the beauty of the face of France, and vnder
pretext whereof the Authority of the Apostolik Sea was disgrac'd,
the forces of Christian Relligion were weakened, the vnity and liberty
of the Church violated and troden downe, and therefore hee
was forced to speake,Popes threat against France. least his silence should bee reputed a conniuence
or carelesnesse, and that the wound which might bee cured
grew not incurable, and hee should be forced to abstaine from all
intelligence and communication with the French, alledging this
passage of Scripture.
                  Alledging, that it is written in the old law: Surper omnem animā quae mortua est non ingredietur Pontifex. The high Priest shall not see a dead soule,
and shall not bee whereas there is sinne, or a perseuerance or obstinacy
in sinne.
            At the same time the Pope made a Bull by the which he declared
all appellations to the Councile an execrable abuse, and neuer
before heard of,His Bull against appellations to a councell.

                to frame an appellation to a Concile which
was not yet assembled, neither knew they when it would bee, and
that by this abuse the excesse remained vnpunished, rebellion against
the first Sea was supported and all Ecclesiasticall discipline
in confusion, wherefore by the aduice of the Cardinalls and Prelates,
which were then at Mantoua, he did forbid such appellations,
as erronius, detestable and pestilent, and charged them with censures
which receiued the Acts, or did fauour them.
            The Kings Ambassadors tooke these words for cracks of thunder
and infalliable threats of excommunication, and hauing reported
them vnto King Charles the seauenth, his councell did beleeue
that he had resolued to curse both the King and his realme, and all
those that should cause the decrees of the Councile of Basill to bee
obserued, wherefore it was concluded that Iohn Dauvet his Attorney
generall in the Court of Parlament, should protest against his
threats, to auoyde the scandales which the Church and Christendome
might receiue, reseruing in all things a respect vnto the holy
Sea, and the obedience which is due vnto the Pope, conformable
to the holy decrees.

should confirme this peace and good vnion, causing those lets to cease

generall consent, and to consider that such lets came onely from those that

For although that vnder this pretext they had leuied great summes of
mony after diuers manners;Diuersae pecuniarum summae modis varus huins rei pretexta hacternus petitae et collatae suat yet Christendome had receyued no ease.
Besides the tenne years in the which the Council of Constans had or dained
that they should hould a councell were expired.
            That the King propounded to submit him-selfe to all that should bee
determined and or dayned by the councell, to the end that so good an order
might be setled in the Church, as God might bee better serued and christian

it was necessary to chuse a place of easie accesse for all that would come.

the citty of Rome was of hard accesse, in a manner, for all the nations of
christendome,The Pope a party. and many times subiect to great plagues, besides that, the
chiefe question being touching the contradiction which was made to the
Cannons of councells, their opinions could not be free; and the King was
well aduertised of the league which was made against Rene King of Siciie

and his children, whreof they made the Pope the head.
            That when as a place of liberty and safety should be chosen in some other
Prouince, the Pope, if hee thought good, might transport himselfe
thither, with lesse pain then he should receiue if he continued his designe
to go in person into the East for the good of Christendome, or elce hee
might send his Legates as his predecessors had formerly done. That the
last Counsells hauing been held in the townes of Italy and Germany,
Many generall Councels haue beene held in France and we find in the History of the Church the Councell of Lyon 2. Orleans 4. & 5. Tours, Paris, Auuergne.
                reason would that now it should be held in France, as Pope Nicholas
the fift had promised, and therefore the King offered to prouide
amply for all that should be necessary.
            That his Maiesty could not imagine that the Pope by his new
Bull against appellations to the Councill had any thought to interdict
the vse in such sort, as in no case, no not when there was question
to maintaine the Orthodoxall faith, or for the extirpation of
Schisme, or the reformation of the vniuersall Church, in the
head and members, for the wrongs which Popes might doe vnto
Princes and there estates, it might not bee lawfull to flie vnto this

not comprehend matters which required a more speciall and
perticular expression, and principally those which did regard
the offences of Religion and the vnity of the Church, and which
fauoured Scismes and troubled the vniuersall estate of the
Church.
            Wherefore if the Pope attempted any thing against the obseruation of
the holy decrees of the pragmatick Sanction, the King ment to flye to a
Councill,Protestation of the King to fly vnto a Councel.

of all censures, according to the forme of the Canonicall Sanctions,
the which in many cases declared the sentences and censures of Iudges
and Pastors void, yet submitting themselues to the iudgement of the vniuersall
Church.
            That if the Pope should refuse, and would deferre the calling of the
Councill, the King declared that he would exhort all Christian Princes,
to labour iointly for this Conuocation, yet hoping that the Pope hauing
duly considered of this iust and necessary instance, would not put him to
that paine.

the instrument of these Decrees, he had beene present at the resolutions,
hee had written them, and vndertaken the defence of the
Councell of Basill, against that of Eugenius. They did alwaies obiect
vnto his Nuncios that it was a shame to gainesay himselfe, to
ouerthrow the worke of his owne hands, and that Dignities had
changed the Maximes of conscience. Wherefore in the end of
Aprill 1463. he made a declaration containing a great repentance
of that which hee had done in the Councell of Basill against the
Pope

himselfe by his youth, comming but newly from the Schooles, the
force of the perswasions of so many great prelates whom hee saw
banded against Eugenius, the example which had seduced him, and
ignorance which should excuse him, thinking not to erre after so
many great Doctors, and especially of the Schoole of Paris, whose
reputation was then very famous, and of the vniuersities of Germany

that he had broken and hindered the course of the counsell which

betwixt a priuate man and the great Vicar of Iesus Christ, betwixt

the errors of a youth without experience and the thoughts of an
age touched with the Spirit of God: Then hauing made a great
repentance of his opinions, he published his beliefe of the Popes,

in vaine to keepe the body in health if the head bee sicke, it did
somewhat restraine the Popes authoritie, binding him to hold a

should be made, yea that which the councell of Basill had made

It did forbid expectatiue graces, and citations to the Court

forbidding the payments of vacances and Anuates, and reseruing
onely the iust fees for expedition of Buls. Pope Eugenius
considering the consequence of this Decree, sent his Nuncios to

him not to suffer such an abuse any longer, then declaring such

not suffering them to receiue the Nephewes of Popes, or of Cardinals

did also ordaine due recompences for learning and merit. And that
there should be Prebends in Cathedrall and Metropolitane churches

They were freed for the priuation of the fruits of their
benefices during three monthes. Pope Pius the second was not
to be blamed if he did so earnestly presse this reuocation, and his
Ministers did often solicite the King, filling his conscience with
feare of excommunication, and telling him continually that there
was neither Iustice, necessitie, nor profit, that could giue the title
of a lawe to that which was ordained without authoritie, and
that it was a sinne to subiect his subiects thereunto. The Cardinall

with the King, interposed great difficulties, to make the Pope
know that the effect of his intensions depended of him. But as
soone as he had promised to make him a Cardinall, hee did fit his
head to that hat.

with the losse of his estate, and to make him repent it. He who
desired that all things should faile him rather then to faile of his

            The Vniuersitie of Paris made her Remonstrances vnto the king
not to suffer the decrees, conformable to the purest constitutions
of the Church for discipline, pollicie, and libertie, to be broken.
In this great agitation of minde, the Popes Ministers promised
the king that the reuocation of the Pragmatick Sanction
should bee made without preiudice of the ancient liberties of the
French Church, and that the Pope would send a Legate into
France, to conferre the prouisions of Benefices, so as the French
should not be bound to send money to Rome.
            The king vpon this assurance consented to the abbrogation.Pragmatick Sanction abolished & dragged through the streets of Rome. The
Cardinall of Alby was sent to Rome with charge to tell the Pope, that the King submitted all the busines of the Church, and the goods
thereof to the Holy Father, to vse in this Realme, prout vellet, as he
pleased, without any regard of the liberties of the French Church. But
being satisfied, he had no care to giue the king that contentment
which hee promised and suffered the patents to bee shamefully
drawne through the streetes of Rome: Behold how choller spares
not euen insensible things. They shaddowed this choller with a
reason that the Pragmatick Sanction was bred in a time of Schisme
and Sedition. The courts of Parliament of France, which haue
the rights of the church as it were in protection, did not allow of
this reuocation, so as it was neuer obserued, and the Clergie did
not obserue the Popes command vpon this subiect

not able to find any, hee had the Bastil for his prison, from whence

his Vncle,

Franciscans, to moue the people to looke vnto the beginning of

If thou didst know Gidarne what libertie were thou wouldest counsell vs to defend it, not with the launce and target onely, but with our teeth and nayles., aduising them that this King entered into the
Realme, as into a countrey of Conquest: that he held all that pleased
him to be lawfull: That he forced great men not to obey but
to serue: The people not to bee gouerned but tiranized, and to
prepare themselues to liue in such sort as they might say they had

a crowne was worth, and how many peeces would make one: They
that haue past by the indiscretions of necessitie, proceed very discreetely
in their expences. If all the time that hee had beene banished

he no great abundance superfluous.

which were in England and Arragon. The King was glad to
entertaine the warre farre from him, and to assist the house of Lancaster
in England, and the house of Arragon in Spaine, whiles that
the clouds and windes prepared to draw the storme vpon his owne
head. England for the diuision of the houses of Yorke & Lancaster,

that they did not cry quittance with him, seeing there is no surer

and Richard Neuill Earle of Warwick his brother, who had wisdome
and courrage, rare parties for a great desseigne, and therewith
such great credit among the people, as it was thought that
not any one in England durst doe that which these would vndertake.
The Duke of Yorke hauing cast his bell made the sound
thereof to be generally heard, hee strake such a terror into the
Court, and made the wicked so audacious, as the King (who had
neuer tasted of Domesticke troubles; his spirit beeing like vnto a
shipCourages tried in dangers are to bee commended. A ship is neuer esteemed which hath neuer felt of a storme. which had neuer sailed but in a calme) was amazed and
confounded, and not holding himselfe safe in the Citie of London,
by reason of the inconstancie of the people, and the great credit
which this faction had gotten, resolued to leaue it. The Duke
of Yorke besieged St. AlbonsThe battell of St. Albons began early in the morning and continued vntil 9. of the clock, in the yere 1556 Edmund D. of Sommerset, and Henry Earle of Northumberlād were slaine., the two armies meet,

his Sonne the gouernment of Callis. He disposed of publike charges
as he pleased, still giuing them vnto those of his faction. In
the end the king discouers the Duke of Yorkes designe. Queene
Margaret his wife, who had been aduertised thereof, lets him vnderstand
that he did temporise but vntill the partie were made to
ceaze both of the king and Realme, and among his partisans the
king was held but for a Tyrant: As if his Raigne had been by vsurpation

aduise to restraine this great authoritie which the Duke of Yorke
had within the Realme; The Duke beeing suddenly aduertised
thereof retired secretly to Wigmore in Wales, Richard Neuell to
his Castle of Midleham in the North Countie, and Richard Earle
of Warwicke to Callis, so as the cruell seditions in England grew
more violent then before, during the which the French spoiled the
coasts of Kent, and Iames king of Scotland, inuited by the same occasion,

that the ciuill discord and the bad intelligence which was betwixt
them, had opened a gate to the enemies to inuade England; that
the common danger did binde them to vnite their forces to defend
it, and that hee was contented to forget all matters past, vpon
hope of a better conduct hereafter,English cease their ciuill discords to war against the French. excusing himselfe that matters
had not alwaies gone directly, being impossible for a Prince to obserue

               .
            The Kings intention was allowed by all men; the Duke of Yorke
being loth to be the author of the ruines of the Realme, declared
that all his affections tended to his greatnes and quiet, and to take
away all occasions of doubt, He came vnto the King to London
with the chiefe of his faction. The feare of a forraine warre quenched
the ciuillThere is no such indiscretion as to hazard ones own to get another mans, and to draw forth the bloud which is needfull for the life of the bodie. It is more glorie for a Prince to maintaine himselfe them to grow great. Preseruation & safety is the essence of an estate, profit it but an accessary. Mens mindes, altered with things past, grew
milder, and all their wills were vnited in one accord for the defence
of the Realme, detesting the discord which had drawne
them into a warre which was not necessarie, nor could bee
happie, and made them a prey and triumph to their auncient
enemie.
            But as the fire of sedition is neuer so well quenched, but there remaines
some sparks in the ashes,Troubles renewed in England. which kindle again if they be a little
blowne, & that there be alwaies some which delights in troubles
(for that it is their rest,Seditions commonly are fed & supported by three sorts of men; First, the heads of factions; Secondly, they that cannot liue in safety in the time of peace; Thirdly, they which are out of the presse & find themselues free from dangers.) and in danger for that they come
not neere them, being like vnto those riuers which enter into the
sea and doe not mingle their streames, the Duke of Yorke and the
Earle of Salisburie being retired to their houses after this accord,
were presently forced to leaue them, to reuenge an affront done to
the Earle of Warwick at VVestminster, where he had been set vpon
by the kings guard, and forced to saue himselfe by the Riuer of

Thames with the hazard of his life. They said that Queene Margret

Andrew Trollop; who was come from Calleis with the Earle of
Warwick, thinking to serue the King, when as he saw their armes
turned against him, left the Earle of Warwick to follow the King,

to passe into Holland, there to attend vntill his Partisans had raised
the ruines of that party.Battaile before London whereas K. Henry was defeated. Presently after the three heads of the faction
returne into England, with an intent to vanquish or to dye, they
present themselues at the gates of London, they giue and winne a
great Battell whereas the Victors saw tenne thousand men slaine,
and as many prisoners. King Henry, who seemed to haue beene raised
vp to show the inconstancy of Fortune and the misery and vanity
of man, remained at the Victors discretion. The English remembring
that his grandfather had caused King Richard to dye in
prison, began to acknowledge the iudgements of Gods iustice, who
punisheth the Children for the offences of their fathers

speakes plainely,Duke of York declared Regent. that whatsoeuer he had done was grounded vppon
the rightes of the house of Yorke, the which belonged vnto
him: The Parlament did then consider the iustice not the fortune,
and respected the Maiesty of the King though hee were a prisoner,
intreating the King to rest satisfyed with the Regency of the Realm
and to assure the succession to his house after the death of Henry.
He accepted the declaration of the Parlament, but considering
that Queene Margaret had a great Army on foot, to set her husband
at liberty,Battell at Wakefield. he resolued to fight with her. He gaue her battell

in the courage of the Commanders there was no other
difference but that of sexe. No, no; it shall not be said that the Duke
of York, who had so often fought in France without any other trench or
defence then his owne armes, is shut vp, that he attends a woman and
doth not go forth to fight with her. He spake this and went forth with
5000. men, and met her. The Combate in the beginning was terrible
and furious.The Queen cuts off the Earle of Salisburies head. The Queene shewed her selfe among the troupes,
exhorting the Souldiers to honour & glory. Richard Duke of York

               Edward in this great prosperitie of affayres troubles not his
iudgement, but considers that the house of Lancaster was ruined
without hope of recouerie, and the Red Rose withered: That it
was impossible euer to rise againe, if it were not assisted with the
forces of France. Wherefore he desired to make his alliance with
the king, and sent the Earle of Warwicke to demand Bonna of Sauoye
the Queenes sister in marriage.
                  Edward fals in loue with a Widdow. But during this negotiation,
Loue, which may be held a kinde of furie,Loue is put in the ranke of Melancholly diseases and kindes of fury, it peruerts the iudgement, and confounds the good with the euill. for that it troubles the
iudgement, carried the affections of this Prince to the seruice of a
Ladie who would haue held her selfe much honoured to haue serued
the Queene of England, and yet she had the ambition to be so.
Fortune agreed with her beauty. Being widdow to Sir Iohn Grey,
her age bound her to follow rather the life of the Doue then of the
Turtle,The Empresse Barba, wife to Sigismond the Emperor being told after the death of her husband, that she should imitate the Turtle If I must said shee initate beasts why rather the Turtle then the Doue or the sparrow. Aeneas Sil. de dict. Sigismondi et Frederici Imper.
                for her first marriage had scarce touched the flowers of
her beauty, nor of her youth. Edward did not liue but for her, his

heart receiued no law but from her eyes, to whom he did submit
the full disposition of his fortunes. She being powerfull in the
charmes of loue let him presently vnderstand that she did not accept
of the sacrifice of the hearts of Kings, but of the Altar of honour,
that he might not hope to haue her for a Mistris, if he would
not assure her to make her his Queene.
            They that loue ardently are easie and tractable,Hee that loues refuseth not any thing. In loue there is force and pleasure, force constraines the will, and pleasure deceiues the iudgement. they spare
neither wordes nor oathes. Edward transported with this fury, forgets
the sute which he made in France, and changeth all his wills
into the obedience of this Lady, who seeing her selfe to command
ouer the Kinges heart, assures her selfe to raigne soone in his
Realme. He is not capable to refuse her any thing. The wind of
her disdaines, and the couldnes of so faire a mistris may well
quence the fire in the beginning, but being once kindled it giues
it nourishment and increase. In the end Edward promised to make
her Queene, and his promise was presently followed with the consumation
of the marriage, to the great amazement of the Nobility
of England, who thought the King was bewitcht,Beauty and grace are the mighty charmes of loue said Olimpias the mother of Alexander. Loue which growes from amorous drinckes continues not. Plutarch gueth these Epithites

a more honorable alliance. Lewis tooke it ill, and the Earle of

for that this yong Prince was valiant and coragious, and
that the successions of the Crowne of Nauarre, Foyx, Berne, Bygorre,

Blanch, Infanta of Nauarre, presumptiue heire of the Realme
of Nauarre, and widdow to Martin King of Sicilie, and it was agreed
by a treaty of marriage, that in case she should die before her
husband, hee should raigne the rest of his life in Nauarre after
king Charles the third his father in law.

Crowne. Behold all naturall affection is altered betwixt the Father

and sonne in law to the king of Nauarre, disposed the two
Princes to referre themselues to the iudgement of the French

the French, king was, an honor pleasing to the humor of Lewis who

of the controuersie betwixt them, and of the causes which had moued
the Cattellans to reuolt, did iudge in such sort as to reconcile
the parties, it was necessarie they should meete and speake together
vpon the frontier. The enterview was at Endaia, whereas the sentence
giuen at Bayona was read by Aluaro Gomes. The Cattellans
were not content with this Iudgement, saying, that as the king of
Castille had abandoned them, so his Embassadors had betrayed
them. The king of Nauarre being offended for that hee was condemned

and drew vnto his seruice some Ministers of these two kings,
and made them his pensionersThe King of Castille suffered himselfe to be gouerned by the great master of Castille and the Archbishop of Tolledo. King Lewis made much of them to be informed of the state of Castille, or at the least to drew them to his deuotion: It is the least a Prince can attend of one that comes to see him..

of the detention of the Bastard of Rubenpre, and for that
he had suffered his Maiesties name and respect to bee wronged
publikely and taxt: That Oliuer de la March and a religious man
had spoken il of him, and that the Earle of Charolois had allied
himselfe vnto the Duke of Brittany. These were the complaints
whereon their embassy was grounded.
            
               Moruillier represented the Kings intentions with much bitternes
and passion, quallifying this intelligence of the Duke of Brittanie
and the Earle of Charrolois with no milder name then crime
and conspiracy, adding that he could not conceiue why it had been
made, but for that the Earle of Charolois was discontented for that
his pension was not paid himThe Earle of Charolois was much moued at that word which imputed his discontent to a matter due, which the greatnes of his courage made him to contemne, thinking that Moruillier would inferre thereby that hee could not liue without his pension..

against the Kings respect hee would cause him to bee punished.
And as for the preacher of Bruges he knew not what was become
of him, and that he was a man of that condition as his conscience
would not suffer him to lay hold of him.
            The Earle of Charolois did still interrupt Moruillier in his discourse,
who told him that hee was come to speake to the Duke
his Father and not to him. Whereupon the Earle entreated his father
to suffer him to speake, I haue answered said the Duke for thee,
as in mine opinon a father should answere for his sonne, yet if thou
hast so great a desire, thinke of it to day, and to morrow speake what
thou wilt. He would not haue his sonne carried away with those

               Moruillier persisted in the bitternes of his discourse, forgetting
nothing that might be said to blemish and disgrace a Prince. Hee
shewed that the Bastard of Rubempre had been sent by the King to
stay the Vice-chancellor of Brittanie returning out of England:
That hauing landed at the Hage in Holland, the Earle of Charralois
had been too suspitious. The Duke answered that the Bastard
of Rubempree had been found faulty. As for his Sonne, the
Earle of Charolois, if he were suspicious, hee had it not from him
but from his mother, who was a very suspicious and distrustfull
woman, and yet notwithstanding if hee had been at the Hage at
the passage of Rubempre, he had done no lesse then his sonneD. Isabella, Infanta of Portugal, daughter to the King Don Iohn was married to Philip Duke of Bourgundy in the yeare 1429. and was mother to Charles.
               .
            
               Moruillier cōplained also, that the D. went from Hedin without
taking leaue of the King, and against that which he had promised.
Ha, said the Duke, with some little perturbation and heate, finding
himselfe toucht with the breath of his word.Nothing can be reproched more sensible to a Prince then the breach of his word, who should rather faile himselfe then his promises, wherein he should be

thing but what I haue kept. And fearing that in speaking this they
should finde that he was moued, he added smiling, that hee had
neuer failed of his word but to Ladies, that hauing promised the
King not to goe from Hedin, he had added this condition if there
came no other newes. That the discouerie of the Bastard of Rubempre
and other important matters had caused him to goe to horse.

and hath kept nothing of that which hee hath promised me,Whē a Prince hath an opinion not to hold any thing that hee promiseth hee may say that

that although the Duke was vassell vnto the King for some lands,

Kings Embassadors, to whom the Duke answered, I would haue the
world know that it was mine owne fault if I be not, yet will I not tel how
or by what meanes.
            
            The next day the Earle of Charolois presented himselfe vnto his
Father in the presence of the French Embassadors, kneeling vpon
a Cushion of Veluet, an exemplary act of Reuerence and Humilitie
of a Prince of thirtie yeares old vnto his Father, and which
assures this truth: That who so will be honored of those which be
vnder him, should not faile to respect and honor those that bee
aboue him. The scope of his discourse was to iustifie himselfe for
the taking of the Bastard of Rubempre, and the confederacie betwixt
the Duke of Brittaine and him, wherein hee protested hee
had no other designe then the Kings seruice, and shewing that his
condition had wherwith to content himselfe with his owne, & contempt
of an other mans; there beeing no lesse glorie in the contempt
then in the possession,It is for great courages to contemne Riches. The shortest way to riches is to contemne Riches. It is easier to disdaine then to possesse all. hee added that it was not for any
discontent he had for the taking of his pension from him, for
that, with the fauour of his father, he could liue without the Kings
bounty.

presented a banket vnto the Embassadors, the History saith, wine

spake these words vnto the Archbishop of Narbonna,Phil. de Com. lib. 1. one of the
three Embassadors, recommend me most humbly vnto the Kings good
grace, and tell him that hee hath sought to disgrace me by his Chancellor,
but before the yeere bee past he will repent it.
            
            From these little sparkles grew that great fire of the warre of
the commonweale. The Duke of BurbonneThe visits of great persons are suspitious. Iohn Duke of Bourbon making shew to go see the Ladie Agnes his mother at Bruxells treated the league of the publike weale with the Duke Periculosae sūt secretae coitiones.

agent,The D. of Bourgundy comes to see his mother at Bruxells. faining to goe see his Mother at Bruxells, conferred
with the Duke, but did not discouer the secret, saying onely,
that the Princes had no other intent but to present a petition vnthe
king to reforme the disorders of the state and to haue forces
readie, to the end hee might know how many were interressed
in this reformation. Such as entered into this league knew one
another by a silken point which they carried at their girdles.
            Although the king had spies in all places yet knew he nothing
of these coniunctions and assemblies. Princes are within and
not aboue the world to see all that was done. They must bee aboue
the heauens to know the ecclipses by themselues and not
descend low to see the effectsThe effects of great designes doe often break forth before the causes are discouered. A vigilant Prince doth alwaies vse peruensions and diuersions.. The league was borne before he
knew the conception, hee did not apprehend that it should show
it selfe on the Burgundians side, for he considered, that although
the sonne were violent and ill affected towards him, yet the father
wanted no iudgement to restraine him, and iudging that
the ayre could not be troubled but towards Brittanie, he assembled
both the Princes of his bloud, and the chiefe of his Noblemen
at Tours about Christmas 1464. and propounded vnto them
the great occasions he had to preuent the designes of the Duke of

being thus roughly handled, and grieued that in an age of threescore
and ten yeares, he was not heard by him whose grandfather
had vouchsafed to heare him in his youth, could not endure them,
not considering that they came from the mouth of his king, who
was not bound to fit them to his humor, and that he must swallow
them sweetly without murmuring, for the demonstration of
the offence doth but augment it. He died for sorrow two daies
after, the fourth of Ianuary 1465. Hee was interred at Bloys, his
bones were carried to the toombe of his Father at the Celestins
at Paris, the 21. of February, 1504. by the commandement of
king Lewis the twelfth his sonne: After the battell of Azincourt he
remained fiue and twenty yeares prisoner in England. The English
would not deliuer this Flower-deluce without ransome, and
to redeeme him the D. of Bourgundy payed three hundred thouthousand
crownes. What a change▪

but to see the head. Charles of France the Kings brother beeing at
Poictiers, and making show to goe a hunting whiles the king was
in his deuotions, steales away and goes vnto the Embassadors of
Brittaine. Iohn of Rommille, vice chancellor of Brittaine, and Tanequy
of Chastell, who were come to haue a Prolongation for other
three monthes to make answere to the kings demands, carried him
away speedily by the meanes of the Lord of Lescon a Gascoine,
and led him into Brittanie.The King being gone in deuotion to our Lady of Pont in Limosin, the Duke of Berry retires into Brittaine. He was but eighteene yeares old, hee
held life so short, and that of Princes, which liue in subiection so

master the knowledge would euer come to late. He was welcome,
for this was the firebrand which they must cast to set France on
fire. The Duke of Brittanie promised him the seruice of his person,
and all the succors of his forces.
            Hee declared the cause of his departure by letters which hee
wrote to the Duke of Bourgundy, and to the other Princes of their
intelligence. The most apparent was drawne from the bad gouernment

            Most deere and welbeloued Vncle I recommend me vnto you. I let
you vnderstand that of late I haue often heard the clamors of the Princes
of the blood my kinsmen and other Noblemen of this Realme
in all estates; of the disorder and pittifull gouernment which now doth
raigne by the councell of men, being about my Lord, full of all lewdnes
and iniquity; who for their owne profit and priuate disordered affections
haue drawne my Lord into iealousie and hatred against you, me, and all
the Noblemen of the said Realme, yea against the Kinges of Castile and
Scotland, so long allyed vnto the CrowneThe most ancient alliances of the French haue beene with the Scots and then with the Castilians. The Crowne of France hath had pretentions vpon Castille at the inheritance of the Lady Blanch of Castile mother to St. Lewis.
                as euery man knowes. In regard
how the authority of the Church hath beene kept, Iustice done and
administred, the Noblemen maintained in their rights and priuiledges,
and the poore people supported and freed from oppression, I write no more
vnto you, for I know you are sufficiently informed, and I am greeued at
the said thinges, as I ought to be, as he whom it doth so neere concerne
as euery man doth know,The Children of one family are interessed in the 
                     〈…〉
                   and the Princes of the bloud in the gouernment of the estate. and desire to prouide for it by the Counsell of

you, of the said Princes and kinsmen and other Noblemen, who haue all
promised to aid and serue me not sparing body or goods for the quiet
of the Realme, and the publick weale thereof, and also to saue my person
which I found to be in danger. For incessantly and openly my said Lord
and they about him spake such wordes of me,The words of such as are neerest vnto a Prince make men iudge of his intentions. The Duke of Berry hearing that the seruants of the K. his brother spake freely against him, thought that their discourses were framed vpō his. Good words entertaine friendship and bad dissolues thē.
                as I might with Reason
haue cause to doubt: I therefore left my said Lord, and am come vnto my
good Cosin of Brittaine, who hath giuen me so good and commendable reception
as I cannot sufficiently commend it, and is resolued to serue me
with body, goods and all his power to the good of the said Realme and publicke
weale. And therefore my most deere and welbeloued vncle, my intention
and desire is to imploy my selfe with you and the said noblemen
my kinsmen, whose counsell I will vse, and not otherwise, to restore and
redresse the said desolate Realme, knowing that you are one of the greatest
of the Realme, whom the good or ill do easily concerne, and Deane of the
Peeres of France,The Duke of Bourgondy is first Peere of France, in this quality hee made a protestation to King Charles the sixth saying that hee might not asist at the iudgement of the K. of Nauarre, vvhich did onely belong vnto the Peeres. a Prince renowned for honor and iustice, as it appeareth
by your great deedes, conduct and gouernment of your great
signories, knowing that the disorders of the said Realme, haue
and doe displease you as reason is: I would desire with all my heart
to haue an assembly with you and other noblemen my kinsmen, that by
your counsell we might prouide for all matters, which for want of order,
Iustice and policy are at this day in all the estates of the said Realme,His designe of arming to reforme disorders. and

an order in all places as it may be pleasing vnto God, to the honour, felicity
and good to the said Realme, and to the retribution of honour and
perpetuall commendation of all those that shall imploy themselues. I do
intreat you, most deere and louing vncle, that in this matter, which is
great for so good an end, it would please you to aid and assist me, and to
cause my brother in law of Charolois your sonne to imploy himselfe in my

you and I may meet (which is the thing I most desire) for that my intention
is shortly to enter into the Country, and to keepe the fields with the

hath alwaies been a dutifull and obedient daughter. This Pope
was lamented of all Christendome, for he had great conceptions
for her glorie and libertie in those places where shee was opprest
vnder the tyranny of the Ottomans. Beeing at Ancona to imbarke
himselfe for the voyage of the Croisado, after that hee had giuen
audience to the Embassadors of France and of the Duke of Bourgundy,
who excused themselues that they could not serue in person
in this voiage, a slow continuall Feuer, which had long held him, depriued
him of life. He had no cause to grieue that hee had liued,
for that his life had been honored with so great and worthy actions
as he might rightly say he had not been borne in vaine.

He was issued from the Picolhomini, of Sienna, and seeing that his
father had beene expelled the Citie with many others of certaine
families reuolted by the mutiny of the people, he resolued to seek
his fortune at Rome, where shee hath alwaies done great miracles.
He was first of all Secretary to Dominike Grap, and followed him
to Basill, when as he came to complaine that Pope Eugenius refused
him a Cardinals hat, which Martin the fift had giuen him. The
masters pouertie forced him to take another: He placed himselfe
with the Bishop of Noara, but seeing that hee was in like manner
persecuted by Pope Eugenius, hee left him and did serue Nicholas
Cardinall of St. Croix: and followed him to Arras, when as he was
sent by Pope Eugenius to reconcile the French King to the King of
England, and the Duke of Bourgundy.
            At his returne finding that he was in no grace with Pope Eugenius,

he came to Basill, where he was imployed in the goodliest
actions of the Councell, he had the charge of Abreuiator, Secretarie,
President in the chamber of the faith,In the Councell of Basill there were foure chambers or foure assemblies which they called four deputations, that of the faith, of Peace, of reformation, and of common affaires. Euery chamber had a president, which was changed euery three monethes. and Orator in diuers

sessions. When there was Question of an embassage to any
Prince or commonweale there was not any one but He fit for it.
He was sent to Amedeus Duke of Sauoy, then to the Emperor Frederick,
to Pope Eugenius, to Philip Vicecount Duke of Milan, and
to Alfonso King of Arragon. It was he which perswaded the Emperor
Frederick to goe to Rome to be crowned there. Frederick
sent him to Sienna to receiue Ellenor of Portugall his wife, and afterwards
into Bohemia to pacifie a controuersie which was
growne, for that the Emperor Frederick did not restore them their
King Ladislaus
               The Emperor Frederick seeing the troubles & schismes in the realme of Hungarie seazed vpon the yong King Ladislaus, & gaue him in charge to Eneas Siluius.

            He was sent to the dyet of Ratisbona, whereas Philip Duke of
Bourgundy assisted,His oration to arme against the Turke. he laid open the necessities of a warre against
the Turke with such efficacie and eloquence, as many Princes resolued
to employ both their liues and goods: But these suddaine
resolutions went presently into smoke:
                  Platina saith that all which heard him were wonderfull resolute to this war, Verū hoe natura cōper. tum est, eorum animos cito residere quorū affectus facile mouentur. But it is found true by nature that their minds are soone changed, whose affections are easily moued. Hee also pacified
a great complaint which Germany made against the Pope,
and the which hath been since continued, the Princes and comminalties
of the Empire being resolued not to acknowledge him
in the policie and direction of spirituall things, if he did not first
grant them the same rights which Italy and France had by the
Pragmatick Sanctions. The Emperor found their first suite iust,
and was soone drawne to yeeld vnto it. Aeneas Siluius changed
his opinion, representing vnto him that there was more honor and
safety for him to haue good correspondence with the Pope, then
to fauour those who would diminish his authoritie whereof the
Emperors were protectors.These complaints were pacified, & reuiued in the beginning of the Emperor Charles the fifths raigne, when as they presented vnto the Popes Legate being at Nuremborg A. Remonstrance vnder this title. Sacri Romani imperii Principum ac procerum grauamina aduersus sedem Romanam.
               
            
            He was Archbishop of Sienna,His bad affection to Lewis the eleuenth. and after the death of Calixtus
was aduanced to the Popedome in a manner without thinking
of it. Hee began with the assembly at Mantua, whither all the
Princes of the Empire sent their Embassadors. Hee made open
show that he loued not France, as hath beene said, and this affection
continued after the death of Charles the seuenth: forLudouieo Gallorum regi aduersatus est, quod libertatem Ecclesiae minuere conaretur cum ab eo antea Pragmaticam Sanctionem Ecclesiae Romanae pernitiosissimam pestem extorsisset. 
               Platina
saith, that although he had wrested the Pragmatick Sanction
out of the hands of Lewis the eleuenth, yet he did not forbeare to
crosse him, for that hee thought to diminish the libertie of the
Church. Paul the second, called Peter Barbo, a Venetian, succeeded
him.

did owe her libertie to King Charles the seuenth,
he had freed her from the miseries of

respect retained many in their obedience and dutie, who suffering
themselues to be carried away with this torrent of the league,Sedition must be bee smothered in the beginning. had
become fooles for company and by infection: For the people is a

                but the number seemed but too great, and it
had multiplied speedily if the Kings wisedome had not foreseene
it. Conspiracie in the beginning is like vnto raine which enters
into a small cranny on the top of the house, and beeing neglected
in the end expels the master thereof. The King did consider hereof,
for being aduertised of his brothers retreat, he knew well that
the partie was made against him if hee did not oppose himselfe:
That what appeared not, might be greater then what was in show,
and that besides the Princes of his bloud, many Catylines
had drunke in the same cup the wine and bloud of this conspiracie.

could not breake. Hee sent to the Duke of Bourbon to come
vnto him; Who for that hee would vse no dissembling (a great
and powerfull vertue in these corrupted ages) would not disguise
his intentions, nor represent them otherwise in words then they

desire to end then to begin. If hee had made any show of repentance
or feare in this beginning, the rest which had martcht in his
steps would soone haue turned their backes.
            He answered that he had the same designe with the other Princes
for the good and profit of the publike weale, intreating the
King to excuse him if hee came not to Court, and for a greater
declaration of his will he ceazed vppon the reuenues of Bourbonois,
and stayed Iuuenall des Vrsines Lord of Traynill, Peter of Oriola,
and the Lord of Crussoll prisoners, making it knowne that
Ambition hath no other Law then the fancie of the Ambitious,
and takes away the maske from all respect. When the King saw
that there was no meanes to reclaime these Princes, and that the
Duke of Bourgundy was in armes, he aduertised all the chiefe noble
men of his Realme, and wrote vnto the Clergie, to the gouernours
of Prouinces,Letters frō the K. to the gouernors of the Prouinces and townes. to the Magistrates and townes, who faint

themselues to bee carried away with the false showes of the enemies
of the estate, who had suborned his brother to ingage
France in those desolations from the which it was but newly freed:
That if they which had suffered themselues to bee abused in this reuolt,
did not bethinke themselues, there wilfulnes would make
them vnworthy the clemencie which he offered them: That with
the grace of God and the fidelitie of his good subiects, hee assured
himselfe to abate and disperse these bad designes.

King of this Tragedie, that they would bring him still vppon the
stage, and make him play all parts according to the humour and
inuention of the Duke of Brittanie, of the Earle of Charolois and
of the Duke of Bourbon: Wherefore hee sought to flatter him,
and to draw him out of the Brittans hands, and to that end hee
went to Angers: there wanted no letters, promises nor good words:

            At Angers hee was aduertised that the Earle of Charolois leuied

the Duke of Bourbon had declared warre against him in seazing

any thing amidest so many discontentments and infidelities, he
had commanded Breze great Seneshall of Normandy not to fight,
who notwithstanding this prohibition, tould one of his friends that
he would bring the two Princes so neere together, as he should be
a very able man that could part them. He was slaine with the first,
and he is produced for an example that seldome doth that succeed
wel which is don against the order & commandement of the Prince.
            On the seauenteenth of Iuly the Seneshall presented him-selfe
earlely in the morning vpon the way to Montlehery. The Earle of
Saint Pol, who led the Earle of Charolois foreward, found himselfe
ingaged, and could not turne hed to come to the place of Battle, as
the Earle had commanded him; it was so prest, as if he had made
shew to refuse to ioyne; all had beene in disorder. He put his troups

might haue beene charged and defeated without all hope of succors,
the way being too narrow for the body of the army which followed,
But the smale skil of the men at armes to mount and descend
(the which horsemen should chiefely practise) made them to loose
much time, for they that had left their horses tooke them againe,
when they considered that they should need them either to poursue
or to fly, and that their courages might be fortefied by that of their
horses.Courage should come from the man and not otherwise; The horse helpes something. The Sarmatians fighting on foote could not finde roome enough to fly, but on horse backe there were none more valiant. In the meane time the Kings army grew great, and the
Earle of St. Pol was sorry that he had so long forborne the charge,
and neglected the aduantageHee that can take the aduantage which the scituation of the place giues him fights happely.

the way, and the Earle made them to march speedly through the
Corne, which was high and strong, so as his men were so wearied
as they had more need to lye downe then to stand. And although
the Princes had disputed the victory vnto the last point of valour,
yet knew they not to whom the trophee did belong, and they
might say that the Earle of Charolois had lost the Battell, but

Lords of Crequy and Hautbourdin, spake of Duke Phillips, the
Earles father, first carying armes at St. Requier, who recouered
the next day that which he had lost the day of Battell, It was to prepare
this Prince to the glorious emulation of his fathers valour
and to bind him not to dislodge. The Earle of St. Pol said that they
must take the way to Bourgondy, and leaue some part of their carriages
to retire more speedily. His reason was grounded vppon the
apparant danger they were in to remaine without victuals betwixt
Paris and the Kings forces: Many were of the same opinion,
and yet they that were sent to take view of the Kings army were not

Army, euery one would grow amazed and flye; that the most diligent
should not goe twenty leagues before he were staid, or slaine.

and followed by the Earle of Charolois, who commanded euery
man to rest two houres and to be ready at the sound of the
trumpet: Oliuer de la March saith that when Contay had giuen his

They grew assured and hardy for company; boldnes returned vnto
them after the danger. The day discouered the feares and heauines
which night had concealed. The Earle of Charolois incouraged
euery man. He thought that seeing there was amazement in his army
which he held to be victorious, there was dispaire in the Kings
which he held to be scattered and lost. But such as had lost would
not hazard any more, they murmured against the heat of this
Prince, who was obstinate to fight, and could not retire vppon his
losse, but made himselfe miserable vppon hope of good hap in the
recouery of that which he had lost. AmbitionAmbi

            That which confirmed the courages of the most resolute,Duke of Brittaine expected. was the
assurance of succors from Brittaine, but many thought that this
ill fortune would stay it. The Earle of Charolois entertained them
with the assurances he had of the armies marchingWhen an army or Towne is in expectation of succours they must alwaies assure that it comes, and although they shold haue news to the contrary, yet the commander in his wisdome must giue it out otherwise. Syphax sent word to Scipio that hee could not succor him and & that he was for Carthage. Scipio entertayned his Ambassadors courteously & gaue them presents to make his mē beleeue that Siphax came, & that his Ambassadors did returne to hasten him. and when hee

had not any, nor other newes, yet matters were reduced to those
termes as he must tell them it was neere. He caused a Frier to make
shew to come out of Brittaine, who said that hee had left the army
so neere as they should see it the same day. But the feare and amazement
was so great as they could not beleeue it. This pollicy

great a traine. He commanded him to let him know the iniustice of

it is to defend my selfe in France from that harme which the king
would haue done me in Flanders: That when he came hee was receiued

need of a warlike and armed liberty, then of a quiet and miserable seruitude.

In this place as the Earle of Charolois spake vnto Mounsieur at a
window, with great attention and affection, a Britton cast a squib
which strooke against the barre where they leaned, and being amazed
at this accident, they thought it done of purpose to hurt them.
The lodging was presently enuironed with souldiers to gard them.
There was a dilligent search made for him that had done it, who
beeing only couered with his inocency, descouered him-selfe and
said that it was but a squib which he had cast to shew them pastime,
wherevpon this great amazement was turned to a iest.
            All their forces being vnited they tooke councell how they shold
imploy them. Their opinions were alwaies applyed to their passions

guiding of this Ship hath his eyes alwaies lift vp to heauen and
his hands at the helme, was more resolute to defend himselfe then
to attempt any thing, yet hee made a trench from Charanton beneath
Constans with a little fort at the head of it, where hee lodged
foure thousand Archers, with some Ordinance, which made
the Princes to keepe their chambers, for it played in their quarter.
The Dukes of Berry & Brittanie came in the morning to the Earles
lodging to hold a Councell, where they dined and departed not
but by the fauour of the night.
            This was all that the King did, for hee held it not fit to hazard
any thing, hee knew this great and gaping breach would exhale
contagious vapors, that it would not be closed vp with the death
of one man alone, but would swallow a million, that he had rather
saue his subiects then vanquish his enemies.A Prince should alwayes haue in his mind, euen in the heat of Combats, that royall saing of Scipio which Anthony the Gentle did so much esteeme. Se malle vnum seruare Ciuem quam mille hostes occidere. Iul. Capitoll. So great a conspiracie
would that choller should straine the sinewes of his soule,
and that hee should refuse peace to them who demanded nothing

but warre, but he represented vnto himselfe the deadly bitings of
incensed necessitie; that the bloud which should bee spilt in this
warre flowed from his veines, that the blowes would fall vppon
his members, and vpon part of his bowels: That it is a goodly
thing to suffer himselfe to bee vanquished, when the victorie is
dangerous to the victor.
            Hee resolued to make their Camels drinke the water which
them selues had troubled. They propounded a peace with goodly
conditions. The Princes make show that they desired not warre
but for the publike quiet, and to liue without wrong. They made
many truces to treat that, they which lasting but little was not
much distinguished from warre,

was begun by diuers, but the King ended it, who one morning

the Earle of Charrolois answered, I as a brother.
               The word of an enemie is a dangerous assurance, K Lewis the eleuenth had no other to goe into the Princes Army which were iust against him. If there cōfidence hath vndone some, it hath bin successefull to others, and Scipio Africanus went vpon this assurance to Siphax, who although he were abaroarian & a cruell enemie to the Romane name, yet the mildnes and generositie of Scipio made him a friend. Ladislaus King of Bohemia went freely to Mathias King of Hungary his capitall enemy, to end controuersies which could not be determined at Olmutz, & they became great friends. Dubrau. lib. 2

                He receiued the
King with much respect, and the King spake vnto him with great
mildnes, which made his heart apt for any impression, so great is
the force of words, and so well hee could handle his tongue, the
which he vsed as a pensill for all coulours.
            He that will haue effects according to his owne heart, must not
spare words to his liking that may giue them. Mens spirits are gouerned
by words, as a ship is gouerned by the helme, and a horse
by the bit, and wee cannot say what power the sweetnes of words
haue ouer the minde of man.Words are the Instrument by the which the minde of man is animated, thrust forward and held backe. A Prince that knowes how to vse them hath a great aduantage in all that he treates, and when it is acompanied with such sweetnes as grauity is not wronged, it workes what it lists in the hearts of men. The King, framing his speech to
this tune, said vnto the Earle. Brother I know that you are a Gentleman,
and of the house of France: why my Lord, answered the Earle. For
that, said the King, When the foole Moruillier spake so boldly vnto you,
you sent me word that I would repent the words hee had spoken before
the yeare were past, you haue not failed, and before the time. The King
spake these words with a countenance so free and full of affection,
although his heart were full of indignation and spleene, as the Earle
tooke delight in it. He disauowed Moruillier, and tooke the seales
from him. Princes play with their subiects, and disauow them
when as their negotiations are not answerable to their hopes.
            He did walke long by the riuers side, betwixt the Earle of Charolois,
and the Earle of St. Paul, and heard their Intentions.The King who thought nothing wel done if he were not an Actor, went to the Earle of Charolois, preferring the necessity of his affaires, before the consideration of his quali

                The
Earle of Charolois demanded the Dutchie of Normandie for the
Duke of Berry, and the riuer of Somme for himselfe, little for the
publike, and much for priuate men. The King told him plainely
that he would neuer consent to dismember the Duchie of Normandie,

but he was content to restore him the Townes of Somme:
and finding that the Earle of St. Paul was the Oracle of the Counsels
and will of this Prince, he offered him the office of Constable.
By these offers the strict bond of this league began to be dissolued,
for there is nothing so fast bound but it is vndone when as one
string begins to slip. The King did and spake all things so cunningly,
mingly offers with threats, and curtesies with braueries, as the
Earle applied himselfe to his intentions.
            The day after this first conferenceThis conference of the King and the Earle was the end of the war. It was not thought fit the King should seeke vnto the Barle, but to do his busines hee past all formalities, & would not comit that to hope which he might doe by discretiō. What doth it import to ascend to any place, to vse staires of wood, or ston, or whether the key bee of gold or iron, so as it open., the Earle of Charolois mustred

commending those goodly forces. The Earle of Charolois speaking
vnto them vsed these words. My masters you and I are for the
King our Soueraigne Lord, to serue him when soeuer hee shall haue
need of vs.
            
            The Kings offers bred a iealousie betwixt the Princes of the
league, euery man cared for his owne affaires. The Earle of Charolois
saw one day vpon his conferences and propositions three
Councels and three bands, whereat hee was discontented, saying,
that there should not be any thing secret in his presence: During
these conferences and enteruiewe. Isabell of Bourbon Countes

him. This death gaue some more facilitie to the peace, for the
marriage of the Earle with the Lady Anne of France, the Kings
eldest Daughter, was propounded, with the transport of the Counties
of Bry and ChampagneIn marriages of the daughters of France, Kings haue somtimes giuen money, & sometimes lands of the Crowne vpon condition they should returne. Charles the fift gaue to his two eldest daughters a 100000. franks of gold, and to the rest 60000. Charls the sixt gaue eight hundred thousand to Isabell married to Richard the second King of England. King Iohn gaue the Contie of Somiers in Languedoc to Isabel his daughter, married to the Duke of Milan. Lewis the yong gaue to Margaret his daughter married to Henry the third King of England the Contie of Vexin. for her dowrie and preferment,
which the Kings Predecessors had neuer done in marrying their
daughters. The Earle of Charrolois affected nothing more, but
vpon the doubt which was made vnto him of the alienation of
these two Prouinces, he sent William Hugonet, and Iohn Carandolet
to Paris, to know if these two peeces might be seperated from the
Crowne. The King gaue them all the assurances they could desire,
but he shewed that his intent was not to lodge his daughter in a
house which he could not loue.
            The conditions of the accord being treated after this manner
with the Earle Charolois, as hee who had all the power in his
hands, euery man stood vpon his gard. The Earle was aduertised of
the kings designes, and there was still some one which discouered
the Earles vnto the King.In ciuill warres Councels are not secret, and the most hidden are diuulged, euery one hath some friend on the contrarie partie. A page came at midnight to the riuer
side crying, that they should be set vpon by all the forces that were

Iohn Duke of Calabria came vnto the Dukes standard, who
like a couragious Prince, beleeuing that which hee desired, spake
after this manner. Now we are come to that which we haue alwaies desired,

            The Duke of Bourgundy vppon some aduertisement that the
Duke of Berry and Brittanie might make their accord apart, as
the Kings designe was onely to diuide them, he held it not fit to

                He sent him a hundred and twenty
men at Armes led by the Lord of Saueur, a thousand fiue hundred
Archers, and sixscore thousand crownes, the which would
haue made him more difficult in the Treatie, if they had come before
the conclusion.
            It had been concluded that Monsieur should resigne Berry vnto

but hee entred also into the Towne. When as the King saw
that the Normans had allowed of this change without those difficulties
and moderations which he expected, he sent word vnto the
Earle of Charolois that he desired to meete with him neere vnto

               ans. Hee came, and the King said vnto him, that the Peace
was made seeing his Brother was in Rouen. This did so please the
Earle of Charolois,Earle of Charolois in a danger not foreseene. as vnwittingly hearing and speaking with affection
of this accord, hee found himselfe at the entry of the Bulwarke,
which was at the end of the trench which the King had caused
to be made, by the which they might enter into the Towne.
The long black cloake which he carried for the losse of his wife, seemed
in a manner to mourne for his libertie.
            He was much amazed, but hee dissembled his feare and his amazement
all hee could, fearing that if the King perceiued it, he
would hold himselfe wronged, and it may bee proceed farther.
The chiefe men that were in the Armie held their master lost, and
represented vnto thēselues that which had hapened to his Grandfather

Marshall of Bourgundy, to vse these words. If this foole
and mad man hath vndone himselfe, we must not follow him, nor ruine
his house nor his fathers affaires, let euery man thinke of his owne
safety and of an honorable retreat: No man can hinder vs from recouering
of the frontier.
            
            The ioy was exceeding great when they saw him returne. This
Marshall seeing him, said vnto him, that he was not at his seruice

but by loane, so long as his father liued.A young Prince must bee reprehended by such persons whose age, experience, and authoritie giue power to speake freely, but the acknowledgement of the error must cause the reprehension cease, the which must not be done publikely, least it breed contempt, and that they which should bee confirmed in an opinion that their commanmander hath nothing imperfect, grow doubtfull of his conduct. So all hold speeches & free aduertisements to a delicate Prince, that cannot endure to be grieued by hearing, are dangerous. 
               Chide mee not, answered
the Earle.Heacknowledgeth his error and is ashamed. 
               I confesse my great error but I found it so late as I was neere
vnto the Bulwarke. The Marshall of Bourgundy added, you haue
done it without me. The Earle of Charolois held downe his head
and made no answere, for that which he had done exceeded the
bounds of all iudgement. The King was commended to haue dealt
so iustly, and the Earle of Charolois to haue committed himselfe
so freely into a strongers hands.
            The conditions of the peace beeing all concluded, the King
gaue to the Earle of Charrolois the Castle of Bois de Vincennes
for his assurance, promising to come thither the next day. Hee
came, where also were the Dukes of Berry and Brittanie and the
Earle of Charolois, the ports were well garded, and the approches
fortified, and the King was in the like feare in the Castle, as
the Earle of Charolois had beene in the Bulwarke. Euery man
thought that the Publike weale,Treatie of peace concluded at Bois de Vincennes. which had beene so much exalted
in this league, should be preferred before all other conditions of
the Treatie. But it is a folly to thinke that what is desired of many
can succeed, when it depends of the affections of few men,
Matters done hardly succeede but according to the intent of the first mouers. Priuat interests and designes bande against publike intentions, and seldom is it seene what all desire is executed by few. which haue diuers designes. They talked thereof when as all
was done. The Earle of Charolois had the Townes of either side
the riuer of Somme, Amiens, St. Quentin, Corbie, Abbeuille, the
countie of Ponthieu, Dourlans, St. Requier, Creuecaeur, Arleux,
Monstreuil, Croton, and Mortaigne, to bee redeemed for two
hundred thousand crownes, after the death of the Earle of Charolois.
The King to retire these Townes had nine monethes before
paied foure hundred thousand crownes. Monsieur did homage vnto
the King for the Duchie of Normandy.Election of thirty six D

                  firme all that should be done by them.
            
            The Duke of Brittaine held some places in Normandy, which he
kept still, for he said he had contributed more, for the charges of the
warre, then all the rest.
            The Conuocation of the estates was resolued, and in the meane
time it was held fit to chuse 36. persons,Reformation of the disorders of the realme. of all the orders of France,
to prouide with the Earle of Dunois for the disorder of Iustice and
the reformation of the estate. The King made no difficulty to grant
all they demanded reseruing vnto himselfe the liberty to hinder it.
His intent was to diuide the forces of the league, and then to turne
ouer his bookes of the sword and dagger,The Emperor Caligula had two secret bookes, the one was called the sword and the other the dagger, wherein they were noted that should be put to death with those kind of Armes Suet. cap. 49.
                where were written in
red letters, their names which had offended him during his retreat into
Flanders, and his fathers raigne, which had followed his brother
and the Princes of the league, and especially they that had receiued
him so easily into Normandy:King Lewis the eleuenth held Normandie the most important Prouince of his Realme, he gaue it to his Brother but to delay him, it was to faire a peece to giue for a portion. Philip de Commines saith, he had seene raised in Normandie fourescore and fifteene thousand pound sterling. for he would not for any thing haue
consented to giue him that Prouince, if he had not beene assured of
their constancy that held the chiefe places.
            
               
But the Normans, who did alwaies thinke that their Country did
well deserue a Duke, consented to this change for the desire they had
to haue a Prince, which should remaine within the Prouince. There
were but three which desired rather to leaue their houses then to
change their maister. Iustice had greater power in their soules then
wisedome. The Seneshall of Normandy, the Balyfe of Rouen, and
one named Picard, who was afterwards Generall of Normandy. The
History owes them this testimony of honor,To doe well among men of honor is easie and ordinary but not to suffer himselfe to be transported with the coruptions of the time nor to follow the violent passions of a multitude but to desire the good, to dare vndertake it and to effect it in a bad season, in the which vice is honored with the recompence of vertue, it is an infallible argument of a spirit wonderfully disposed by nature to all good and commendable thinges. the which is the
more considerable, for that there is some difficulties to retire ones
selfe out of a presse that runs headlong, and that the imitation and
example of ill, presents it selfe alwaies with much heat.
            At their departure from Bois de Vincennes,Departure of the Earle of Charolois. euery one to tooke his
course, the Dukes of Normandy and Brittaine went to Rouen, the
King did accompany the Earle of Charolois to Villiers the faire.
They lodged together for a proofe of the confidence they had one
of another. The King was the weaker hauing but a small troupe, but
there was order that 200. men at armes should come to accompany
him to Paris. An act of wisedome, as commendable as those of
precedent conferences, and trusts had beene dangerous: for in such
occasions there is nothing more safe then not to giue any aduantage
to his aduerse party to wrong him:All assurances of friendship, faith and promises which may be drawne from an enemy are good and profitable, but by reason of the inconstancy of men and time there is none better, then so to fit himselfe as he may haue noe meanes to hurt him. The Earle of Charolois

farewell, and returning with them that came to fetch him, he freed
him from al subiect to distrust his intentions.

with siluer then with blood, and teares of his subiects. To the

sword ouer his subiects. That of his Iustice remaines in the hands of

he tooke his oath, and his authoritie was verified by the Court of
Parliament. As Arthur

first whose letters of Constable were there published, so Lewis of
Luxembourg was the first that tooke his oath there. We must not
iudge of a mans fortune by the glorie of such dignities, they bee
peeces of Christall, which as they glister so they will breake. To
hold a man happie that enters into great charges, is to giue the name
of the image to the mettle which is not yet molten. Wee must see
him come, liue and runne to the end of the course, to know what
the issue will be.
            With this charge Lewis of Luxembourg was wedded to his own
ruine, and did himselfe adde much vnto it, for notwithstanding
that he were bound vnto the King both by reason and oath,Affection of the Constable St. Paul. yet (as

which ouerflowes and waters a field and is nothing the cleerer: He
still kept a naturall inclination to the seruice of his first Prince,
grounding his affections vpon one maxime, in the which hee found
his ruine in stead of greatnes, whereunto he aspired.

to be alwaies supported by the one when the other should seek
to ruine him, and to make both of them depend so vpon his will, as
as hee should prescribe them a lawe of warre and peace when hee
pleased, nt considering that newtrality, which may bee commended
in a prince, when by reason of wisedome or weaknes he cannot doe
otherwise, is meere trechery and treason in a subiect, who can
haue but one maister.
            It was a great miserie for him to be betwixt two Princes which
could not agree. He that is in this estate is not like vnto the towne
of Siria,
                  Pliny saith that the towne of Palmira in Syria remained without touch amidst the powers of the Romane and Parthian Empires. which was nothing anoyed being inuironed by the Armies
of the Romans and Parthians. Hee finds his condition oftentimes
like vnto the miserable marriner of Tire, whom one waue cast out
of the ship, and another brought him in againe. His humor did
fauor his bad fortune, wauering alwaies amidst the vncertainty of
his resolutions, and a spirit of contradiction.
            When he was freed from one businesse he intangled himselfe with
another,His bad conduct & vnsortunate end. well in France, ill in Flanders, and as the cloudes turne alwayes
either into wind, or to raine, his enterprises ended alwayes
in teares or sighes. In a word he made a trade of the profession of
armes, and did not take them to haue peace, but to make the warre
continue.Whilst that Rome was well gouerned (which was vntill the time of the Gracchi) there was neuer Captaine nor Souldier which made a trade of war, when it was ended euery man returned to his first exercise. A

            When as he saw that Councells are not esteemed by Princes but
according to the euents,He kindles the firebrands of warre. hee desired to make his to be allowed by
some fauorable occasion. He sees the Duke of Bourgondy busie in
war against them of Liege, he knowes how much the King is offended
at the practises and Intelligences which the Dukes of Normandy
and Brittaine had with his enemie, hee therefore Counsells him to
make warre against them, to make worke in their owne estates, and
to kindle a fire in their owne houses, to the end they should not
haue leisure to cast it against their Neighbours. These two Princes
in the beginning were great friends,Of great friends are made the greatest ennemies; hatred folowes and accompanies friendship. Chilon could him that vanted he had no enemies. That he should also haue noe friends. Plut.
                but as great hatred growes
from great friendship, they did so iarre in the diuision of the fruites
of the peace, as they continued not long together. The Duke of
Normandies seruants, who had serued King Charles the seauenth,
could not indure the Brittons for companions. The Duke of Brittaine
would bee respected as the instrument of their good fortune.
Seeing these two Princes could not remaine Neighbours, they
would neuer haue beene associated in the Empire.An admirable and sole example of trufriendship. Dioclesian and Maxim. Emperors entred the Empire together, commanded together, and lef

            The Duke of Normandy was aduertised that the Duke of Brittanie
had a designe not to leaue him, and that the Earle of Dammartin
vndertooke to lead him into Brittaine. Hee was then at
Mont St. Catherines attending vntill the preparation which they
made for his entry were finished, but when hee had sent notice
thereof to them of Rouen, they would not deferre his entry a minute.
They set him on horseback without a foot-cloth, and led him to

the Cathedrall Church in a black veluet gowne, where they sware
obedience vnto him, the Brittons were out of countenance to see
their designes made frustrate. The King made his profit of this bad
intelligence. He came into Normandy,Normandy yeelded to the King. and within few daies forced
his brother to depart. The Earle of Charrolois was much greeued
that this diuision had lost Normandy,Ruines caused by diuision are reparied by cō

Prouince being out of the Kings handes hee was weakned a third
part. Monsieur had no other refuge then Brittaine, being poore naked
and dispossest, which mooued them to pitty, that were too weak
to releeue him, and support him against a Brother who was so great
and mighty.
            The Earle of Charrolois was not long in suspence whether the
King would hold all that he had promised: for hauing sent Imbercourt
and Carondolet vnto him to put him in minde of the promise
of marriage of his daughter, they found that shee was promised to
Peter of Bourbon Lord of Beaujeu. The King told them that hee
would marrie her better cheape then the Earle of Charolois would
take her, and that Champagne and Brie, were too good to bee dismembred
from the Crowne.
            If men could iudge as truely as sodainly of all things, What
should remaine for the prouidence of God to decide? Euery man
thought that France would neuer escape this Apoplexie, which if
it did not bring death, would at the least end with a Palsey, but
her destinies were otherwise set downe in the eternall tables of the
great God, the father of time, the true Saturne

worshipped bare-headed, and knowes onely the periods and ends
of Estates. After the glorie, which belongs wholly to his bounty,
We must commend the Kings wisedome and iudgement, who remained
so staied in occasions, where as the coldest spirits would
haue been inflamed to runne vpon their enemies. He plaied Sertorius
against Metellus.
               
                  Metellus sought onely to fight. Sertorius refusing the Battel cut of his victuals, tooke his water frō him, & kept him from forrage. When he thought to march, he staied him, when he was lodged, he annoyed him in such sort as he forced him to dislodge, if he layed siege to any place, hee found himselfe besieged through want of victuals.
            
            France neuer saw so many men assembled to ruine her, but she
shewed that her foundations were good. The forces that were before
Paris were so great and so many as they might well be admired
both of friends and enemies: for it was an apparent demonstration
what this Crowne can doe against the conspiracie of all others.
Yet Paris did feele of this storme long after, and was so vnpeopled
by this warre, and by a plague which happened in August 1467. as
the king to repeople it drew strangers thither with great priuiledges,
as such as had been condemned by iustice,Vnpeopling of Paris. by the assurance of impunitie,
and all, as the Chronicle saith, according to the priuiledge
giuen to all banished men remaining in the Townes of St. Malo
and Valenciennes.
            The fidelitie of Paris saued the Estate, for if shee had refused entrie
vnto the king, he was resolued to retire into Suisser-land, or to
the Duke of Milan. It is true that as it happens alwaies in Ciuill

warresIn ciuill wars there are but to many occasions offred to be iealous of them of whose loyalty they sh

the religion of secrecie was not obserued, for the Princes were aduertised
of all the resolutions that were taken against them, yea of
the time and of the sally which should be made vpon their Armie in
three seuerall places; the first and the greatest towards Paris, the
second towards Pont Charanton, and the third by Bois de Vincennes.
Wherefore all this siege the king was euer in IealousieThey watch in vaine for the safety & defence of a Town besieged, if fidelitie sleepes at the gates, the gard must bee committed to them whose loialtie is well assured.
for that one night he found the Bastille gate open towards the
field. The Chronicle saith it was on Thursday the 29. of September.
He was conceited it had beene done by Charles of Melun,
but he made no shew of it. Wise Princes should not lightly
call in doubt two such deere and precious things, as the reputation
and loyaltie of their seruants.It is hard to repaire and recompence the iniuries done to faith and reputation. Famae et fidei damna maiora sunt quā quae estimariqueant. Tit. Liu. 
               Phil. de Commines saith notwithstanding
that the king had not a better seruant that yeere then this
Charles de Melun, and the Chronicle attributes to his care the honor
to haue saued Paris.
            The best blowes which were giuen at this siege were drawne
from his head, and from the wise resolution which he tooke, not
to haue any thought but to diuide the company, he had forces sufficient
to fight with all the Princes together without paine or perill,
they had not yet past their Apprentiship in warre. Onely the
Duke of Calabria knew something, hauing learned it vnfortunately
in the warre of Naples. The Earle of Charolois had in his
youth followed his Father in his Armies and Battels, but a long
peace had made him forget more then hee knew. As for the Duke
of Berry and Brittanie, the amazement wherein they were when
as the Canon played vppon their quarter, made it knowne that
warre was not their Element. The Historie hath obserued that after
the Armie had past the riuer of Seine, the Earle of Charolois
and the Duke of Calabria troubled themselues much to haue the
souldiers march in order, and represents them so well armed as
they seemed to haue a great desire to fight. But when it describes
the equipage of the Duke of Berry and Brittaine, it makes a right
Prosopopeia, seruing onely for the number and pompe. They did
ride, saith Phil. de Commin: vpon little nags at their ease, carrying for
the most part but little light Brigandins, yet some said they had nothing
but little gilt nayles vpon Sattin, that they might not weigh, yet I know
not the truth. He that goes to the warre without his Armes shewes
that he hath no desire to come neere blowes.

               PARIS was all in Feasts and Ioy for the happie
successe of the Kings affaires, who had so wisely
pacified the windes which threatened his ship
with shipwracke, but much more for the discharge
which he made of certaine souldiers and
impositions which the people found insupportable.
On Saturday the third of August 1465. the King remitted the fourth peny of the wine to the eight, & tooke away all impositions except of Marchā

these times, as curious to represent the order of Feasts that were
made, as that of Battels,

                as if the knowledge of the one gaue as
great proofe of sufficiencie as the other, reports the magnificence,
and addes that in the house of Iohn Dauuet the first President they
had made foure bathes (they were alwaies acknowledged among
the delights) for the Queene and for the Ladies. Her indisposition
and that of the time would not suffer her to bathe. One of the
bathes was for the Ladies of Bourbon and Sauoy, the other for the
Daughter of the Lord of Monglat, married to the sonne of Nicholas
Balue, brother to the Bishop of Eureux, and Perrete of Chalon
a Bourgesse of Paris. This woman is particularly named in diuers
places of the Historie, and here shee hath her share in the delights
and pleasures of the bathes.
            The Duke of Sauoy procured libertie for his Brother Philip,
whom the King married vnto Margarete the third Daughter of
Charles Duke of Bourbon, and of Agnes of Bourgundie, but the
content of his libertie was not of such force in his remembrance
as the distast of his imprisonment, the apprehension whereof made
him to follow the humors of Charles Duke of Bourgundy against

the King. Amé dyed three or foure yeares after in the Towne of
Orleans of a Flix.
                  Ame the third dyed at Orleans about the end of Iune 1471. he left 2. sonnes Philebert and Charles vnder the gouerment of the Lady Yoland of France, Sister to Lewis the eleuenth.
            
            But whilest that France enioyed this quiet, which the King had
purchased in dispersing these terrible windes, her auncient friends
felt the storme, and yet she had no meanes to relieue them, for that
she would not open the wound which began now to close vp, nor

Bruxells, to proclaime warre against the Earle of Charolois, and
threaten him with fire and bloud. In his absence the Duke receiued
and read the letters, and then deliuered them againe vnto the Herald,
saying, that his Sonne was in France, and that he should carrie
them vnto him if he list. Hee returned to Liege, from whence
he was presently dispatcht with the like letters against the Duke

at the end whereof they present themselues vnto the Duke

now to breake their intelligences. He sets such good gards vppon

and naked, was sufficiently punished with the Councels of his
youth. The Duke of Brittanie held himselfe too weake to support
him against so mightie a brother, the Deputies which he had sent

nothing back but that they saw much discontentment in the King

not be followed as a Decree, and that such as will contradict it
may doe it freely. The Marshall of Bourgundy and the Signior
of Contay, concluded to haue them put to death, grounding
their opinion vpon this reason, that so strange a reuolt should bee
extraordinarily reuenged, that these Mutyns were vnworthy of the
Princes Clemencie, and that the bonds whereby they contained
such wilde spirits in their duties, must be taken in the terror of punishments,

of the Earle of St Paul, and the Sigr of Imbercourt, who detested
this crueltie against the poore Bourgesses which had willingly sacrificed
themselues for the publike, perswaded the Duke to take
God of his side; this reason was sufficient, and words were superfluous
to oppose against it. But in these occasions, whereas all is
disputable, it is good that the Prince haue more then one or two

Besides there are many which doe not speake but after others.
            The mildest and most iust opinion was followed, and the
Hostages sent back to Liege, being aduised not to meddle in the
contagion of the infidelitie of others, and to tell them that if they

            In the meane time the Duke of Brittanie cryed out for succors.
The Duke of Bourgundy sent vnto the King to intreat him to cease
that warre, and to consider that the Duke of Brittanies cause was
his. The King to pay him with the same reason, sent him word that
if hee would leaue the protection of his brother and the Duke of
Brittanie, hee would abandon the Liegeois. The Constable of
St. Paul, and la Balue carried this message, to whom the Duke answered,
that he could not abandon his friends. Nor we ours, replied
the Constable, you choose not, but take all, you will neither haue vs
succour our friends, nor make warre against our enemies. Well, said the
Duke going to horse, the Liegeois are in field, I haue proclaimed warre

                  The Heraulds which proclaimed this war, carried in the right hand a naked sword, and in the other a flaming torch, a fearefull threat of fire & bloud against them with a naked sword and a flaming torch, I will fight

                the Leigois beeing 30000. came
to succour the besieged, and lodge in a great Village enuironed

recouered courage, charged them with their pikes, and in an
instant slew fiue hundred, and made the rest to wauer betwixt

to meete him, presenting vnto him the seuenty two Banners of

the death of Duke Philip, and which had beene formerly taken

Aldermen they had the election of two and twentie, and the

Kings Embassadors came thither vnto him, to intreat him not to
meddle with the affaires of Brittanie nor Normandie: winter was
spend in these conferences, but the King not able to temporize any
longer, nor to giue time vnto his enemies to ioyne together, enters
into Brittany, and takes Chantoce, with Ancenis. The Duke

of Bourgundy aduanced to S. Quentin to succour his Allies.Treatie of the Duke of Berrie and Brittanie. The
King held them so short as he made them resolue to treat with him,
and laying aside their interest,It is certaine there is not any one of whome we may not obtaine what wee desire, if he bee not thereby interessed howsoeuer the publike be interessed. he drawes from them a renonciation
of all Alliance with the Duke of Bourgundy. Hee would not
haue it said that he was armed to doe nothing, for one enemie hee
makes three. He was wonderfully incensed against the King, who
alwaies prepared him such bankets, and was discontented with
the Dukes of Normandie and Brittanie, who had made an accord
without him, terming them faint-hearted and without iudgement.
The King made him cease his Armes for sixscore thousand crownes
which he gaue him, the which he did accept the more willingly, for
that hee desired to enioy in quiet the first contents of his marriage
with the Lady Margaret
               
                  Margaret Daughter to Rich: of York & Sister to the K. of England was married to Duke Charles in Iuly 1468. Shee made her entry into Bruges beeing conducted by six Knights, Adolphe of Cleues, Iames of Luxemburg, Anthony Bastard of Bourgundy, Peter of Baufremont Earle of Charny, Philip Pot and Philip of Creuecoeur. of Yorke Sister to King Edward, who was
come to Bruges.
            The King sent Cardinal Balue and Taneguy of Chastell vnto him,
to haue his consent vnto an interuiew, thinking that if hee might
speake with him, hee would wholly draw him from the Protection
of the D. of Brittanie, with whom he was discontented, and would
not regard that of the Duke of Normandie which was more hurtfull
then profitable vnto him.
            The Duke tooke no taste in this enteruiew, beeing (as he said)
well aduertised that the King had sent his Embassadors to them of
Liege to sollicite them to a new reuolt, Balue and du Chastell let
the Duke vnderstand that the Liegeois had been so handled the last
yeare, as it was incredible they would fall into the like miseries,
and if they had any such desire, this enteruiew of the two Princes
would make them desist. Which reason made the Duke consent to
receiue the King at Peronne. As soone as Cardinall Balue and du
Chastell had acquainted the King with the Dukes resolution, hee
set forward to meete him, and parted from Noion vppon a letter
which the Duke wrote vnto him with his owne hand, for the assurance
of his comming,Error which the K. could not repaire but with danger. stay and returne. An error which was
seconded with many errors,In errors of importance the first step disorders all. It is more easie not to enter then to get forth. One error followes an other, and that of iudgemēt brings that of the heart. and an error of an ill setled iudgement,
and one of the most remarkable of the life and conduct of
this Prince. He went to se a Prince whom he had newly offended,
what could hee hope for but to see himselfe forced to repayre this
wrong? He had sent men to Liege to make it reuolt, hee should
haue giuen ouer this practise, and consider that if it did succeed,
Peronne should bee an infallible prison to him, from whence hee
should neuer be freed vntill he had done reason vnto the Duke, to
the blemish of his courage and honor.It is a dishonour to bee forced to disauow his own thoghts and intentions. The K. had sent men to trouble the D. at Liege, hee had done it through indiscretion, now he is forced to pacifie it, and to stay the busines more then hee thought to aduance it.
            
            If this consideration were not able to stay his voyage, yet it
should haue bound him to seeke for other assurances then in words
and paper;Two errors the K. committed in the assurance of his person. and remember that he himselfe had not much regarded
that which hee had promised at Constans, that they might yeeld
him the like measure, and that there is nothing so light as an oath,
when as the breach thereof presents some priuate commoditie.
The desire of profit, of reuēge or pleasure, is the ram which ouerthrowes an oth. Neither of the three doth moderate the paine. The diuine is vndoubted misery to periures, and that of the world is shame. Moreouer hee had no child, and committed his life vnto a Prince,

whose Ambition would haue confounded heauen and earth to
raigne, hee gaue it in guard to him who would ruine his estate,
holding it more commendable to be rash then a coward.The rashnet of a priuat man may be excused when it hath no traine: The life of Sparta depends not vpon that of Calicratidas, but that of a prince which is the spirit that giues life and motion to an estate, is alwaies blamed
            
            It is the second error which he committed in the conduct of his
owne safety for hee had trusted the Princes that were in league
against him,He comes to Peronne to the Duke comming to parle with them at Bois de Vincennes,
who desired to seaze vpon the royall authoritie, and to gouerne
France at their owne pleasures. Hee went thither without any

to bee prepared for him. Presently after arriued the Bishop of
Geneua, the Earle of Bresse, the Earle of Romont, all three brethren

                  ll from the Marshall of Bourgundy. The King being aduertised hereof grew very distrustfull,
and had his thoughts troubled and confounded with repentance,
There is not any thing more vnworthy wherinto a Prince may fall then repentance, especially in errors which may not bee twice committed. for that he had not better considered of his voiage. He sent to intreat
the Duke to lodge him in the Castle, for that all these Noble
men that were come did not conceale it that they were his enemies.
The Duke was glad that the King had made choise of the
lodging which he durst not haue giuen him,He is lodged in the Castle. and intreated him not
to doubt any thing.

in regard of the Duke. But Monsieurs condition grew better,
for in exchange of the Duchie of Normandie he had. Champagne
and Bry with all the rights, and the Duke of Brittaine entred into
the Treatie as an Allie.
            Matters standing vppon these termes, newes came vnto the
Duke that the Kings Embassadors had made them of Liege reuolt,
The Leigeois in this reuolt made more hast then the King expected, for his designes were not yet well digested, and he held them not so able. that they had seazed vpon the Towne of Tongres, imprisosoned
their Bishop, Cousin germaine to the Duke, and slaine fifteene
or sixteene of his Chanons and seruants. The Duke caused
the gates of the Town and Castle to be shut, fayning that some
one had taken a Casket of Iewels: he fortified his guards about
the Castle, and told some of his trustie seruants that the King was
come thither to deceiue and betray him.The K. in a manner a prisoner. Hee was so transported

                   caused Charles the simple to dye in prison. King Lewis his sonne to reuenge this iniury called an assembly of the Princes and chiefe noblemen, and propounded this question which he seemed to receiue from the K. of England, to haue his aduice: What punishment that farmer descrued who hauing inuited his maister to come vnto his house had put him to death. All concluded that the crime was punishable, and Hubert said that hee ought to be hanged, You shall bee (said the King) you haue condemned your selfe. And hee had noe sooner spokē the word but hee was hanged. the simple being lodged
at the foot of the Tower where he had beene imprisoned. He made
some offer to pacifie the Duke, and to giue hostage to procure
such satisfaction from the Liegeois as was fit.
            He had friends in the Dukes Councell,The aduice of that which was done in the D. counsell, came as it was said from Phil. de Commines.
                and casting twelue or
fifteene thousand Crownes among them,And he himselfe writes after this manner. The King had some friend which aduertised him that he should haue no harme if he did yeeld vnto those two points, but if he did otherwise, hee thrust himselfe into very great danger.
                he was by that meanes
aduertised of the Resolutions which were taken: wherof the mildest
and most moderate were not pleasing vnto him. The first opinion
was that they should keep promise with him, so as he would declare
himselfe an enemy to them of Liege. The second that being offended
as he was, it was dangerous to giue him liberty, to reuenge
himselfe, The third that they should send for the Duke his brother,
and the other Princes to consult what was to be done. In the end
they past by this straight, that he was constrained (and it is the
greatest violence that may be done vnto a King) to consent vnto a
a warre against them of Liege, who had relyed vppon his protection.
            The Duke continued three dayes in great alterations, and past
the third night in such disquietnes as he did not vncloath himselfe,
but lay downe vppon his bed, then rising sodainly he would walke
and talke to Phillip de Commines, his Chamberlaine, whose integrity
and moderation did serue to calme those violent stormes that
troubled his soule. He was wholly French,
                  Philip de Commines became a Partisan to the King, who drew him into France, gaue him the signory of Argenton in Poictou, and the Seneshalship of the same Country. and from that time
some thought he resolued to retire himselfe into France. But it is not
credible that there was any trechery in him. The vptightnes and
sincerity of his writings frees him from suspition. If he had been blemished
with infidelity & ingratitude, vices which dissolue al humane
society,All the greatest reproches are comprehended in these two wordes, Ingrate and trecherous. Nihil aeque Concordiam humani generis dissociat et distrahit quam hoc ingratitudinis vitium. Sen. the King had not trusted him with so many great and important
affaires.
            The Duke went early in the morning vnto the Castell to the King
who was already aduertised of what he would say vnto him, and had
time to thinke of his answer, and to fit it not so much vnto reason as
to necessity,Amazement should neuer bee seene on a Princes forehead. He should be maister of his wordes, but much more of his countenance, for his lookes do often contradict them, and betray the secrets of the heart. and aboue all to carry so euen a countenance, as the
Duke should not discouer that he had any ill game, or that he had any
apprehension to loose, for if he had thought that hee had made
him affraid, he would haue done him a mischeefeMany times a bad designe begun is not ended; when as he that doth it thinkes that he is not discouered. And it is a maxime grounded more vpon experience then Conscience in such occasions, not to do so much, or to do more. all together.

and la Roche. He could not by the humility of his wordes, so well

dissemble his proud and threatning gesture,The Duke coniures the King to go to Liege but the trembling of his

hold the treaty and come to Liege, to help to reuenge him and the
Bishop of Liege his kinsman of the Liegeois who by reason of his
comming were reuolted. The King granted it, the Peace was sworne
vppon Charlemaignes crosse, and the whole towne was full of ioy
for this accord: the 12. of October 1468.1468. 
               Oliuer de la March reports
this otherwise then Phillip de Commines. The King (saith he) was
not well assured, but as soone as he saw the Duke enter into his Chamber,
he could not conceale his feare, but said vnto the Duke Brother, I am not
safe in your house, and in your Country; and the Duke answered, yes sir,
and so safe, as if I should set an arrow come towards you, I would put
my self

                   before you to preserue you. And the King said vnto him, I thank
you, for your good will, and will goe where I haue promised you, but I
pray you let the peace be presently sworne, betwixt vs. Then they brought
the Arme of St. Leu, and the King of France sware the peace betwixt him
and the Duke of Bourgondy and the Duke of Bourgondy sware the said
peace, and promised to keepe and entertaine it with and against all men.

the Contry of Liege in the beginning of winter. The King had no
forces but his scottish garde, and 300. men at armes. The Duke held
a Counsell in the sight of Liege, what he should do. Some were of
opinion that he should send back part of his Army, for his forces
were too great against a demantled towne, which could not be releeued,
seing the King was with him. He gaue no credit to this Counsell

            The Duke commanded the Marshall of Bourgondy who led the
foreward,Siege of Liege. to lodge with in the Citty, either with their wills or by
force. The Pope had a Nuncio within the Citty, to end the Controuersies
which were in a manner perpetuall betwixt the Bishop and
the people, who changing his power and forgetting his duty, vppon
a designe to haue this Bishoprick, exhorted the inhabitants to
defend themselues, and caused them to make a sally with such fury,
as they that were without had no hope to enter but victors.

Sally was so vnfortunate, as he repented him of his Councell, and
apprehending the danger, gets out of the towne and flies away, but
he was stayed by the Dukes men, who promised to them that had
taken him to make their profit, vsing no speech to him. But whilst
they contended for their shares in his ransome, they came vnto the

               In sallies the Commander should alwaies stand firme to maintaine the besieged in their duties by his presence, and to fauour their retreat, hauing a care that being repulst the enemy doth not enter pel mel with them. When as they of Liege had lost their head in the first sally, their defence was desperate. the sole Commander
of the people was hurt and slaine. The suburb was kept by the
Marshall of Bourgondy, who had committed a grosse error, hauing
giuen no better order for his lodgingThe first duty of a good Captaine is to know how to lodge his men. For this only respect Hanibal in the iudgement of Phirrhus, was the first Captaine of Greece next to Alexander.

of a good Captaine. The Prince of Orange was hurt there, and
in this action the History giues him the glorious surname of a man
of vertue, as it commends the valour of the Lordes of Lau and Vrfe,
and reprocheth the contempt of honor to aboue two thousand
men, who vnder fauour of this night had sacrifized their safeties and
honors to flight.
            This first defeat aflicted the Duke, and hee would not that the
King should haue knowne it, if he could haue concealed it amidst
so many passions and diuers Interests.The Dukes troupes ill intreated in the suburbs. Beleeuing that the brute was
greater then the losse, he went himselfe to tell it him. The King was
very glad, but this ioy was more grounded vppon discretion then
iustice, for if the Dukes designes had not prospered, the King had
had cause to repent him, and therefore he did apply his spirit to the
motions of the Dukes, approuing that it is a hard seruitude for a
great man to force himselfe to the humors of his inferiour.
            He was aduised to goe and refresh his foreward, plunged in the
mire, besieged with hunger and benummed with cold. The Duke
sent 300. horse with some victualls to refresh them that were ready
to faint,A famished soldier hath neither courage nor force to fight. It was a great negligence in the Dukes Captaines to haue ingaged the soldiers so neere the enemy, and not prouide to make them eat. Asdruball lost his men against Scipio by this defect.

            This first night about midnight there was a hot alarme although
it were in the heart of a very sharp winter. The King shewed himselfe
vnto the Towne as soone as the Duke,Alarum giuen and the King goes to horse. and they were amazed
at his diligence, the name of King and his presence put the Duke
out of countenance.The Duke saith Phil. de Commines, held not soe good a countenance, as many men wisht, for that the King was present & tooke the word and authority of Command. The Adamant hath no vertue neer vnto the

resolue to incounter and meet with Death, to fell their liues as
deere as they could, and to surprise the two Princes in their owne

all doubt, saith Phil. de Commines, if they had not stayed in these
two places, but had followed those two posts which were their guides,
they had slaine the King and the Duke of Bourgundy, and defeated
the rest of the Armie.

            About eight of the clocke on Sunday morning being the 30.
of October 1468. the signe for the assault was giuen the inhabitants
hauing no thought that they would trouble their rest on Sunday,
The Earle of Montfort, who was caled Iohn the valiant, D. of Brittany, sent to intreate the Earle of Blois his enenmy, to referre the Battel which hee ment to giue him, vntil the next day, for that it was Sunday, & St. Michels feast, and it was one of those dayes, on the which the Countesse of Blois his wife had forbidden him to fight, but the Earle of Blois would not beleeue any of them, and was slain there. This hapened in the yeare 1364. (a day by the scrupulous of that time held vnfortunate to
fight in) and moreouer much tired, for that euery day they had
beene in gard, and now they were gone to dinner. They were
surprised without any resistance, euery man sauing himselfe either
in the Forrest of Ardennes, or in Churches, he that escaped the
fury of the sword, fell into that of cold and hunger, and all tryed

                men keep the Citie if God take not the care.
            The Duke being master of the Citie came and conducted the
King vnto the Pallace. This prince fitting his words vnto the time
and to the Dukes humors, commended his victorie, and spake to
all that past of the Dukes valour and good conduct, who tooke
a wonderfull delight to haue a King for a Panegyrist. The Towne
was reduced to that estate as it might serue to posteritie for an example
not of conseruation,Ruine and desolation of the Liegeois but of extreame miserie. The gates
and walles were ouerthrowne, the ditches filled vp, the priuiledges
reuoked, the lawes changed, and all the Churches (except the
Cathedrall) spoiled. The Duke caused it to bee kept by some of
his houshold, against the souldiers, who sought to force the two
doores. A strange thing to see churchesSeeing that God ought to be feared and worshipped in all places, that which belongs vnto his seruice should also hee religiously respected euen in the Armies. Zenophon saith, that Agesylaus would not allow them to touch any Temples in the enemies country. in daunger among
Christians, whose impieties are such as euen the most Barbarous
Nations doe abhorre them, for they haue alwaies respected holy
places, but it was so peruerse and corrupted an age, as there were
men without soules, and soules without religion.
            The Duke not able to restraine this furie slew a souldiour to
make the rest dislodge, all was reduced to a vast and fearefull wildernes.
The Duke repented himselfe of the cruelties which had
been committed in the furie of the Sacke, and offered for an expiation
the St. George wherewith St. Lamberts church in Liege is
at this day adorned. The King, fiue daies after the desolation of a
countrey which relyed vpon the succors of his power, and which
stumbled into seruitude, for it could not goe straight in libertie,
Liberty is to be desired, when as they that will not be subiect to haue meanes to liue free, but as Plato saith Epist. 8. Many haue fallen into seruitude, for that they could not vse their libertie vvell.
                tooke leaue of the Duke, and told him, that if he had any more
cause to vse him that he should not spare him, but if all were done,
he desired to goe to Paris to haue their Treatie verified, yet hoping
to meet againe the next Summer in Bourgundy. I will said he,The King desires to returne to Paris.

               Princes as all other men are by nature subiect to passions and alterations, and not able to endure the toyle of the body and minde long without tiring, and haue need of some rest and recreation. It is that which K. Lewis the eleuenth in this place cals good cheere. The forme and
manner of his words did much help the matter, for he deliuered
them with an open countenance, and a heart which seemed free,

which did binde the Duke to please him. An Act of incomparable
wisedome, to fit his words and actions for the necessitie of the
time and place wherein he was, and humilitie in these actions doth
no wrong vnto a great Prince,Humilitie abates nothing of a princes greatnes, for either hee that humbles himselfe is inferior, and then it becomes him well, or superior but brought to such a straight, as he is forced to bēd & if he escapes, he greeues not at his humility, although that doe him good who hath intreated him with pride and arrogancy. which knoweth there is no other
meanes to continue with spirits that are insolent of their fortunes,
but dissembling.
            The Duke also knowing the humor of this Prince, murmured
still,Treatie made without liberty bindes not. & made his distrust knowne, he did consider that bonds of promises
made by men which cannot say they are in libertie are light,
that force hath no power to prescribe a force sufficiently noted
in the solemne words of the oath wherevnto they desired the King
should consent, that in case of contrauention to the Treatie, all
his subiects should retire from his obedience, and adhere to the
Earle of Charolois. And therefore he would that before the kings
departure, their Treatie should be read and read againe, and all the
points expoundedIn Treaties of peace they must vnderstand one an other well. Al words must be made plaine, and those that are comprehended or excluded expressed. and that vpon all hee declared his intention.
Aduise my Lord if there bee any thing whereof you repent,A breach in the obseruation of forced promises is not dishonorable, and hee wants force that obserues them. it is at
your choise to doe it or leaue it. I desire to adde one Article in fauour of
the Lords of Lau, Vrfet, and Poncet of Riuiere, that they may bee restostored
to their lands and offices, I am content, replyed the King, so as
the Earle of Neuers and the Lord of Croui may bee also restored. The
Duke, who bare a deadly hatred to these two, spake no more of the
rest, and the King declared that he would obserue the Treatie.In Treaties which are made by equals impertinent demands are choked with the like demands.
            
            Hee had so great a desire to be farre off, as to make no stay of
his departure, he made no show of discontent. Hee concealed his
griefe so cunningly as it was impossible to iudge that hee felt any.

had drawne him to the warre of Liege.Excuses of the Duke. He had need of very artificiall pouldersWords of excuse and complements in actions which cā

be circumcised and change their names, George was called Scanderbeg,
that is to say Alexander Lord: and as Alexander he began
betimes to make such proofes of his valour
                  Scanderbeg was instructed in all the exercises of war before the force of his body could shew what his courage was. He also learned the Turkish, Sclamonian, Arabiā, Greeke & Italian tongues. as euery man thoght
that his militarie toyles, would make him worthy of that name,
that he would end more Battels in effect then the Princes of his
time had seene painted,When Cicero spake of Pō
                     pey, he said that he had brought more battels to a happy end, thē others had read in Histories, & conquered more Prouinces then any one before him had conceiued in his wishes, that hee had triumphed almost as many times, as he had followed the warre yeares. that he would winne more victories then
others had encountred dangers. He was Sangiac, the first dignitie
next vnto a Basha, then was he sent into diuers expeditions, and
knowne to be the sole authour of all the good successe which happened
in Greece, Asia, and Hungarie, there being nothing in the
Art of warre, but in the end came to his knowledge.
            But this great valour had almost vndone him. Amurath apprehended
it to haue such a Prince neere him; and the enemies
of his courage, but more of his hopes, said that he nourisht a domestick
enemie, to weaken his intentions, and disappoint his intelligences.
He put his Brethren to death, beeing resolued to make
him runne the like fortune, if he had not made it knowne by his cariage
that he had no other thought nor passion but that of his seruice,
and that his FatherAfter the death of Iohn father to Scanderbeg, Amurath seazed vpon the Realme of Epirus, and put a garrison into Croy. Scanderbeg dissembled the griefe of his fathers death, the taking of his estate & the murther of his Brethren & so from that time he resolued to pull that Crowne from Amurath.
                and his Brethren did reuiue in the affection
which he bare vnto him.
                  Amurath puts Scanderbegs brethren to death. And when as Amurath, to sound
him, had offered him the crowne of Albania, he said, that he preferred
the honour of his seruice, before all the Scepters and Empires of
the world, and that he felt his hand fitter for a sword, then his head
for a Crowne.
            This answere pleased Amurath,
               He grovves fearfull of his valour. but it freed him not from all
his feares which the greatnes of his spirit imprinted in his soule,

admirable then imitable. Wherefore hauing resolued to make

quit Amurath,
               
                  Scāderbegs retreat was in the year 1444. hee conferred with Huniades of his enterprise that vnder a coulour of making warre against him hee might retire on his side. whereupon hee ioined with Huniades Prince of
Transiluania,He ioynes with Iohn Huniades.
                and with him defeates the Basha of Romania, who
had fourescore thousand men: he caused his Secretarie to be taken,
and setting a dagger to his throat, forced him to write letters
to the Gouernor of Croy, carrying a commandement in Amuraths
name to consigne the place vnto him.

                  Iohn Despote of Transiluania, otherwise called Huniades, being discōtented with the King of Hungary, for that certaine places in Seruiae which had bin granted him in reward of his vertue were detained from him, refused passage to Scā

it brake a peace solemnely sworne with Amurath.
               Battell of Varna. It was decided in
the valley of Varna on the limits of Misia, or Segoria, vppon the
Euxin Sea within foure dayes iourney of Andrynopolis, to the dishonour
of the Christians, who were put to flight, but the triumph
cost Amurath so many men as his ioy was turned to repentance.
            If hee made some triumph, Scanderbeg reapt the profit,
for seeing that hee had retired his forces, hee went to field,
These say that Amurath hauing escaped this danger grew more sad then he had been accustomed and being blamed by his followers he answered, I would not win after this manner. Amurath caused a pillar to be set whereas the Battell was giuen, with an inscription of the victory, and at this day the heapes of dead mens bones are to bee seene, which shew that the slaughter had been wonderfull. and made such sharpe warres as the Turke wrote vnto him, rather
to stay his exploites, then to threaten him with reuenge,

that hee should yeeld vp all the other Townes of Albania and

These letters were receiued with that contempt they deserued.
The letters beginne after this manner, Amurath and Ottoman Soueraigne of the Turks and Emperour of the East, sends no salutations to Scanderbeg his ingrateful nurschild. He saith that he knowes not what wordes to vse to him for that hee doth not merit any good for his ingratitude, and a rough & sharp speech would make his arrogant nature more insolent. 
               Scanderbeg thinking that Amuraths feare who grew old, and broken,
had made him to write them, hauing a desire to leaue his Empire

                yet he made him an answer, and after that hee
had told him that he should remember the good which he had receiued
from him, if the numbring did not renew the remembrance
of a greater number of ills he concluded with these wordes. Such

with Mahomet his sonne to besiege Croy.
            After that his Artillery was cast, the Towne battered, many assaults
giuen & maintained, and the ruines of the Assaylants blowne
vp and laid open, Amurath, tired with the tediousnesse of the siege,
offers to retire and to leaue Albania vnto Scanderbeg, with the title
of a Realme, so as he would do him homage and pay tibute, Scanderbeg,

as hee was more powerfullCato reduced to that extremity in Vtica as his friendes aduised him to make an Accord with Caesar. It is for them, said he, to sue that are vanquished, as for me, I will hold my selfe inuinsible, as long as I am stronger in right then Caesar.
                then hee in the iustice of his armes,
found these offers so contrary to the honour of his religion, as he reiected
them couragiously, saying that hee would neuer indure that
the name of an Albanois should be defamed with such a blemish,
no not if Amurath would giue him halfe his Empire.Death of Amurath before Croy. This answer
with the little likelihood there was to vanquish the obstinacy of the
besieged, did so aflict Amurath as he dyed, complaining of his hard
fortuneAmong the precepts, which be left to Mahomet his sonne, he did often reitterate these wordes with aboundance of teares. That he should neuer contemne an enemy not knowing any thing in all his life whereof he did repent him, and should repent in the other world, but that he had contemned Scandebeg.
                that after he had giuen subiect to all the world to speake
of his triumphes against the Grecians and Hungarians, hee saw

the number of the dead or prisoners, for Scanderbeg hauing
taken the Generall prisoner,
                  They say that Scanderbeg had it in particular in all his incounters and military actions, alwaies to begin his first stratagems of victory with the death of the head, saing, That the head should be first cut off, and the rest of the body will fall alone, and that he knew no kind of liuing creature, that could suruiue the head beeing taken off. a maxime which hee held for the first
of military stratagems,

            He attempted the siege of Sfetigarde, and after that of Belgrad, the
one and other expedition brought him no profit but repentance,
and notwithstanding that he had the worst, yet he sold Mahomet his
victory so deere as he was forced to say that his Army had nothing
but the name of triumph.Constantinople taken He turned his forces towards Constantinople
where he made the victory horrible, by all kindes of Brutish
and barbarous inhumanities, which caused the most stayed and

            The Conquest of Constantinople made him resolue to ruine Epirus,

and to auoid the Turkish seruitude. Mahomet sent Baillaban, to
whom he promised the Crowne of Epirus,A pittifull atteration of things, to see a Prince who had lately come into Europe with a mighty army, and had refused a short truce unto the Emperor of the Turkes to be now forced in his old yeares to abandon his Country, and to goe farre to see

            He made foure voyages and was as often beaten, the number
giuing place to valour.
                  Scanderbeg demands succors of the Pope. But in the end Scanderbeg seeing that Croy
could not hold any longer against so mighty an enemy, and that
Albania was all couered with troupes of Infidels, he went away in
a disguised habit to demand succors of the Pope.
            
               Paul the second had no great pitty to see these sad and mournefull
relickes of so many Princes, and of so many heads of Macedon
and of all Greece, nor of the common necessity, and eminent perill
of Christendome. The Venetians apprehended it more sencibly,
and gaue some succours to Scanderberg, with the which and that
which he drew from his Allies of Epyrus, Macedonie, Sclauonia,
and Dalmatia, which might make about 13000. and foure hundred
good men, he returned into Albania and freed Croy, before which
Baillaban was slaine.

and Hedert the Brother and Nephew of Baillaban, this representing
vnto him the cruelties which they had committed vppon his
subiects, put him into such choller, as hauing not the patience to
attend any other hand, he cut them both asunder by the wast at one
blow. He punished them with the like paine that their Prince did
punish Christians.
                  Mahomet made one man die as it were of two deathes, he made them to be cut off by the wast at a blow, of tentimes it happened that hee dyed of two deathes, for Chalcondile saith, you might see either part liue long after the blow.
            
            During the Truce he had with Mahomet, he sent him this Cymeterre
for that he desired to see it, hauing heard say that with it
he cut any armes asunder. The strongest armes of his Country
would trye if it were true, and finding not the vertue which was ascribed
vnto it, he sent it back againe disdainefully, thanking him
for a thing which he held to haue beene better. Scanderbeg answered.
The vertue of my sword depends of mine owne arme, which I cannot
send him, for that I reserue it against mine enemies.
            
            It was an increase of glory and reputation to the common weale
of Venice to see Kings and Realmes vnder their charge. But at that
time they did an act of prouidenceProuidence is one of the most apparant effect, of wisdome. Prudents postumus dicere prouidentes.
                which shewes that wisedome
hath long held the helme of that Estate. They did adopt for daughter
of the common-weale the heyre of Marc Cornare, and married
her to the King of Cypres, after whose death and of the after-birth
his sonne, she was acknowledged for Queene, and made present of

her Crowne vnto the Venetians, her fathers by adoption.
            From this action followed two diuers effects, the one of great ioy
to the Venetians, the other of extreame afliction to Charlotte of Sauoy
the French Queene, who by this act saw her Brother as it were
exiled from Cipres, and seperated from the Queene his wife. The
History is long and tragicall, but thus in breefe.
            By the like accidents that other realmes haue beene made desolate,
the Crowne of Cipres fell from the house of Lusignan,
                  Iames of Lusignam King of Cypres put Peter his brother to death, and being told him that the Genouois were entred into his Pallace with armes, & had some designe vpon his person hee put many innocent Marchants to death a cruelty which made the Signory of Genoua to arme against him. Bolius writes the History at large. in the
which it had long remained. A Fratricide was the cause, for Iames
of Lusignan hauing put his brother to death to raigne alone, added
other violences to this cruelty, which made him odious to the people,
and forced the Genouois to arme against him,Cruelty makes the Princes of Lusignan odious. to reuenge an iniury
done vnto certaine Marchants of their Common-weale. Hee
was dispossest of the Crowne, his brothers Children restored to the
Realme, and he himselfe carried prisoner to Genoua, where he had
one sonne who was King of Cipres,King Iames of Lusignan had one sonne named Iohn or Iames who was K. of Cypres, and Anne married to Lewis Duke of Sauoy, sonne to Amidee, Iohn had one daughter named Charlotte, who was first married to Iohn King of Portugall, and after his death to Lewis of Sauoy. and this sonne one daughter,
whom he left sole heire to the Crowne. She was married to
Lewis of Sauoy, sonne to Lewis Duke of Sauoy, and to Anne of
Cypres Sister to King Iohn.
            
            
               Lewis imbarked at Venice to passe into Cipres, to take possession
of his wife and Realme. Iames base sonne to King Iohn, Bishop of
Nicosia, past into Egipt to haue succours from the Soldan of Egipt
who made him to be proclaimed King of Cypres,Letters of the Souldā to the King of Cipres. prepared a great

away thy wife, I am content, vpon condition that thou dost not attend
a second Summons. This barbarous letter deserued no other answer
but by the sword,Perswasions are vnprofitable when as Iustice is inferiour to force. but Iustice being forced to yeeld vnto tirrany,
King Lewis by the meanes of the great maister of Rhodes, let him
vnderstand that by the Christian lawes the Realme did be long vnto
the lawful daughter, that the Bastard was excluded, and that they
pretended not to change any thing of the rights which he had ouer
the Crowne of Cypres as Protector.After that the Christians affaires were ruined in Soria and the East, the Kings of Cypres of the house of Lusignan put themselues vnder the protection of the Souldiers of Egypt. This reason had pacified
him, being resolued to quit the Protection of the Bastard. But Mahomet
sent him word, that it was a thing worthy of his greatnes,
and profitable to their common religion to restore this Prince
to his Estates, exhorting him to remember the iniuries which they
of that Nation, and those of Lewis his house had done vnto the Mahometans,
protesting that if hee had a desire to haue peace with
Christians, he should be sure to haue warre with him.
            The assistance which the Souldan of Egypt gaue vnto the Bastard,
was the cause that he was presently acknowledged by them
who could not oppose against his power. He cōmanded ouer their
bodies more then their hearts, which being full of feare, were also

so of wishes and desires of his death who made them feare.Feare is a bad gard for them that command. For they that feare studie still how they may be rid of him that keepes them in feare, Quem metuunt oderunt, quē quisque odiit periisque expedit
                
               Lewis
was forced to quit the field, and to retyre himselfe into the Castle
of Cerines, where he was besieged by the Bastard, who seeing
it impossible to take this place, and that all the Princes of Christendome
were offended at this vsurpation, he sent his Embassadors

him to hold him in the ranke of Catholike Kings. The Pope would
not see them, but sent them away with bitter words.
            Hereupon Lewis saw himselfe forced to retire to the Duke
his Father,King and Queene of Cypres driuen out of their owne Realme. and the Queene Charlotte to Rome to seeke succors,
but the diuisions of Italy hindred that which they desired, and
stayed her there during the time of Pius the second; of Paul

of Cypres, for that his father had failed of his promise at the assembly
at Mantoua for the holy warre, and that the same Lewis his
Sonne being then neere vnto Mantoua, and hauing not vouchsafed
to see him, and demand his blessing; hee had saied by prediction
vnto the Embassadors of Sauoy, that it would happen his
Sonne would loose the Realme of Cypres, for a punishment of
that the father did, and that one day hee would demand those succors
in vaine from others, which his father had denied vnto the
Church. The Bastard seeing himselfe in quiet possession of the
Crowne of Cypres, remembred that Marc Cornaro, a Gentleman
of Venice, had assisted him in his necessitie, with ships,Good deedes neuer dye in great courages, others forget the good & remember the ill. Quid autem est eo miserius, cui beneficia excidunt, herēt iniuriae. Sen.

of Egypt, hee resolued to marry his Daughter named Catherine,
whom the Senate of Venice after the death of Marc
Cornaro her Father, had adopted as their Daughter. The mariage
was treated with the consent of the Siegneurie, who gaue
her a great dowrie: this marriage was made in the yeare 1466.
            
               Iames King of Cypres fell sicke of a bloudy Flix,, and seeing
that his cure was desperate, hee had not the trouble which great
Princes as well as priuate men haue when they die, to know to
whom hee should recommend his realme, hauing the Senate of
Venice wholly at his deuotion, but it troubled him what his successor
should be, which was yet in the mothers wombe.Princes haue no lesse need then mean persons of strong consolations, to help them to depart the world, & to leaue their affaires in some safety. 
               Mocenigo
assured him that neither the Venetians forces nor his priuate seruice
should neuer faile him. After his death Charlotte demanded
succors of the Venetians, the Duke answered that the Siegneurie
was bound to defend her who was her adopted Daughter, and
that King Iames had instituted her heyre with the fruit in her
womb: That moreouer he wondred that she vnderstood not that
rights of Realmes were debated rather by Armes then by Lawes,
In former times whē they haue demanded of conquerors of Prouinces, the titles of their Cōquests, some haue shewed them their Canons, and others their swords. and that the Realme of Cypres had not been solely to her, but
also to the Geneuois, who at that time held a great part.
            The widdow of King Iames was presently troubled with new
Combustions within the Realme. A Bishop of the house of the

Gotholans,Tumults in Cypres. who had great authoritie and credit in the Iland, being
Embassador to Ferdinand King of Naples; when as King
Iames dyed, propounded to marry the Bastard of the deceased
King of Cypres. Many were of his partie, but the wiser sort
were contented to passe these rockes with open eyes and deafeeares.

The Generall of the Venetians Armie beeing aduertised of their
practises, and what they intended, caused them to bee stayed, and
sent them presently to Venice.
                  Tristan fearing some more shameful death poisoned himself with a Diamond which he swalowed drinking salt water after it.
            
            
               George Cornaro, Brother to the Queene was sent into Cypresi,
to assist his Sister and to dispose her to free her selfe from troubles
and the Realme from danger, in retiring her selfe to Venice,
and leauing the Crowne to the Gouernment of the Siegneurie.
She who had beene bred vp after a royall manner;Queene of Cypres exhorted by her brother to goe to Venice. and who knew
the great difference that was betwixt a Venetians life and that of a
Soueraigne Princesse found this proposition very strange, and the
Venetians ambition vniust to desire to haue Kings and Realmes vnder
their protectionThe highest degree of greatnes and glorie whereunto a popular or an Aristrocraticall Estate may come vnto, is to haue Kings vnder their Dominátion. The Romans did not disposses Kings of the Realmes they had conquered, & Tacitus giues the reason, v thaberent instrumenta Seruitutis & Reges.
               . But when her Brother let her vnderstand
that if the Siegneurie of Venice did abandon her protection, as
it might doe if shee did not follow her Councels, shee was in danger
to become a prey vnto the Turke, and to serue as a triumph
and spectacle to the people of Constantinople: That shee should
not relye vpon Christian Princes, who would all loue the Iland and
the Realme rather then her selfe, and she should beleeue that they,
courting her Crowne rather then her fayre eyes, she were to blame
if she did not preferre a quiet life and safe abode before an vncertaine
Royaltie, an assured rest before honor, which was but winde,
and a title which was but a vapor.
            To perswade her, the Historie saith, that to the reasons of feare
and danger, he added those of vanitie, adorned with stuffes of immortall
glorie. What greater honor, these are the wordes of G. Cornaro,
and what a nobler commendation can you leave of your selfe hereafter.

that they write in the Historie of Venice, that Catherine Cornaro
hath honored and augmented the Venetians Estate with the Realme of
Cypres. Then he represented vnto her the danger and infallible disgrace
of her house,Councels how pure soeuer they be doe still sauour of the passions & priuate interest of them that giue them. if shee did not grant it vnto the commonweale,

               Marc was set vp in the
Market of Famagosto, and the Realme of Cypres became a Prouince

of the Citie. The Councell of ten presented vnto her ten pounds
waight of gold, and appointed fifty for her entertainment in the
Castle of Azolle vpon the hils of Treuisan.
            Thus the Common-weale of Venice purchased a rich Crowne
without any paine, imploying nothing but her wisedome, with
the which shee hath alwaies preferred easie conquests, before the
most glorious, if they were without hazard. It is a curious obseruation
that the Estates doe commonly retaine the humour of
their first founders. The Citie of Rome hath been alwaies possest
with an ambitious desire to raigne, for that her founder was full of
it, who not content to haue recouered the Realme of Numitor
his Grandfather, cast his eyes presently vpon Alba, and vppon
the small Estates which hindred the extention of this first command.
The Estate of Rome increased sodainly as Polibius obserues. The Romanes hauing once gotten the command of all Italy, in a short time they made all the world subiect.

                So as the first profession was Armes, which hath not been
discontinued by posteritie being desirous of glorie and command.
It seemed that all other vertue except militarie had been defended.
Contrariwise the founders of the Common-weale of Venice were
men which had no such ambitious thoughts, but loued peace and
quiet, who being afflicted with the long calamities of Italy and the
inundation of the barbarians, had cast themselues into these Fens
of the Adriatike sea, & seazed vpon many small Ilands which were
caled Venetie, they liued there a time, contenting them with an assured
rest in a place which nature made inexpugnable,The scituation of Venice is by nature inexpugnable, she is garded without walles or garrison, and hath alone for so many ages remained vnuiolated. & which hath
alwaies braued the attempts of the mightiest Princes of the world.
            This first inclination not to arme but for their owne defence,
hath made them contemne Armes, and hath made them more
carefull to maintaine themselues in peace, then to inlarge their
Empire. Who so will consider of their first enterprises shall finde
them limitted with a desire onely to maintaine and defend themselues.
The Art of war saith Cardinal Cōtarin, hath been banished out of the Cōmonweale of Venice, but it hath bin done insēsibly within these two hundred yeares, for before they haue been very war like especially against the Genouois. By this contempt of the Art of warre, they are constrained to imploy forrain forces, & they choose not a Captaine amōg thē. The which they doe, least that priuate mē hauing forces vnder their cōmand, should attempt something against the state. Their first warres against the French were onely for the defence
of their liberty, when as Pepin K. of France past the mountains
to subdue the Lombards, & when as the Huns came like a violent
floud vpon Italy, only the commonweale of Venice opposed it selfe
like a rampar against these furious inundations, and it is no wonder
if beeing forced to resist such furious attempts shee had noe

meanes to thinke of other Conquests. Iealousie for the command
of the Sea, held it long in quarrell with the Genouois. And as
in her first beginning she had no care but to fortifie herselfe at Sea
against the iniuries of the firme land, so all her Conquests haue
beene by Sea. An error and negligence which some that haue come
after haue better consideredFrancis Foscarin Duke of Venice, was wont to say Che non potea la Republica crescere molto di potenze, se non hauesse nell imprese di Terra impiegate le sue forze: la quale cosa perche nō haue a prima fatts, pero era stata molto ritardata, et impedita quella grandezza, alla quale, se tale consiglio hauesse preso piu per tempo, po teua caminare felicemente. & haue thought that this Commonweale
had begun too late to inlarge it selfe vpon the maine land, &
to make profit of her neighbours ruynes. The two principall intentions
which shee hath had for the greatnes of her estate, to maintaine
her selfe free, and to become ritch, haue succeeded, for the one
she hath alwayes maintained her selfe strong at Sea, there beeing
no other meanes to anoy her, and she hath continued her traffick,
without the which she could not continue, & this goodly flower of
liberty had been withered by the idlenes of her subiects. The industry
of marchandize should bee no lesse honorable vnto them then
tillages to the old Senators of Rome, & both the one and the other
in their labours and trafficke haue produced famous examples of
publike vertues. We must giue vnto Venice the glory of the best
gouernment of all the Estates of the world, the forme and order of
her politick gonernment is in all parts so well disposed, and obserued,
as this Common weale (amidst so many diuers accidents of
good fortune and bad) was neuer troubled with any discord or domestick
diuision, which haue aflicted Aristocraticall Estates, and
driuen gouernours of Common-weales into such feares and distrusts,
as the Pallace where they haue assembled to resolue of publique
affaires, hath beene often dishonored with the losse of their
liues, or liberties.After that they of Miletum had expelled their tyrants, they setled an Aristocraticall Estate but the people did still muti
                     •
                  e against this kind of Gouernment, and the great men did still liue in such feare as they could not hold a Councell in safety but in shippes. The Lords of Samos were murthered by the people when they were in counsell. Inevitable stormes in estates, which depend
not of the power of one alone, whereas the lesser are alwaies kept
vnder by the greater, and the poore cannot long indure the felicity
of the ritch, who so will keepe the poore people in such obedience
must after the example of Rome allow them a share in the estate.The gouernment of Rome was diuided betwixt the Consulls, Senate and people, with such a conformity of their duties and common Offices, as neuer common weale was better instituted. The power of the one was bridled and restrayned by that of the other. Nulla efferre se pars supra caeteras valet, nequie impotenter superbire, omnia quippe in 
                        〈◊〉
                      statu manent, cum aliorum cehibiatur impetus, aliine in se quoque insurgatur perpeuo metuunt.
               
The Venetians haue made them subiect by meanes very pleasing
vnto them, they haue in a manner the best part of the liberty, and
their pleasures are not limited but by excesse, they do their affaires
quietly, and the Senate hath all the care to maintaine them in liberty
and rest. The greatest disdaine not them that are meaner, they
contract Allyances together, and do not restraine them from certaine
publique charges. There is a great temper betwixt Aristocratia
and Democratia: For the Gouerment retayning little of the one
and much of the other, is freed from disorders and corruptions
which haue alwaies troubled ciuill tranquillity.

of LEVVIS the XI.
            THE FIFTH BOOKE.
            
               THE Duke of Normandy was no sooner aduertised
that the King had promised by
the Treaty of Peronne to giue him the
Contries of Champaigne and Brie for his
portion but hee presently besought him to
giue him leaue to goe thither, and not to suffer
him to languish any longer, for the enioying
of his rest and quiet, the cheefe part
whereof consisted in not beeing troubled to seeke it.It is a part of rest not to be in paine to seek it.
            
            The King who had promised nothing freely, thought to discharge
himselfe of his promises at a better rate. Hee wonne the Sigr. of
Lescun,He that wil winne a Princes heart, let him first win the cheefe ministers which possesse him, who are as it were the eyes by the which hee seees, and the eares by the which he hears and vndrstands. who was his Brothers whole Councell,The King winnes his Brother by the practise of Odet of Rye. to perswade him
to be conformable to his intentions, and to rest satisfied not with
that which he desired, but with what should be offered him. Yet this
practise was not so secret but the Duke of Bourgondy was aduertised
by the Cardinall Bal

                  e, a double heart and a turbulent spirit
full of passion, who wrate vnto him that the King treated with his
Brother, that they made no mention of him, and that hee should
looke to his busines. This letter being surprised, lodged him in a

                  mitted to prison in Aprill, 1468. The Commission to examine him was giuen to Tanequy of Chastel, gouernour of Roussillon: William Cousinot, the maister of Torsy, and Peter of Oriolo Generall of the finances.
                for a prison from the which hee was not freed but
by the Popes intercession, and towards the end of this raigne.

            The King being returned into France, whereas they talked of his
indiscretion and great credulity in trusting his enemie, set a good
countenance of it, and made shew that what had beene done at Peronne
had been as beneficiall vnto him as if it had beene resolued,

to be made by the trumpet, that all birds which are kept in Cages,
as Pyes, Iayes and such like, should bee brought vnto him to

Amboise. They that had the Charge of this commission, should
informe themselues what euery Bird could say, and where it had

power, and brought himselfe to that estate, as he was like vnto
the Elephant who paies his ransome with the Iuory of his
teeth.
            To repaire this error and to preuent his Brother, and the Duke
of Bourgundy of their pretensions, he labours to breake the Treatie,
but he will doe all with solemnitie, and if hee must cast forth
the Thunderbolts of warre, it shall not be done without the Councell
of the Gods,A Prince should not alone▪ resloue to make war. Iupiter did not cast forth his lightning without the Councel of twelue Gods. The Kings of France did not vndertake any war but with the aduice of the twelue Peeres. imitating the wisedome of his Predecessors,

Charlemaine went against the King of the Lombards, and the Duke
of Bauaria hauing first acquainted the Parliament with these designes.1468 Conuocation of the Estates at Tours.
            
            To this end he assembled the Estates of the Realme at Tours,
The Estates assemble for one of these three reasons, for the regencie of the Realme, in the Kings minoritie, for the reformatiō of the realme, and to prouide meanes to succour the necessities of the Crowne. It is a bodie of three Orders & hath been alwaies obserued among the Gaules. the pretext was to preuent the ruines of the Realme, but the essentiall
cause was to resolue two things, a portion for Monsieur,
and the restitution of the Townes vpon the riuer of Some, both
depending vpon this Lawe which is one of the pillars of the Estate.
That the Lands of the Crowne are inalienable, and portions
are not giuen but with condition to returne againe for want of
heires masle.A Monarchy suffers no diuision, nor estimation, for the yongers portions of the house of France are not diuided, but for want of Masles returne to the Crowne.
            
            The tongue hath done great seruices to this Prince in diuers actions,Eloquence naturall to K. Lewis the eleuenth.
in this (yet without any Art or affection)It is necessarie for the Prince to speake well but without affectation, his eloquence should more appeare in the facillitie of his owne nature, then in any curious Art, for there are more parts required to make a man eloquent, then to make a Cuptaine; to know and discourse of particular things we must vnderstand the generall. he strikes fire to
inflame the coldest spirits, to what he will, and speakes to all the
Deputies, and lets euery man know the importance of the Duchie
of Normandie, and the preiudice which other Prouinces receiued
when it was in the power of the English, with the incredible to ile
which King Charles his Father had past to wrest it out of their
hands. That although he did not hold his brother to be of so bad
a disposition as to haue intelligence with them,Importance of the Duchy of Normandie. yet he knew well
that they of his intelligence bad great practises in England, that
he might haue children which should not bee of his humor, beeing
most certaine that the Princes of the same bloud extend their
thoughts farther then they should,Ambition neuer takes root but in hearts that are vigorous, hardy and desirous of innovations. When as it incounters with any preheminence of bloud, or fauour of the people, it is

matters, and are not content with their condition. That for these
reasons he could not leaue the Duchie of Normandie. That his
promises in that regard should be soundly vnderstood, and that affaires

of State were not managed with such scrupulous considerations.
That hee offered notwithstanding to giue him such a portion
as the Estates should aduise, making them Iudges and Arbitrators
therein, but aboue all he commanded that the lawes of the Realme
should not be infringed.The Realme of France is seated vpon a triangular basis, the Salique

thither with greater Maiesty then he did euer shew in any action during
his raigne. A Prince cannot adde too much in such great occasions,

acquainted therewith in a long Oration the Deputies beeing prepared

nor ought to grant vnto Charles of France the Duchie of Normandie
for his portion. It was said that it should remaine vnto the
Crowne, and the King was intreated to maintaine the auncient
lawes of the Realme, concerning his Patrimonie, holy, sacred and

inalienable either by contracts, or by prescription of time, and
against any whatsoeuer, and that the Princes of the bloud should
not therein haue any more fauour nor priuiledge then priuate

a portion with the title of a Dutchy or an Earledome the which
should be worth twelue hundred poundes starling a yeare, and a
yearely pension of foure thousand and eight hundred pounds starling,
without drawing it to consequence,This clause of cōsequence was superstuous & shewes from what respect it came. For the portion was so small, as no man would make it a President. There are houses in France, where the yonger sons would not bee so satisfied. for the yonger brethren

the Parliament of Guienne from Bourdeaux to Poitiers. This
resolution was carried to Monsieur, and to the Dukes of Brittany

to change the ayre, as notwithstanding that hee found small
profit in the change of his condition, yet would he not refuse it.
the Lord of Lescun perswaded him to reconcile himselfe vnto the
King, and to accept of what he should giue him.

                   Hee was taken prisoner at the Battel of Azincourt and remained three & twenty years in England. for St. Valery and other lands
which he detained. The King was well pleased with this resolution,
for that he knew well that when the Duke should see himselfe charged
in this manner he would make an answer according to his humorfull
of contempt, and that some grose-headed fellow executing
his commission indiscreetly for profit, would moue him, and prouoke
him to do somthing whereat the Court should bee offended
and vrged to seeke reparation.
            The same Court of Parliament sent Iohn Loyselier,
               Complaints for the Pragmatike Sanction.
               The Deputies of the Court of Parliament let the K. vnderstand that the abolitiō of this Pragmatick was shamefull and iniurious, for the Frāce had neuer had in like causes Ordinances which had taken their authoritie from the vniuersall all Church. That as long as she had obserued this Pragmatick, she was full of all prosperitie, and feared of her enemies whom she had chased out of Normandie and Guienne, and had seene Prelates of such holines, as they had done miracles.

Estates the great preiudice which France had receiued by the abolition
of the Pragmaticke Sanction, that it was depriued of a rule
which comprehended all the liberties and freedomes of the French
Church approued in the Conciles of Basill and Constance: That
by the cessation of such decrees, France must needs looke for some
great confusion of the Ecclesiasticall Order, and a generall impouerishment
by the transport of gold and siluer beyond the
Alpes. But the King hauing obtained what hee desired against
his Brother and the Duke of Bourgundy, hee carried his
thoughts to other things then to that which the Estates expected
for the good of the publike,In these Estates they did not thinke of the publike good nor of the peoples ease, who complained, for Lewis leuied much more then King Charles.

of the great men of this Realme, had ruined his affaires hee
inuented a meanes to vnite their mindes to his will and to keep
them firme by new bonds of honor and fidelitie,Institution of the order of St Michell. the which hee
found in the order of St Michael making it not onely a recompence
for vertue, like to the Consulship of Rome, but a marke of
the Nobilitie of bloud and extraction.The dignity of Consull at Rome, was as Valerius said vnto his soldiers. Premium virtutis non sanguinis, and went to seek out the vertuous in any house & at any age.
            
            Princes should haue things in their meere disposition which
should be out of the commerce of their subiects,1469 and wherevnto
they may not aspire but by the degrees of Vertue. Honors which
may bee recouered for money, are no more honors, for the sale
may make them fall vpon vnworthy heads.The sale of honors makes them to be lesse esteemed, vertue to bee contemned, & sufficiency lesse necessarie, euery one thinking that he may attaine vnto it for money. It is a great disorder
when as such as are aduanced, cannot say that they are bound
vnto their vertue, although they haue glorious shewes, and that is
not held rare which may be recouered for money.Glory is the desire of great courages. Caesar would haue scorned him that should haue giuen him gold, but hee dyed with desire to haue a crown of bayes.
            
            Fortune may impouerish the greatest houses of Christendome,
but the honour which they hold from their Ancestors remaines
for euer, and a branch of Laurell which remaines of their fathers
Crownes, is more deere vnto them then any other thing. Wee see
not any Prince reduced to that necessitie, as hee prefers siluer before
honor. And that King hath no great power in a Realme wheras
they obtaine all for coyne.

haue them that were neerest vnto him honored.By these orders the Prince becomes a companion to the whole Colledge.

taken vpon the consideration of things present & to come,
was that he should goe to Calice, and in his absence they should
make some stirres in the Prouince of Yorke, to the end hee might
haue a subiect to come thither and to arme. The pretext of rising
was for the deniall of some Corne which they of the Earle of
Warwicks faction refused to pay for the entertainment of St Leonards

            The Earle of Warwick was no sooner aduertised of these broiles,
but he parted from Calice with the Duke of Clarence, and came
and ioined with this multitude, who wanted not any thing but a
head. King Henries presence and the Earles did countenance the
faction, and increase it with a greater number, with the which he
resolued to giue Battell, to recompence the errors, ruines and occasion
past.Hee that knowes how to giue a Battell recouers

had sent, not to fight but to punish those rebels was put to
route and they had the victory. Richard Lord Riuers father to
Queene Elizabeth, and his sonne Iohn Wooduille, with some other
Gentlemen lost their heads.
            The King sought to make some accord with the Earle of Warwicke,
and vpon the assurance which he gaue him, neglected to
keep good gard in his Campe, the which should not bee omitted

his spies he vndertooke to charge him by night,

as killing all he found in the trenches hee came without
any resistance to the place where the King was, whom he tooke prisoner
and led away. But for that they could not make good vse of
this fortune, they ruined themselues and vndid King Henry, for
whom they had taken Armes: God, who hath a speciall care of
Kings, depriued them of Iudgement, for although they knew well
that it was impossible to settle King Henry peaceably in the Realme
during Edwards life, yet could they not keep him so well but hee escaped,
hauing corrupted his gards with hopes, and goodly promises,
whereof great men are no nigards when they haue need of
their inferiors.
            
               
               Edward being at libertie, recouers Yorke, where he was receiued
with ioy, which was as great as it was vnexpected. From
thence he went to London to confirme their wils whom his captiuitie
had made to wauer, and considering that victory doth alwaies

            Queene Margaret, Prince Edward her Sonne, the Duke of Clarence
and his wife, the Earle of Warwick with their children and
friends were forced to flye. They came to Calice, but the Earle of
Warwicks Lieutenant would not receiue them, nor scarce suffer
them to carrie two bottels of Wine for the Duchesse of Clarence,
who was deliuered of a Sonne whilest the ship rode at an Anchor.

            Being there he receiued a letter from the Duke of Guienne containing
these wordes. Labour to content your subiects and then care not

and dispossest of the Townes which he did so much esteeme, intreated
the Constable not to presse this warre so hotly, nor to doe the
worst he could, and to consider that the King without any precedent
offence had taken armes, and broken the treaty of Peronne,

will to the Kings, and Deputies were sent into Castille to King Henry
the fourth. The King had for his part the Cardinall of Alby and
the Lord of Torcy: The Duke of Guienne gaue his procuration to
the Earle of Bolloigne, and to the Lord of Malicorne, to consent
vnto this marriage and had neuer beheld the Bride, Princes drinke

            Hee commanded the Archbishop of Seuill, the Bishop of Siguenç

with the Embassadors of France. All being concluded, the King

and confirmed to his Daughter D. Ioane the title of Princesse and
heire of Castille, the Cardinall of Alby addressing himselfe to the
Queene her mother, besought her to sweare whether D. Ioane were
the Kings daughter or not. She sweare that she was. He made the
like adiuration vnto the King, who affirmed the same. They had

kist her hands, and she was againe sworne Princesse of Castille. In
this qualitie the Cardinall of Alby made her sure to the Duke of

with all the capacitie of his iudgement to disswade him from this
alliance, letting him know that it was dishonorable by reason of
the vnlawfull birth of Bertraiamina, (for so they called her) and
dangerous for the hatred which he should purchase of D. Ferdinand,
and D. Isabella declared Kings of Castille, with the like Art
he represented vnto him the greatnes he should expect by the marriage
of the Princesse of Bourgundy.Death of Pope Paul▪

was sodainly surprised by death hauing held a Consistorie and eaten
two melons at his dinner. His election was as vnexpected as
his death. Cardinall Scarampi who was his enemie,Cardinall Lewis Scarampy Patriarke of Aquilea was enemie to P. Paul the second being yet a Cardinal. Lewis reproched to Peter the sumptuousnes of his buildings, and Peter said that he had rather exceed in that then in dice, playing, wherein Lewis tooke great delight. did in the
beginning of the Conclaue breake off the proposition which was
made, and yet contrarie to the ordinance of elections, the suffrages
agreed vpon the same subiect which they had reiected, and the
contention which had begunne, the Conclaue ended. This Pope
shewed a great generosite, for beeing chosen, and seeing that the
gowt, or rather shame and discontentment hindred this Cardinall
from comming to the adoration, hee went to meete him,
imbraced him, assured him of his loue, and to forget all matters
past.
            This Pope augmented the pompe of the Court of Rome, hee
gaue Scarlet foot-clothes to the Cardinals Mules. Platina saith that
he loued not learned men, and called all them hereticks that made

profession; and therefore he supprest the Colledge of Abreuiators
which was full of great excellent spirits. The feeling which Platina
seemed to haue of this iniury did wholly ruine his fortune, in the
affliction whereof he wrote a letter vnto the Pope,

            This Pope was also taxed to be very greedy of money,
                  Paul the secōd a great builder. and not
to haue held the iustest meanes to get it, and yet his magnificence
in the sumptuous building of the Pallace of St. Mark, and in the
reparation of that of S. Peter freed him from blame with such as
know that magnificence is the daughter of liberalitie.
            The promises beeing broken in the Castille the poursuite of the
marriage with the Duke of Bourgundies Daughter was followed
by the Constable with great vehemencie, who could not endure
that any other should deale in it. Hee represented vnto him the
greatnes and commoditie of the Estates which this marriage would
bring him after the death of his brother and father in law, & makes
him to apprehend it in such sort, as this yong Prince, who filled not
his fantasie with small imaginations, continued his first poursuite
of an alliance with duke Charles, assuring him that it would produce
great effects for their common fortunes and profit.An apparent and important profit is a great motiō to diuert the effect of a promise.
            
            The Duke of Brittanie promised vnto himselfe the honour of
the mediation for a matter which did profit few men and offended
many. The King had no desire his brother should be so great.T

                  s. The house of Bourgundy grew so mighty as it would equall it selfe with that of France.
The King of England sent often to the Duke of Bourgundy to diswade
him from this alliance, entreating him to consider that the
Duke of Guienne,Designe of the King of England. succeeding the King who had no children, and
holding the countries belonging to the house of Bourgundy, England
did foresee her ruine and destruction.
            The Duke of Bourgundy would haue no such sonne in Lawe,
he gaue a desire and appetite to all men with one hand, and tooke
all hope from them with the other, he promised her to all & gaue
her not to any; he made vse of his daughter to entertaine the loue
of Princes, and to passe ouer his affaires with more successe, to repaire
by pollicy the defects he found in his owne strength, thinking
that his weaknes did dispence him of his word, and that fraud was
glorious against his enemies.Deceit which makes an enemy receiue an affront is as commendable as it is to bee blamed when it deceiueth him that is not so declared, whereas they say that fraud is glorious in warre, it is not to be vnderstood in breaking words and promises, but of politick, fained, and artificiall stratagems.
            
            But he had no desire to marry her, propounding vnto himselfe
in this marriage more the aduancement of his owne designe, then
the contentment of his daughter, hee promised her to Maximilian
sonne to the Emperour Frederic,
               Princes pretending to marry the Daughter of Bourgundy. and inclined much to that party,
to doe his busines in Germany, where he desired to purchase some
credit, for at the same time Sigismond ArchDuke of Austria had ingaged

draw him from the Kings allyance, who had promised him his eldest
daughter, To the Duke of Guienne to trouble the Kings of France,
and England, and to Phillip Duke of Sauoy, for an other designe:
Yet the practise was so followed by the Duke of Brittaine and the
Constable, who promised in regard of that marriage to draw him
into Amiens, and S. Quintin as he gaue his word to consent vnto it,
and at the same instant hee assured the King of England that hee
would not doe it, his words vppon this subiect were neuer of one
tune,It was a witty comparison of him that said that mens actions were like notes of musick sometimes in spaces & sometimes in lines, sometimes aboue and sometimes beneath, and neuer or seldom straight for any long cō
                  tinuance. and did not accord with his heart.
            The Dukes of Guienne and Brittanie, being well aduertised that
their hopes were crost by the King of England, gaue the Duke of
Bourgundy to vnderstand by their Ministers that without the assistance
of the English, they were strong inough, and had sufficient
intelligence to force the King to doe him right, and that the principal
end of their Armes, being for the publike good of the realme,
they could not haue that successe which they expected imploying
their ancient enemies, and that so long as they had forces and
meanes in France, it was not needfull to seek them in England.W

                  ilest that wee may passe without succors we should not seek them. Plato in his Lawes forbids to dig for water in a neighbors house before that hee had sought it in his owne.
            
            These words were deliuered vnto him by Vrfe in the behalfe of
Monsieur, Wherevpon the Duke said, to Philip de Commines, Behold
the Lord of Vrfe presseth me to make mine armies as great as I can, and
tels me that we shall doe great good vnto the Realme, doe you thinke if I
enter with the company that I shall lead that I shall doe any good? Philip
de Commines answered smiling. In my opinion no: Then the Duke
said, I loue the good of France better then my Lord of Vrfe thinkes,
for whereas there is but one King I would there were six. He would gladly
haue had the whole peece,Ambition striues to diuide and teare in peeces that which shee can not breake nor carry wholly away. but knowing the impossibilitie,
that the ascent was too steepe, and the top too slipperie hee had
no care but to breake that which he could not wholly enioy.There is not any one of so great a courage, but thinking to make himselfe a King he trembles, the ascent vnto a royaltie is slipperie, the top shaking, and the precipise & fall fearefull.
            
            He prepared great forces, and the King sent his into Guienne, being
incensed that his Brother had restored the Earle of Armagnac
to his lands, which had been confiscate, and hee spoyles both the
one and the other. He wins his cheife seruants the more easely to
chase him out of Guienne. The Duke of Guienne prest the Duke of
Bourgondy to succor him, the Duke sent vnto the King to intreat
him to suffer Monsieur to liue in peace, The King answered that hee
had no intent to alter any thing of his brothers portion, but to keepe
him from attempting beyond his bounds. And behold a remarkable
poynt of wisedome in this Prince, whilest the Duke prepared
his army he sent Peter D'oriole Chancellor of France vnto him, and
the Lord of Craon to make an ouerture of an accord.A Peace treated and a promise made to restore Amiens. A peace was
treated, and the King promised to restore Amiens and Saint Quentin,
the duke was so much greeued for the losse of these two townes,
and had so great a desire to recouer them, as in regard thereof hee
granted whatsoeuer they would.

Truth, freedome and loyalty are rare, vnknowne and exiled qualities.

It were basenesse not to dare to be lie his promises, nor to accommodate
his words to profit rather then to Iustice, These two
Princes sought to deceiue one another,It is simplicity to speak all, but it is meere wickednesse not to speake what we thinke. It is a basnesse of the heart when a

would preserue him that which a peace tooke from him. The duke
of Bourgondy wrote vnder-hand to the dukes of Guienne and Brittanie,
that the abandoning of their protection, and friendship, which
he had promised was but fayned, that his affection was alwaies pure
and firme to maintaine them. Neither of them held himself bound
to keepe his word but to effect his businesse, and in this bargaine
they spake not all they thought.

king, who had made profit of the time, deferred it from day to day,
he lick't and fashon'd this little beare at leasure. Quingey who knew
his Maisters mind durst not importune him. The king went slowly,
hee tooke not halfe the winde hee might haue taken to arriue
at a prefixed time at the port of his desseigns, thinking the
winning of time very necessary for him that will effect his businesse,
that it cannot be bought to deere nor too long attended.When as the Barbarians demanded mony of Sertorius going into Sp

behold a post which brings newes that the Duke of Guienne is
dead: a death which changed the face of affaires, and depriued the
Duke of all that he promised vnto himselfe.
            It happened the twelfe of May 1471. and the manner so violent
as his members turning contrary to their propper motion by
strange convulsions,Death of the duke of Guienne. wholy disfigured his body, his teeth, haire and
nayles fell off before his death. It was thought to bee by poyson.
Being on a sommers day at Saint Seuere with the Lady of Montsoreau,
the Abbot of Saint Iohn d' Angely (who was one of the Dukes
fauorites) at his after-noones drinking presented a goodly Peache
vnto his Lady, she tooke the one halfe and steeped it in wine, and
gaue the other to Monsieur. Shee dyed soone after, but the Duke
contynued longer, yet so sicke, as his death was bruted the very day
that he had taken this deadly morcell.
            If the King were pleased with this death we may gather by the
words which he spake a little before, when as newes was brought

word of Brother was vnto him as a goodly name to signifie a bad
thing, if he wept they were teares of ioy, and if they were not fayned
they were presently dryed vp.
            The little care hee seemed to haue to punish such as were accused
to haue poysoned him, confirmed an opinion that he was content,
and made many beleeue that this death came by his commandement,

to assure the quiet of many by the death of one alone.
It is a great misery for a Prince when he sees him-selfe forced to bee cruell vnto his owne bloud, to assure the quiet of his estate. Hee commanded the Bishop of Angers Secretary to bringe him
the proceedings taken before his Maister and Lewis of Amboise vpon
this death, Claude of Seysel in that which hee hath written of the
History of Lewis the twelfth saies vpon this occasion. Many there
are which said, but yet I dare not affirme it, that he caused his said brother
to die of poison, but it is most certaine that he neuer had any confidence
in him whilest he liued, and was not greeued at his death.

all perswations, as the King his brother was cunning and stayed.

            Impressions were very easie in this lightnesse. The rigor which
King Lewis the eleuenth shewed vnto him, made him giue eare to
such as sought to finde their owne contentments in his discontents.
It is Iniustice in a Soueraigne brother not to prouide for the entertainment
of his yonger, whom he should put in the number of his
forces and felicities. They are of the same bloud and grounded vppon

Iohn to raise the siege from before Peralta, the which was wonderfully

            When as the King of Arragon had ended a Ciuill warre against
his subiects, he found himselfe ingaged in warre against the French.
King Lewis the eleuenth being often importuned with the ordinarie
complaints which were made of the insolencies of the French,
The inhabitants of Perpignan intreated Iohn King of Arragon, either to giue the K. other p

being reuolted against the garrison, had forced them to retire into
the Castle, he sent the King word that he should pay him his three
hundred thousand crownes & retire his countrie, or that he should
make him an absolute sale, or giue him caution for the paiment.
The King of Arragon finding either of these conditions verie
harsh, answered that he could not yet vngage the country, and
that it would bee no honour to him to alienate it, being a part of
the Crowne of Arragon, and that it was a matter neuer heard of to
presse a King to gaue Caution, the pawne being sufficient.
            The King taking this answere for a refusall, prepared to warre,
and made his preparation slowly, to haue a more speedy victorieHe that will demand any thing of an enemie must not be disarmed, neither must hee prepare hastily to war to vanquish more speedily.

With the like care as he armed for an offensiue warre against the
King of Arragon, he gaue order for a defensiue, and to furnish the
Towne of Perpignan with victuals and necessary commodities to
maintaine a siege, and gaue the command thereof to the Lord of
Lude. The Letter which he wrote vnto him vpon that subiect deserues
well to be considered of, beeing drawne from the originall
and full of passages which discouer the humor of this Prince, the
order and conduct of his affaires, and the manner of writing of

make any good appointment, or whether they came to deceiue mee and to
dissemble. The said Bouffille is returned vnto me, and as farre as they

can finde they bring not any good newes, and their intention is onely to
entertaine mee with words, vntill they haue gathered in their coine.
And therefore I must play Mr Lewis, and you Mr Iohn, and whereas
they seeke to deceiue vs let vs shew our selues more politick then they. In
regard of my selfe I will entertaine them heere vntill the first weeke of
May, and in the meane time you shall part with all the speed you can,
and shall draw together a hundred Lances in Dauphine to lead with you,
and cause them to be led by Monsieur de S. Priet, or by Pouillalier, or by
them both together, that is to say, fourescore Lances by S. Priet, and twentie
by Pouillalier, or all to him alone or to both together, as you shal think
the matter may be best conducted for my profit, for I referre this Article
to you.
            I send you a Letter which I write vnto them by Beauuoisin, whom I
charged to tell them and to doe what you shall thinke fit. And for the
paiment of the said hundred Lances,A hundred pound starling. you must speedilie finde a thousand
Liuers to giue them at their departure, for they shall make but a roade
to spoile and burne the corne and then returne, which is ten francks a
month for euerie Lance: And seeing they haue no Archers, and continue
but eight or ten daies, it must suffice them, it is fit to finde a meanes
to recouer the said thousand Francks either by confiscation of Corne or
otherwise. And if it should come to the extremitie that you could not
finde it before you want, take it vppon the accounts of the Treasurer of
Dauphin

seruice you can doe me is to vse such speed as you may burne all their
Corne betimes, for thereby they shall be forced to speake plainely.
            I haue spoken vnto Captaine Odet Daidre, who is well content to
goe thither, I send him vnto you with his hundred Lances to assist you
to make the spoile, in my opinion when you are all together you are inough.
            I send Yuon Diliers vnto Monsieur de Charluz to raise an hundred
Lances in Lanquedoc. I doe also write vnto de Charluz to gather together
of his Franc Archers the neerest to those marches, to the number
of three thousand, and that he cause them to march into Roussillon
with you, and that all be readie to part the 25. of this month of Aprill.
And for the paiment of the hundred Lances of Lanquedoc, and of the
said Franc Archers, I write vnto the Generall and Treasurer of Lanquedoc
that they cause foure thousand Francs to be deliuered vnto them,
that is to say a thousand Francs to the hundred Lances; and to the said
Franc Archers 3000. Francs.

directed to him, to Monsieur Charluz, and to the said Destueille,

may haue no want: but you must haue a care that vnder co

shall part within two or three daies, and in my opinion with those hundred
Lances, with yours, those of Dauphinè, Lanquedoc, and of Captaine
Odet, with the three thousand Franc of Archers, you shall haue forces sufficient
to spoile and burne their whole Country, and to take and beate
downe their paltry places, or ruine and burne such as you cannot beat
downe.

were well receiued and graciously vsed by the King, who gaue them
two cups of gold waying fortie markes,As a weake Prince should not make any show of his forces, so hee that is mighty glories to shew what hee can. The King out of one Citie of his realme musters a hūdred thousand men in Armes, the 20. of Aprill 1470. and esteemed worth three
thousand two hundred crownes of gold, and to the end they might

            The fortune of the house of Armagnac was intangled in that
of Arragon.
                  Iohn Earle of Armagnac expelled his Country. 
               Iohn Earle of Armagnac had married Ioane of Foix
Daughter to Gaston Earle of Foix and D. Leonora of Arragon. This
alliance could not defend him from the indignation of King Lewis
               
the eleuenth in the furie whereof he found first the losse of his libertie,
then of his goods, and lastly of his life.
            The King could not forget with what vehemency he had followed
the Bourguignon party in the war of the Common weale, after
that he had promised to retire himselfe from all Leagues and associations,
contrary to the Kings intentions, nor with what affection
he had followed the youthfull follies of the Duke of Guienne his
brother, who had restored him to his lands, contrary to his commandement.
            In the yeare 1469. one called Iohn Bon of Wales in England
brought letters vnto the King, which King Edward had writen to
the Earle of Armagnac,Accused by a welchmā. and the answer which the Earle made him.
The King reading them with the passion where-with he was possest,
and easily beleeuing one man aloneTo draw many heades in question vppon the report of one tongue, is an act of extreame & odious Iustice. Graue militibus visū quod in causa falconis multos milites ad vnius serui testimonium occidi preceperat Pertinax Iul. Capitol. to ruine one who was
worth many, and who would cost him much, thought that Infidellity
was noe new thing in a spirit who had already shewed the
proofes, and without further inquisition sends the Earle of Dammarting
with twelue or thirteene hundreth Lances, and with ten
or twelue thousand Franc Archers to seaze vpon the Earles person,
lands and estate.
            Being come into the Towne of Rhodets, he put the whole Country
into the Kings hands,His lands put into the Kings hāds. changed the officers, and caused a Proclamation
to be made by the sound of a Trumpet, that noe man of
what estate or condition whatsoeuer should advowe himselfe seruant
nor officer to the Earle of Armagnac, nor make any poursute
for him, vpon paine of confiscation of body and goods.There is nothing so powerfull nor fearefull as a publik declaration of the Princes hatred against any one, especially among a people which esteem not their Gouernors but by the authority and credit they haue with their Superior.
In these extremities there is not any man that will willingly loose
himselfe for another. Good men are loth to drawe their friends into
danger. As it is an office of frendshippe to runne into danger for
ones friends, and rashnes to goe into perils without occasion, so
it is cruelty to bring others into danger.
            The Earle of Dammartin made booty of all the places and Siegneuries
which did belong vnto the Earle of Armagnac. If he tooke
his part, as some taxed him he did contrary to the duty of a Generall,
who should content himselfe with the glory of the command
and executionThe glory & honor of well executing the cōmandements of his Prince, serues for a booty, in the distributiō wherof he that commands must consider that there is not any thing for himselfe. Themistocles seeing a great nū

                and leaue vnto the soldier that which concernes
profit.
            The Earle of Armagnac seeing that hee must haue time to cleere
these brutes,He retires to Fonteraby. and that oftentimes Innocency is forced to yeeld vnto
a sodaine euent,We must giue time to broyles to make them vanish away when there is no meanes to resist. Innocency it selfe is troubled when she is surprized. Relinquenda rumoribus tempus, quo senescant innocentes recente inuidiae impares. Tac. An. Lib. 2. was aduised to goe out of the Realme and to retire
to Fonteraby with his wife, being loth that his person should be
at the Earle of Dammartins discretion, who beeing aduertised
of his flight, past on, and seazed vppon the towne of Lestoré. The
Court Parliament of Paris vppon the informations of the Intelligences
which the Earle of Armaignac had with the enemies of
the Realme decreed a personall adiournment against him. His

processe was made by reason of his contumacy,The first default was obtained the 24. of Nouember 1469. the second the 19. of February▪ 1469 the third the 6. of August 1470. and before that the E. of Dāmartin had seazed vppon all the County of Armagnac. and by a sentence
giuen the 7. of September 1470. he was condemned to loose his
head. But he was in a place of safety, whereas the sentence could not
be executed, hauing an intent to let them know, which had condemned
him, that he was aliue.
            After that he had for two yeares space indured the miseries and

find no resistance in his contry, that all was vnder his obedience and

him good security, that he might go vnto him to iustifie his life and

            The offers were not accepted,It hath beene alwaies found strange that a subiect whose will should be conuerted into obedience and his reasons to humility, should capitulate with his Prince. The Duke of Nemours, the Earle of St. Paul, the Duke of Brittaine, and the Earle of Armagnac repented it to late the Capitulations of an Inferiour
beeing then more odious then they haue been since with Kings. Al
the Contry was ouerrunne, spoiled and ruined, and yet the Earle
would not suffer his people to defend themselues, declaring alwaies
that he was the Kings seruant, desiring nothing more then to
iustifie himselfe, offering to deliuer vp the Towne of Lestoré, and

for a greater declaration of his will, hee caused the white Crosse
and the Armes of France, to be set vpon the Towers and Walles.

                  This Maxime That a Prince being forced to make a peace or treaty to his disaduantage may fall from it at his pleasure, had already taken footing in the councells of Princes.
                they entred into
treaty with the Earle of Armagnac, and it was agreed: That the
said Lord of Beaujeu, as Lieutenant to the King, hauing speciall
power soe to doe, did pardon all crimes and delicts which he might
haue committed against the King, as wel in adhering vnto the Duke
of GuienneThe Earle of Armagnac had followed the D. of Guienne in the warre of the Common weale, and since had termed him selfe his Lieutenant Generall. as otherwise. That noe trouble nor hinderance should
be giuen to himnor his seruāts going nor comming. That he might
goe safely vnto the King with a hundred or sixe-score Horses, without
Armes to iustifie himselfe of those crimes wherewith he was
charged, according to the offers made by him. That the Lord of
Beaujeu and the Cardinall of Alby should obtaine all Letters and
expeditions necessary for his better assurance. That in the meane
time he might remaine in his Countrey of Gascoine in what place
he should thinke good, except the Towne of Lestoré, the which
should be deliuered into the hands of the Lord of Beaujeu.
            It was also agreed that in case they gaue him not this assurance,A man of quality should desire nothing more then to make his innocency knowne, and to see himselfe purged from all accusa

granted him to goe vnto the King with threescore horse. But in steed
of going thither, he executed an enterprise, which he had vpon Lestoré,
by the meanes of Iohn D. Aymier. The younger brother of Albert
surprised it,In the Earle of Armagnacs defence, it is said, that seeing that the Lorde of Beauieu commaunded him to void the Country, he required him to restore him the Towne of L

the Seneshals of Toulouza and Beaucaire to beesiege Lestoré. The
siege continued three months, and the Cardinall seeing that force

King, pardon for the Noble-men & Gentle-men of his party, & of al

of this he deliuered vp Lestoré vnto the King. The articles
were signed by the Cardinal Ranfort, Balsac, Gaston of Lyon, & Iohn
Daillon Lord of Lude, on Thursday the fourth of March 1472.
            
               
In execution of the treaty the Earle of Armagnac deliuered vnto
the Cardinall the Castell of Lestoré, caused his men to disarme, and
retired his Cannon, making all the ports to be sett open to the
Kings men.They that trust are easily deceiued. The wise prepare themselues for dangers in assurances. In ipsa securitate animus ad difficilia se preparat.

naked into the streets, the Townespoiled, the Countesse of Armagnac
carried prisoner into the Castell, and within fewe dayes after
was deliuered of a Sonne before her time, the Castell and walles of
the Towne were razed, and it was fiered in euery place, and in the
end all were intreated with that liberty which the rigor of war permits
against Townes and people that rebell.Razing, burning, and sacking, are the ordinary punishments of rebellious Townes. Alba was razed, Carthage burnt, the V

bred him wonderfull sorrowes and griefe, and as the passage is not
great from melancolly to madnes, his spirit grew weake, and made
him incapable to rouse the enemies of his howse. They gaue him
certaine Noble-men of the Countrey to be his gouernors.

that the Cardinall of Alby entred into some treaty with the Earle
of Armagnac for the assurance whereof he vsed a damnable pollicy,Trechery most damnable. for seeing that the Earle feared to fall into the Kings hands, he
sware his promises by the most sollemne misteries of his Religion,
giuing halfe a consecrated Hoste vnto the Earle and himself taking
the other halfe. That in the meane time the soldiers slipt into
the Towne, and that the Earle, meaning to charge them, fearing
a surprise,Vntill the capitulation be made, all pollicies, all surprises are alowed. They laugh at them who suffering themselues to be surprised in those bargaines, cry out of disloialty. In courses of hostility there is nothing more excellent then deceipte, nothing more safe then distrust. they cryed out for succors, the Kings Armie entred
by the breaches which the cannon had made, the Towne was
spoiled and ruined, all were put to the sword, and the Earle slaine.
The Lord of Beaujeu with the other Gentle-men prisoners were
deliuered.
            Such was the Tragicall and fatall end of the Earle of Armagnac.
Fortune, who desired to ouerthrow the greatnes of his house, blinded
his eyes that hee could not apprehend the dangers which did
threaten it. She had not a more powerfull instrument then the hatred
which the King bare him. A hatred conceiued long before, nourished
and augmented, by many free & hardy actions. He was therfore
inuironed with so many perplexities and perturbations as hee
needed no more to let him know her constancy, and to

and is purified in the fire. They were so extreame as if in the beginning

they had let him see the least part, or the choise of a cruell
death, with what a resolution would hee haue imbraced this, to auoid
the miseries of the other? The most violent torments which a

Earles memory.
            
               Charles Duke of Alençon, whose Grandfather had married the
Earle of Armagnac's Sister, drew his iustificacion from the same
reasons by which he was accused. They said he had receiued Letters
from the King of England, and that Iohn Bon had brought them
vnto the King, with the answere. His innocencie therein was very
apparant, for if he had receiued his letters and would haue made any
answere he would not haue giuen them back vnto the bearer.
They were cunning practises, said the Duke of Alençon, of such as
haue gouerned Lewis the eleuenth to tempt the fidelity of the Earle
of Armagnac and to haue a share in his spoile. That if Iohn Bon
had been a true messenger to the King of England, as he made shew
to be, he had not carried the Letters vnto the king.
            That the Earle of Armagnac was naturally an enemy to the English,Earle of Armagnac a great enemie to the English. and being at Font arabic, he carried himselfe in such sort towards
them, as men wondred how he could be banished for fauoring
them.He that will iustifie himselfe must liue in such sort among them where hee is exiled as his Innocencie may be apparent, and his returne more easie. There haue been banished men, who for the Integritie of their liues haue been more happie among strangers then in their owne houses. He would not suffer his seruants to conferre or conuerse
with the English which did trafficke in that Contrie: and it
hapened one day as the yong men of Bayonne were come to dance
before the Countesse of Armagnac, his wife, an English man hauing
a red crosse vpon his brest slipt into the hall, with the people
who are accustomed to follow dances. The Earle who held the
meeting of an English man with a red Crosse for as bad a presage,

driue him out, and as they ranne after him with their naked daggers,
Mauleon his Stuard stept betwixt them, saying that they were
in a strange countrie, and that the Townes-men might rise against
such an act, which the Earle of Armagnac seeing, he tooke his Stuards
staffe and chased the English man out of his lodging, making
him to leape downe the stayres.
            That being parted from Fontarabie, to goe vnto the Duke of
Guienne, by chance he found an English man at the Sea side, whom
he caused to be taken and carried him prisoner to Lestoré, onely
for that he was an Englishman.

pattents giuen at Compeigne in February 1514. resigned vnto the
Duke of Alençon and to the Lady Margaret his wife and their
children, all his interest, vpon certaine conditions, the which happening,
it fell to the house of Albret.
            
               Iohn Duke of Alençon was so wonderfully grieued at the miserable
fortune of the Earle of Armagnac, as all his affections grew
cold to the Kings seruice, and carrying alwaies from that time
this vlcer in his brest he sought the Duke of Bourgondies protection.
All which did but hasten his miserie and the losse of his
libertie.
            We must end this discourse with these words, that the reputation
of the seruices of the Lords of the house of Armagnac done to
France against the English, freed him from all suspition of intelligence
with them, being most certaine that they were neuer no
good English men, they haue alwaies resisted them, they haue spent
their liues and goods to expell them out of the realme, and had
detested them, hauing slaine their Predecessors cruelly and inhumainly.

the Isle of France, who defended the Bourguignons assaults valiantly,
but being prest by necessitie, hee accepted of a composition for
himselfe and his men, to depart with their liues and Armes. But
the trecherie was strange beeing followed by an excesse of brutish
cruelty. As soone as the besieged were disarmed, the Bourgundians

haue been a Sanctuarie vnto him, euery man ranne thither, and
the souldiers made such a slaughter, as the bloud ranne in all places.
The Captaine and his companions were hanged.
            
               
The Duke was no lesse pleased with the bloud then the sacke of
the Towne. Entring into the Church he spake these words more
fitting for a Busiris, then for a Christian Prince, and of the bloud
of the most Christian Kings.
                  In the Chronicle of Lewis the eleuenth these words are read vppon the desolation of Nesle. On Friday the 12. of Iune 1472. the Duke of Bourgundy entred the church on horseback, the which was halfe a foote deep with the bloud of poore Creatures which lay naked and dead there: And when as the said Bourguignon saw them in this maner, hee began to smile and said that he saw a goodly sight, & that he had with him many good butchers. 
               Behold this is goodly, I haue good Butchers.
               Inhumane words of the D. of Bourgundy.
The griefe for the death of Monsieur, and for the losse of
S. Quentin, transported him to these outrages, which then were
noted by the Cassandras of those times, to bee the chiefe cause
which prouoked Gods Iustice to cut off the course of his daies in reuenge
of innocent bloud.A cruel prince continues not long. The Emperor Anastasius the fourth, was so, and had no religion. In the end an old man with a sower countenance appeared vnto him in his d

The Duke of Bourgundy went,
but hee appeared not, for Monsieurs death had made all his desires
subiect to the yoke of feare and reason, so as he was contented
to burne all that quarter of Normandie, euen vnto the
gates of Diepe.
            The same furies of warre which the Duke had caused to be seene
in Normandie were heard vpon the frontier of Champagne, wheras
the Earle of Roussy, the Constables sonne, led them. The Earle
Dauphin of Auuergne did the like in Bourgundy, and in all places
the victory was not famous but by the lamentable estate wherin the
vanquished were left.

came vnto the King being at Pont de See, and brought words and
offers of affection and seruice on the Dukes behalfe, who feared
that the King would make some sodaine inuasion,The D. of Brittaine demands a peace. hauing an armie
of fifty thousand men ready to fall vpon his country.
            The King with all his forcesA Prince should neuer doe all that be may against his enemies. would not doe what he might doe
against these gyant-like enterprises, reseruing his thunder-bolts to

an other season. The more slowly Princes take Armes, the more
difficult it is to draw them out of armies; hee resolued to vanquish
without fighting, and considering that the Lord of Lescun was the
first linke of the chaine of the Duke of Brittanies Councell, that all
the iudgement, conduct and experience in Brittanie did lye in the
person of this Nobleman,
                  Phil. de Com. speaking of the Lord of Lescun saith, that there was neither iudgement nor vertue in Brittanie, but what proceeded from him. who after the death of the Duke of
Guienne his master had retired himselfe to the Duke of Brittanie;
a good and a loyall French man, who neuer would consent that
the places of Normandie should bee giuen vnto the English, hee
thought that if he could draw him to his seruice, the accord which
he should make with the Duke of Brittanie would be more firme,
and withdrawing him from the Duke of Bourgundies alliance hee
should make him so weake as all his forces would not suffice for his
defence.The King drawes the D. of Brittanie from the Duke of Bourgundies alliance ThereWhen as the Prince hath won him that is in most credit and authoritie with him with whom he treats hee doth worke his affaires safely and with aduantage. is nothing so easie as to bring one whether

Duke his master to vnderstand that there is no other safety for his
affaires but the Kings protection. The accord was made so as the
Duke might haue eight thousand pounds starling. The Lord of

            The affaires of Brittany being compounded, the King went into
Picardie. It was his and the Duke of Bourgundies custome euery
yeare to make a truce for six monthes, in the beginning of Winter:
during the which there were many voiages and conferences to
quench the causes of warre, which they held to be shut in the Constables
thoughts, who began to stand in feare of the Duke and to
keep aloofe from the King. Philip de Commines saith that the Chancellor
of Bourgundy came to make it, but as it was the first yeare
of his comming to Court, he was not very curious to vnderstand
the truth, the which is drawne out of the Articles that were published
and signed by the Earle of S. Paul Constable of France, and by
Philip of Croy deputed for the King, and Guy of Brunen Lord of
Imbercourt, and Anthony Rollin Lord of Emery for the Duke of
Bourgundy. The Deputies promised to cause this Truce to be ratified
by the first of December, it ended the first of Aprill following,

            The Constable following the intention of the King his Master,

he had often abandoned them by Letters and words, and yet had

but reason did still reclaime him. That the Duke did then name

he would haue by force that which he refused him vpon his intreatie

liued Peace would be vncertaine,1474. and that one and the selfe
same Sunne would see it spring vp and dye, they make religious remonstrances
and full of Conscience vnto their maisters, and dispose
them to a good reconciliation, for the which by their consents
there was a conference appointed at Bouuines,Assembly at Bouines.
               This Conserence of Deputies for the K. and Duke of Bourgondy at Bouines, in the yeare 1474. was sought by Imbercourt to reuenge the iniury which the Constable had done him at Roy. neere vnto Namur.
The King sent the Lord of Curton, Gouernour of Limosin,
and Iohn Heberge Bishop of Eureux. For the Duke of Bourgondy
came William Hugonet his Chancellour and the Lord of Imbercourt.
            The first proposition was to make away the Constable who was
much aflicted for the Duke of Guiennes death, it was the swarme
which gaue him both hony and waxe.A great authority cānot maintaine it selfe in a season when it is not respected: that of the Constable could not continue but in warre: warre was his element, it entertained his Estats, & made him to bee respected both of the King and the D. of Bourgondy. They held him to be a spirit
of discord from whence came all Inuentions to make peace of no
continuance and warre euerlasting,Resolution taken to do iustice of the Constable. and to maintaine his authority
in Confusion. They said that he was like vnto the bay tree in the hauen
of Amicus which they called mad, for that one branch of it
being put into a ship, all that were in it fell to iarres and deuision.
wherevppon they resolued that who so could first seaze on him,
should put him to death within eight dayes after his taking,
or deliuer him to the other party, to dispose of him at his
pleasure.
            The best resolutions vanish away as soone as they are discouered:
The Constable had an inkling of this proposition,Great affairs should be managed with secrecy & iudgement. The resolution taken at 
                     〈◊〉
                   against the Constable was not secret, he was aduertised, and by this meanes anoided the storme which threat

                  ed him, but this was but to deferre an ineuitable mischefe. and assembled
all the trickes and deuises of his braine to breake off this assembly:
he aduertised the King how the Duke had sought him,The Conble creepes into the Kings fauor to draw him
to his party, and of his great attempts to shake his loyalty, and with
what constancy and generosity hee had reiected his offers, hauing
no desire to affect any greatnes more assured nor any assurance more
happy then the seruice of his King, without the which there is not any
thing in the world, that deserued his loue or remembrance; beseeching
him. Not to beleeue the passionsIt is necessary to haue a sound and perfect Iudgment to discerne with what intention aduertisments are giuen, which concerne the loyalty of a man of credit, for oftentimes they are the practises of Enemies to make them frustrate.

the Deputies of Bouines were the Constables enemies in particular,
and desired to find their reuenge in his disgrace, with the two
Princes.

him.
            The King came neere vnto St. Quentin, spending the time in hunting
about Noion, Compeigne and la Fere, to busie himselfe during
his expectation of the Constable, who knowing the humor of this
Prince to be full of reuenge and disdaine, and that contrary to the
nature of Caesar hee neuer forgat iniurie, hee did capitulate for his
safety of going and returning with conditions too hardy for a subiect.
His health was in humility, and he sought it in pride,It is a great error in a Prince to intreat a subiect like vnto a Soueraigne Prince. By enteruiewes of such inequalitie, there cannot grow any thing but contempt of the greater and vndoubted danger for the inferior which

reputed great.

a distrustfull spirit and a guilty Conscience.Bodies which are easie to purge are also to cure, but when the humor resists the Phisicke, the cure is very difficult.

among his men at Armes, but with his money? That a King
should indure a barre betwixt him and his Vassall to talke together, you
will not beleeue it, you that shall liue after vs, and indure the paine of
such an indiscretion. A great Prince, who dares not refuse his subiect any
thing, is faint hearted.To giue all that is demanded is the act of a man that is not of himselfe but depends of another. Mucho pide el loco, mas loco es elque lo da. A feale demands much, but he is more foole that giues it. It is an act of a free courage to refuse somthing
of a great Prince, to know what should be demanded or denyed, and aboue
all not to grant that lightly which being once giuen cannot be recalled,
nor taken away. O Constable, thou hast done, thou hast done so bold an
act, as thou shouldst bee carefull it should not bee knowne that thou hadst
once presumed to think it.
            The King dessembled all, and although he would willingly haue
forgotten it, yet he tried how difficult a thing it is not to remember
an offence. He could not loose that which he could not keepe,

side soeuer it came, would stil passe ouer his head & neuer hurt him;
that his merits would shield him from al the practises of his enemies

could not bee without him. They did not consider that they neuer

of Burgundy,New designes of the Duke of Bourgondy the King had no thoughts but to vnite the wills and
affection of his subiects to his seruice, and to punish the obstinate.

which Arnold Duke of Guelders, to punish the vanaturall ingratitue

Princes of Germany, who had not said any thing, whilest that this
Prince was busie with his forces along the Riuer of Meuze, could
not now be silent to see him in this designe to passe the Rhin. When

Many were carried prisoners to Basill, and burnt aliue, by iudgement
of the Magistrate for crimes which cannot bee too seuerely
punished.There is noe wickednes that is new, but hath some president. In former times wee haue heard speake of all the the disorders & villanies which are now committed by soldiars. The Chronicle of Basill saies, that these men were burnt for Sodomy, forcing of women, and for that they had profancd Churches, and troden the holy Sacrament vnder foot burnt, murthered and sowed vp womens priuy parts.
            
            In those times they made noe warre in winter, the souldiers retyred
to their garrisons, It beganne againe in Aprill the next yeare
very furiously, and the King was forced to enter into it. The Germaines
and Swisses complayned that hee stood gazing on them

whose greatnesse made all men enuy, and whose dissipation promised
proffit to many.A mightie Prince that is enuied of many maintaines him selfe hardly, & that state which is least enuied is most durable. The Emperor Frederick put men and victualls
into Nuz, and presents him-selfe with all the forces of Germany to
make the Duke dislodge. The King makes warre against him in
Picardy, Bourgoundy and Artois. The Duke of Lorraine sends him
a defie. The Swisses beseege Pontarlier vpon the riuer of Doux,
they take Blammont, Orbe brings them the Keys, and in two
monthes they become Maisters of nine townes or Castells. The
Bourgoundians burnt, 40. villages about Pourrentru and Montbeliard
and spoyled all the Mountaine.
            All this amazed him not, the more enemies the more Triumph.
The greatnesse of his desseignes made all difficulties smale. They
could not represent vnto him so many inconueniences, but hee did
hope for more profit by this Germaine warre.Places takē by the kings troupes in Picardy. The King tooke

were burnt, contrary to that which Phillip de Commines had propromised
them in the Kings name, making the capitulation. It
was not his entent to haue this warre contynue long, but to force
the Duke of Bourgundy to prolong the truce, and to content himselfe
with two or three enemies which hee had without the Realme.
It was not that which the Kings friends desired, for they were discontented
to see him a newter, whilest that he incouraged them to

fight, and this newtrality did not diminish the number of enemies,
nor of friends.Although that neutrality doth not bind friends nor ruine enemies, neque amicos parat, neque inimicos tollit, yet when a Prince hath meanes to be as he may bee

the secret blowes which the King gaue him, desired rather to haue
him an open enemy. He was also so full of reuenge and indignation
against the King, who had gathered together all the clouds, and
wyndes to raise this storme against him, as hee would rather haue
troubled Hell, then not to let him knowe the fury of his passion. His
resolutions were so strange as they did not promise him other safty
then danger. Danger in the continuance of the seege of Nuz:
danger in a new warre against the Swisses, and danger to serue himselfe
with the succors of England, which he attended impatiently.

the Prouinces which depended of the Empire, and the King those
which did hold of his Crowne.
            This Ambassador, more faithfull to him that sent him, then pleasing
to him to whome hee was sent, reapt noe great fruits of his
Legation.An apology for an answere. The Emperors answere was by this Apology. Three

which they should make in selling the skinne, and their Host increased

surpize him, the Beare came out vnto them, and so terrefied them,
as one got into a tree, another fled towards the towne, and the third
not so good a footeman, fell flat on the ground as if he had beene
dead, for he had heard say that this beast pardons dead folks, as the
Lyon doth them that humble themselues. The Beare put his mussell
to his nose and eare, to iudge if he were dead, and thinking him
to be so, for that he held his breth, he left him. Hee that was in the
tree and had obserued all, asked his companion what the Beare
had said in his eare, he tould me said he, that we must neuer make bargin
for the Beares skinne vntill he be dead. Whereby hee would let
this Doctor vnderstand that they must first take the Duke, and then
talke of diuiding his spoile, and that there is noe wisedome which
holds firme when they must resolue vpon that which is to come.It is folly to deliberate vpon things not yet hapened; he that aimes so far off neuer hits the white, we may well foresee diuers accidents, but the variety is so great, as two or three may happen so little foreseene, as they may change all other resolutions.
            
            The Duke contynued the seege before Nuz, meditating furious
reuenges against them that had so ill intreated his subiects. That

great exployt of Arras where hee had lost his cheefe commanders,
did much afflict him, and the mischiefe had bin greater if the Constable
had not moderated it with an apparant falling from his duty
and loyalty to his King, who had commanded him that when as the
Bastard of Bourbon should enter into Artois, hee should beseege
Auennes in Hainault. He spent two or three daies in that seege
very carelesly without watch or gard. If there were courage and

            Hee remayned at Saint Quentin contynuing the traffick of his
faith with the two Princes. Hee sent the Duke word that he was
very sorry the King made his profit of his absence, and he did aduertise
the King that the Dukes affaires were in good estate, thinking
hee should finde noe other safety then in the feares and alarumes
which he gaue them. But when as he saw that this LyonAduersitie humbles great men and makes them mild, as a quarte

his Brother Iames of Luxembourg would goe thether with some
troupes, and not carry Saint Andrewes crosse.
            Hee made these bargaines when as feare prest him, and that hee
knew not whome to trust to diuert the Kings desseignes, but when
as the Danger was past he would noe more heare speake of his promises,

is that hauing imployed some part of the money, leuied for this

as his ancient inheritance, he declared his Armes to be iust to recouer
it, and to set the French at libertie, and to deliuer them from
the oppressions which they endured.
            The Letter being read the King drew the Messenger apart, and
spake vnto him alone with words of such Emphesie as hee left an
opinion in him that the King of Englands enterprise, hauing no
support but the weaknesse of the Duke of Bourgundy, the dissembling
Constable, and the passion of some English, would not finde
any great credit in France, and so he sent him back with a present
of three hundred Crownes and thirty elles of Crimson Veluet, so
full of good will as hee promised not to returne but to offer him a
peace. The Chronicle saies that the King sent vnto King Edward
               
the goodliest Courser he had in his stable, And after that an Asse,
a Woolfe and a wilde Beare, all signes of affection and of other
thoughts then warre and hatred, for it is as great a testimonie of
friendship to receiue a present as to giue.He that giues, offers friendship, & he that receiues it accepts and binds himself to loue. Wherefore among all the pride of the Romans they haue noted this; to disdaine▪ the presents which came not from friends. Pharnax sent a Crowne of gold to Caesar, who sent him word that hee should first doe that which hee was commanded, & then send him presents which Roman Emperors after the happy successe of their enterprises were accustomed to receiue frō their friends.
            
            This great Prince, desiring rather to saue a Cittizen then to kill
an hundred enemies, was resolued not to hazard any thing but money,
preferring the price of an assured Peace before a doubtfull
victorie, and notwithstanding that his Armie was great and mightie,
being in number aboue an hundred thousand men, yet would he

            This descent of the English had three great passions to moue it:
Ambition; Reuenge and feare. The King of England commanded
in his Armie, and Ambition commanded the King of Englands
heart, who promised vnto himselfe the conquest of the whole
Realme. The Duke of Bourgundy reioyced to see the English reuenge
his quarrel, as they had before a wrong done vnto his Grandfather.

                   can never be secnred. there was no rebellion discouered
within any townes, yet there were many great men which
promised vnto themselues that the English would take reuenge
of their discontents. He feared that S. Quentin would be a prey to
his enemies. He was no lesse troubled to keepe the Constable from
failing, then to seeke meanes to punish his fault. He sent to haue
him come vnto him,The King sends for the Constable. to ioyne their Councels together; and to
prepare for a iust defence against his enemies, promising to giue
him the recompence which hee demanded from the Countie of
Guise.
            The Constable let the King vnderstand that he desired nothing
more then to be neere his Maiestie, to yeeld him the dutie of his
seruice, and to make new vowes of fidelity and obedience vnto him,
so as it would please him to sweare vppon the crosse of St Laud
that he would not doe,Hee will haue the K. sweare for his safety. not suffer any harme to be done vnto him.
                  Constantine would not go to the Court of Michel Paphlagon Emperor of Constantinople before he had made him sweare his safety vpon the wood of the true Crosse, vppon the Image of our Sauiour, and vppon the letter which hee had written. Angarus. Cedren. Ann. Pa. 607.
               
            
            It is in the Cittie of Angiers where the people hold this old beleefe,
that whosoeuer sweare vpon this crosse and forsweare themselues,
die miserably before the end of the yeare. The King sent
the Constable word that he had sworne neuer to take that oath to

any man liuing, and that there was not any other but hee would
willingly take, although he should relye vpon his word.Princes will be trusted of their word. It is a great rashnes in a subiect to make his Prince sweare, & euery oth as Plutarke saith, is like a torture giuen to a free man.
            
            This refusall did sufficiently discouer the Kings intent, and the
Constable, knowing that hee had once made no difficultie to take
the same oath for the Lord of Lescun, thought that there was no other
safety for him then not to come neere the King, and not to
see him but by his picture.

            When as the King of England was landed at Calice,The D. of Bourgundy is prest by the English. and found
not the Duke of Bourgundy, he held it for a scorne, and euen then
he discouered his weaknes, and sent him word that if he did not
aduance he would force him to thinke of that which hee did not
desire.
            Behold this Prince reduced betwixt two extremes, all the wisedome
of man could not shew him a meane. He found it dishonorable
to dislodge from before Nuz, and hee found it dangerous
not to ioyne with the English. God had stroken him with
an amazement for the good of France, for if hee had attended the
English at their passage, and not vndertaken the voyage of Germanie,
those two Armies ioyned together had been able to doe that
which diuided was impossible. When as the King of England prest
him to come with speede, the Emperor offered him battell to make
him raise his seege from before Nuz. At the same time when as both
Armies were in view, and that Albert Duke of Saxonie, who carried
the Standard of the Empire, and Albert Marquis of Brandebourg
prest the Emperor to command a chargr, the Trumpets
whom they attended to giue the signe sounded the publication of
a peace,He is forced to raise the siege of Nuz. the last day of May. The secret Article carried this condition,
that the Duke should giue his Daughter to Maximilian
               
and declare her heyre of al his Estates, if he dyed without any sonne.
Munster saith that the Emperor for the desire he had of this mariage
did not all the harme he could unto the Duke, and that hee gaue
him ten thousand florins. The Duke said that he did not retire but
to obay the admonition which the Pope gaue him by his Legate,
to whom the place was deliuered, to coulour his dislodging with
some shew, the which was the more troublesome vnto the Duke,
It is a disgrace to dislodg after a long cō
                  tinuance, which alone should force Townes. But he gaue the Duke this contentment that his enemies were not comprehended in this Treatie. A conditionibus Pacis exclusi sunt Lud. Franc. Rex, Sigismundus Exarch. Austriae. Out of the conditions of peace were excluded Lewis the French King. Sigismond Archduke of Austria, Rene Duke of Lorraine and the Suisses. for that he knew the towne was reduced to extremities, hauing
neither patience, not bread, for aboue ten dayes, hauing endured a
whole yeare all the attempts of the assailant, and all necessities
which doe afflict and make desperate Townes which are sharply
besieged.
            He came posting with a small traine to Calice,He comes to Calice to the King of England being loth to
let the King of England see into what estate his wilfulnes at this
siege had brought his Armie.The Duke of Burgundies armie had beene weakned at the siege of Nuz with the losse of foure thousand men, the remainders did ouerrunne the countries of Lorraine and Bar whilest with a small traine he went to K. Edward to Calice. The Constable, who had presented a
planke to passe the English into France, now drawes it back. He
had promised that as soone as the Armies were ioyned hee would
open the gates of S. Quentin, and hee shootes at them that approch
by the Dukes commandement. And yet to giue a goodly
name to a deformed thingIt is a great pittie said Cato (

                he seekes to make him beleeue by Lewis
of Creuille whom he sent vnto him expressely, that he had shewed
reason and discretion in the fayling of his word, that if he had
receiued his men without some kinde of resistance he should make
himselfe vnprofitable for his seruice, loose the credit which he had
with the French, and the opinion & esteeme which the King made
of his fidelitie:The Constable assures the Duke of his seruice. That nothing could change his affection, whereof
he would giue him such infallible proofes against all men, and without
any exception, beseeching the Duke that the Letter which he
sent him might serue for an assurance of the same intention to the
King of England. These words vowed and sworne with vehemencie,
held the spirits of these two Princes in ballance notwithstanding
that they doubted the contrarie.There is nothing difficult to beleeue when it is affirmed constantly and boldly sworne by any one, although he were held a deceiuer. The efficacy of an oath if it do not beget credit in the mind, at the least it breedes a suspension and doubt of the contrary. Guiceiardin saies in his first booke.

Armie which followed. The King of England cryed out of treason,

            The Duke of Bourgundy gaue excuses and said, that the Constable
had a good intent, and that the place deserued some ceremonies,
that he would not purchase that reproch to haue yeelded
at the first sight of the enemy, and that he knew his humor not to

attempt any thing, but when he may doe it safely, profitably, and
honorably.
            He thought otherwise in his heart, and Edward knowing well
that the Constable deceiued them,The K of England repents that he beleeued did not conceale it that the duke
had done him wrong to imbarke him vpon his assurances. The
Duke take his leaue, vnder a pretext to goe fetch his forces, and
retired into Brabant to passe at Mezieres into the Dutchie of Bar.
The King of England did not like of the reason of his sodaine departure,
knowing well that the Dukes affaires were in no good estate,
and might impaire. The English were amazed and discouraged,
as they are commonly which ground their enterprises vpon
the promises and passions of strangers.They that haue needs of forraine succors promise wonders to ingage them, and doe not commonly performe halfe their promises. Their wils wauered betwixt
hope and repentance. For all the Townes whereof they
promised themselues the conquest, and which they had sometimes
held, they had onely Perronne, and that was but by way of passage
to refresh them. The season was incommodious. The Duke
of Brittanie remained quiet to see the game, and who should win.
He had incensed the King too much, who had new drawne, from a
Secretarie of England, two Letters written by Vrse,
               The Duke of Brittanie promised to loyne his forces with those of England, and to receiue 3000. English. This designe was discouered by two letters written by Vrse, who then serued the D. of Brittany. the one vnto
the King of England, and the other to Hastings his Lord Chamberlaine,
which discouer his practises, and the promise which he
had made to ioyne with the English.
            All these reasons make Edward incline to a peace, he hath some
about him would gladly haue re-past the sea: His chiefe seruants
were not very eager of warre, and remembring the entertainment
at S. Quentin, they found that the English were too blame to
trust in the French against the French, and to beleeue that Rauens
will pick out one anothers eyes. The Ceremonie was, who should
speake first, there was not any one betwixt these two Princes that
would attempt this mediation, they thought that hee which should
first demand a Peace had confest himselfe vanquished. There is a
great disparitie betwixt the affaire of Princes and priuate men, their
rules and Maximes are very different, like to the Kings of Thrace,

people.The dissemblance of the affaires of great men sh

               Haward and Stanley,
               Occasion which caused an ouerture of a Peace. who were neerest about the King of England,
offred an occasion to breake this Ice: They had taken a Groome of
the Kings Armie, who was sent back without ransome, as the first
prisoner of the English. Being at libertie and readie to depart, Haward
and Stanley said vnto him. Recommend vs to the good grace of the
King your Master, if you may speake vnto him. He failed not, and the
King remembring what Garter had said vnto him, found that his
veluet had wrought. These salutations draue him into a great perplexitie.
Whatsoeuer comes from an enemie is to be suspect. He
caused the messenger to be put in Irons, fearing that he was a spie;
he is sounded into, and curiously examined by his most confident
seruants: hee himselfe speakes vnto him, and findes him constant
without varying. This perturbation of minde held him vntill the

next day with the which he sate downe pensiue to his meate.Posture of Lewis the eleuenth, when hee was pensiue. When
as he was in his deepest cogitations, the minde did so neglect the
actions of the bodie and left them in such disorder, as no man would
haue taken him for a wise man.Phil. de Cō. represents in these worlds the grace of K. Lewis, when hee had any fantasie in his head, As soon as he was set at the table and had studied a little as you know he did in such sort as it was very strange to them that did not know him, for without knowledge of him they would haue held him vnwise, but his deeds witnes the contrary.
            
            After that he had been a while pensiue, hee told Philip de Commines
that hee should take away the table, and went to dine in
his chamber, causing the seruant of the Siegneur of Halles to
come vnto him, of whom he demanded if hee would goe into the
King of Englands Armie in the habite of a Herauld. He had bethought
himselfe of this man to whom hee had neuer spoke but
once, and notwithstanding that Phil. de Commines told him that in
his opinion hee had neither stature nor grace, yet would hee not
any other.Iudgement of the King to distinguish spirits He had made choise of him as of a man of good vnderstanding,
and who had, as the Historie saith, a sweet and pleasing
voice. He considered that if the charge hee gaue him did not
succeed, he should quit in disauowing him, and make it knowne
that he was but in a disguised habite like vnto Comediens.
               They demanded of Polistratidas Embassador of Sparta if he came in the behalfe of the commonweale, or of himselfe, hee answered eloquently. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . If you
grant me that which I demand, said Polistratidas, I will cause my selfe
to be aduowed, if not, I let you vnderstand, that I haue no charge.
            He would not accept this charge for any thing that Philip de Comines
could say or promise him, he fell vpon his Knees as if hee had
beene condemned to die.When as the King thought this man was in a good humour, he sent the master of his horse for the banner of a trumpet, to make him a coate of Armes, for the K. was not curious, nor accompanied with Heralds and Trumpets as many princes be. Phil.: de Com. l. 4. c. 7.
                The King came and spake with him,
and wonne him at the first word,A Herald sent to the King of England. promising him mony, and the
office of an Esleu in the Ile of Rez. Hee must be attired, and there
was some trouble to make him a coate of armes, and more to send
him away secretly and not to seene, but most of all to instruct him in
that which he should say. His coate of armes was in a bouget behind
his saddle, hauing commandement not to put it on vntill hee
did enter into the English army. Philip de Comines obserues in
this place the little care and curiosity the King had of the markes of
the greatnesse of the Maiesty of Kings, when he saith that there was
not a coate of armes to be found in all his campe, and that they
were forced to make one of the banner of a trompet to attyer this
Herald. Souueraigne powers were neuer without them.Princes haue alwaies had marks of greatnes & maiesty. The Senate ordained foure & twenty Sargents to march before Augustus. Before that the Roman Emperors had fire and a diademe for marks of maiesty, they had maces and rods enuironed with boyes. Excubiae arms cetera Anlae, saith Tacit, watching Armes and the rest of the Court.
            
            Being come into the army, he was conducted to the king of Englands
tent: they demanded of him what he was, whence he came,
and what he would. His coate of armes made answer to the first
demand, and for the rest he said, that he had commandement to speake
vnto the King, and to addresse himselfe to Haward and Stanley. The
King of England was then at diner, in the meane time they made
the Herald good cheere, and then presented him vnto the King
to deliuer his charge.Instructed by the Signeur of Argenton. Wee must stand to that which hee hath
written that did instruct him, and who hath reported it after this
manner.
            That the K. had long desired to be in friendship with him; and that the
two realmes might liue in peace: and that neuer since hee was King of

France,The Heralds speech to the King of England he had not made warre, nor attempted any thing against the
King nor the Realme of England, excusing him-selfe
                  These Prepositions seeme nothing generous, they argue feare and ere vnworthy of a great Prince, who should let his enemies know that he did not demand nor accord any thing by force. But Phil. de Com. excuseth the K. and saith, that: If God had not disposed the King to choose so wise a party, the Realme had been in great danger. Then he addes. Wee had then many secret matters among vs vvhence had sprung great inconueniences vnto the Realme and that sodainly if the accord had not been soon made, as wel from Brittaine as other places. And I verily beleeue by matters which I haue seene in my time that God had and hath a speciall care of this Realme. for that he had
formerly entertayned the Earle of Warwicke, and said that it was onely
against the Duke of Bourgundy and not against him. Hee also let him
vnderstand that the said Duke of Bourgundy had not called him, but to
make a better accord with the King, vppon the occasion of his comming,
and if there were any other that had a hand in it, it was but to repaire
their errors, tending to their priuate ends: and touching the King of
Englands interest they cared not what became thereof, so as they might
make their owne good. Hee also layed before him the time and winter
which approached, and that he knew well he was at great charge, and that
there were many in England both of the Nobility and Marchants which
desired to haue warre in France. And if the King of England should doe
his endeauour to harken to a treaty, that the said king would doe the like,
so as he and his realme should remaine content: And to the end he might
be better informed of these things,Hee demands a pasport for a Conference. if he would giue a pasport for an hundred
horse, that the king would send Ambassadors vnto him well informed
of his will, or if the king of England desired it should rather be in
some Village midway, betwixt both Armies, and that the Deputies of
either side should meet there, he would be well content, and would send a
safe conduct,
            Many thought that King Edward would haue said vnto the Herald.
We will talke in Paris.
               
                  Arsaces K. of the Parthians sent to tell Crassus that if he were sent by the Romans to make warre against him, hee would haue no peace: but if he came of his owne free will to possesse his Contry, that then hee would suffer them to depart with their liues and goods, wherevnto Crassus said brauely. I will make you an ansvver in the Towne of Seleucia: the Parthian Ambassador began to smile, and shewing him the palme of his hand, hee said. Crassus thou shalt sooner see haire grow in this hollow of mine hand, then the Citty of Seleucia in thine.
                but this first ouerture was so pleasing,Ouerture of a peace betwixt the two Kings.
as he granted pasports for the Deputies of the conference. England
had rather forced then perswaded him to the Chimeras of this war.
He had leuied great summes of money for his passage, the warre
drew them out of his cofers, peace kept them there and added more.
Ciuill warre had so weakened and impouerished England, as at
need they could neither hope for men nor money. Hee had caused
some of the Deputies of the Commons of England to passe with
him,Reasons which perswaded the English to peace. they were already weary of the warre and to lodge after the
manner of Soldiers. These men did allow of this proposition of
Peace, and said that it was iust and reasonable,It is a weakenes in a Prince to make it apparantly knowne, that hee desires a peace. It is indiscretion to refuse it when it is iust. If a Peace bee iust and honest, saith Polibius 4. it is in truth good and goodly: yet must they not doe any thing that is vniust and vnreasonable, nor suffer any shamefull thing to bee done to enioy it. that it were indiscretion to refuse it, and that they should be contented to haue reduced
the French King to seeke a peace with the King of England, for
that a great King cannot humble himselfe more, nor descend lower,
then to seeke his enemy for a peace.
            Pasports were dispatcht of either part, and the Deputies entred
into conference in a Village neere vnto Amiens, in view of both armies,
which were but fower leagues asunder. The Bastard of Bourbon,
Admirall St. Pierre: and Heberge Bishop of Ereux for Lewis;
Haward, one Challenger, and Morton who was afterwards Chancelor

of England for Edward. The Ouerture of the assembly was by a
demand of the Realme of France, which the English said did belong
vnto them, grounding their pretensions vppon those of Edward the
third
                  Edward the third King of England sonne to Edward the second, and to Marguerite or Elizabeth of France, disputed the Regency and Royalty in the yeare 1328. who as sonne to Elizabeth daughter to Phillip the faire, had
first disputed the Regency, and then the succession of the Crowne,
against Philip of Valois, thinking to ouerthrow the ancient order of
the Salike Law.The Salike law excludes woemen from the succession of the Crowne, it carries these wordes. Nulla portio hereditatis mulieri veniat, sed ad virilem sexu
                        ••
                      tota terrae hereditas perueniat. Let noe portion of the inheritance come vnto the woman, but let all the inheritance of the land descend vnto the Male. The English from a Generall demand come vnto
a particular, and restraine it to the Dutchies of Normandy and Guienne.
It was answered that as Edward had no interest to the whole,
so his felony had depriued him of the parts.
                  Edward the third did homage to Philip of Valois for the Dutchies of Guienne and Normandy calling him his deere Lord and Cousin, in the Cathedrall Church of Amiens the 6. of Iune 1333.
            
            As the King was resolued not to giue them any land, so would
he not refuse whatsoeuer they reasonably demanded in money,
when there is no question but of money, a Prince should not bee
sparing nor difficult. The safety and felicity of an estate is not measured
by a certaine price.A Prince should not respect money to send away an enemy; and rather then to giue him any part of his estate with the which hee may liue in feare to loose all he should hazard any thing. Hee winkt at all that, as well as at sundry
other formalities which the maiesty of the Crown of France would
not haue suffered to passe in another season, for in all this negotiation
Edward gaue him noe other stile but his Cousin Lewis of
France.
            Hee offers them threescore and fifteene thousand Crownes for
the charges of the Army,Articles of a peace betwixt Frāce and England. the Crowne being 33. solz a peece; the
marriage of his Sonne the Dauphin with the Princesse of England,
and a Pension of fifty thousand Crownes yearely vntill the marriage
be consummated. These offers were accepted, a Truce was concluded
for nine yeares, and Hostages giuen by the King of England
for the retreat of his army. There was also a Compromise vppon a
penalty of three millions of Crownes to determine and compound
their Controuersies within three yeares by the iudgement of foure

that a man of any sence would haue spoke so vnworthily of his maister

                To conclude the Constable as Creuille
said, thought it fit they should purchase a truce of the English
and that they should giue them some towne, as Eu and St. Valery.
            The King being content with that which hee had heard, tould
Creuille that the Constable should heare from him. He set Contay at
liberty to go and report vnto the Duke of Bourgondy what hee had
heard behind the Portall of the Constables dissimulations, who
sent his Confessor vnto the King of England to aduise him not to
trust vnto the Kings words, nor to attend vntil he did willingly giue
him Eu and St. Valery,The Constable perswades K. Edward not to trust K. Lewis.
                but to seaze thereon by force, to winter his
troopes, in hope to lodge them better and more at large, and hee
offered fifty thousand Crownes to aid him to make warre. Tell your
Maister, answered the King of England, that he is a deceiuer, that I
repent me not of a peace, seeing he hath repented him of that which he
had promised me. The King notwithstanding to let the Constable vnderstand
that he did esteeme his CouncellsThere are some thinges wherein it is better to bee deceiued then to distrust. The King was well informed of the Constables infidelities, & yet to entertaine him in good humor, and not to giue him occasion to doe worse hee commends his Councells. gaue Eu and Saint
Valery to the King of England onely to lodge in during the treaty,
of Peace. But hee had giuen such order as the English in these
townes were rather in prison then in Garrison.
            The Constable by Edwards answer saw himselfe almost in dispair
with more subiect to be amazed how hee liued then to reioyce that
he was liuing, apprehending on the one side seruitude, and on the
other punishment, and seeing no other port in this torment of mind
but death.
            The Dukes of Bourgundy and Brittanie were comprehended
in this truce if they would. The Duke of Bourgundy being aduertised
of this Treatie, came from Luxembourg with sixteene horse to
finde King Edward, who discouered in his Cousins face theIt is an extreame misery to stand betwixt 2. great powers & haue no meanes to maintaine himselfe. A little nag betwixt 2. great horses, is alwaies subiect to some stripe. spleene

he demanded of him what brought him. I came, said the Duke, to

wherevpon the Duke, who could not containe his choller, and who
came to speake what he would, not considering that he might he are
what he would not, t demanded of the King of England if hee had
made a Peace. No said Edward, but a Truce for nine yeares, in the
which you are comprehended with the Duke of Brittanie, I pray you accommodate
your selfe vnto it. The Duke replyed in English, which hee
vnderstood and spake. That his Armie should not haue past the
sea for that this Treatie ruined the reputation of the Kings of England,
and that he had need of that Lyons heart interred at Rouen.

choller left him there: He went to horseback, and so returned as
he came being well content to haue said that which hee would say
to him, who had not done that which he would doe, and carrying
in his heart a wonderfull discontent that this Treatie tooke from
him the meanes to purchase glorieTo loose the occasion of any great matter by the meane of Armes is a very sensible griefe to a great courage. Epaminondas did shew it in causing his sonnes head to be cut off who had won a Battell, cōplaining that he had depriued him of part of his glory. at the Kings charge, and once
againe to giue him a Battell.

            The King fearing that the Duke of Bourgundies choller and
the Constables practises would cause Edward repent, or make him
distrust the expectation of that which had been promised, would
make his proceedings free from all suspition. Confidence is the
true cyment of friendship.Good cheer made to the English at Amiens. The English entred continually in what
troupes they would into Amiens. There were long Tables at the
gates furnished with good meate and delicate wines, and good
companions attended to entertaine all that came. All the Tauerns
and Innes were full. The Marshall of Gié hauing charge to obserue
how the English liued, came one morning into a Tauerne
where they told him they had alreadie made a hundred and eleuen
reckonings,Gran favores comery no escotar. and it was not yet nine of the clock. Among other
commodities the souldiour found it sweet to dine well and not to
pay any thing. It was in the Kings power to cut the throats of nine
or ten thousand, who could neither goe on their legges, nor finde
the gates to returne vnto their quarters, they were so full. They

were content to see them drunke with wine, who would haue been
drunke with bloud. But when they came and told him that it was
dangerous to suffer so many men to enter, he left his howers which
he was saying, and the ceremony of Innocents.The Romans did obserue good daies to assaile but all were good to defend. Macrob. l. Satur. cap. 16.
                All daies are good
and fit to care for defence and safety.
            We must beleeue that which he saies that saw it and hath written
it. The King being vp and saying his howers, one came and
told him that there were at the least nine thousand English in the
Towne. I resolued to aduenture to tell him, and entring into his retiring
place I said vnto him. Sir, although it be S. Innocents day yet
is it necessarie that I tell you that which hath been deliuered vnto mee,
and so acquainted him at large with the numbers that were entred, and
still came, all armed, and that no man durst refuse them the gates, least
they should be discontented. The King was not obstinate, but soone left
his deuotion, and told me that they must not keep the ceremonie of Innocents:
               The Christian religion holdes the obseruation of daies superstitious. Eas culpat, saith St 
                  Aug. qui dicunt non proficiscat hodie quia praeposterus dies est. It blames them that say I will not goe forth this day because it is ominious. whereby wee may gather that the day whereon the Feast of
Innocents fell was for all the rest of the yeare following superstitiously
ceremonious to this Prince, on which hee would not haue
them speake vnto him of any affaires, Phil. de Commines hauing
been in danger of a disgrace vpon that occasion.
            Yet he receiued this aduice in such an humor as he beleeued that
he might referre his deuotion to another time and dispence with it,
to the end that he might prouide that this troupe should retire quietly.The King dines at the gate of Amiens.
He caused his dinner to bee carried to the Porters house, not
to shew his distrust, but to make much of the English which came
in and out. He stayed some to eate at his table, and made others
drinke, and withall prouided for the safety of the Towne, hauing
caused three hundred men to be armed in their Captaines houses,
and appointed some vpon the Portall to obserue the entrie of the
souldiers. The King of England being aduertised of this disorder
sent to intreat the King not to suffer them to enter. That shall not be,
answered the King, but if it please him to send some Archers of his
gard to the Port, they shall let in whom they will. This was done, the
King hauing by his dissembling obtained that which some greater
brute had made difficult.
            But Lewis had no money in his Coffers to pay the summes that
were agreed vpon. He found how difficult it is to draw money from
a multitude in an vrgent necessitie.Although they say that a Prince should haue no other treasure then in subiects purses, yet there may fall out such vrgent occasions as if behaue it not in his owne Coffers he is in dangerous estate. His Treasurers refused him,

                  Piquigny noted by the Predictions of England. This was at Piquigny a towne
which the Sibilles of England had long before noted for so great
and happie an action. They made a barre vppon the bridge of the
riuer of Somme, in such sort as they might passe their Armes freely,
yet without any wicket for their bodies, the King remembring
that he had heard say,That which is past teacheth the present. In the like occasion Duke Iohn was slaine at Monter eaufaut Yonne, whether he was come vnto the Dauphin, who since was Charles the seuenth, to treat an accord. that the doore which was left at the Barre
at Montereau Faut-Yonne did serue to aduance the execution
which caused so many calamities in France. For Duke Iohn being

inuited to passe with three more not two paces off receiued the
mortall blow from Taneguy of Chastell.

that he was in his owne house,Enteruiew of the two Kings at Piquigny. and receiued a strange Prince.Many take this ceremonie otherwise, and that it is for the greater Prince not to come first vnto the place, but to be stayed for. He
was accompanied by the Duke of Bourbon, and the Cardinall of
Bourbon his Brother. In these actions of shew hee tooke delight
to haue some one attired like himselfe. Phil. de Commines was so
that day. He had eight hundred men. Edward came thither after,
being aduertised by a Gentleman of the Kings arriuall.

There were foure English Lords on Lewis side, and as many French
of Edwards, to see if there were any practise to the preiudice of
their master.

                  Edward a goodly Prince. with a great Iewell of
stones made like a Flower-de-Luce, a goodly Prince and of a gallant
stature, but began to grow grosse.
                  Phil. de Cō. saith, that Edward was one of the goodliest Princes of that age, but at this enteruiew hee began to grow grosse. Beauty is a qualitie which doth adorne the rest which are necessarie in a Prince. But this is vaine without the rest, it is more fitting for a woman, and serues but to please. Maximin son to the Emperor Maximin was so fair as the women desired to be beloued of him and that hee would make them mothers. Iul. Cap.
                Comming within two or
three paces of the Barre, he put off his Cap and made two or three
low reuerences before hee came vnto the King who attended him
leaning vpon the barre, after very kinde imbracings, to make the
heart speake by these demonstrations of loue and affection, the
Peace was sworne vpon the Masse-booke and the Crosse.
            The King, who knew Edwards humor, fitted his Discourse to entertaine
him with a content which cost him nothing, entermixing
still some merry speech among their most serious affaires. And
for that Edward had youth, beauty and loue in him, hee intreated
him not to returne into England before he had seene the Ladies of
Paris, and that the Cardinall of Bourbon who was their present
should giue him absolution. Edward shewed by his eyes and his
silence that this Sumons was pleasing vnto him. The King prest him
no farther,The King offers that which hee would not haue accepted. remembring that his Predecessors had beene too familiar
there. These two Princes were so cunning as it was hard for the
one to haue any aduantage of the other: the policy of the one appeared
outward and the other kept his close within.Some shew their Art at the first incounter, others hold it secret and there the deceit is not discouered, before one is deceiued. Heerevnto is applyed the controuersie which was betwixt the Foxe and the Leopard for the variety of their skinnes. The Leopard bragd that his was fairest without, being marked with diuers spots, that is nothing (said the Foxe) my variety is within.
               
            
            They conferred long together to open their hearts one vnto
an other, or rather for Lewis to discouer Edwards thoughts, who
for that he was not like vnto him in iudgement and experience, was
not so warie. The King found that hee had an extreme desire to assist
and defend the Duke of Brittany, and that hee held himselfe
bound vnto it, saying that hee had neuer found a better friend at
need. As for the Duke of Bourgundy hee did not seeme to bee so
carefull of his fortune, for when as the King said vnto him, What
shall wee doe if my Brother of Bourgundy will not enter into the Truce.
               
The King of England answered.
                  Lewis soūds K. Edwards thoughts. 
               I will summon him againe, and if he
will not hearken to it, I referre my selfe to you two.
            
            The Constables fortune remained. In the first conference of
the Treatie, the King of England being highly offended that hee
had fayled of his word, had said that hee could let the King know
his bad seruants, and how to conuict them of treason towards his
Maiestie. The Deputies had not much regarded it, holding it to
be a pollicie to terrifie the King with such practises and Intelligences,
and although there had been some thing, yet the estate of the
Kings affaires did not allow of too curious a search of the fidelity
of his subiects,There are seasons when as it is not good to discouer all diseases to moue humours not to purge the bodie. It was told Pompey that there were amōg Stertorius papers many Senators Letters, who exhorted him to come into Italy and to attempt against Rome, but Pompey did an Act not of a yong man, but of a graue & setled in

                  gement, causing all his Letters to be burnt, and not suffring one to be read. Plut.
                but the King, who contemned not any thing,
thought that it was an Arrow shot against the Constable, & therefore
he desired to be satisfied from Edward, who dissembling not his
great discontentment against the Constable, related vnto him the
whole History of his preuatications, and for proofe thereof deliuered
two Letters into his hands.
            After a long discourse, accompanied with infinite shews of loue,
honor, and respect, the two Kings parted. Edward past by the Sea,
leauing Hostages in the delights and feasts of Paris, and the chiefe
Noble men of his Court talked of nothing but the Kings bountie.
The Heralds and trumpets of England at their parting cryed out.

               The King went to lie at Amiens, by the way he entertained himselfe
with that which he had obserued in this Action, speaking these
words to Phil. de Commines confidently.
               A wise obseruation of the king. I found the King of England
so willing to come to Paris as it did not please me. Hee is a goodly King,
and loues women much, hee might finde some Mignion at Paris, who
would tell him so many goodly tales as he might haue a desire to returne.
His Predecessors haue beene too much in Paris and Normandie. His
company auailes me nothing on this side the Sea, but on the other side
he is my good brother and friend.
            Being come to Amiens, and ready to set downe to meate, Haward,
one of the Hostages, thinking to doe him a great pleasure,
came and told him in his eare that if he pleased he would draw the
King of England vno Amiens, and it might bee to Patis to make
good cheere there with his Maiestie. The King (who hauing saued

it did not please him; and as if he had thought of other matters,
he began to wash and to speake of other things. Haward remembred
him after supper, hauing not obserued the Kings intention
by the first euasion. The King being prest by his importunity,
said that he was then ready to goe to horse, to see what the Duke of
Bourgundy would doe, and to make him runne the hazard of
Armes, seeing he had contemned the opportunitie of an accord.

and money he had sent away the English. This flowing of words
with more truth then wisedome, came to the hearing of a Gascon
Marchant remaining in England, who was come into the Cabinet
to craue leaue to transport a certaine number of pipes of wine
Impost free.Heard by a Gascon Marchant. The King would haue been glad that this man hauing
seene the Palace of his Councels bare and vncouered, had
been blind & deafe, but he made no shew of it acknowledging notwithstanding
that discretion had not beene arbitrator betwixt his
tongue and heart, that the Marchant had seene and heard too
much,There haue beene Princes which haue put their seruants to death hauing heard wordes the report whereof was dangerous. Alexander dealt therein more discrectly, for finding that Ephestion had seen in his letter an aduice of importance, he only toucht his lippes with his seale without any word speaking, and Lewis de

(which was but in the bud) to wither,Cause not foreseene of a good fortune. if these words were reported
vnto him. He therefore resolued to buy this Marchant vpon some

pretext of seruice. He imployed Philip de Commines who wonne
him, offering him an office in the towne where hee was borne, the
transport of the wines which he demanded, and a hundred pounds
starling to send for his family, but vpon condition that he should
not goe into England, the King condemning himselfe willingly in
the penaltie, for that he had spoken too freely.
            The most couragious, but especially the French which were
retired into England blamed this peace. Many held it for a worke
of heauen, saying that it had accomplished the Prophesies which
the holy Ghost had made,Men draw great Predictions from small matters. In the Concla

                  e held for the election of a Pope, after the death of Paul the fourth a Doue flying rested vpon the Cell of Cardinal Iohn Ange Mediguin who was named Pius the fourth, and it was taken for an assurance of his election. that a white Doue the day of the enteruiew
of the two Kings had sat vpon King Edwards tent, and that
all the noise of the Armie could not driue her away.
            A Gentleman Gascon called Bretailles, who serued the King of
England, was discontented at the Peace, and mockt at his iest.
He said that this Doue being beaten with the raine had fallen vpon
this tent as the highest to dry her selfe in the Sunne. He talked
with Phillip de Commines, who knew him and said, You had reason
to laugh at vs. To whom Commines (but not touching that) said.
How many Battels hath your King woon?Wisedome of Phil. de Com. to auoid a needlesse discourse. Nine answered Bretailles,
K. Edward the fourth was in nine Battels fighting on feet to assure the Crown of Englād on his head and to ruine the house of Lancaster. 
               And how many hath he lost? one onely, which is that vvhich hee
might haue woon in France, so great a losse as it hath blemished the honour
of nine which hee hath wonne, for this tenth vvas the crowning of
all the rest.
            
            They came and told the King that this Gascon was a free spoken
man, and that in the libertie of his speech he might make his masters
thoughts knowne, and alter the mindes of many. The King
sent for him, caused him to dine at his table, and by his purse stopt
his mouth and made him say as the rest, that the holy Ghost had
made the Peace. In one houre Bretailles setled an assured reuenue
for euer vpon the timiditie of this Prince.We may say of King Lewis as Plutark did of Nicias, he gaue not lesse to thē that might doe ill, then to those that deserued well, & who were worthy to taste of his bounty, so as his feare was a reuenue & rent vnto the wicked, as well as his bounty was vnto good men.
            
            The Duke of Bourgundy seeing that the King of England was
farre off, began to bethinke himselfe. He had seene the inconstancie
of the English. Contay had represented vnto him that of the
Constable, and the discourse which hee had heard behind the Portall.
All this would not suffer him to grow obstinate against reason,
and moreouer the King is armed against the frontier of Hainault,
who demands it, and offers to doe it, and he hath a liuely
impression of the great perplexitie which an irresolute soule doth
suffer that liues in suspence betwixt hope and feare.Whilst our soules are in suspence betwixt hope and feare, wee doe not enioy the present, and the future torments vs.
            
            
               Hugonet the Dukes Chancellor sent the King word that if it
pleased him to send his Deputies vnto the bridge,Treatie of Peace betwixt the King & the D. of Bourgundie. mid-way betwixt
Auennes and Veruins, the Dukes should be there to resolue vpon
that which was presented. The King would be present notwithstanding
that his Councell disswaded him, and hee led with him
Haward and Cheney, Hostages which the King of England had left.
One of them being sorrie for the Peace, seeing the Deputies for
the Duke of Bourgundy accompanied with a great number of soldiers
well mounted and armed, said, that if the Duke of Bourgundy

had shewed many such to the King of England, hee had
not so suddenly repast the Sea. Philip de Commines, to whom these
words were spoken, answered not any thing, he had so great patience
in hearing, and such stay in his speech, as it was no paine
for him to hold his peace in occasions where the tongue sometimes
escapes:He that is not patient to hold his peace, can not be discreet in speaking.
            
            The Vicont of Narbonne who had heard them, said, that without
doubt the Duke of Bourgundy had a good number, but the
English had so great a desire to returne into England, as they
were contented with six hundred pipes of wine, and a pension
which the King gaue them. This English man who was much altered
with this Peace, found his griefe doubled with this flout, and
all fuming with choller, hee said, It is true that was told vs, that
you would iest at vs, call you the money which the King giues vs a Pension?,
Euery man giues what names hee pleaseth to things. That which in effect was a pension, the English call tribute. An insupportable word to a free Nation. Saluian lamē

and from serious and biting as it was, and might haue been
worse (for the French would neuer haue endured that they should
haue termed France tributarie to England) turned it to a Iest. But
the Englishman was discontented, and complained to the King,
who was much offended with the Vicont of Narbonne, who had
not considered that to bad demands good answeres cost little and
profit much, and that a small matter cals back an enemie who departs

            The Deputies of either side met, but could not agree, euerie
one seeking to maintaine his owne. The King told his that he would
not haue so many words, and causing the Dukes deputies to come,
he shut himselfe in with them, and before they parted concluded a
Truce for nine yeares, beginning the 13. of September, 1475. and
ending the same day in the yeare 1484. The Duke would haue
Baldwin Bastard of Bourgundy, the Lord of Renty, Iohn de Chata,
and Philip de Commines excluded and to loose the benefit of this
Truce, the which notwithstanding was not so soone published
to saue the Dukes oth, who had sworne not to hearken vnto it so
soone.
            As they were vpon the Treatie the King of England, being discontented
that the Duke of Bourgundy treated apart, sent Thomas
of Montgomerie vnto the King, to assure him that be would return
in the Spring with a mighty Armie, to finish the Duke of Bourgundies
ruine, but the King, who loued him well where he was, answered,
that the Truce which was then in question, was no other then
what had been made with him without any alteration, but that
the Duke desired to haue his Letters Patents apart.
            Thus a peace was made both with the English and Bourgundians.
These mists which were so thick as there was no hope to see
the Sunne all the day, were disperced in a moment, leauing France
in the same cleerenes that it was before.
            The wisemen of those times saw and did acknowledge the particular

care of Gods prouidence ouer this Monarchy hauing by his
singular grace escaped so terrible a storme. It was not the first brunt,
nor the greatest fit which tryed the firmenes of her forces. The
foundations of this Estate are so well layed,Al the estates in the world haue tried her Inconstancie, what are become of the Empires of Assiria, of Persia, of Media, of Egypt, of Iudea, & of Macedon. Quicquid in altum

wisely preuented all kindes of accidents, that although there bee
nothing constant in the world, and that nature turnes euery thing
sometimes aboue, sometimes beneath, yet it stands amidst the
greatest shakings, and supports it selfe like a Colosse with his owne
waight. The composition of this body is so strong and vigorous,
as it entertaines it selfe euen with his excesse and disorders: other
Estates with all their good order are not in better case, and the least
disorder they commit brings their life in danger.
                  Plutark said, that the reputation of Sparta was like vnto a body which alwaies tooke a dyet, & which was distempered with the least disorder.
            
            The Kings wisedome was the Instrument of Gods prouidence
to free this Realme from the danger which did threaten it. It is
true that if necessitie, which hath no law, did not excuse the proceedings
of this Prince, and if the honour of the action did not remaine
to him that hath the profit, there might be exceptions taken
to that which the King did to haue this Peace. A wise Prince and
lesse fearefull would haue aduentured a Battell, rather then be subiect
to his enemies pride, but these high and generous formes of
treating are buried in the ruines of proud and triumphant Rome,
and there is nothing remaining but admiration which the History
represents. The Romans neuer receiued condition nor capitulation
As the Romans did neuer receiue offers nor conditions from an enemy, so long as he was armed, so did they neuer goe whether they called them.

of their authoritie. Neuer did they allow a stranger, how great so
euer, to enter into their lodging on horseback.When as Tigranes came to Pompey, to yeeld himselfe into his hands, the Sargeants told him that he must light, for that no man was euer seene to enter on horseback into the Romans lodgings. Pl

the seruices which he might doe him, and when as he saw his affections
altered, his will also grew could, making it knowne that great
hatred proceeded from great friendship.The fauors & benefits of Princes are not for the respect of the persons, but in consideration of seruices and merits which they find in their seruants: when these qualities change, it is not strange if in like manner their fauors and affections alter.

him aduice of all that had past with the English, and that for the troble

obedience. This promise bound the Duke to doe Iustice of the Constable

            Although the Duke were wholie bent to ruine the Constable, yet
did hee not thinke it reasonable to deliuer him into the Kings hands

long the accomplishment of this promise. And on the other side

condemned himselfe alreadie by the feeling of his Conscience, so
his seruants accused him of want of courage for that he had not attempted
some other way rather then that of the Greue. Thereuppon
they made him passe by S. Anthonies gate to enter into the Bastile,
with his hat pulled downe in his eyes to hide his face, being
full of palenesse and shame of so tragicall a condition. Three howers
after that the Dukes men had deliuered him they receiued letters
of countermand, forbidding them to deliuer him, but this defence
came too late.
            The eyes of man cannot behold the Sunne firmely, yet they see it in
a bason. It is impossible to comprehend the iudgments of the Sunne
of Iustice, we must consider them in the life and variety of the Constable,

which past like an arrow in the water, as soone as euer he was
prisoner it was sayed that he would neuer come forth, and he himselfe
thought that in losing his liberty he could not saue his life, that
he was a dead man, and that it was a folly to desire lifeHe that will not do any thing wherby it may be knowne dying that hee hath liued, should not desire life. The Troglodytes said, that such a desire of life for one that had done nothing worthy to liue, was an extreame misery. Dio. lib. 3. c. 3.
                seeing that
in liuing he could not doe any thing to reuiue his reputation.
            When he was come into the Bastile he found the Chancellor there
with the first President, and some councellors of the court, prepared
to reuenge the publike iniurie, and to make knowne what the body
feeles when the head is hurt
                  Areius capito said, that it did much import the Common weale to punish them rigorously who had in any sort attempted against the Prince, vnlesse they will say that the Body hath no cause to grieue when the head is wounded. Suet.
                The Admirall tould them that by the
Kings commandement hee did deliuer the Constable ouer vnto
them, to make his processe with all speede, vppon the letters written
and sealed which the King of England and the Duke of Bourgundie
and Bourbon had sent the which he presented vnto them.The want of rewarding the good is not so preiudiciall to an estate, as the impunity of the wicked.
            
            The Empires of the world martcht vppon two feete, vppon the
recompence of good and the punnishment of ill, and they must goe
streight on the one, and not halt on the other, and yet it is better to
faile on the right foote which is the reward of good, then on the
left which is the punnishment of whomesoeuer. On this foote they
went against the Constable, but somewhat to swiftly. Hee saw him
selfe reduced vnto those termes as they did not regard his seruices
past, but his present offences. He beares this affliction as impatiently,
They carry prosperities insolently and aduersities impatiently which thinke that neither the one nor the other can euer chāge. as hee past his prosperities insolently.
            They began his processe by his answers. Hee must eyther speake
or beee silent,His processe is made. his words discouer the treason, his silence the Traytor.
There is nothing but pitty to speake for him, and there is not
any to be foūd for crimes of this sort: His own writings were against
him. He cōfest that to maintaine his office of Constable and trouble
the Kings estate he had alwayes entertayned war betwixt the king, &

Guyenne the kings brother & the princesse of Castill he wrote vnto
Msr. aduising him to haue a care▪ how he proceeded, & as soon as he
should be gone into Spayne to fetch his wife, the King was resolued
to send an Army into the Dutchie of Guienne to dispossesse him, &
to make him miserable, and that if he would giue eare to marry with
the Duke of Bourgundies daughter, he assured himselfe to make him
haue her, so as hee would send his seale to the Duke of Bourgundie,
& that he would passe a procuration to obtaine a dispensation of
the oth for his promse of marriage with the Princesse of Castill.

him to haue his seale, the which he would send to the Duke of Sauoy,
he would that they should paffe to the Duke of Bourbon, to draw
him vnto their league and intelligence against the King, who answered

them that he had rather be as poore as Iob

England, to the Queen, to the Earle of Somerset and to Msr. de Candalles
touching the E. of Warwick, that he had writen quite contrary
to the kings intentions. They desired to heare him touching the
barre and Causey of Compeigne. At that word he found his owne
mistaking, and that the perfection of mans actions depends of well

Heraclitus speaking of a great and high cogitation of his spirit, said that he sought himselfe.. He could not denie but that he had there played
the companion with his master. He confest that when he spake
with the king neere vnto Compiegne, he had caused a barre to
be made betwixt the King and him to the end he might talke in safety,
and yet the king notwithstanding past the barre to imbrace him
and to intreat him to holde his partie, the which he promised and
sware, & notwithstanding two dayes after the Duke of Bourgundy
sent one vnto him to know if he would performe that which he promised
him, & to offer him a pension of a thousand pounds sterling.

finde meanes to seaze vppon the king and then kill him or carry him

slowly in a matter of that weight. The treason being apparent, their
opinions tended to death by the courses of extremitie and of the
highest point of Iustice, and the sentence was pronounced in Parliament

and therefore the Siegneur of St. Pierre went early in the morning
to the Bastile to fetch him, comming into his Chamber he demanded
of him what he did, and if he slept? he answered that he had been
long awake but he kept his bed, hauing his head full of fancies. The
Siegneur of St. Pierre told him that the Court of Parliament had
viewed his processe for the expedition whereof it was necessary hee
should be heard. He rose and prepared himselfe to goe vnto the Pallace,
not thinking that from thence he should be led vnto his death.
And for that the Court had ordained that the Seignieur of Estouteuille,
Knight and Prouost of Paris, should accompany him, he grew
into some iealousie that it was to draw him out of the hands of Philip

conceiued an implacable hatred against him, and defamed his reputation
both by writingsIn Iune 1471. the K. by a publike proclamation promised 300. Crownes to him that should discouer the author of Libels that were made against the Constables honor. Henry Mariette who had bin Liefienāt criminal of Paris, and Peter Mercier a Scholler were committed to prison for that fact, but they were absolued. and wordes publikely, would do him
some outrage as he past through the streetes. The Siegneur of St.
Pierre assured him, and freed him from either feare, telling him that
he went not out of one prison to go into another, and that he would
neuer suffer him to be wronged in his company. Thus he went to the
Pallace on horseback betwixt St Pierre and Estouteuille. Being come
to the staires foot of the Pallace, the Lord of Gaucourt, Gouernour
of Paris, and Denis Hesselin came to meet him, to lead him to
the Tournelle, where he found the Chancellor, who hauing exhorted
him to patience, demanded of him the order of St. Michel. The
Constable took it from his neck, kist it, and gaue it him. He had receiued
it from the Kings owne hand, beeing the third of fourteene
which first receiued it.
            
               The Chancellor did also demand the Constables sword of him,
VVhen men in high degrees are condemned to lose their liues, the death of honor by degradation goes before that of the body by punishment. hee answered that it had beene taken from him when he was committed
to prison. This done the Chancellor retired himselfe and left
the Constable in some hope that iustice would bee satisfied with this
degradation of honor, and leaue him the remainder of his life as a
guift, the which notwithstanding he should neither desire nor accept
being offred, hauing lost that which was dearer then it.There remaines nothing to loose for him that hath lost his reputation. Hee dies too late that suruiues his honor. But behold
the President of Popincourt which pronounceth his sentence
and speakes to him after this manner.
               His sentence pronounced. The Court hath and doth declare
you guilty of high treason, for the which it doth depriue you of the office
of Constable of France and of all your offices, honors, estates and dignities,
and for punishment it doth condemne you to suffer death, and to
loose your head at the greue, in Paris, it declares all your goods moueable
and immoueable forfeited to the King. And although, considering the

and to be lodged in a Burgesses house of Paris. The fortune of
this Prince was to be pittied, and the consideration of his birth

after the assurances of Protection and defence. This breach was
noted for an infallible presage of the ruine of his house.
            
               
The Annales of the Franche Contie of Bourgundy adde an
other cause, which was, that the Duke had seazed of a great sum
of money at Aussone, which was leuied by the publication of the
Croisadoe, and appointed for the warre against Infidels. From
that time he approched still neere vnto this precipice, making his
graue in his owne designes, as Silke-wormes die in their owne
workes. Hee began to distrust his owne subiects and to take strangers.

the beseeged would giue them time. The Canton of Berne sent
eight thousand men,Swisses co

came to Neuf Chastell the day of the Composition, which was the
last day of February, 1476. On Saterday the third of March they
went to field with an order seemlie in all things, but very profitable
and goodly for the warre,There is nothing so commendable in warre as order bee it in marching or fighting. Xenephon saith that it is the goodliest & most profitable thing in men. Among the precepts of Vegetius this is singular, Vt omnes milites in acic vel in itinere incedendi ordinem seruent. v

Neuf Chastell, they would haue seazed vpon the Castell of Famerku

the Duke had seazed the Day before; the Army hauing recouered
the top of the hill, they descouered that of the duke of Bourgoundy
standing in three great Bartaylons, and their ordinance before
them: The Swisses did not thinke to haue seene them so soone in
that order, and found that it was in good earnest, and that they must
of necessity ioyne.

Eptingen stayed them, shewing them how dangerous it was, for

The Dukes great Diamond which was held a master peece of
the sun, was sold for a Florin to a Priest, who was so religious as he
sent it to the Magistrates of his Canton, who gaue him six shillings
starling. They say that this peece past through many hands for a
small price, at last it came vnto a Geneua Marchant remaining
at Lyon, who sold it for eleuen thousand Florins, and then Pope
Iulio the second had it for twenty thousand. They found also three
Rubies alike, which were called the three Brethren, with other
inestimable Iewels, which were little esteemed by the Suisses. Their
Generall made many Knights after this victorie, three of Zurick,
foure of Berne, two of Basill, and some of Strausbourg. Valour is

some one which excels the rest in merit, should attempt to exceed
them in authoritie: yet it is certaine that Europe for that it hath

by them whom hee contemned and held vnworthy of his courage,
but much more to see that his reputation which hee had so highly

of his fortune stood yet firme as long as hee had an army on foot.
He coniured the chiefe noblemen which suffered in this losse to forget
it, and to change their greefe into wrath against enemies vnworthy
of such a booty, & to make them buy the little profit which they
had gotten at a deere rate.

that he had lost nothing but his reputation, and that he had his estates

him that there were but seauen men at armes slaine,Number of them that were slaine in the battell. but the losse of
the baggage was inestimable. The King being among his most confident
seruants made it appeare that nothing displeased him so much
as the little number. Hee commanded them to make Contay good
cheere, who made no shew to heare the people of Lions singing
through the streetes the shame and ruine of this battel, the courage
of the Suisses and the rashnes of the Bourgondians, for at that time
there was not a Battell but there was presently a Song made of
it.The custome is very antient to make hymms and Songs of Battells and victories. There are examples in Aristophanes and in Plutark in the life of Flaminius. Charle maigne caused a collection to be made of all the rimes of the like subiect.
            
            This hard incounter bred a great alteration in mens mindes and
affections. Those which feared the courage and admired the prosperity
of this Prince, began presently to contemne him after the newes
of this rout. There was not any friend, no loue. Galeas Duke of Milan
renouncing the alliance the had made with him, besought the
King to renew those which he formerly had with France, and offers
him a hundred thousand Ducats. The King made this braue & proud
answer to his Ambassador. Tell your maister that I will none of his
money, and that once in a yeare I leuie three times more then hee, as for
peace and warre I will dispose as I please, but if he repent himselfe to
haue left my alliance to imbrace that of the Duke of Bourgondy, I am
content to returne as we was: vpon which wordes the Truces were published
againe.
            
            This good newes augmented the content which the King tooke
at Lion, whether Rene Duke of Aniou came to see him. This good
Prince who had seene the death of his three sonnes,
                  Rene Duke of Aniou comes to the King. and had but one
daughter
                  Rene Duke of Aniou had by Isabel daughter to Charles Duke of Lorayne three sonnes who died in the flower of their yeares. Iohn Duke of Calabria. Nicholas Duke of Bar. Lewis marquis of Pont, and yoland. put the Duke of Bourgondy in some hope that hee
would adopt him for his sonne: and transferre the rightes of
his house to the Crowne of Sicile, with the Earledome of Prouence

and this Prince had already sent Chasteau Guion into Piedmont with
20. thousand crownes to leuie soldiers and to passe them into Prouence,
to take possession thereof. The King being aduertised heereof
sent to Phillip Earle of Sauoy to seaze vppon Chasteau Guion
with his money and men. Hee had great difficulty to saue his
owne person but lost his money, adding this losse to others which
his maister had receiued.
            The King intreated him to come to Lion, and not to deale with
the Duke of Bourgondy who sought to ruine him. The good old
man being discontented with the Duke of Lorraine, who had forced
him to giue his daughterAfter the death of Charls the first of that name▪ Duke of Lorraine, Rene Duke of Aniou pretended the Duchie, as husband to Isabell daughter to Charles. Hee lost a Battell against the Earl of Vaudemont, and was taken prisoner & forced to giue his Daughter Yoland to Ferry of Lorraine son to Anthony Earl of Vaudemont. 
               Yoland of Aniou to Ferry his sonne,
resolued to this voyage.Complaint of the Du: of Aniou made by the Seneshall. Hee led with him Iohn Cosse Seneshall of
prouence, who with a freedome worthy of the age wherin he liued
and little knowne to them of his nation, (for he was a Sicilien) let
the King vnderstand that all which
                  Rene of Sicile sold to Lewis of Chalon the homage & soueraigntie of the Principalitie of Oranges, his Son submitted it to the Parliament of Dauphiné, and afterward K. Lewis restored it vnto him. Duke Rene had treated with
the Duke of Bourgondy touching Prouence & Sicily, and that which
he had dismembred to the benefit of the Prince of Orange, was only
to make his maiesty know the wrong which hee had done him in detaining
the Castles of Bar and Angers, and crossing him in all his
affaires, that this dispight had forced him to these resolutions, the
which notwithstanding he had no desire to effect if he might otherwise
haue reason from his maiesty.
            The King taking the libertie of this Discourse in good part, as
free from flatterie, and seasoned with discretion,To fit a discourse to flattery for to please, is impudencie, but it is a great indiscretion to be to free and hardy, to auoid pleasing & flatterie. They must obserue a mean. Seemelinesse comes from mediocritie.

in it which he could not gainesay, the which did binde him by all
courtesie and good vsage to deface the discontents which the good
old man his Vnckle King of Sicile had against him. The Chronicle
saith, that he made him great cheere at Lyon, he made him see the faire
of St
                Iohn, and the faire Dames of Lyon, but hee did well requite
this good cheere, for before hee parted hee contented the
King with such assurances as he desired to adde Prouence to the
Crowne.
            The Duke of Bourgundy had besieged Morat,
                  Morat besieged by the Duke of Bourgundy a small Towne
two leagues from Berne with an armie of fourescore thousand
men. The Suisses had twelue thousand Pikes, ten thousand Halbards,
and ten thousand shot. The Duke of Lorraine came also
with such troupes as the King had giuen him, and although the
number were not great, yet hee was commended by the Suisses.
They were weary saith Phil. de Com. in our Court of the D. of Lorraine. When a great man hath lost al his owne, most cōmonly he tires them that support him. There might be in all some thirty two thousand foote, and
three or foure thousand horse.
            The Duke of Bourgundy held it impossible for the Suisses or
the Duke of Lorraine to succour Morat,Battell of Morat won by the Suisses. and yet they did attempt
it and execute it very happily. As they approched the Duke saluted
them with his Canon which did play so furiously vppon their
troupes as presently there were many horses seene without riders.
The Suisses notwithstanding march on, for the way was
such as they must either aduance forward or retire back: they charged
the Dukes troupes, beat them back, and force many to seeke

their safeties in the Lake, into which they waded vp to the chins:
but they were noe more assured in the water then on the land, the
fury of the victorious souldiour slue them like Duckes. It was presently
made red with the bloud of this slaughter, many fled to the
next Forrest, and were slaine there. The Duke returned from Suisserland,

            The Suisses hauing continued three dayes vpon the place of Battell,
they dismist halfe their troupes, and with the rest recouered
the places which the Duke had taken, Petterlingen, Romon and Milden:

            The Duke vexed at this vnfortunate successe, the which hee
had attempted more to reuenge the iniuries of the house of Sauoy
then for his owne, and fearing least the Duchesse of Sauoy should
reconcile her selfe vnto the King her Brother,The Duchesse of Sauoy seazed on by the Bourgundians. and that the Sauoyards
should follow the fortune of the victory, he commanded Oliuer
of la March to seaze vpon the Duchesse and her two sonnes. He
stayed her neere vnto the ports of Geneua, set her on horsebacke
behinde him, and gaue order to them of his troupe to doe the like
vnto her two sonnes and two Daughters. The Duke of Sauoy was
saued and carried to Geneua. Oliuer de la March hee went on his
way all night, past the mountaine, came vnto a place called Myiou,
and from thence to S. Claud, and from thence to Rochfort,
and in the end to Rouure neere vnto Dijon. The King drew her from
thence by the Lord of Chaumont, and caused her come to Tours,
The Duchesse of Sauoy being prisoner at Rouure sent vnto the King to beseech him to set her at libertie. If she had not bin in these extremities, she would not haue done it, the hatred had been so great betwixt the King and her. whether he went after his departure from Lyon. Being arriued
there, he saluted her with these words. Madame of Bourgundy you

are very welcome. To whom she answered, that she was a good
French woman and ready to obay his commandements. He took
her at her word and this first answere was the best.The first answeres of women are commonly the best. It is that which Vlisses cōsidered in Homer pressing the soule of a woman to answere speedily. Their humors

of her, and she as great to be farre from him.
            
            The King would willingly that shee had married the Princes
her children to his humor, but she excused her selfe, and wrought
so as by his meanes and the mediation of the Duke of Lorraine
and the Arch-duke of Austria, she retired from the Suisses some of
those lands which they had seazed on, paying fifty thousand Florins
for the charges of warre, but it was not possible for the Earle
of Romont to recouer his. Eight daies after the King caused her to
be conducted into her Contrie with her children, but before they
parted one from an other, they would be assured of the promises of
loue which they had made, and not trusting to bare words they
added writings and others. They depriued themselues of that content
which their wils might haue receiued in producing freely the
effects of a reciprocall affection and confidence. But they had rather
be bound to religion then to Nature.

                  Alfonso K. of Portugal comes to demand succors in France. 
               Alfonso King of Portugall
came to salute him, being at Tours, hee came vnto him as to his
last refuge, being no longer able to resist the power of King Ferdinand
and Isabelta. The cause of their contention is well worthy
the knowing, and to vnderstand it wee must remember that it was
formerly said that by the peace made betwixt Iohn King of Castille

and Iohn of Nauarre, Blanche the eldest Daughter of Nauarre was
married to Henry of Castille Prince of the Asturies, and that the
marriage was not consummated by reason of the disabilitie and
coldnes of the husband.Pope Eugenius the third, gaue a dispensation for the degree of proximitie that was betwixt the married couple, and the marriage was celebrated at Madrid in the yeare 1440.

                whereof no man might inconsiderately grow
in doubt, for the Prince was of a manlike and braue aspect, but his
actions were faint and languishing. They were but fiue and twentie
yeares old when they were married. At one and thirty he succeeded

His faction won the Prince D. Henry, who armed against his father, & wroght so as he was restored to fauor, and made Master of the Order of S.

His Daughter Isabella was but three yeares old, to whom he gaue
the Towne of Cuellar, and a great summe of money for her mariage.
All things succeeded otherwise then he had proiected. The
eternall prouidence, which hath written in his tables of Diamond

disposed after another manner.

hauing for a long time endured her husbands disabilitie, began
to murmure, and he preuented her complaints, presenting a
request vnto the Pope to bee seperated from her, and shewed that
she was barren and could not be a mother, and that the affaires of
Castille required an heire. The Pope dissolued the first marriage
and suffered him to marry againe with Ione Infanta of Portugall,
Sister to King▪ 
               Alfonso, and Daughter to King Edward, a Princesse
exceeding faire, who more desirous to bee a Queene then a wife,
consented to this marriage, notwithstanding that shee was fully
aduertised of the disabilitie of the husband which she tooke, who
although he were a great Prince could not haue found a woman,
where as euery one may haue for his money. But shee made it
knowne that a politick woman neuer dyes without an heyre.
            On the other side the King held the blemish of disabilitie to be
so dishonourable, as to make the contrarie knowne▪ and to haue
children to succeed vnto his Crowne, he consented that Bernard de
la Cueua, one of his fauouritesSome write that D. Ioane consented therevnto by force, but when she had once made this leape, she had more need of a bridle then a spurre. A wonderfull incontinency and impudency. Being at it were confined to the Castell of Alacaes, vnder the custody of the Archbishop of Seuelle she had by D.

thought to be done by supposition, he would haue her deliuered

Toledo, and the Marquis of Vellena. It was a Daughter, which had
for her Godfather the Earle of Armagna

               , who was at that time

            Wisedome and discretion might haue made this deceit more
fortunate then it was,
                  Henry the king of Castille degraded. for all Spaine made demonstration, of
incredible Ioy for the birth of this Daughter, but there was follie
and indiscretion of all sides. The King, who would confirme
this opinion that he was a gallant man, sought the loue of other
women, who soone discouered the deceit. The Queene made
shew to be iealous, entertained her loue securely with D. Bernard,
so as the great familiaritie he had with her made the world doubt
of her chastitie, and when as they saw that the King honored him
with the chiefe charges of the Realme, making him master of the
order of St Iames, and then Duke of Albuquergue, they did imagine
that he made him play his part in this Comedie, which ended
with cruel & tragicall effects, for the Great men of the realme made
a league to seaze vpon D. Alfonso and D. Isabella, brother & Sister,
to the end that this Bastard should not depriue them of their rights.
Alfonso being about twelue yeeres old was proclaimed K. of Castille
by them, and then did D. Henry shew the imbecillitie and weaknes of
his Nature, for whereas hee should haue opposed himselfe against
those mutinies, he suffred them to get such credit and authoritie, as
the Archbishop of Toledo, being sent for to come vnto him, to the
end hee might pacifie those troubles, he said vnto him that brought
him this charge. Tell your King that I am weary of him & his affaires,
and that he shall shortly see who is the true King of Castille.
            
            The Grandos of the Realme assembled in a great plaine neere vnto
Auila to degrade the King from the royall dignity. That which
they could not doe vnto his person,
                  Alfonso proclained K. of Castille. they did vnto his statue

they presented vpon a scaffold: when as the Herad said that D. Henry
was degraded from the royall dignity, the Archbishop of Toledo
tooke the Crowne from his image, the Earle of Plaisance the sword,
and the Earle of Beneuent the Scepter, this done Diego Lopes cast
it out of the royall seat. Alfonsos standard was aduanced, and poore
Henry shouted at and contemned. They would end the quarrell
by a battell before Olivedo.The Battell of Oluiedo was in the yeare 1467. They doe not agree who had the victory. D. Alfonso was seen armed a

one squadron against another. The Archbishop of Toledo led his
army hauing a white stole vpon his armes. The combat continewed
three houres, and ended with so great disorder of either side, as
both parties made bonfiers for the victory.

Princesse of Castille the nineteenth of September, 1468. vpon
condition that she should not marry without the consent of the
King hir brother. They would haue married her to Alfonso of Portugall,

who was a widower, and D. Ioane to Iohn the eldest Sonne of
Portugall, vpon condition that if there came no children of the marriage

disguized habit and marryed him the eighteenth of October. 1469.

            King Henry was so incensed at this marriage, as hee declared his
Sister fallen from all the rights which shee might pretend to the
crowne of Castille, and caused Ioane his daughter to be proclaymed
his true heire, who was married to Charles Duke of Guienne, as hath
beene formerly said. This treaty of marriage was broken by the
death of the Dukd of Guienne. King Henry died also.The death of Henry the 4. King of Castille was in the yere 1474. the one and forty yeare of his age and the on & twenteth of his raign Hee was interred in the great Chappell of the Monastery of Guadalupe. He appointed 52. lampes of siluer to burne day & night vpon his tombe. And notwithstanding
that the Crowne were assured to Ferdinand and Isabel,
yet Ioane continued the title of Queene of Castille,Troupes sent out of France into Castille. and in this quality
she married with Alfonso King of Portugall, which was an occasion
of great warres. The French King being discontented with the
house of Arragon, and the warre of Pergignan, sent troupes to the
King of Portugal vnder the command of Aman of Albret.

were assured of the Realme of Castille, and therefore he went into

townes of Ensicheim, Colmar & Schletstat, making no conscience
to take in grosse from the Iewes that which by their Vsuries they had
robbed by retaile from the Christians. All the Duke of Lorraines

many men. The approches were so kept as no pollicie, no stratagems,
which are commonly practised in such victuallings, could
succeed.In militarie factions, as the victualling of a place neere prest is one of the most difficult, so is it one of the most worthy. Policy can doe more then force. That of Landrecy in the yeare 1543. is one of the most memorable, by Francis the fift in view of the Emperor Charles the first

conduct and hazard of a company of men at armes. They past not
all, many were taken and presented to the Duke, who commanded
they should be hanged by the rigour of the law of Armes, which

wils that euery man attempting to enter into a place to fortifie it

Duke of Bourgundy beleeue that his desire to speak was but to desire
to liue and to winne so much time. This Duke too tractable in a matter
of such consequence, and which should not haue been neglected,
commands he should bee dispatcht. Ciffron said that it was not any
desire to prolong his life, but to free his Conscience, which made him
desire to be heard, they report this vnto the Duke, who sends back to
know what hee would say. This was to adde crueltie to death, to refuse

they smothered in his brest the aduice which might haue saued the
Dukes life. A miserable condition of them whose misfortune no man

lay hid, and to the end he should not loose the remembrance, he did
entertaine that by the ordinarie obiect of a deuice which was wittily

                The wheele began to
turne, to stay it was difficult, and the fall was infallible. The descent
vnto ruine is easie, but the assent to good fortune is painefull. The
Duke of Lorraine diuided his armie into two great Battaillons, either
of seuen or eight thousand men, whereof the chiefe force
were Suisses, glorious and proud of two victories which they had
wonne at Granson and Morat. The Duke of Bourgundy had not
the third part of his troupes, and if he had made choise of the best
to fight, he should not haue found twelue hundred, yet he attends

and chase away the Bourgundians that were within it. The same
night the Duke of Bourgundy thought to surprise Nancy before
that the succors should arriue. The Duke of Lorraine was speedily
aduertised thereof: The Suisses let him vnderstand that the
season was so rigorous, and the cold so extreme, as if the troupes
did continue long without any imploiment they would ruine themselues
without profit.An armie in time surmounts all accidents. In like manner which in time ruine armies. Of this kind are hunger, cold, & other d

aduanced towards Nancy, the Dukes chiefe strength was in his ordinance,
the which notwithstanding wrought no great effect. The
Duke being aduertised of the Suisses march, planted his Ordinance
against the high-waies comming to Nancy, thinking they
would come that way, but they tooke the left hand which was
a rough and troublesome way along the Riuer of Mozelle, passing
a little Brooke through the Y

as soone as the Battell began. They recouered a little hill,
by the which they might charge the Dukes Armie of both sides.
The Bourgundians discouering it, they raised a great cry to haue
the Artillerie charged: But it was too late. The Suisses hauing taken
breth, and made their prayers fell violently vpon the Duke of
Bourgundies footmen, and after some resistance woon their trenches,
make them recoile, and disorder them. The horsemen seeing
the footmen in route fled that way where as Campobasse stopt
their flight and their retreat. All the Bourgundians were at the
discretion of their enemies. The Duke being knowne by the traitor

They found him in a ditch, his face being plaistred ouer with mire
and bloud, the sharpnes of the winter hauing frozen all that they
could not know him. Nature hauing giuen him no greater share
of ground in this fall then to the meanest souldiour. The brute
was that he had escaped, and for sorrow of such a losse had attired
himselfe in a Pilgrims weed to wander throughout the world.There was seen in the town of Bruxelle in the Diocesse of Spire, a naked man couered only with a linnen cloth, whō they held to be the Duke of Bourgundy.

the withering of the skin vpon his shoulder which a cole had made;
by a Fistula which hee had vnder his nauell, and by his nailes which
he ware longer then any one of his Court.
            The Dukes Ensignes and coulours were presently carried to Rene,
who obseruing the Fuzils or Irons to strike fire which they carried
said.The Duke interred at Nancy. 
               What a Pittie, when this Prince would warme himselfe, hee could
not make vse of these Fuzils to strike fire!

            The bodie was drawne from among the dead and carried to
Nancy, where after they had washt it, and attired it in a poore weed
of linnen cloth, they layed it vpon a table, vnder a cloth of Estate
of black Veluet, the chamber being hanged with the same. The Duke
mourning in his outward habite for this death, and carrying ioy in
his heart for his victory, would needs see him, and was not so scrupulous
as Pompey, who turned away his eyes from the dead body of
Mithridates, King of Pontus, least he should prouoke the reuenging
wrath of the Gods against him.
            At this sight the Duke was moued to pittie and sorrow, as compassion

the dead is proper to base and cowardly mindes.Great mindes are moued at the spectacle of the ruines of nature, and at the

beleeue not that which they desire not, his subiects were long
doubtfull of the truth of his death. They said that the griefe of
this losse kept him hid, and that he had been seen in a Pilgrims weed.
It is troublesome to beleeue the death of Princes whom they loue,
who haue won their hearts by mildnes and affabilitie.
            This Prince said, and his tombe speakes it yet, that he neuer had
any rest in his life. He would be the Eagle of Princes in designe and
execution, and as Eagles haue alwaies in their nests stones which
sound, hee had alwaies some designe in his head which disturbed his
rest. Hee that did inherit the matteresse whereon he slept, might
well keepe it to cause sleepe, seeing that a man so distempered did
sleepe little.
            Wee must not suffer honor to grow old,Humor of the D. of Bourgundy nor to weare like a garment,
it must be renued by some goodly action. He sought by new
designes and new enterprises, to maintaine the brute of this reputation,
which he thought did passe away presently, if some other couragious
action did not renew it, and hee feared nothing more then
that his idlenes should giue the people occasion to demand what he
did. Meane men are not to giue an account of all their actions, but
will know what great men doe or doe not.A Prince should neuer giue the people occasion to inquire of his idlenes. Cato had reason to say, Non minus otii quam negotii clarorum virorum rationem extare oportere. The reason of famous mens Idlenes must be apparent, is wel as of their imployments. His great courage was
giuen him to afflict his bodie, & to torment his spirit. His force was
not equall to his Ambition, lesse pride or more power. His life was
too short to goe that great way. Hee would not haue been satisfied
with halfe Europe.Excesse the Dukes Ambition. All or nothing. Hee had more valour then
gouernment. Of this King & this D. might haue bin made the composition
of a great and absolute Prince;Who so could haue takē some of the King our Masters conditions and some of his, might well haue made a perfect prince, for without doubt the King exceeded him much in iudgement, and the end did shew it by his workes. Phil. de Com.
                for the two essentiall parts
necessarie to make a great Captaine, Wisedome, and Valour, he had
but one, and would make himselfe to bee esteemed by actions
which were rather animated by courage, then guided by Counsell.

make a Captaine. He would be euery where, himselfe did view the
scituation of his Campe, with the aduantages and discommodities
about it, he obserued who went and came, who entred and who went
forth.
                  Charles D. of Bourgundy vvas called by many the toiling, for that he vvould see all and doe all, toiling himselfe extraordinarily in all occasions. He was still walking among the souldiors, reprehending the
Captaines priuately, and the soldiors publikely, when he found them
to neglect their duties. The meanest fortune requires wisedome to
guide it, and the greater it is, the more it is enuironed with difficulties.
This Prince grew so insolent, & fell into so great a conceit of his own
valour, after his first deeds of Armes, that although his naturall inclinations
were not meerely warlike, yet hee tooke delight in no other
exercise then warre; with such great presumption, as he held no wisedome
comparable to his Councels, nor force equall to his valour, and
yet in that there vvas impatiencie and deceit, and in this rashnes and
violence. Presumption was so violent in his imagination, as he would
not haue giuen place to Hannibal nor to Scipio.
               
                  Antigonus being demanded who vvas the best Captaine, he answered. Pyrrhus if

                  e had liued a mans age. But among them that liued so, the first ranke was due to Haniball, the second to Scipio, and the third to Antigonus.
                He had made a temple

of his heart, which adored no other Deitie, then his Ambition.
            After the Battell of Montlehery,The Duke grew presumptuous and insupportable. hee did nothing by Councell, all
after his owne head, and according to his own humor, being not able
to restraine the fiercenes of his pride, nor moderate the greatnes of
his designes,After that Paulus Emilius had vanquished Perseus, King of Macedonie, he spake these goodlie words. Let vs learne to humble our selues, and let vs restraine our fiercenes and pride.
                Vanity did so ouershadow the tree of his fortune, as it
made it die. His death vvas the ruine & desolation of the great body
of the house of Bourgundy, vvhich hath continued some 100. yeares
vnder foure Dukes in continuall felicitie & prosperitie. And so all ended,
yea the empire of Rome which cōmanded al that was great, rich,
& powerfull vpon the habitable earth, is in the end fallen to peeces.The Empire of Rome in the time of the Emperor Adrian, had 200. thousand foote, and 4000. horse entertained daily, with 300.

            He had vertues worthy of a Prince, but Pride, presumption and
wilfulness blemished all the glory. Aboue all he was a great iusticer,
and they report an admirable example of his Iustice against a
Gouernour of a Towne in Zeland who was in a manner mad for
the loue of a Lady which was equally faire and wise,Example of the Dukes great iustice and who had
committed the gard of her beauty, to the loue of vertue. He attempted
against her honor, and this violent curiosity to be partaker of an
other mans pleasure,

that hee could not winne her by praiers, seruices nor presents, hee
committed a notable villany, causing her husband to be imprisoned,
and faining that he was aduertised of some intelligence, which hee
practised with the enemy. Behold hee is in an estate where hee must
iustifie himselfe or die, for in such accusations there is no other way.
He that is accused of a crime must haue no other thought but to die, or to iustifie himselfe. It was the message which that couragious woman of Sparta sent vnto her Sonne, being told that he was accused of some crime. Either rid thy selfe of thy life, or of thine accusation. Plut.
                His wife cast her selfe at the Gouernors feet, whose intreaties shee
had so often scorned, suing for the innocent, & innocently pleading
plainly for the prisoners liberty. Why how now saith the Gouernor
do you make sute vnto him whose will you hold subiect to your laws?
restore me my selfe, and I will restore you your husband; he is my prisoner,
and I am thine, it is in your power to set vs both at liberty.

Paucissima in tam numerosa gente Adultera, quorum poena presens maritis permissa, accisis crinibus nudatam coram propinquos expellit domo maritus, ac per omnem vicum verbere agit. There are very few Adulteries in so populous a Nation, whose present punishment that is allowed the husband, her haire being cut of, he driues her naked out of the house before the neighbours, and beats her through the streets. and feare not to
recouer her husband. The Gouernour gaue her no time to bethinke
her selfe, for supposing that shee was in an Estate not to refuse
him any thing, he takes that by force which he could not haue

tyranous possession,Cruelty base and villanous. to his loosenesse hee addes crueltie, which is

desire to reuenge this iniurie, but she found him dead laid in a Coffin.

                from whom they haue stolne
her yong ones, and reports to all her friends this cruell aduenture.
            They aduised her to goe vnto the Duke, to whom shee fled and
cast her selfe at his feere, where with teares of reuenge and greefe,
she acquainted him with this iniurie, demaunding Iustice. The
Duke hearing of his barbarous accident, sends for the Gouernour,
who being confronted with this woman, feeles his face to blush for
shame, as much as hers was pale for greefe, who after hee had with
trembling denied a crime which had no other witnesse but his owne
conscience, and tried that villanies are more easily committed then
excused:It is a trouble to colour and disguise a villany. An ancient Lawyer being importuned by a Tyrant to excuse a parricide, which he had committed in killing his owne Brother, answered, That it was much more difficult to excuse an offence then to commit it. hee imbraced the Dukes knees, demaunded pardon of
him, and promised to marrie this woman, to repaire the wrong &
iniurie which he had done her. She craues reuenge for the death of
her Husband, and not the loue or alliance of him that had slaine
him. those that were present aduised her to accept of the offer, seeing
the mischeefe was done, and Iustice might well reuenge, but
not repaire the wrong. She being forced to fly to forgetfulnesse, the
Goddesse of the vnfortunate, resolued to giue her selfe vnto him,
who had depriued her both of honour and husband, and to binde
him vnto her for his life, which he could not saue but by her means.
The promises were written, concluded, and sworne, whereunto the
Duke added this Article, that the husband and dying first without Children,
all his goods should remaine to his Wife. This concluded;
their hearts did sacrifice to the concord of marriage, and they promised
to liue louingly together. It seemed there was nothing
else to be done, nor that so cleare a heauen as was that day, should
haue any lightning or thunder. The Duke turning towards the woman,
demaunded if she were content: I am my Lord answered she,
by your bountie and Iustice. I am not, replied the Duke, who wayed
how much the Commonweale was wronged in this crime: that a
Prince may well declare, but he cannot make an offender innocent:
that he is bound to do Iustice,A Prince doing Iustice equally, wins more glory then if he had giuen limits to the Sea, vanquished Monsters, ruined hell, and supported heauen. & to giue an accompt of innocent
blood, there being no triumph equall to that which a Prince raiseth
to his glorie in doing Iustice. He commanded the woman to retire,
& caused the Gouernor to be carried to prison, giuing charge that
he should loose his head in the same place wher he put the womans
husband to death,A woman depriued at one time of two husbands. and that he should bee also put into a Coffin.D. Ferdinand of Gonzaga, Lieutenant Generall to the Emperor Charles the 5. in Italy, made the like reparation to an Italian Lady. Hee caused his head to be cut off that had committed the rape, hauing first made him to marrie her, & to giue her all his goods.
Which done, he sent this woman to the prison, who being amazed
at this spectacle, & to see her selfe the widow of two husbands in so
short a time, was so violently opprest with greefe, as within a short
space she followed the way which these two men had made her.
            But to end the life and discourse of Charles Duke of Bourgoundy,

he died at the age of three and fortie. He came into the world at
Dijon on Saint Martins Eue; in the yeare 1433. The verie daie that
he was christned he receiued the choller of the golden fleece, and
withall the name of Charles, which Charles Duke of Bourbon gaue
him, the title of Earle of Charolois, and Lord of Bethunes.
            The house of Bethunes entred into that of Flanders, long before
the house of Flanders entred into that of Bourgundie. Baldwyn
Earle of Flanders, who purchased the Empire of Constantinople
by the force of his Armes, and the happie assistance of Anthonie
and Coesne of Bethunes, had two Daughters. Ione married first
to Ferdinand Prince of Portugall, and afterwards to Thomas Prince
of Sauoie, and dyed without Children. Margaret her Sister, married
William of Dampierre, and had three Sonnes and one Daughter;
Guy, William, Iohn and Marie. Guy married the Daughter of Fegard
of Bethune, Robert of Bethune succeeded him, to Robert Lewis
of Neuers, to Lewis of Neuers Lewis of Malain, Father to Margaret
his only Daughter, who was married to Phillip Duke of Bourgondy,
great Grand-father to Charles. This house of Bethunes hath

and the diuision was great to know who should haue the Regencie
and Gouernment of the Realme. Some were for Queene
Marie his Mother; Others were for Iames Kenneth, and George Douglas
Earle of Anguse. The Queene caused her selfe to be declared
that which she would be, & they that were for her saied; that if they
regarded Proximitie, there was not any neerer vnto the Sonne then
the mother: If they did consider the good of the childe, not any
one could haue more care then she: If they could not contend with
her in the degree of Proximitie, it were indiscretion to call her affection
and fidelitie in doubt, hauing therein nature for her Caution.
If they respect the common good, the condition of her birth
was considerable, for that being a stranger, no way possest with loue
nor passion, they should not finde that she would support the one
to the preiudice of the other, as they might doe which had Alliances,
Kinsmen, and Intelligences within the Realme, who carried
their dessignes beyond the Kinges life, and might builde vpon his
toombe: As for her, the death of her Son could bring her no other
fruits but a perpetuall sorrow, and therefore she was bound to desire

men? must a Nation which hath no other experience but
armes, beforced to subiect their swords to the lawes of a distaffe,
and suffer themselues to be gouerned at the discretion of a woman,
and of a strange woman?The first woman which opened the waie for the rule of women in Scotland was Mary Stuard: and Mary the Daughter of Henry the 8. in England. To pacifie this discord, they resolued
to leaue all matters as they were for a moneth, during the which,
the passions of both parties were but the more enflamed. Many
within the Realme, desired rather to obey the Queene then any other
that should be of an equall condition, or superior vnto them.

wonders, drawing the hearts and opinions of men as he pleaseth.
Iames Kenneth Archbishop of St. Andrew, giuing the Parlament to

                that to giue the authority to the Queene, was to contradict the auncient Lawes of the Realme, to expose Scotland to
dangers, and Scottishmen to the scorn of a shamefull gouernment;
and who should iustifie the reproach which might be made vnto
them to commaund men, and to be commaunded by women.
            That Scotland neuer knew what the gouernment of women was,
they found no names in their language to expresse it, they had neuer
seene woman preside in their Councels nor Parliaments, nor to
dispose of Iustice nor of the Treasure, and that which other Nations
call Queene, Scotland cals the Kings Wife.The history of Scotlād reports the wordes of Iames Kenneth: Mairoes nostri adeo erant a cura publica muliaeribus mandanda alieni, vt si omnia rerū vocabula excutias, ne mul

Our Elders were so farre from giuing the gouernment of publike affaires to women, as if you will examine all words, there is not any one to be found with them of a womans gouernment: why should they giue that a name whereof they had no vse, neither did they hope there should be. Those whom other Nations in their language tearme Queenes, we call Kings wiues. That for these
reasons he could not councell the Estate of the Realme, to preferre
the gouernment of a woman before that of a man, not to the
Queene to attempt it, beseeching her to thinke, that they which
councelled her did it more for their owne fortunes, then for her
honour. That although her vertues were not vnknown to Scotland,
and that they must hope well of the vigour of her spirits, and the
greatnesse of her courage, yet they had but two many examples of
the ruines which verie sufficient women had brought to States,
when as striuing to excell their sexe; they would exceed the bounds
ordained by nature.

In a moment she lost the realme which her husband had inlarged and inricht. This seemes to shew, that the enterprises of women beyond their reach are alwaies dangerous. His aduice was, that they should chuse one,
or more, capable to gouerne the Realme, vntill the King had force
of minde and body to discharge them.
            This opinion was followed by the greatest part, and they that
would willinglie haue crost it,Councell appointed for the Regency of Scotland. seeing themselues ouerswaied by the
multitude, consented. But to the end, one faction should haue no
aduantage ouer the other, they tooke two of either, giuing them
power to keepe the Prince, and to gouerne the Realme. They left

vnto the Queene the care to bring vp his two Brethren, Alexander
Duke of Albany, and Iohn Earle of Marre, and his two Sisters: but
she died the yeare following. The affaires being thus setled in Scotland,
the King of England made a truce with the Scottish men for

               Robert Bothwell a bold spirit,
being desirous to haue a share in the affaires, found meanes to approach
neere vnto this young Prince, and told him, that hee had
beene long enough vnder the gouernment of these old men, that it
was time to make himselfe knowne, and what God had ordained
him to be. Perswasions to raigne and commaund are alwaies sweet,
especiallie to Princes, who thinke they cannot begin their raignes
too soone, nor end thē too late. Vpon this discourse, the King suffered
himselfe to be led to Edingbrough, to begin his raigne. The
Regents of the Realme were incensed at this presumption, & make
Bothwells processe. But the King declaring that hee had done nothing
but for his seruice, and by his commaundement, makes him
Lieutenant Generall of the Realme, and a Companion both in his
authoritie and affaires.

person, his Brethren and Sisters, his Forts and Townes, vntill hee
should come to the age of one and twenty yeares, he bindes all the
Noblemen that were about him, to acknowledge him in this qualitie,

did so enuy it, and did pretend so many dangers in this great Communication
of the Royall Authoritie to a priuate person, as they
coniured the ruine of this house. The King had demaunded Margaret,
the King of Denmarkes Daughter in marriage: whereunto
they did the more willinglie accord, for that by the treatie the controuersie
was ended betwixt those two Crownes, for the Ilands of
Orcades. The question was to send one to conduct the Queene:
This charge was giuen to Thomas Bothwell by the aduice of his enemies,
to the end that this absence might coole the great heare of
the Kings loue (as commonly Princes affections fauour that onelie
which they see) and weaken his faction, giuing more courage to
his enemies to make their party against him. They that had neuer
spoken word during his great prosperitie, cry now against those
Horseleeches of State, against those Rauens and Harpies.For a time they suffer and dissemble the publike iniuries and oppressions of priuate men, but when as any one begins to cry, all pursue them. All
the complaints which had beene made against the Father for the
bad gouernment of affaires, were reuiued with such vehemencie, as
the King saw himselfe in a manner forced to heare them, and to
prouide for it. A Parlament being called at Edinbourg, they make

Thomas Bothwel being come to Edingbourg with the Queen,
much amazed after so many dangers which hee had runne for his
seruice, to see his house thus ruined, and vpon the aduice which
his Wife gaue him, of the small hope there was to returne into fauour,
he returned into Denmarke, past into Germanie, and so into
France, to intreat K. Lewis the eleuenth, to make his peace with the
K. of Scotland, but whē he saw that the king would not do any thing,
he retired to the Duke of Bourgondie, and did him great seruices.
            But he did not long enioy the peace and quietnesse which hee
thought to finde there, for the King of Scotland, who desired to see
this house vtterly ruined, commaunded his Sister to leaue her Husband.

the King married her to another, and makes her to send for her children
which were in Flanders: Thomas Bothwell died for greefe at
Antwerp, and the Duke of Bourgoundie, his heire, made him a
rich tombe, not so much for any care of his memorie, as to erect

               ❧THE HISTORIE
Of LEWIS the eleuenth.
            THE EIGHTH BOOKE.
            
               TWO great occasions presented themselues
vnto the King to augment his
Empire,1477. after the death of the Duke of
Bourgondy. In the first, it seemed that
Italy was not diuided, but to vnite it againe
vnder the gouernment of one alone;
and that not any one but the
French King, might vndertake it, or
hope for it.
            They councelled him to make his
profit of these diuisions,K. Lewis councel'd to make his profite of the diuision of Italy. and to renue the right which the Crowne
of France had to the Realme of Naples; since Charles, Earle of Aniou
               Pope Vrban the third, called Charles of Aniou against Mā
                     froy, and promised him the Inuestiture of both Siciles. Charles came to Rome in the yeare 1264. in May, and receiued it frō 
                  Clement 4. and from the same hand the Crown at S. Iohn de Latran. the 28. of Iune. & Prouence, brother to the great King, who renowned by the power
of Armes, and much more by the holinesse of his life, deserued
to be declared a Saint.
            
               Robert of Saint Seuerin came vnto the King,
                  Robert of S. Seuerin came to the King, to make him resolue to come into Italy. Paulus Aemilius saith, that the King answered him, that he had learned frō his Predecessors, that the Frēch could neuer keepe any thing in Italy. and made him diuers
ouertures to moue him thereunto▪ but he, who was a Prince
which made more account of the essence then of the appearance
of things, would not hearken to it. The Geneuois intreated him to
take them vnder his command, hauing liued happily vnder King
Charles the 7. He was contented that Iohn Galeas, Duke of Millan,

                  Iohn Galeas Duke of Millan did homage for his mother, for the Dutchy of Genoa to the Lord of Argenton, returning from his Embassage to Florence in the yeare 1476. should do him homage; and whē they said, that they gaue themselues
vnto him, he gaue them vnto the Diuell, refusing a command
so ill grounded, as vpon the quicke-sand of the will of a multitude.
He was also resolued not to meddle with the affaires of Italy,
hauing learned from his fore-fathers, that to send Armies beyond
the Alpes, was nothing but to purchase repentance with much
charge, and great difficulties.
               The Geneuois haue often sought a Maister. Guichardin saith, that desiring with great instance to giue themselues to Lewis the eleuenth, he did not accept the donation, and had often refused, Dimescolarsi in Italia come cosa piena dispese & difficulta & all vltimo perniciosa al regno di Francia, to meddle with the affaires of of Italy, as a thing full of charge and difficulties, and in the end dangerous for the realme of France. Guic. l. 1.
               
            
            He sent the Signior of Argenton to Florence,Troubles at Florēce.
                being full of troubles

for a conspiracy made against the house of Medicis: Laurence
de Medicis liued in that Common-weale as a Cittizen, and commanded
as a Prince: for alwaies in states which depend of the authority
of many heads, there are some which excell the rest.In popular Estates there hath alwayes beene some priuate man more eminent then the rest. Pericles at Athens, Epaminondas and Pelopidas at Thebes. His
Grand-father the great Cosmo,
               Cosmo de Medicis surnamed the Great.
                had laid the foundation of a great
authority, which did threaten the Common-weale with a new
forme of gouernement vnder the power of one alone: He was in
such reputation, through fauour of his wisedome, as he began to
terrifie the liberty of the Citty; and as Machiuel saith, the other
Citizens held it dangerous to offend him, and most dangerous
to suffer him. The contrary faction attempted to stoppe the
growing of this designe, the which they thought they could
not effect, but in killing Laurence and Iulian de Medicis brethren,
who were not odious vnto great men, but for that they had too
great credite, and their vertue too much reputation and applause.In a free Cittye the great vertue and reputation of one alone is alwaies suspected. Cato said against Scipio, that a Citty could not termed free, in the which the Magistrate did respect & feare a priuate man.
            
            Heauen, which reserues vnto it selfe the disposition of States,
and which aduanceth or staies the Destinies as it pleaseth, had
resolued to raise the house of Medicis by the same meanes that
their enemies sought to ruine it.Conspiracies do many times succeed happily for them against whom they are made. Brutus in his History of Florence, the 6. Booke, saith: Consilia quae à coniuratis ad Medicum potentiam euertendam inita fuerant, ad eorū principatum stabiliendum mirifice contulerunt. The councels which the Cōspirators had taken to ouerthrow the house of Medicis, did wonderfully serue to settle their power and authority. It was already growne to that
splendor, and raised so high, as the fight of the vulgar sort was dulled,
and could not discerne it. The Lords which carried this
Name, being hardy and couragious, knew their owne merit, and
knowing themselues capable to reigne worthily, past all difficulties
to reigne assuredly.
            The Conspiracie was executed vpon Iulian being at Masse in
Saint Reparees Church, but Laurence saued himselfe in the Vestry.
The Conspirators were hanged at the Palace-windowes,
and the Conspiracie held so execrable throughout all the world,
as Mahomet
               All Princes are interessed in the punishment of traytors; When as Mahomet vnderstood that one of the Conspirators was in Constantinople, he caused him to be apprehended, and sent bound to Florence. would not suffer one of the Conspirators to liue safely
in Constantinople.Pope excommunicates the Florentines. The Archbishop of Pisa was among them
that were hanged: Nicholas, Cardinall of Saint Georges was put
in prison: Pope Sixtus the fourth was offended, and fauoured all
those that had beene dealers in this Conspiracie; he did excommunicate
the Florentines,Army against the Florentines. and caused Ferdinand of Arragon, King
of Naples to Arme against them: the Duke of Vrbin was Generall
of the Popes Army, and of the King of Naples, and with
him the Kings two sonnes, they did ouer-runne the Territories of
Florence, yet they spared that which did belong to Laurence de
Medicis, to bring him into suspition, and to make the people beleeue
that he had intelligence with them.So Hanibal spoiling and burning the houses which were about Rome, forbad the Souldiers to touch any thing that did being to Fabius Maximus.

which the lawes haue established ouer people. From Oligarthia
she fell to an Aristocratia, and then the people banded against
the Nobility, and were reduced to those tearmes as they intreated
the Pope to giue them a Prince. This was Charles of AniouThe Citty of Florence was made desolate by the cruell factions of the people, which made the bloud to flowe in, the streets, and put all into combution. The Lucquois came and parted them, & it was resolued, they should take a maister from the Pope, so as he were royally descended. This was Charles of Aniou, brother, to the King S. Lewis.

            He had scarce let them know what difference there is betwixt
the iust command of a Monarchy, & popular confusions, but they
that were bred vp, not to endure a maister, bring the popular estate
againe into credit;Duke of Athens died at the battell of Poitiers. then they returne to a Soueraignty, and submit
themselues to the Duke of Athens, against whom they made their
conspiracies, and forced him to leaue them:It is hard for a multitude to continue long in one forme of gouerment, especially when it is a stirring, actiue, and subtill Nation. These changes haue bin noted in the Athenians, Samians, Megarians, Syracusans, Florentines & Genouoys. The Athenians chāged 6 times in lesse then a hundred yeares. The petty Cantons of the Suiffes haue maintain'd thē
                  selues in their first popular estate. then they returned
to their first confusions, they change and rechange their policy &
gouernement, thinking that they had got much by the change,
when they had new Officers, and that they which gouerned had
new names, the peoples vnderstanding beeing dulled with a
desire of Innouation: so as we finde, that in lesse then a hundred
yeares,Florence in an 100. yeares changed estate seuen times. they haue changed their estate seuen times, euery man seeking
to haue his share in the affaires, and thinking himselfe more
capable then his neighbour.
            That wherin they were now, was to be held most lamentable, and
would haue beene more, if the King had not shewed his affection
for their defence. He sent them not any force against their enemies,King Lewis declares himselfe for the Florentines.
but he made an Edict, forbidding his subiects to send any
money to the Court of Rome, either by billes of exchange, or otherwise,
to obtaine prouisions of benifices, to the end that France
should not furnish the Pope with money to ruine his friends.
            
               In the Edict which the King made to forbid them to send money
to Rome, bearing date the 16. of August, 1478. after a great and
patheticall complaint of the enterprises, and practises against Florence
made by Count Ieronimo, whom he calles an Vpstart, a man
almost vnknowne, of base and meane condition, we reade these
words: We did hope that our holy Father, like a good Father and Pastor
of Christian people, would haue imployed himselfe for a peace, and not
haue shewed himselfe partiall of either side; and hoping that for our
sake, who haue alwayes carried a great reuerence and deuotion vnto the
holy Apostolike Sea, hee would do some thing, we haue let him vnderstand
of the ancient friendship, league and alliance which we haue with
the Sgniory and Commonalty of Florence;Oath of the Gouernment of Florēce
               The Florētins haue beene alwaies Allyes & Confederate to the Crowne of France, they holding that their Citty being ruined by Totila, King of the Gothes, was built againe by Charlemaigne, & cherished by the succeeding kings, whose party they haue alwaies followed, and declared themselues Guelphes for their sakes. Moreouer the King was bound to fauour this house of Medicis, which hath beene alwayes affected to his seruice; and be remēbred the great Cosmo had exhorted his Citizens not to break with France, to fauour the designes of the Pope, of the King of Naples, nor the Duke of Millan. And in consideration of these great proofes of affection & good wil, he had suffered Peter his son, in the yeare 1465. to carry three Floures de Luce in his Scutchion. which hath beene alwayes
so well affected to vs, to the King and house of France, as they haue held
them for their singular Protectors; and in signe thereof, whensoeuer
they renew the Gouernours of their Signory, they sware to be true and
loyall to the house of France, and to defend their honour, and to entertaine
themselues in their friendship, good will, and seruice.
            
               
But notwithstanding all these aboue-named things, and without respect
of the present necessity of Christian people, our sacred holy Father,
hath shewed himselfe partiall in this matter, against the said Signiory,
and Common-wealth of Florence, and in like manner against the Duke
and Signory of Venice; wherefore they cannot by any better meanes, fortefie
the Turke and Infidels against Christians, then to molest and oppresse
them, that maintaine the Warre against the Turke: which things
are so strange to thinke of, as the Vniuersall Church, and euery vertuous
and Catholicke Prince should be grieued at it. And moreouer, wee
haue beene aduertised, that our said holy Father hath said; that in this
warre against the Florentines, Venetians, and others of their part, hee
would employ his Person, Goods, and all that he could furnish. The
which is a very strange thing, that the goods and reuenewes of the
Church, which are appointed for the seruice of God, defence of the Catholicke
Faith, and for the sustenance of the poore, should be imployed in
such warres, and for such Factions against Christians, and to mainetaine
such conspiracies to vsurpe the Signiories of Italy, and such murthers
and execrable crimes. In like manner it is very strange that
they suffer the indue exactions which are made at Rome, by expectatiue
Buls and other meanes, and by the Vacants which they leuy, contrary to
the holy Cannons and Decrets of the Church, made, and constituted, by
the holy Fathers, and against the determination of the Vniuersall
Church, and of holy councels, to employ the mony which hath beene so
gotten, to any Earledomes and Signories, to giue them vnto men of base
condition, and to aduance them, without precedent merite, or without
any aide or succour which they haue giuen vnto the Church. Among
all the Kings and Realmes of Christendome, we, our sacred Realme of
France, and Countrey of Dauphine, and generally all our Subiects, haue a
very great interest and losse, by the great abundance of money which is
drawne and paid by a great excessiue taxe, contrary to the said holy Decrees,
and the liberties of the French Church.
            The Venetians made a league with the Florentines:League betwixt the Venetians and Florentines. The Pope
excommunicates them, being no lesse offended at this League,
then at the troubles which happened in Florence: The Duke of
Milan entred also into their League. The warre was managed with
that spleene wherewith their spirits were then transported. The
Venetians contemne these flashes of lightening, and are amazed
that Rome when it was Pagan had forbidden their Priest to looke
vpon dead men,The Priestes at Rome diuerted their

                  eyes from all funerall sights, when as Tiberius made his sonnes funerall Oration, there was (said Seneca) a vaile betwixt him and the body: Quod Pontificis oculos à funere arecret: That it might keepe the high Priests eies frō that mournfull sight. Sen. in Cons. ad Mart.

            Italy became the force and store-house of the warres of Christendome,
there being no hope to quench the fire which his wilfulnesse
had kindled, but by the bloud of the vanquished.5 Lewis intreats the Pope for the peace of Italy: The King
knowing that the common enemy should reape all the profite of
this warre, sent his Embassadours to the Pope, to beseech him
not to show himselfe implacable to these two Christian Common-wealths.

The Pope receiued them with much contentment, as the
Angels and Messengers of peace: They came to Rome in February,

Proximo Februario venientes ad nos dilectos filios Oratores Christianissimi Franceorum regis, pro nostra in eum principem solita charitate laeti suscepimus. Auxit laetitiam missionis tam longinquae causa. Ad pacē enim in Italia procuranda dicebā

The cause of this long Embassage did encrease the ioy, they were said to come to procure a peace in Italy. and had audience as soone as they demanded it: They let the
Pope vnderstand that the Kings affection to the holy Sea, and his
zeale and piety to the seruice of the Church, had bound him to
seeke the meanes to quench this great diuision, and to vnite the
childrens will vnto the fathers, for that he was well aduertised that
Christendome should haue need to ioyne all her forces to resist the
Turke, who had a desire that yeare to inuade Christendome, and
it may be would begin with Italy, and therefore the League did
promise to giue care vnto a Pacification,Offer made by the King for the League. to the end they might
contribute their forces and meanes for the common defence of
Christendome.
            The Pope

should be any occasion presented, to seeke and aduance the good
of Christendome, his affection should neuer giue place to any

and by that meanes supply the necessities, and serue for the defence
of the Faith: That neuer BishopThe History of Affricke saith, that the Bishop of Nola, after that he had sold all his goods to redeeme Christian slaues, he sold himselfe vnto the Vandales for his brethren. sold himselfe more willingly for

which do groane vnder the yoake of Infidels.
            The Kings Embassadours; as Arbitrators and Iudges of the
Controuersie,Embassadours of France make an ouerture for a Peace. propounded some Articles to end it, and among
others: That there should be a suspension of Armes and Censures;
That the Cardinall of S. George should be set at liberty; That they
should ordaine certaine Suffrages and Prayers, for them that had
beene slaine in the Tumult of Florence; That the Florentines, and
Laurence de Medicis should humble themselues vnto the Pope, as
they offered to do, for the reuerence of the Apostolicke Sea; And
that all together should demand absolution, after the forme ordained
by the Church: That they should giue caution and assurance,
for their obedience and fidelity, and to maintaine the Liberties of
the Church: That all the forces of either side should be vnited together,
and paied for two or three yeares, to make warre against the
Turke.
            The Pope hauing imparted the Articles and Instructions of the
French Embassadours to the Colledge of Cardinals:Articles of peace imparted to the Consistory. Euery man
commended the Kings Integrity, Religion, and Wisedome, but
they found them not full enough in matters which concerned the

Holy Sea,Non multos post dies jidē oratores sicut internos at

                which the Pope did chiefly regard, and yet they were
allowed, vpon hope that they would produce a Peace, and an vnion
of Christian Forces, against the enemy of the Church; and also
for that the King pretended to make the Venetians and Florentines
consent to any thing that should be thought reasonable for
satisfaction of the holy Sea.
            Vpon this assurance,The Pope receiues the Embassadours of Venice and Florence. the Embassadours of Venice and Florence
were welcome; for the Pope did beleeue that they came to performe
all that which the King had promised on their behalfe:
without this beliefe he had not receiued them, for the Church
dores are alwaies shut against them that are Excommunicate,
They that bee excōmunicated are not heard, but to demand pardon and absolution. Pope Nicholas in the ninth Epistle to Lewis and Charles Kings of France, saith vnto them: That hee could not heare King Lothaire in his reasons, for that hee had beene disobedient to his commandements: Quod si contra propositum nostrum forte presumpserit venire Roman minime cum qua cupit honestate vel hic suscipitur, vel hinc profecto regreditur: That if hee shall presumne to come to Rome contrary to our purpose, he shall neither bee receiued with the honesty that hee desires, neither shall he depart. when as they present themselues to contradict his iudgements,
and to excuse their faults: But as they were about this Treaty, the
Pope supposing there would be no other difficulty, but for the Ceremonies
and Circumstances of the Reparation, which was due
for the offence done vnto the holy Sea; a Post comes vnto the Venetians,
bringing them newes of an accord which they had made
with Mahomet, by the which they did giue vnto him, Scudry, Tenare,
the Promontory of Lyconia, with the Iland of Lemnos, and
they did promise to pay him yearely eight thousand Crownes for
the liberty of the Traffique. This Peace brought ioy vnto the Venetians,
but it did terrefie all the Princes of Italy: For this Tyrant
was so neere, as he saw them from the Port which he had newly
gotten
                  Mahomet did besiege Scudry, the fifth of Iune, with foure score and fiue thousand men, the siege continued nine monthes.
            
            The Pope was wonderfully discontented, seeing that the foundations
of the Peace of Christendome were ouerthrowne, and
that the King was disauowed by them, in whose name he had made
such instance for a League against the Turke,
                  Indoluimus pro fidei causa vehementius, & quia potissimum conficiendae pacis fundamentum submoneri ex hoc videbamus, nec minus ipsius Regis Christianissimi gratia, in cuius dedecus maximopere redundat quo dum se huius pacis ad Ligae requisitionem autorem profitetur ab ijs tamen pro quibus orati, tam iniuriose contra fidei caussam affectus fuerit. Wee were much grieued for the Faiths cause, and for that he did see the foundations of making of a Peace shaken, and no lesse for the most Christian kings sake, to whose dishonour it doth much redound, who whilst be doth professe himselfe author of the Peace, at the instance of the League, yet he is iniuriously delt withall, by them for whom he had entreated. yet he did acquaint
the Venice Embassadours with the Articles; and they demanded
respite to answere, and to haue aduice from their Superiours. This
answere was attended two and twenty daies:Venetians demand suspension of Armes and Censures. The Pope thinking
that the longer they were to consult, the more iust and reasonable
the resolution would be.
                  Fatemur errorem (dilecti filij) dies tam multos, ad saniora consilia pertinere credidimus, quanto inter eos consulebant diutius tanto & iustius & reuerentius ad salutem animarum vtilius responsuros putauimus. Deere sonnes wee confesse our errour, that there were so many daies of respite giuen, wee did thinke they had bene employed in sounder counsels, the longer they did consult among themselues, the more iust and reuerent we thought their answere would haue bene, and more for their soules health. But for their answere, they demanded
before all things, a Suspension of Armes and Censures, adding
great cōplaints, the which Sixtus maintained to be contrary to the

truth, intreating them to resolue within eight daies.
            The Pope reports all this vnto the Consistory, and they finde it
hard to suspend the Excommunication,Vnpleasing to the Cōsistory.

were excommunicated had made any satisfaction to the Church,
nor made demonstration of repentance: It was held a distastefull
thing that the Accused should prescribe a Law vnto his Iudge,
that the Iudge should do the duty of the Accused, and the Accused
performe the office of the Iudge: It was a ridiculous thing to
demand suspension of that which had not beene obserued, and that
they should grant that which they had already taken of their owne
authorities, and they said; if they feare Censures, why do they contemne
them? if they feare them not, why desire they to haue
things granted, which in their iudgement, they hold not necessary?
            Moreouer they considered,Suspensiō of Armes not alwaies necessary to make a peace. that it was not alwaies expedient to
haue a cessation of Armes to make a Peace: That many Treaties
had beene made, both within and without Italy, in the heate of
Armes; That in this suspension there might not onely be losse but
also danger, for that the course of the correction being broken,
mens minds grew incorrigible & more obstinate: And yet the Embassadours
of France did shew, that priuate considerations could
not haue such great effect as the generall for the common good of
Christendome; That the peace which the Venetians had made
was no let, but the other Soueraigne powers of Italy might
ioyne together to resist the Turke, euery one binding himselfe to
entertaine a certaine number of Souldiers, for so long time as
should be thought fit.
            Vpon this consideration,Censures suspended & a Truce made. the Censures and Armes are suspended,

In disscussing of those doubts, the publicke charity preuailed ouer our priuate interest, and inclining with a desire to that which the French Embassadours had deliuered in the Kings name, and by his mediation and commandement, for the procuring of a a peace, we haue relinquished our owne right, and thought good to surcease. The Embassadours of Venice and Florence fall to an examination
of the Articles: They finde not any pleasing vnto them,
they make new demands, & wil haue all restored which had ben taken
during the war, they passe ouer the Popes interests & respects
highly, and say plainely that the affaires are changed, being no
more in the estate they were in before they had made a peace with
the Turke, the which they declared they would maintain constantly

King, of Edward King of England, of Ferdinand King of Arragon,
of Maximilian Arch-Duke of Austria, and of the Confederates:
He complained of the contempt of his authority, and told
the Embassadors of the league, that he lamented the obstinacy of
their Princes, who would not hearken to the voyce, and wholesome
counsell of their father, whose bounty they did abuse, and had more
confidence in their owne Armes, then affection to the Church
their mother: That he was exceeding sorry that the Kings Embassage,
and the good Offices which he had done to the holy Sea,
should remaine without effect, that for his part, his conscience
should neuer accuse him to haue contemned any thing for the
good of the Church, that his armes were alwayes open to receiue
them that would repent. And for that the Embassadors of Venice,
Florence, and Millan, demanded leaue to depart, he declared that
they were free, that he would not force the necessity of their returne;
but if they would stay, they might with all safety, that it
might be, time and their presence, might make those things easie,
which seemed difficult;Intelligē
                  ces of the Duke of Brittaine discouered. and that sometimes Treaties were broken
off to be vnited againe more firmely.
            But it is more time to repasse the mountaines, and see how the
King makes his profite of these last accidents. Estates are like vnto
ships, all things are not so well, but there is still some disorder: It
seemed that the Duke of Bourgundies death had brought France
to that estate, as she could not desire any thing else to make her
felicity perfect; But there is yet another Duke which hinders this
perfection: It is he of Brittany, who since the Treaty made at
Victoire neere vnto Senlis, hath not discontinued his practises in
England, forgetting that the English had alwayes reserued this
Prouince for the exercise of their Armes, when they should be
weary of peace;
                  Edward the third, King of England, would not haue the Duke of Brittaine comprehē
                  ded in the Treaty of Bretigny, to the end he might haue meanes to vent in this prouince the boiling humours of his Realme, & haue where to discharge himselfe of his Souldiers. and that they haue taken delight to see him in
bad tearmes with the King. The Duke was more earnest and carefull
hereof, when he saw that he had lost the Duke of Bourgundy,
assuring himselfe that the King would fall vpon him, and that it
would be verified of him what the Fable sayes of the Larke in the
Hawkes tallants:The weake receiues from one that is more strong, what Law he pleaseth. The Larke (saith Hesiodus) demanded of the Spar-hawke, why he offered him violence. Miserable (answered the Spar-hawke) why dost thou complaine, a stronger hath thee in his power?
                Wherefore he sent often to visit the King, to
entertain him in a good opinion of his pains, and the fidelity of his
promises, and yet he continued his practises with the King of England.
            The secret of this practise depended of Peter Landays,

                Superintendant

                He imployed and called Maurice
Bromell, who carried and recarried the Packets. The King, who
had spies euery where, discouers the messenger, and wins Bromell,
who by meanes of a Norman that could counterfeit the King of
Englands hand, the Duke of Brittaines, and their Secretaries, sent
the originall letters vnto the King, and carried the counterfeit Copies
into England.
            The Duke of Brittaine, who thought he had no other witnesse in
this action, then the Sunne, and that the king could haue no knowledge
therof,In Actions which we think to keepe most secret, there is alwaies one witnesse irreproueable, our owne Conscience. sent his seruants often vnto him, to assure him, that
he was wholly at his deuotion, and would not depend of any but of
him. When as the King had meanes to verifie the contrary by the
proofes which the Norman put into his hand, hee caused Chauuin,
Chancellour of Brittanie to bee stayed, with all them that
did assist him in his Embassage, to the number of sixe or seuen
of the Dukes Councell, and committed them to close Prison
for ten or twelue dayes, the reason whereof they did not vnderstand.When as an inferior Prince deales not plainly and sincerely, with one that is mighty, he must not thinke it strange, if hee makes knowne the knowledge he hath of his subtilties, euen vpon them that know not any thing: and who, by the Law of Nations, should not be drawne in question. For this reason Lewis the eleuenth commits to prison Chauvin the Chancellour, the Seneshall of Vennes, and sixe of the Duke of Brittanies Councellers.
            
            
               Chauvin seeking to iustifie his Maisters Actions, and imputing
this imprisonment to the power which some standerous suggestion
had ouer the King, they did shewe him all the Letters which
did witnesse the strict intelligence which was betwixt the King of
England, and the Duke of Brittaine. Your Maister (said the King)
is much too blame, who assuring me of his affection, shewes the contrary
in seeking the ancient enemies of this Crowne. I haue told him
often,Letters of the Duke of Brittany shewed to his Chancellor. that so long as he should hold the English for his friends, hee
must needes bee an enemy to France; and to the end hee shall not
excuse himselfe, nor contradict this truth, behold two and twenty
Letters vpon this subiect. Chauvin viewes them, and considers
of them: All his Rethoricke is not able to excuse the Duke,
he had rather calme the Kings iust choler by confessing and yeelding,
then to incense him more by contradicting.
            The Duke of Brittanny seeing, that by the treachery of his
Seruants, his faith could not bee vntainted with the King, hee
sent for Peter Landays,
               
                  Peter Landays suspected of treason. who alone had the charge of this Negotiation;
Being much confounded, he had no other answere, but
a protestation of his Innocency, submitting himselfe to the rigors
of Iustice, if hee were found tainted with any such disloyalty:
then remembring that hee had not employed any therein,
but Maurice Bromell, who had carried the Letters, and the
answeres, hee caused him to bee apprehended. This miserable
wretch confest all; and vpon his confession, he was put into a

Sacke, and cast into the Riuer, to the end the King should discouer
no more.
            
               Peter Landays was vpon the declining of the precipice of his
life, and of this great fauour which hee had with the Duke of
Brittaine, if Bromel had not beene found; but hee was not contented
to haue escaped this danger,Hatred of Landays against the Chancellor Chauvin.
                his diuellish malice engaged
the Chancellour Chauvin, whose Iustice and Integrity hee
could not endure, being mad to see him so honest a man.An honest man is a great torment to malitious and wicked mindes: for although they blame and flye Vertue, yet they consider the glory and light, and that whatsoeuer is goodly in the world, as tributary to it. All the gold that is aboue, or vnder the earth, is not comparable to Vertue. Plat. & Plut.
                The
meanest Vertue may procure Greatnesse that is vitious to enuy.
Hee thought that the Wheele of his Fortune could not well be
staied; but being obserued by so quicke and piercing an eye, to
discouer and censure that which hee did, and that which hee did
not. But hee had more paine to accuse him, then to slander him.
Chauvins actions were like vnto well polished Tables, the flyes of
detraction could not sticke vpon them, they rest vpon rough and
vneuen places.
            Hee makes the Duke beleeue, that without Chauvin the King
had neuer discouered the Negotiation of England, that hee had
Intelligence with him, depended of his Commandements, and
was his Pentioner. The Duke was so hooded by Landays, as he did
not see but by his eyes, giues eare to this slander, chargeth the Innocency
of this good seruant,Death of the Chancellor in prison in great pouerty. puts him in prison, and makes
him dye there with griefe, languishing, and hunger.
                  Chauvin, Chaunceller of Brittaine, after two yeares and a halfe imprisonment, dyed of languishing and want in prison: foure poore Beggars carried him to be buried in the Franciscans Church at Vennes. He was so
old, as he could not liue many yeares, but his memory shall liue
euer, as a memorable example of the iniuries which Fortune hath
done to Vertue.
            Soone after Landays appeared vpon the Theater of Gods Iustice,
to make knowne the shame which attended him at the last step of
his greatnesse. The Duke could not preuent it, but he must iustly
feele the same fortune which he had caused Chauvin to run:
                  Landays processe made. for he
was taken prisoner euen in the Dukes Chamber, his processe was
made, and hee did insolently and arrogantly confesse all the excesse
of his life, vpon assurance which the Duke had giuen him to
saue him, and to draw him out of the Hang-mans hands. In the
end, for his Concussions, Violences, Thefts, Outrages, and other
Crimes,And hanged at Nantes the 19. of Iuly. 1485. he was condemned to be hanged, and the Iudgement executed
before the Duke had any aduertisement; the Castle gates
were guarded vntill the execution was done, to the end, that not any
one should enter.It was thought fit that the Earle of Cō
                  minges should go and entertaine the Duke, during the execution; when as the Duke sawe him, he demanded in what estate Landays processe was: he answered, That the Iudges wold come and speake with him. They shall do well, said the Duke, for whatsoeuer he hath committed, I pardon him, and will that hee shall not dye. When as hee vnderstood of the execution, hee said, that his ereherous Gossip, the Earle of Comminges had deceiued him. He was therewith so troubled in minde, as few men saw him. This Landays came of base parentage: hee
was the Dukes Taylors Boy, he had charge of his Ward-robe, and
by little and little grew to haue the absolute command of the afffaires
of Brittaine. When as men of base condition are aduanced
to great places, they forget themselues, they abuse their fauour,
and respect not their fortune with that humility and moderation
which they ought.

man leaue to depart this life, when as he gaue him no meanes to
liue.
            But let vs returne vnto the King:Townes vpon the riuer of Somme recouered by the king. Before the newes of Duke
Charles his death was assured, hee brake the Truce which should
haue continued seuen yeares longer, and seized vpon Abbeuille,
Dourlans, Monstreuil, Montdidier, Peronne, Han, Bohain, Saint
Quintin, and the Townes vpon the Riuer of Somme, which by the
death of Charles, the last Male of the House of Bourgondy, returned
vnto the King.
            Hee wisht hee might haue done as much to all the Low Countreyes,
and by some iuster meanes, then by Armes, in marrying his
sonne to the heire of Bourgondy.
                  Lewis desires to marry his sonne to the heire of Brittain But beside the great inequality
of their ages, hee had promised him to the Princesse of England,
and he desired to giue him the heire of Brittaine, for she was more
sutable to his sonnes age; and this Princesse was a Rampart against
the fury of the English, who being seconded by the Dukes of Brittaine,
haue entred that way, and come into the heart of the
Realme.
            He perswaded himselfe to preuaile by other meanes: he had good
seruants at Gand, who had made shew that this kinde of gouernement
was against their mindes; and that they affected new Maisters.
The day after that the Ganto is receiued newes of the Dukes death, they put to death 25 men of their Lawe. The pretex was, for that they had executed a man before they were confirmed in their charge. He thought that in taking some of the chiefe Townes of the
Countrey, the rest in this confusion of Councels, and weakenesse
of forces, would yeeld of themselues; and as if there had beene no
other difficulty, he disposed already of places and gouernments of
Prouinces.
            His humor was to imploy meane men in great affaires, and to
handle great works with small engines. He sent Robinet of Odenfort
to S. Omer, and Oliuer le Dain, his Barber, to Gand, who was of such
power and authority, euen with the King, as the French going out
of the Realme, they demaunded of them in mockery, among

other newes of Court,Presumption of Oliuer le Daine.

Gand, was so presumptuous, as hee thought he could make this
Towne subiect to the Kings will, and tooke this charge vpon him
to goe thither, vnder colour to carry some message to the Princesse,
who had called an Assembly of the Estates at Gand,Estates in the Law Countries held at Gand. The Oath of fidelity was renued to the Princesse: for it had in already taken by Guy of Ro

Ape, but made him more ridiculous to them that knew the basenesse
of his breeding.Basenesse of birth is a reproach which is giuen to them that gloriously forget thēselues. Iphicrates, Tully and Marius endured it.
            
            Yet the King perswaded himselfe that hee would doe wonders
in this Citty, telling the chiefe Noble-men of his Court,
that they whom he had sent to Gand, and Saint Omer, were able
to get the keyes of the Towne, and to draw in his Troopes. He
made account of the one, as Augustus did of Mecenas,

to speake vnto her, but in priuate, hee caused himselfe to
bee scorned; and this disgrace concerned him that had sent him,
who had not considered, that such Commissions did properly belong
to men of birth, or of great merit; and that it seemes they
contemne the Prince to whom they send Embassadours of base
condition.They that carry the Title of Embassadours, should be men of credit & reputation. Caesar said, that the Suisses sent Embassadors vnto him, the chiefe wherof was Deuico, he who in the Cassian warre had bin their Generall.

practises in their Towne, hee was in danger to haue beene cast into
the Riuer; whereupon hee retired to Tournay, and practised
thirty or forty men, by whose meanes hee brought in Mony with
his Company, which hee had at Saint Quintin, and seized of the
Towne, sending seuen or eight of the Gouernors to Paris.
            
            The Princesse Councell seeing that her subiects fidelity was
shaken, and the Townes of Picardy deliuered vnto the King, that
she had to deale with a Cyrus,
               Embassage sent from the Princesse of Bourgundy to the King. and that she was no Tomyris
               Cyrus hauing attempted against the Massagets, a people of Scythia, Tomyris their Queene being Imperious, high minded & proud, sent him the choice, either to go & assaile her in her owne countrey, where she would attend him, or that he would stay in his owne, and she would go vnto him. to say
vnto him, If thou comest not, I will goe: that euery one followed the
strangers fortune, they sent a great Embassage vnto the king,
consisting of many Noble-men, and of all the orders of the Countrey;
among which were William Hugonet her Chancellor, and the
Lord of Himbercourt, the dukes chiefe seruants, they found the king
at Peronne, where he had made his entry, and present the Princesses
letters vnto him, who besought him to protect her, rather then
oppresse her, as hauing the honour to come out of the House of
France, and rather consider the pittifull estate of her present Condition and Sexe, the which besides was subiect to the Councels
and Authority of passionate Men, then the respects of his owne
priuate Interest: That all subiects of Hatred and Offence
should bee buried in the Tombe of Duke Charles her Father:

                   the Supreame Authority lights vpon a woman, she must of necessity bee supported with great and eminet vertues, with a generous courage, and a wise conduct to gouern her selfe: vpon the first refusall discontētments grow, and then factions. Simon Rosgon Bishop of Agria, demanded of Q. Elizabeth, daughter to Sygismond, and wise to Albert King of Hungary, the Arch-bishoprick of Strigonia, to whom shee answered: Whilst I raigne you shall not haue it; and he replied; as long as I liue you shal not raign, and they both kept their words. That it was piety, for a great Prince, her Kinsman and Soueraigne,
to defend her in her Countries and Estates, whereunto she
succeeded according to the Lawes and Ordinances of Kings his
Predecessors, and in the end that she was resolued to referre her
affaires, to the good gouernment of foure persons, of the Dowager
her Mother, Sister to King Edward of England, of Rauasteen
brother to the Duke of Cleues, her neere kinsman, of Hugonet
her Chancellour, and of the Lord of Himbercourt.
            The King gaue them good words,The King winnes the Princesses Embassadors. and hauing entertained euery
Deputy a part, following the first precept, not to force all at
once, but to pull of the horses taile haire by haire:To shew that perseuerance & cōtinuance doth by little and little preuaile ouer all things: Sertorious caused two horses to be brought, the one leane, feeble, and old, the other fat and strong; behind the leaner he set a strong and mighty man, and behind the other a slender weake one: a signe being giuen the strong man tooke the leane horse by the taile and sought with all his force to pull it of, but he laboured and sweate in vaine: The weake man who was behind the great horse began to pull it haire by haire, and soone stript it without any paine. Plu.
                Hee drew the
cheife of them to be at his deuotion, vpon the assurance of the marrying
of his sonne with their Mistresse: Hugonet hauing all his
lands in Picardy towards Amiens, and Himbercourt in Bourgundy,
giue themselues vnto him, and for the first proofe of their
affection, they dispose Phillip of Creuecoeur Lord of Cordes to
open the gates of Arras vnto him, holding him freed from his
oath to the Princesse: They thought that if this marriage tooke
effect, there were nothing to be diuided betwixt the house of
France and Bourgundy.
            Vpon the same opinion,Townes yeelded to the King. Hedin, Therouenne, and Monstreuill
yeeld:That which the Ancients called Gessoriacum, is at this day named by the French Bologne, by the English Bollen, and by the Flemings Beunen: Beatus Rhenatus saith, that he had seene an old Inscription, where were these words: Gessoriacum, quod nune Bononia.
                Bulloine did not beleeue so lightly, it endured a Battry;
the King entred, and finding this Towne fit for the fortification of
the frontiers (as it hath bene alwaies famous on either side the
Sea) he compounded with Bertrand de la Tour, who was Lord in
propriety, and as the new Lord, he did homage without Girdle or
Spurres, bare-head, and on his knees, to the Virgin Mary, offering
as a right and duty vnto her image, a Hart of Massiue Gold,
weighing two thousand Crownes,Boloigne vnder the Virgine Maries homage. vpon condition that from
thence-forth, he and his successors Kings, should hold the Earledome
of Bulloine of the Virgine, should do her homage, and at
euery change of a Vassall, should pay a Hart of pure Gold of that
weight.
            Thus the Princesse of Flanders,Arras besieged. saw herselfe forced to quite
that, which she could not keepe;It is better to quite that which we cannot keepe, then to loose it in keeping it. Phillip of Macedon did willlingly abandon many places vnto the Romanes, and a great continent of his Country which he saw he could not defend, rather then to be seene to haue lost it vnwillingly: So after the Battell of Cannes, the Romanes refused to succour many of their Allies, desiring rather to loose them, then to be blamed for that they were not able to defend them. T. Liu. Dec. 4.
                yet the King held nothing of
Arras but the Citty, which de Cordes had deliuered vnto him, and
wherein he remained Gouernour. The Lord of Lude defeated
the Horsemen which they of Doway had sent, and in this Encounter
Vergy was taken, and remained a whole yeare prisoner in
chaines, for that he would not be sworne vnto the King, protesting
obstinately that he could not cease to be seruant to the house of

Bourgundy, nor begin to affect that of France:
                  It is dishonorable rashly to fall from the duty which we owe vnto the Prince, L. Maenius an Officer to Augustus, being carried prisoner to M. Anthony, he demāded of him, What wilt thou shall bee done with thee: that they strangle mee, answered Maeniu
                        •
                     , forneither for grace, nor punishmēt, will I euer cease to be Caesars souldiour, neither will I beginne to be yours. They of the
Towne seeing themselues prest demanded a Pasport of the Bastard
of Bourbon, Admirall of France, for two or three and twenty
Deputies vnder colour of going to Bollen to treat with the King.
            They go forth with this pasport, but being followed and surprised
vpon the way to Flanders, they were led to Hedin, and by a
sentence giuen by the Prouost condemned to loose their heads: the
King arriuing vpon the execution staid it: Princes alwaies cause
punishments to cease when they are in presence: They told him
that among them that were executed, there was a Parisian called
Oudard of Bussy, to whom he had giuen the office of a Maister of
Accompts in the chamber at Arras: Hee caused his head to bee set
vpon a stake in the Market-place, wearing a scarlet hood, furred
with Meneuer.Arras yeelded by composition. A breach being made, an assault valiantly giuen, &
basely defended, Arras yeelded by composition, the victory was
but of bare wals, for their hearts remained firme to the house of
Bourgundy:There were a good number of Cittizens found in Arras, who suffred thēselues rather to be hanged, then they would say, God saue the King.
                The king also thinking it impossible to make this people
obedient, and to imprint the Flower de luce in their hearts, caused
most of the Inhabitants to depart,To people a Towne with ancient subiects, & to expell the naturall Inhabitants, is a means to assure it, but very inhumane: It was a pittifull spectacle to see poore men ladē with their infants vpon their shoulders, passe out of the Coast Townes where they were borne, by the commadement of Phillip king of Macedo, & to go into Emathia, quitting their houses and inheritances to the Thracians. Tit. Liu. lib. 10. Decad. 4.
                & planted naturall Frenchmen,
commanding the Town should be Francis-towne, & that with
her first name, she should loose the ancient hatred she bare vnto
France. This people had no sooner yeelded, but they made it known
how much they were grieued to see themselues reduced vnder the
command of a new Maister, for the King hauing sent the Cardinall
of Bourbon, the Chancellor of Oriole, Des Cordes Gouernor of the
Towne, and Guyot Pot Bayliffe of Vermandois, to receiue the oath of
fidelity; they saw themselues assayled, in the Monastery of S. Vast,
where they dined, with a furious mutiny of the people, crying kill,
kill, The kings seruants were onely made afraid, but these mad-men
repented it, for many of them were stript and slaine, and the City fined
at three-score thousand Crownes.
            The Princesse remained at Gand,
               Gantois ready to reuolt against their Princesse. with much trouble to keepe the
Gantois in obedience: She knew well their sedition, but she dissembled
the nūber of the seditious;It is not good to hold all them to be wicked, in open shew, which are so in effect: In old time they did not thinke it necessary to marke all their slaues, to the end they should not know their owne strength: In seeking out all the seditious, they know one another, & learne how many they are. seeming to make account of their
fidelities whose reuolt and treachery she held to be certaine: They
would haue againe the priuileges, which her father & grand-father
had taken from them, they vndertake the conduct, and absolute direction
of affaires, not being able to endure them, who for their
wisedome and experience had deserued the first places in the Princesse
Councell, & she had not any person capable to make head against
this Mutiny, the which doth neuer fortefie it self, but through
the weakenesse and cowardise of them that may suppresse it.A people which is fearefull, is alwaies humble and tractable: when as Mutines see the powerfull sword of Iustice before their eyes, they distrust one another: Being all together they are Lyons, and diuided Goats.
            
            They made an Assembly in forme of Estates, and resolued that
from thence-forth she should be gouerned by the aduice of the Estates,
who should send vnto the King, to acquaint him with this

resolution, and to beseech him to allow thereof, and in this consideration
to cease all Acts of Hostility against her Countries: These
Embassadours come vnto the King, thinking to bring him a subiect
of great content: assuring him that their Princesse desired nothing
but the honour of his friend-ship and protection; being resolued
not to do any thing but by the aduice of the three Estates of
her Countries. The King, who knew well the humour of the Gantois,
the confusion of this Princesses affaires, and had a desire to
make his profite in this trouble,Embassadours contradicted & confoū
                  ded.
               In many things, but especially in this, Lewis did imitate the most politick of Romane Emperours, who held it for one of the best maximes of State, to haue peace at home, & war far off. Princes which haue followed this course, haue atained to a perfect prosperity of their affaires, others haue gone astray. said vnto them: My Maisters, I
know not what to thinke of the cause that drawes you hether, knowing
wel, that it is not conformable to that which you say vnto me, & that your
mistresse will not aduow that she hath giuen you charge to tell me, that
that she would be gouerned by the aduice of the Estates of the Country,
for she hath giuen me to vnderstand the contrary: And as these men
protested of the truth of their instructions, and seemed resolute,
the King heares them coldly, & showes them a letter written by the
Princesse, and brought by Hugonet her Chancellor, & Himbercourt.
            
            At the sight of this letter,The King deliuers the Princesses letters to the Embassadours. which made mention that the Princesse
was resolued to referre her affaires to the discretion of foure persons,
& not of the Estates, they end their Embassage, and attend no
other answere, being satisfied to see themselues deceiued, and the
King suffers them to go ful of choller & reuenge. They present thē
               selues
vnto the Princesse, to giue an account of their Embassage,
complaining, bitterly and indiscreetly, that she had made them
to carry a message vnto the king, contrary to that which she had resolued;
that she had reserued truth in the heart, and put falshood in
their mouths to ruin them: When as the Princesse sought to iustefie
the truth of her intentions,
                  When as the Deputies of Gād presented themselues vnto the Princesse Councell, saying; That the King had let them see the contrary of their Embassage, the Princesse sought to maintain that she had done nothing contrary to their instructiōs, Then (said Philip de Comines) the Pentioner of Gand, drew out of his bosom the said letter, before al the world, & gaue it her. He shewed that he was a bad man and of smal respect, to do that affront to a yong Gentlewomā, to whō so villanous a scorne should not bee done: for if shee had committed any error, she shold not haue been reprehended publikely: It is not to bee demanded, if she were ashamed, for she had told euery one the contrary: Phil de Com. assuring them, that what she gaue
them by instruction, was what she thought; they present vnto her
the letter which the King had giuen them: She held this for a great
affront, and contempt, and the bloud which appeared in her face,
discouered the trouble of her mind: The Gantois hauing no means
to discharge their choller vpon her, vpon her mother in Law, nor
vpon Rauesteen; they vomite it out vpon Hugonet, and Imbercourt, the
chiefe of the Princesses Councell. They were instantly ceased on,
imprisoned, and accused to haue caused the Citty of Arras to bee
yeelded,
                  Oliuer of la March saith, that the Chancellour Hugonet, confest that he had concealed the Duke of Bourgundies letters, written at Nancy, the which did much import the safety of his person and Army. and to haue taken mony of a priuate man of Gand, to
giue him a fauourable end of his suite, and to haue infringed the
priuiledges of Gand,
                  Hogonet & Imbercourt condēned to die. the which may not be changed nor broken
without paine of death: Vpon these accusations, or rather slanders,
the Maior & Aldermē of Gand, condemn thē to loose their heads.
In 6 daies their processe was made, the number of their freinds, nor
the appearance of their innocency, which in those extremities is the
last refuge, could not saue them.Innocency is the last refuge of the miserable, & helps him much, that hath nothing else remaining: It hath sometimes set the condemned in the Iudges place: Neri, sonne to Vgucione of Fagiuola, Lord of Luga, condemned Castrucio to death, and the people freed him going to execution, and set him in Neris place. Three houres after the sentence
was pronounced they were executed, without any respect to the
appeale which they had made to the Court Parliament at Paris,

                  〈2 pages missing〉
               
               
Brother in law,The Pope and Emperor offended at this impiety. at whose instance, the Pope, and the Emperour
Fredericke, send vnto Adolph to set the Country at liberty, and to
yeeld obedience to his father; and vpon the contempt of this commandement
they write vnto the Duke of Bourgundy, not to suffer
this impiety any longer.
            The Duke was then about Dourlans, he commanded Adolph
to come, and to bring his father: Adolph durst not displease so
mighty a Neighbour: The Duke heares them in their complaints,
and confronts them together; The sonne accuseth the father of villanous
and wicked actions,Duke of Bourgundy Iudge of the quarrell. whereof he presently purgeth himselfe,
and by the testimony of Noblemen that were there present; at this
confrontation the sons slander was discouered and detested, then
the father, transported with extreme griefe presented the single cō
               bat
vnto his son. The Duke would not allow it, for the vncertaine
euent could not be (where soeuer the victory fell) without a certain
crime: Hauing conferred of this businesse with his Councell, hee
ordained that the father should retaine the title of Duke with the
Towne of Graue, and 3000. Crownes for his entertainment, & the
son should haue all the rest. Notwithstanding that this iudgement
was so fauourable for the sonne, as all men thought that the Iudge
was more affected to him then to the father;
                  Adolph had maried Catherine of Bourbon, daughter to Iohn Duke of Bourbon, and Anne of Bourgundy, sister to Phillip: The Sigr. of Argenton saith, that the Duke fauored Adolph in respect of this marriage. yet this vnnaturall
sonne, straying from all obedience & duty,
                  Decius was commended for that hee refused the Empire, saying; that being Emperour, hee should forget to be a sonne. Imperet pater meus, meum imperium sit parere humiliter imperanti: Let my father rule, my Empire shall be, humbly to obay him that rules: Val. Max. lib. 4.
                would not be satisfied,
saying; That his father had raigned long enough, and that he should
content himselfe with the pension of 3000. Crownes, and that he should
neuer set his foote in the Countrey of Guelders: To be short, that hee
had rather cast his father into a Well, and himselfe headlong after him,
then consent to the conditions of this sentence.
               It is an impious thing, saith Plato, for any one to force his father, and his Country, he saith more-ouer that the child should haue a care not to offend him, for there is not any praier which the Gods heare sooner, then that which the fathers make against their children.
            
            The Duke being prest to go vnto his Army before Amiens,
leaues them in this dispute, and would not alter his iudgement.
The sonne fearing that his obstinacy might bring him to the place
where he had put his father, and knowing that few men affected
him, stale away in a disguised French habite, and tooke the way to
Graue:
                  Adolph steales away and is taken prisoner. But passing the Riuer at Namur, with one man in his company,
he was knowne by a Priest, and staied by others, and conducted
to the Duke of Bourgundy, who sent him prisoner to Villeuor,
and afterwards to Courtray, where he remained miserable,
and no man pittied him in his misery,It is a cruelty and inhumanity to pitty a parricide: The punishment which he endures, how great soeuer, doth not giue so much amazement, as the crime causeth horror and execration. vntill that the Gantois set
him at liberty, to be their Generall in the warre of Tournay. The
father dying had giuen the Dutchy of Guelders to the Duke of
Bourgundy.
            The warre being vndertaken, by them of Gand against Tournay,
and the Mutiny growing insolently violent against the Dutchesse
of Bourgundy, they had need of a Head, for without it their
hands were not much to be feared:He is set at liberty by the Gantols. They cast their eyes vpon
Adolph, draw him out of prison, and like mad-men (as they are)

thinke that this cruell wretch, who could not loue his father, will
haue a care of their affaires.What piety can bee expected of him that hath beene impious, and inhuman to his owne father? Qui fallere audebit Parentes qualis erit in ceteris? He that dares deceiue his Parents, what will hee bee to other men? Casiod.
                They giue him absolute command,
being resolued to aduance him higher then his Predecessours, and
to make him husband to the Dutchesse. People in such distractions
haue played madder prankes, and made more indiscreete
elections.
            He lead them to Tournay, where hauing burnt the Suburbs, he
was slaine: His death was not more honourable vnto him then
his life. The Princesse was not sorry for this action; For if hee
had returned tryumphing from this exploite, the Gantois had forced
her to mary him; and rather then to haue had a husband of their
choice, she would haue taken one by chance, as the heire of Bohemia
had done,

They tooke him, and led him to the Princesse, who made him her husband, and gaue him to the people for their King: His wodden shoes were long kept in the Cathedrall Church of Prage, and shewed to the Kings of Bohemia, to make them remember their beginning.
            
            The Princesse of Bourgundies affaires impaired. Many Physitions
vndid the Patient. The King had a mighty Army, which
kept all the Low Countries in awe, in his absence it was commanded
by the Bastard of Bourbon Admirall of France: There was
nothing attempted by the enemy, but was defeated. In many exploits
of warre, which were made vpon this Frontier, I finde that
Guerin le Groin Baliffe of Saint Peter le Moustier, and Robinet of
Quesnoy, Either of them Captaine of a hundred Lances, tooke
a great Conuoy of Money, which came to Doway, and with a
small Troupe defeated a great number of Horse, which did
gard it.
            If the King of England had declared himselfe for the Princesse
of Bourgundy, there had beene a great alteration, and she had

called the Tribute of France: He gaue great Pensions to the Chancellor,

her in minde of the letter which she had written, by the commandement
of Duke Charles her father, carrying a promise of marriage

vp the places vnto him, which he had taken, according to the
Kings commandement, grew discontented, reuolted, and recouered
in a manner all that Craon had wonne in the County, and then
cast himselfe into Gy.
            From thence Craon besieged Dole,Dole besieged. contemning them that were
within it, as men whom he held to be without courage or defence.
This contempt, accompanied with carelessenesse, made him to
loose his honour, the Kings fauour, and the Towne which he
might haue taken; for the besieged made a sally in a night that was
windy, darke, and rainy, with such aduantage, as they surprized him,
and forced him to ritire, with the losse of some of his Ordinance,
and of three thousand men.The fault of a Generall of an Army is sufficiently punished by the losse of his honour, and his Princes loue and fauour. The Romanes had no punishment for such errours, to the end their Commanders should not haue their minds troubled with the dangers, and ordinary Inconueniences in such charges, and with the examples of such, whose faults had bene punished with death: For it is impossible to resolue iudiciously betwixt feare and suspition.
               
            
            
               Charles of Amboise, Lord of Chaumont, was substituted in his
place, who aduised the King to renew his aliance with the Suisses,
and thereby to weaken the house of Bourgondy. The perswasion

of this counsell was not difficult: the King thought nothing more
fit for the safety of his estate, then to make his enemies weake of
Intelligence and Friends: He sent some to practise this league, and
pursued it with great vehemency. He had receiued so great content
in the ruine of the most obstinate of his enemies, as after the
Battels of Granson and Morat, hee did nothing but speake of the
Suisses valor,

Hee sent Embassadours with rich presents: hee gaue them after the battell of Granson, vntill his death, aboue a million of Florins of the Rhin. and esteeme their Friendship. He put them in greater
reputation then euer they had beene, although they had much
honoured the establishment of their liberty with a triumph of nine
or ten Battels; and that we may say of them, as Titus Liuius did of
the Romans,Nulla vnquam Respublica nec maior nec sanctior, nec bonis exemplis ditior fuit, nec in quam tam serae auaritia luxuriaque immigrauerint, nec vbi tantus, ac tamdiu paupertati ac parfimoniae honos fuerit. There was neuer Commonweale greater, nor more holy, nor richer in good examples, nor into which auarice & luxury crept later, nor whereas pouerty and parsimony were so long honoured.
                That neuer Common-weale was better maintained
in her ancient discipline; nor wheras Auarice had lesse credit, and
Simplicity more honour, then in that of the Suisses.
            For these reasons the king made a defensiue leaue with them,Alliance of France with the Suisses. &
by the Treaty, gaue himselfe the Name of the first Ally of their
Common-weale, and tearmed himselfe their Bourgesse.The Duke of Sauoy said, that the Title of the first Ally of the Suisses, belonged to him before all others. They
promised to furnish him with eight thousand men at all times for
foure German Florins and a halfe of monthly pay.2000 poūd sterling. Moreouer, he
gaue them a pension of twenty thousand Franckes, to be distributed
among them.
            By the meanes of this Alliance, his forces increased greatly in
Bourgondy, Dole was taken by assault, spoiled, ruined, and made
miserable. But this pillage did impouerish the King, beeing certaine,
that what is taken from Townes vanquished, is lost for the
Victor.
                  Craesus, King of Lydia, seeing Cyrus Souldiers running vp and downe the Towne of Sardes, he demanded whither they did run. They go to the spoyle of the Towne answered Cyrus. They take nothing from me (replied Craesus) all they carry away is thine, and not mine.
                Aussonne held out but fiue dayes; Besançon, an Imperiall Towne, continued in her liberties, and was not forced to
more duety then shee had beene accustomed to yeeld vnto the
Earles of Bourgondy. Verdun would not yeeld but by force, and
suffered for her wilfulnesse. Beaune auoyded it, submitting herselfe
to a fine of forty thousand Crownes.
            The King labouring to ruine the house of Bourgondy,Estate of the affairs of Castille
apprehended the rising of that of Castille, seeing that by the marriage
of Ferdinand and Isabel, the Realmes of Castille and Arragon,
which had beene diuided 405 yeares, were vnited.Castille & Arragon in the beginning were but Earldomes, they were made Realmes after the death of D. Sancho, the great king of Nauarre, who was the last Earle of Arragon & Castille. He would
haue beene nothing sorry, if the contention which was betwixt
them, who should haue the gouernment of Castille, had continued
longer. Queene Isabel said, that as daughter to King Iohn of Castille,
shee was sole heire of the Realme, and that her marriage
should not depriue her of her quality. King Ferdinand obiected,
that he was sonne to Iohn the second, King of Nauarre and Arragon,
descended in the direct line from Iohn the first, King of Castille;
and that it was not fit a woman should carry the Scepter of
so great a Realme.
                  Lipsius speaking of this Prince and Princesse giues this censure, Maritus caetera vir egregius restrictor aut timidior erat retinere sua melior quam augere. Haec dilatabat. The husband a worthy man, a holder fast, or more fearefull: hee was better to hold his owne, then to augment it. She enlarged it. It was concluded by the aduise of the Grands,
               
that all Letters and Expeditions should bee made in the name of
both, and vnder the Seale of both Realmes, of Castille and Arragon,
and the money coined with the Armes quartered.
            This iudgment (wherwith Ferdinand was not well pleased) was
grounded vpon the great and eminent vertue of Isabel,

was aduertised therof by others. She was very constant in al
distemperatures and dolours of the body, for she was deliuered of
her children without any groane or cry.

the interest of so long an abode in the world) had taken from him.

Victoria, to conferre with him vpon the affaires of the realme,

not any with him, but ancient men, aboue threescore years old, and

begun in the Councell of Constance, and decided in that of Basil, in
fauour of Castille; Alphonso, the fift king of Arragon, would not
yeeld it to his father Iohn the second King of Castille.It is a difficult thing sometimes for the prerogatiue of nature to giue place to that of fortune, & dignity; witnesse the Senator of Venice, who would not giue place to his sonne, although he were Duke, who to binde his Father, did alwayes carry a great Crucifix, to the which the father said hee did his duty. The law of
Maiesty was of more force then that of respect and naturall obedience,
wherof the son, how great soeuer, many not dispence himself
towards his father. The Crowne of Castille had alwaies pretended
that Arragon depended of it in soueraignty; and that if it were free,
it was by grace. The King D. Iohn the second, at his returne from
this voyage, dyed at Barcelona.

a Truce, and the Truce a peace, Christendome had great need to
vnite her forces against Mahomet, who besieged Rhodes. The King
obtained a Iubile from Pope Sixtus, and caused it to be published
throughout his Realme to gather mens Almes and Deuotion for
the reliefe and defence of that mighty Bulwarke of Christendome.
But the History doth not say that he gaue any thing of his owne to

giuen him of Mahomets designe, prouided carefully for the defence

should get them; but hee would not attempt this demolition tumultuously,
nor of his absolute authority, but would first haue the
Priests, Monkes, and all others that were interessed. These men, by

fortifications which he made in the Island, and of the ouertures of

Hilles thereabouts, it consisted of an hundred thousand men, and
a great quantity of Artillery: A great troope of horse and foote
came furiously from the Mountaine, to discouer the Towne of
Rhodes; the which were twice beaten and repulst. Their Batteries
being planted, the Canon played against S. Nicholas Tower:
The great Maister was informed of euery thing in the Turkes Army
by a Germaine Inginer, who cast himselfe into the Towne,
and left the Infidels, making shew that the onely zeale of religion
had moued him; hee related the whole estate of the Campe, and
discouered that which they could not learne, but by him. But his
zeale was meere treachery and treason;Treason of a German Inginer. for the which he was soone
after hanged, by the commandement of the great Maister, who
feared Traitors more then Enemies.At the siege of Towns, the practises within are no lesse to bee feared, then the attempts without. Scipio Affricanus said, that he was not so carefull to defend himselfe from the enemy, as from traitors.

most valiant Knights, and best Souldiers to guard it; he viewes the
ruines which the battery had made, and causeth them to be repaired

them the more easily being diuided, batter the Towne in

Thunder, and their ruines like that of Thunder-bolts. The Rhodians
had a Canon which they called the Tribute, which carried
away great heapes of the enemies. The Scorpions, Rammes,
Slings, and Crosse-bowes of the old warres, which carried and
forced Mil-stones, and Rockes, with such great violence, and so
farre off, wrought not such terrible effects. The Turkes shot out
of Engines, the stones whereof ruined houses where they fell. And
after this maner Philip Augustus, and Richard, King of England, had

in former times ruined Ptolemaid: There was danger to remaine
within, and danger to come out of the houses.

            The great Maister, whose prudence was without feare, and valour
without rashnesse, would not neglect it: he was as couetous
of his peoples bloud, as he was prodigall of his owne; he could
not see them die miserably, but provided a good remedy,To feare to loose his men, & to spare their liues, is the duty of one that commands.

the Women, Children, and vnable persons, to leaue the
houses, causing them to be lodged in a void place, betwixt the houses
and the Towne-wall, vnder Tents, supported with great peeces
of timber. The stones they shot out of their Bombards alwayes
past ouer them: for the Turkes shot onely at the houses, and at the
places most frequented; and if any stone fell there, it found resistance,
and did no harme. At night the people retired into Churches,
that were vaulted.
            He commanded publicke prayers to be made, euery man casting
his eyes to heauen, hauing no other hope of helpe: it was impossible
to defend the wall, and therefore hee made intrenchments,

as the Bashaw saw, that the sole presence of the great Maister was
the chiefe force and defence of Rhodes,The Bashaw seeks to poyson the great Maister. he set two men to poyson
him: the first being surprized, and trembling at the first demaund
they made him, entring into Rhodes, discouered the second.
            Saint Nicholas Tower did so command the Port, as the enemy
thinking that all the defence of Rhodes depended theron, gaue an
assault by night, when as they thought that the besieged, tired with
the continuall toyles of the day, had neglected the defence, they
made their troopes to land secretly, and marched directly to the
Mole, (it is the Port whereas sometimes the Colosse, one of the
wonders of the world stoodThe Colosse of the Sunne at Rhodes, was 70 cubits high of brasse set vpon the port, all ships past betwixt the legges: It was ouerthrowne by an Earth-quake, and laie long vpon the shore: Mabia, a Captaine of the Sarazens, hauing defeated Constant, the son of Constantine, and nephew to Heraclius, in a battell at sea, seized vpon Rhodes, and sold the mettall of this Colosse to a Iew, who laded 900. horse, and sent it to Alexandria, in the yeare 614. that is to say, 1460 yeares after that Charles the Indian, an excellent Grauer, had made it.) but found them that attended them,
who repulst them in such sort, as they lost a great number of their
companions.
            The Bashaw by these first attempts, did iudge of the Issue of the
siege, thinking that he did beate in vaine against this rocke, and
that he might win the great Maister by some other meanes; he demaunded
to speake with him vpon the ditches banke, where hee
told him, that hee wondered at his presumption and rashnesse, in
seeking to resist so mighty a Prince, and obstinately to refuse him
tribute,It is a troublesome and importune demand, to require a tribute of free-men; yea it is insupportable to them that are born to seruitude. The King of Castille demanded from Muly Alboacen, King of Granado, the Tribute and Arrerages, to whom the Embassadors answered, that the Kings of Granado, tributaries to them of Castille, were dead, and therefore their bond was voyd; and that in Granado they carried no more gold nor siluer, but heads of Lances, Arrowes, and such like Armes, to turne them against their enemies, and to free themselues from seruitude and charge. seeing that he could not receiue more honor, then to be

Tributary to a Prince, to whom the greatest of Asia, Affricke, and
Europe paid tribute.
            Although the great Maister did not thinke it fit to spend time
in words, and answeres, for that in such occasions, a Generall
should not haue his hands on his tongue, but his tongue in his
hands, yet would he not suffer the Bashaw to returne without an
answere, as without any profite of his discourse; and therefore he
said vnto him: Know that thou hast not to doe with base and effeminate
Asians,Generous answer of the great Maister. but with Christian Knights, who are ready to burie themselues
in the ruines of this Towne, rather then once thinke of yeelding.
            
            The walles of Rhodes had in few dayes endured 3500 Cannon
shot, the Towers, the Bastions, with the goodliest buildings,
were beaten downe and ruined: there was a breach on all parts,
but in the knights hearts, who were resolued to loose themselues,
rather then to leaue it.Constancy and courage is neuer beter tryed, then in Townes besieged, whereof there haue been admirable examples seene. Some more through obstinacy then reason, haue first slaine their wiues and children, and then killed one another, to win the honour to be constant. The Bashaw, the more to incourage the
Souldiers to an assault, gaue them the spoile of the towne, and caused
it to bee proclaimed by Trumpet, declaring that nothing
should bee saued, but the Infants to bee conducted to the great
Turkes Serrail, that all the rest should bee put to the Sword, hauing
caused 8000 stakes to be made, to impale them that should be
taken aliue.
            All things beeing ready, forty thousand Turkes came vnto the
assault towards the Iewes wall, and the quarter of Ierusalem, with
such fury, as if their Prophet had beene behinde them, like vnto
the Egyptian Gods:King Amasis making warre against the Arabians, caused the statues of the Aegyptians gods, whi

                The attempt was so great, as the Christistians
could not hinder them from planting of their ladders, the
wall was wonne, and their Ensignes set vp in signe of victory; but
they continued not long: the great Maister, and Anthony of Aubusson,
Vicount of Montelier his brother, came to succour them:
they finde many Turkes within the Towne,Scalodoe repulst. whom they cut in peeces,
repulst the rest, and follow them euen to the Bashawes Pauillion,
where they take the Turkes standard Royall, and carry it to
Rhodes.
            They say, that in this assault, the Turkes sawThis vision is related at large by I. Bosio, in the first part of his History, accordingly as it is set downe in the Text, the which to auoyd repetition, I omit. in the aire vpon
the walles,Vision miraculous. a shining Crosse of gold, a virgin attired in white, with
a Target on her Arme, and a Launce in her hand, and a man muffled
with a Camels skinne, followed with a great troope of armed
men, all glittering, which seemed to come to succour the towne:
that the assailants were so amazed and terrified with this vision,
as they that were neerest vnto the walles, durst not goe on, and
they that were farre off, fled. This miracle hath beene mentioned
by all the Historians that haue written of this siege: and William
Coarsin, Vice-Chancellor of the Order, speakes amply in his Commentaries.

The Bashaw mad at their great constancy and resolution,Retreat of the Turks retired,
& caused his Artillery to be carefully drawne away, whereof a Generall
should haue an especiall care; for the losse is dishonorable:
He caused it to be imbarked, with his hurt men. The rage which he
could not poure forth vpon the Inhabitants of Rhodes, shewed it
selfe round about the Towne, leauing no tree vn-cut, Vine vn-puld
vp, nor house vn-burnt. The Bashaw going out of the Port, discouered
two great ships, which Ferdinand, K. of Naples sent to their
succour: he held it an affront if hee should suffer them to passe
without fighting. But in despight of him, and 20. Gallies which assailed
these two ships, they entred the Port after three houres fight.

desirous to know the cause of this ioy, sent certaine Grecians to demand

Army was neere; which being reported vnto him, hee commanded
to weigh anchor, and to set saile, the 18 of August, hauing
continued at this siege 89 dayes, and lost the best part of his Army.

not be ripe before his time: The Emperour Fredericke his father,

Moreouer as men are more grieued for the fayling of things promised,
then for those which are but in expectation; they saw the
Emperour Fredericke did not care to assist him, nor to releeue
him with forces equall to the subiect which did presse him; For he
had written vnto the chiefe Townes, that as soone as he had
setled the affaires of the Empire, he would follow his sonne: and
yet he left him in a confusion of miseries,

was forced to sell and pawne part of her reueneues.
            So the battell of Guinegaste was not followed by any other
losse. Onely the Prince of Orange would make vse of it, hauing
found, that what he had designed against the Kings person
brought him nothing but shame and repentance. Reuenge inuents
villanous practises to please it selfe: Being offended with the King
for that he had not giuen him so great authority as he thought he
had deserued, he was not content to haue left his seruice to follow
the Arch-duke, and to haue caused the Townes of Bourgundy to
reuolt,Attempt against the Kings person discouered. but he attempted against his life, thinking that to free himselfe
from feare hee should vtterly ruine himselfe,To attempt against an enemies life is a testimony of feare and cowardise, vpon an apprehension that hee will bee reuenged: It is a counsell of safety, not of courage.

                he began
to cast forth some words of the tediousnesse and difficulty of the
way, assuring him of greater good with lesse paine; he demanded
of him if he would not be as well pleased to haue it done him
there, as to seeke it so farre off.Hee offers to do any thing. 
               Renond answered that he was well
content, and that he was ready to serue him against all men, yea
were it to go against the King: The Prince of Orange replyed:
Thou sayst well, thou art the man I seeke for, commanding they
should make him good cheere; and after that time they suffered
him to go vp and downe the Towne where he listed, yet they caused
a Legeois to accompany him, least he should escape. The
Bastard of Orange did sound him, to see if he continued in this
humor, & if he did embrace it willingly, or with griefe,We must not hope for any good successe of that which is done vnwillingly. Per multum interest vt

him that if he did persist, he should find a happy fortune: that if
he would sweare to serue the Arch-duke of Austria faithfully, the
Prince of Orange had power to do him good, and his authority
was such, that if he gaue him halfe the Country,He is ingaged with the hope of great rewards. the donation
should not be reuoked. These words wrought the effect, which
may be expected from a soule of that disposition, and in such
affliction as to recouer his liberty, he would haue promised any
thing.
            The Prince of Orange, thinking that there was not any else to
do but to bind him, causeth him to come into his chamber, in the
presence of the Bastard of Orange, to sweare vpon-the Masse-booke,
and the Figure of the Crucifixe,He swears to do what hee would haue him. to do all that he should
command him, and adding this clause vnto his Oath,An oath should haue three

                that if hee
did it not, he renounced God, his Christianisme and Baptisme.
Renond sware, and spake those words freely, and takes a chamber
in Hell (those were his words) if he fayled to effect that which
should be commanded him; but his heart did not consent to this
Oath, desiring rather to deceiue his heart, then to betray his
Maister.
            They left him yet three daies, to see if hee did persist in this resolution,
and to obserue if there were any coldnesse in his words,
or amazement in his Countenance, for that words the most certaine
in shew are changed by the inconstancy of will, the Nature
of man being such, as it oftentimes taketh away Will from all his
intentions,There is nothing constant in humane resolutions, man

               The Prince of Orange gaue him a horse, and carryed him to
Bleterans, where he caused him to come into his Chamber, and

                  ded the Bastard of Orange to bring him fiue boxes of

Leade,They shew him fiue boxes of poison. presenting which vnto Renond, he coniured him by the
oath which he had taken, to vse them as he should direct him: He
let him see that those Boxes were full of diuers Liquors, and that
euery one was of a different colour; then he said vnto him. Thou
knowest that when the King hath heard Masse, or done his deuotions,
hee is accustomed to kisse the ground, and, many times, the corners of
the Altars.Reuenge is blind, it respects neither the holinesse of places, nor the reuerence of things. Princes should learne 'by this example, that death watcheth them, and may surprise them euery where▪
                Thou shalt finde meanes to powre these Liquors at the
corners where he shall kneele, and shalt rub the corners of the Altar:
and to the end, the colour may answere the Ornaments that are vpon it,
and that the diuersity make them not obserue the spots, thou shalt take
greene liquour for greene Ornaments, blacke for blacke, white, for
white, and in like manner, red and blew for the like colours: The
white may be laid vpon the ground, or vpon any gray colour. They are
of this Composition, that as soone as they are powred forth, there will
nothing appeare, and no man can perceiue it, but beware thou dost not
touch it with thy hand.
            
               This defence not to touch them, made Renond demand after
what manner he might lay them on the Ornaments of the Altar,
and not rub them with his finger. The Prince said vnto him:
Thou shalt take a waxe candle, and fret the end of it, then faigning to
make thy Offring, thou shalt according vnto custome, kisse the corners
of the Altar, and then thou shalt touch them with the end of thy Waxe
Candle, rubbing the place, where thou shalt thinke the King will kisse
the Altar.
            
               Renond who did abhorre all this in his soule,He promiseth to do it. made shew by his
words that nothing seemed more iust, nor more easy to be done.
The Prince of Orange did long to haue him gone, and it seemed
to him, that his Reuenge, although shee were drawne by Cruelty,
Boldnesse, Impatiency, and Impudency, as by foure Tigers,
The Chariot of Reuenge hath foure wheeles, Cruelty, Impatiency, Boldnesse, and Impudency. Valde enim velox currus iste ad effundendum sanguinem, qui nec innocentia sistitur, nec patientiaretardatur, nec timore frenatur, nec pudore inhibetur. The Chariot to shed bloud is very swift, it is neither stayed by Innocency, restrained by Patience, Feare doth not brible it, nor shame hold it backe. went not swift enough, saying alwaies, that seeing the King
would not haue him for his seruant, he would neuer hold him for
his Maister. Renond promised to do all this, and made no difficulty
but how he might get out of the Country and not be stayed, for
that as soone as he should enter into the Realme, he was in safety,
and feared not any thing.
            The Prince of Orange gaue him mony, and caused him to bee
conducted out of the Franch-County: He gaue him a Pasport to
passe vnto Bresse, and promised him two hundred Crownes: But,
for that Renond said, the recompence was not equall to the seruice
he vndertooke, he sware by the Prayer Booke, which he held in his
hand, that if he did that which he commanded him, hee would
giue him an Office, which had two hundred and forty pound yearly
fee: That if he dyed, he would cause to be giuen to his wife and
children, thirty pound Sterling of yearely rent, and a house, in the
Towne of Salins, for their retreat: and in a word, that they would
do him more good then they had promised him.
            There remayned no more to do, but to make the Kings Epitaph,
but as they were vpon this discourse, the Signior of Erbeins arriues,

who brake them off, and the Prince caused Renond to retire,
who went downe into a chamber, whereas the tonnell of the chimney
did answere to that of the Prince, by the which he might easily
vnderstand what they said: After that Erbeins had discoursed with
the Prince of the affaires of warre, and that Dijon, Chalons, and
Beaune were ready to yeeld vnto the Arch-duke:The Townes of Dijon, Beaune, and Verdun reuolted against the King. The Lord of Chaumont, who was Gouernour, recouered them. Phil. de Com. saith that it was for want of iudgement in the enemy, and th

                  uernment to that part which hee will support. He heard the
Prince say vnto him: You haue brought vs a man which is very fit for
vs, for the boxes which you know: Whereupon Erbeins said vnto
the Prince, you haue done ill to discouer this businesse, to one that
is a French-man. If you (said he) haue promised to make him a Knight,
the King will make him an Earle: He hath Knighted a Scullion, and giuen
him great meanes,Danger wherin Renond was. for that he discouered the like enterprise:
And what remedy then (said the Prince.) You must cast him into the Riuer
(answered Erbeins) to the end he discouer not any thing: That were
ill done (said the Bastard of Orange) seeing that he was taken in
Sauoy, in the habite of a Marchant, and not of a Souldier; that he
was a poore man, who had neuer spoken vnto Souldiour but with
his hat in his hand.
            This first instrument being made vnprofitable, the Prince did not
for all that desist from his bad intent, his reuenge was so enflamed
with rage and despite against the King, who had contemned him as
a person that could neither do him good nor harme.The King, saith Phil. de Com. did not thinke that the Prince of Orange had had courage, or meanes, to rebell the Country of Bourgundy, as he did a great part of it. The Prince
demanded whom they should then employ for the Boxes: I will
answered Erbeins, giue you one of my seruants called Catherin, a
very faithfull man, who can both go and speake, and knowes many
in Court, and hath ben the Winter past at Arras, Paris, & at Tours.
They sent for this Catherin, who promised to do any thing they
would. Then the Prince of Orange commanded the Bastard of Orange
to carry Renond to Salins, and to haue a care least he escaped.
You shall do well (said Catherin) for if he go into France, I will not go,
for that he will discouer all 
                     〈◊〉
                   designes, and knowing me he will accuse
me: He had reason to think thereon, for if he had beene discouered,
they would not haue giuen him any time to repent.There are crimes, whose example is so necessary, as they that are apprehended must bee presently dispatched. In other excessesit is good that repentance go before the punishment, and a good Prince: Non poena semper, sed saepius poenitentia contentus esse debet: Not alwaies with punishment, but oftentimes must be content with repentance: Tacit in vit. Agtic.
                The Bastard
of Orange said, that he would put such irons on his feete that hee
should not be well able to flye: The next day, Renond was led to Salins,
and lodged in a base chamber at Chastelbellin, where hee had
fetters put on him, waighing aboue an hundred weight.
            The Bastard of Orange went to Beaune
                  The Processe verball shows that the Country made great ioy for the reduction of Beaune, 
                        〈◊〉
                      these words. And in making the said feasts and dancings, he heard them that were in the chamber, vnder the Towre where this deponent was, cry out with a loud voyce, Long liue Burgundy and of the rest one: Thus they cryed three or foure times, and so did the rest that were in Castelbellin. to reduce it to the
Arch-dukes obedience,
                  Renond a prisonerin Irons, put to ransom. which done he returned to Chastelbellin,
and told Renond that he was his prisoner taken in the warres, and
that he must put himselfe to ransome, Renond could do no other
thing but weepe, saying, that the Prince of Orange had promised
him otherwise. The Bastard of Orange told him, that it was no
place for teares, and that water was deere, that he should resolue
either of a ransome, or to be cast downe head-long from the top of

the rocke; Seing no remedy, he promised to pay two hundred
Crownes by Midsommer day, and if he did not acquit himselfe
within the time he should pay the double.
            Hee found himselfe in this perplexity the first day of May,
which was the feast of Saint Iames, and Saint Phillip, he made his
Vow vnto our Lady of Puy in Velay, and to Saint Iames in Galicia,
promising to go thither to pay his Vowes, if he escaped out of
that prison, and not to see wife nor children vntill he reuealed the
Prince of Oranges practise vnto the King. His prayer being ended,
God (who hath alwaies had a particular care of the King and
Realme of France) gaue him meanes to breake his Irons,
                  Renond deliuered miraculously and to
get out of prison, to aduertise the King of these matters, so much
importing the safety of his person, and of his estate:The Processe Verball saith; that after that Renond had made his Vow, his Ironsopened, and hee found meanes to escape▪ by two lances which he had tyed one vnto another; and by cords which hee found there▪
                The feare
hee had to bee followed made him to take the way to Lausanne,
from whence he went with all speed to Bourges, where
hearing of the Lord of Bouchages being, and that he was one of
the Kings principall Seruants, hee addrest himselfe vnto him, to
tell him all that he had learned of the Prince of Orange. The
Lord of Bouchages sent for Raoul Pichon, Councellour to the
King, to heare this Declaration, and caused a verball Processe to
be made, the which was inrold in the chamber of Accompts of
Dauphiné, bearing date the eight and twentieth of May, one
thousand foure hundred seuenty and eight, Signed Imbert of Baterne,
R. Pichon.
            
            From this Discourse wee see another spring. The Signior of
Erbeins,The like attempt discouered and punished. to let the Prince of Orange vnderstand, that hee had inconsiderately
made choise of a French-man, to be the bearer of
his boxes, and the executioner of his designes; for that, beside the
bonds of God, and nature, which bound him to his Prince; and
not to hold any thing which hee should promise against him:
Vniust promises must not bee kept, it is iustice to flye from thē; and iniustice to obserue them▪ If they were extorted by force they bind not, for his will that promised was not free. The estate wherein hee was, when hee promised, dispensed him
of his promise: he said vnto him, that if Renond did it for the hope
of recompence, hee should haue more from the King,
then from any other, and that hee had made a Scullion of his
Kitchin, or one that did make sauce, a Knight, for that hee
had reuealed the like enterprise. The Chronicle maketh no mention
of this kind of recompence: but it reports the seruice,
which a Sauce-maker, called Colynet, did vnto the King.
            Princes haue Instruments for the good and euill which they do,

any thing, & to dispatch thē of mē by waies vnknown to generous

                   That the Romanes were not reuenged of their enemies by fraude and secret practises, but by Armes, in which glory Tiberius was equall to the ancient Emperours, who did forbid poyson to be giuen to King Pyrrhus, and did bewray it. The Duke of Bourgundy had
some, who practised a Marchant called Ithier, to haue the king poisoned
vpon promise of 50000. Crownes, to distribute among thē
               
that should execute this damnable designe, but they found that
the gate, by the which they would haue it passe was shut, and had
neuer beene opened to any such thoughts, whereas they found nothing
but misery, for we may say, to the glory of fidelity, that such
detestable conspiracies did neuer enter into the Kitchin.
            
               Ithier corrupted one called Hardy, and he dealt with a maker of
Sauce in the Kings Kitchin, to whom he promised twenty thousand
Crownes. This Sauce-maker resolued suddenly to cry quittance
with this wretch, that came to tempt him, preferring the duty of
his fidelity before all other considerations of profite, making
shew to hearken to this bargaine, he told him, that he could not do
any thing without Colinet, who was also an Officer, and that it was
necessary to put the poyson into his hands: Hardy deliuered it vnto
them and instructed them how to vse it.The King aduertised of this poisoning. They presently aduertised
the King, who caused this poisoner to be apprehended and examined
in his presence, to know the motiues and the effects of his
designe; He confest the whole matter: The King went from Amboise
(where he was at that time) to go to Paris, and caused Hardy
to be conducted by Iohn Blosset, Captaine of an hundred Archers
of the Dauphins Gard, who carried him in chaines in a little Cart,
to deliuer him to the Prouost of Marchants of Paris, to do iustice
of him: The came and receiued him in the Suburbes, and caused
him to sit in a chaire, made fast in the Cart, to the end the people
of Paris might see him, not so much to the shame of this miserable
wretch, as to the confusion of the Duke of Bourgundy,
for that it was publiquely spoken, that he had commanded this
foule attempt.

his foure quarters to be carried to foure frontier Townes,
with an Inscription, containing the cause of his punishment, his
houses to be razed, and the place where he was borne to be ruined
and neuer more to be built.
            A holy, and iust iudgement: If the places for that they haue
beene innocently guilty of any heynous villany, haue beene termed

should be moderated with the losse of his eyes: He accepted of

finds no Companion, and is without hope euer to returne. My
opinion is, that the King did it in remembrance of some seruices,

which this miserable man had done him in the discouery of
some of the Earle of Armagnackes practises, as hath beene formerly
said.
            God dispersed these wicked practises which the Prince of Orange
had against the Kings life,Taking & recouery of Beaune & Verdun but his designes vpon the Townes
of Bourgondy succeeded: Hee made Beaune reuolt; and as wee
haue said, the bastard of his house entred into it. Verdun did also
declare it selfe against the King: the Townes of Mons-aujon, Chastillon
vpon Seine, Semur, and Bar vpon Seine, followed this
rout. Chaumont, Liuetenant generall of the Countrey, recouered
them as speedily as they had beene taken,Rebels punished. and caused them to
be seuerely punished which had beene chiefe actors in this reuolt.

of Princes and states. The Memorials of the Franch-county,

to the house of Bourgondy, vndertooke to kill him, and to
make his sonne Bishop.
            To execute this designe, hee gathered together a Troope of
the most desperate wretches that were in Paris, (a Forrest at that
time where such sauadge beasts did lurke,)
                  
                     〈…〉
                   with the honor of their villanies, and the feare of Iustice. Therascally mullitude in Townes are alwayes dissolute, and they principally, quibus ob egestaten

                  anies, are forced to sinne. he gaue them red
Cassockes; and for a Badge, a Boares head vpon the sleeue, with
whom he went into the Country of Liege. Hee acquainted some
of Liege with his Conspiracie,Treason of the Liegeois. who promised to serue him. They
presently tooke an Alarme to see these Boares in their Vines;
they let the Bishop vnderstand, that he must not suffer them there,
and that if he would go forth to chase them away, euery man would
follow him.
            This good prelate, whose courage could not deferre such an
occasion to another season, and did thinke that Palmes were not
planted for cowards, resolued as sudenly as he was intreated, to go
out against these theeues.
            Beeing ready to charge, the Liegeois abandoned him, so as
hee was compassed in by these Boares, and barbarously slaine
by their Leader, who caused him to bee stripped starke naked,
and to bee carried to the place before the Cathedrall Church.
Soone after Maximilian caused the head of la March to bee cut
off.
            Although the King held a Peace difficult betwixt Prouinces
so neere, so interressed, and so accustomed to picke quarrels, as
it is a hard matter for two Neighbours,
                  Lewis seeketh a peace of Maximliā.
                which haue many desputes,
to bee long at peace;Neighbour Estates haue alwayes some disputes: The Romans and Carthaginians, continued fiue hundred yeares in peace; but when they began to extend their frontiers, and to draw neere one vnto another, suspition. iealousie, and enuy of eithers greatnes thrust them into warre. yet the losse of the battle at Guinegaste,
made him resolue to seeke it. A resolution which could
not growe, but from great wisedome and policie, hauing duely
considered, that it was necessary, honourable, and profitable for
him so to doe.
            A Prince that is already well stricken in Age, who sees great
discontentments amongst great men, and heares great complaints
amongst the meaner, and hath his Children very young,
should no more thinke of Warre, if he could not draw vnto him
the aduantage which he desired; and considering that the Footemen
had all the honour of the battle, hee made the body of an
Army of ten thousand Foot, two thousand Pioners, six thousand
Suisses, and a thousand fiue hundred horse to imploy vpon all occasions.
            This establishment must bee reckoned among the examples of
his good Gouernement, or rather among the Instruments which
hee could handle to reigne powerfully. If hee had made this Order
sooner,New discipline for Souldiers. or if King Charles the eighth, and Lewis the twelfsth had
continued it, France had not felt those wants and weakenesse
which haue beene a let that her designes haue not beene equall to
her courage.
            Estates depend not so much vpon a good forme of Gouernement,

               Estates may wel be gouerned either by one alone, or by fewe heads, or by many, but their strength or weaknes depends vpon priuat order; and especially of Martiall discipline, whose effect is so great, as it preserues euen Tyrants in the estate which they hold, wherof the house of the Ottomans is a president. as of Force: Military Discipline is the foundation of an
Estate. The groundes of Warlike Discipline are Foote-men;
and all Foote-men which are not drawne from the Princes owne
Estates, cause more discommodity then profite. Rome which in
her greatnesse (that is to say,Dangerous to imploy forraine souldiers from Numa to the Emperour Augustus)
Footmen haue giuen vnto the Romans the Empire of
                     •
                   all the world. Frō 
                  Numa to Augustus, they had but one yeare a suspension of Armes, & haue alwayes carried the warre into the Enemies countrey, how farre off soeuer. had fought fiue hundred and fifty Battels, and had wonne
foure hundred thirty seuen with her owne Troopes, held that footmen
were the sinewes of her forces, and hath not found a more
certaine cause of her ruine, then to haue mingled strangers in
their legions.
            Strangers draw away the chiefe treasure of the realme, their affection
and fidelity is not so naturall, as they care more then the
subiects to preserue the estate: They dis-band for want of pay, and
sometimes they bandy against them of the Countrey with more
fury then against their enemies: they will prescribe a law when
they are ready to decide a good action; and like vnto Rauens, rather
follow the prey, then accompany the Wolues which pursue
and take it.The Fable saith, that the Rauens hauing accompanied the Wolues at the pursute of some beast to deuoure it, would haue their share whē it was taken, saying, that they had assisted thē, and alwaies follow'd them: you were not for vs (answered the Wolues) it was the prey that drew you thither, & if it had succeeded ill, and that we had beene taken, you wold not haue spared our owne flesh.
                Experience teacheth many examples to confirme this
Maxime. Those estates which haue no other suport but by forraine
forces, suffer great discommodities in time of peace, and recei
                  •
               e
small profit and succours in time of warre: they are alwaies declining
to their ruine, the which is not deferred, but by the slacknesse
of the occasion, or the small courage of the assailant.
            Men of warre are not ordained but to preserue or conquer,Obseruations of the aduā
                  tages of Foot-men ouer horsmen. to defend
or take townes, and to decide by a battell the rights and differences
of Princes and Estates. In all these occasions foot-men are
more proper then horse-men. A towne which is kept by hors-men,
receiueth such discommodity for provision, as oftentime it is more
prest by necessity within, then by the enemies without: and alwaies
horse do more trouble a
                  Philip. father to Alexander, seeking to campe in a place of aduantage for the souldiers, but vnfit for the horse, cryed out, that it was a great pitty of our life, which must be subiect to the commodity of horse. Generall to feed, then to discipline his
souldiers. At assaults of places hors-men are of small seruice, if they
leaue not their horse, & serue on foot. At battels, foot-men which
haue meanes to entrench and couer themselues, and haue good
store of pikes, are alwaies more then equall to horsemen. It is true
that the Cauallary hath great aduantages, for a horse-man hath better
legges then his owne, hee chargeth more furiously, and hath
more force, heat and breath then a foot-man. Foot-men are leuied
more speedily, are led and lodged with more facility, are paid and
entertained more commodiously, fight more safely & couragiously,
and rally themselues againe moreWe are not now in the time of the old warres, when as Gentlemen onely gaue themselues to the exercise of Armes. At this day euery man hath liberty to seeke it without the Realme, and many are growne Souldiers, and neuer went out of their Village easily: For the facility of
the leuy, it is so great in France, since that the ciuill warres haue armed
the people, as there is not any parish where you find not Souldiers
which haue carried Armes, and others which are resolued to
run that fortune.
            
               
The Prouinces are so peopled,France cannot be disarmed of footmen. as if the King should loose as many
battels as the mightiest conquerer could giue him, yet could he
not disarme him of Foot-men. Adde hereunto, that horse fit for
the warre, are alwayes deere, and rare, and that we euer finde more
men then horses.The Romans, to repulse the Gaules, who had seized vpon some Townes of Lombardy, made a description of their forces, and of the number of men fit for the warre: they found six hundred thousand foot, and threescore thousand horse.
            
            Touching the pay, we know that the difference is great betwixt
the pay of a man at Armes, and that of a foot-man; and that it is
easier to raise a thousand foot, then a hundred horse. For the facility
of lodging, foot-men couer and entrench themselues in field,
and fortifie themselues within a Towne: if they be lodged in a village,
they lye close to defend themselues, and not scattering like vnto
horse-men. For the aduantage of fight, it is true that horse-men
haue sooner done;l but also wee haue seene battels lost by the disorder
and violence of the horse, who can hardly keepe their ranks,
nor recouer them beeing lost; and oftentimes they fall vpon the
foot, and breake them with more disorder then the Elephants of
the Antients,
                  One of the greatest forces of the Armies of the East, consisted of Elephāts: They must of necessity (saith M. de Montagne) giue great credite to their beasts and to their discourse, abandoning vnto them the head of the Battle: wher
                     •
                  s the least stay they could make for the greatnesse and heauinesse of their bodies, & the least amazemēt that had made thē turne head vpon their owne men, was sufficient to ouerthrow all. to whose discretion they did commit the head of
the Army. A Foote-man fights more surely, and more resolutely
then a horse-man. In what perplexity doth a valiant man fight vpa
faint-hearted Iade? and what is a Coward, or a mad-man vpon a
couragious horse? How many haue we seene carried away by their
horses, into dangers not foreseene, who can no more stay them in
the flight, then in the heat of their fight?They that speake of warre with knowledge and experience, hold, that commonly when as the Cauallary aduanceth to giue the first charge, it is the cause of the losse of the victory, returning often vpon their foot, and striking a great amazement into them, for that hauing conceiued a great opinion, and assured themselues often to winne the Battell, they finde themselues suddenly deceiued; and therefore the Rout of the Cauallary is alwayes full of amazement.
            
            For the commodity of the leading, bee it to march, lodge, or
fight, the foot-men passe in all places, whereas the Cauallary
comes often into such difficult passages, as the men at Armes
should rather desire flying, then ordinary horses. Speaking hereof
with a braue French knight, very well knowne in these last warres,
and who hath yet command amongst the Kings men at Armes, he
said vnto me, That the discommodity of forrage had beene so great, as
the horsemen were sometimes fifteene, or twenty leagues from the campe
to supply their wants: That some went to warre with fiue or sixe Horse,
who fought but vpon one, and yet the people were forced to feed these vnprofitable
beasts, with their keepers: That ten horse-men had more Carts
then a company on foote. And if his aduice might purchase credite, they
should therein imitate the Spaniards, who giue honors, recompences, and
markes of vertue to the foote, and the contrary to horse-men.
               It is more honourable in Spaine to bee among the foot companies then among the Horse. The contrary is obserued at Rome. Valerius the Consull said vnto his Troope: Agite Iuvenes prestate virtute peditem, vt honore & ordini prestatis. Goe to yong men, excell the foot-men in vertue, as you do in honor and order. Liv.
               
            
            The Horse-men were the losse of the battell at Courtray, and the
footmen defeated the Earle of Flanders before Gand. The horsemen
seeking to haue all the honour of the battell at Poitiers, came
to charge before that the foot companies had meanes to ioyne,
this was the cause that the English, whose force consisted wholly

in Foote, wonne the Battell. At the Battell of Guinegaste, the
Arch-duke Maximilians Horse-men abandoned the Foote, who
stood firme, and kept the place of Battell. Wee haue formerly
seene, that the men at Armes at the Battell of Mont-lehery, who
seemed as if they would haue supported heauen with their Lances,
fell vpon their owne Archers, and trode them vnder their feete,
doing them more harme then their enemies.
            It is true, that whatsoeuer was fortunate and glorious in this
Encounter, came from the Arrierban, or Gentlemen of Horsebacke
of Dauphiné, who made the Fore-ward vnder the commaund
of the Baron of Sausonnage, who was slaine there: for
of foure hundred Gentlemen which dyed in this Battell, there
were foure and fifty of Dauphiné. Before the troubles, their names
and Armes were to bee seene in a Chappell in the Conuent of Iacobins
at Grenoble. Yet for all this discourse we may not banish
horse-men out of Armies; if RomeTo them that say, the Romans made their Conquest by Footemen, wee may answere, that in like manner, the Parthians encreased their Empire by horsmen: And that M. Antony hauing vanquished them in eighteene battels, found his victories vnprofitable, by reason of the inequality of Hors-men. Plut.
                could haue equal'd them of
France in Courage and Resolution, shee had sooner carried the
proud Title of Queene and Mistresse of Nations. But shee was forced
to make a vertue of necessity: for meaning in the beginning
to haue all the people fit to serue in Warre, and all hauing not
meanes to bee Horse-men, her chiefe force was setled in Footemen.
Romulus
               
                  Romulus made but three Centries for hū
                  dreds of Horse-men. Tullus Hostilius added ten troopes, either of two & thirty Horse. Tarquinius ordained, that the number should be of three hundred: Seruius disposed the people into fiue bands, which made 93 Centuries, whereof 18 were for horse-men. hauing diuided the people into thirty Tribes,
made but three hundred horsemen. And to proue this pouerty, we
finde that when as Lucius Tarquinius, of a Patrician race was made
Constable by Lucius Quintius Cincinatus, he had alwaies fought
on foot, for that hee had no meanes to mount himselfe on Horsebacke.
            Horse-men are very necessary in diuers occasions,Necessity of Horse-men. which cannot
be otherwise performed: If it be needfull to make a long iourney,
to surprise the Enemy, seize vpon, approch, cut off, or hold
passages, recouer the Cannon, inuest Townes, keepe the Enemy
in Alarme, to command the fieild, to make a spoile, to cut off victuals
from the besieged: all this Horse-men doe, and more readily,
and more effectually then Foot-men. Often-times they haue
recouered that which the Foot haue lost; they alone haue saued
the Estate:
                  Sext. Tempa
                        •••
                     us seeing the Volsques come to the charge against him, spake these words: Nisi haec armata cohors sistat impetum hostium actum est d

                  ay the Enemies fury, the Emperour were vndone. and wee know well, that the Parthians haue done as
great Exploits with their Horse, as the Romans with their Foote;
but it is certaine, that the men at Armes haue alwayes beene
beaten when as they encountred Foote-men, and therefore wee
often see, that the Roman Horsemen left their Horses to fight
and defeate Foot-men, and tooke them againe to pursue them
when they were in flight.
                  Titus Largius at the Lake of Regilla, and the Consull Valerius fighting against the Sabins, caused their Horse-men to light: And when as Largius had defeated the Latins, hee caused them to mount againe to pursue them. Equitibus admoti equi, vt prosequi hostem possunt.
                The like hath beene obserued in the
English and Bourgondian Armies.
            
               
But to returne to the Campe which wee haue left; It was not sufficient
to haue made this Leuy of Men of Warre, to keepe the
Field, and to serue vpon any occasion, if they had not added two
necessary things to make it profitable, Entertainment and Safety:
for if it had alwayes laine open to the iniuries of the Aire, and
the enterprises of the first Assailant; or if it had beene forced to
dis-band, to seeke for Victuals, it had beene like vnto the Pyramides
of Egypt, of great shew and ostentation, and of no profite.
The King prouided for the first, imposing a Taxe vpon his Subiects,
which Philip de Commines calleth Excessiue and Cruell,
               The entertainment of the souldiers of the campe, cost the king a hundred and fifty thousand pound sterling yearly. necessity
iustifieth all kindes of impositions: for all that is necessary
to the State, is Iustice; and all that is profitable, is necessary.
Necessity goeth beyond the Law;Necessity teacheth Princes to command the lawes, and dispenseth them from obseruing the Lawes, it doth excuse that which they doe, Necessitas, magnum humanae imbecillitatis patrocinium, omnem legem frangit. Necessity a great support of humane weaknes, breaks all lawes. Sen.
                and when the Prince is prest,
hee doth more consider that which hee doth, then that which hee
should doe: his Iustice goes of another traine, then that of Princes;
and those things which seeme to be against the lawes, are not
done, but to make the lawes liue and continue.
            Wherefore,Armies are not to bee entertained without tribute. who-so will draw seruice from any thing, must make
it last: for that which is not for euer, cannot alwayes profite, and
hee that will haue it last, must make the meanes whch entertaines
it lasting:The Tributes by the which the meanes to make warre, are maintained, may not bee touched. Augustus ordained a perpetuall and certaine reuenue for the entertainement of Souldiers, out of the twentieth penny of Legacies and Successions. After his death, the Senate intreated Tiberius to extinguish it. Dion saith that hee would not doe it, and Tacitus giues this reason. Quod militare aerarium eo subsidio niteretur, that the treasure of the warre did 
                     〈◊〉
                   consist of that aid. The quyet of Provinces cannot be without Armes,
and Armies; Armes are not to bee found, nor Armies entertained
without Money; and the Money which is to bee imployed
in publique necessities, is not drawne, but from priuate commodities.
The Senate would haue Tiberius suppresse the twentieth
penny imposed (by Augustus) vpon Legacies, and Successions:
But this wise Prince would not yeeld vnto it, for
that it was onely affected for the entertainement of his Souldiers.
            For the second, hee caused a great company of Tents, and
Pauillions to bee made, to lodge his Souldiers dry, and Carts
to close them in, and intrench them. All this would haue beene
found weake against a mighty Enemy, and against a mighty
attempt,
                  Lewis the eleuenth, strong in Artillery. if hee had not placed Artillery. I do not hold it a small
matter the commendation which Philip de Commines giues him
to haue been alwayes well furnished of Ordinance in his Armies,
and better then euer King of France: for the great designes of
Princes are not executed by handie stroakes. His Chronicle
saith, that about the end of the yeare 1478. Hee caused twelue
great Bombardes to bee made, with a great number of Iron bullets
in the Forges of Creil, and many of stone, in the quarries of
Peronne.

Artillery hath
beene a marke of the power and greatnesse of Estates, which cannot
bee held strong, nor assured, if they be vnfurnished, seeing that
nothing can be gotten, nor preserued without it.
            Artillery shewes those Forts to bee weake, which the Ancients
held impregnable; there is not any but feares this thunder: and if
they ouer-throw the Attemps, and consume the meanes and patience
of the assailant,Formes of war changed. it is onely by the Cannon: It workes such
terrible effects, and so farre from the vse of the Engines in old
time, as it hath changedArtillery is the cause that warre is at this day more iuditiously managed then in former times, when as quarrels were ended by battels. Euery man seeketh to win time, and to force his enemy to necessity. They trust nothing to fortune, that may be committed to wisedome: they gouerne their designes with longer time, and more safety. all the old formes of Sieges and Battels.
Gun-powder and wilde-fire are multiplied in so many sorts,
and are growne to such perfection, as the warre which in former
times was made onely with Iron, is now done with Artillery and
Powder.

voyage to Germany, neuer made Cannon-shot, but cost him three

Saint Anthonies Bastille, to try a great Bombard which the King
had caused to bee made at Tours; At the first shot it carried an
Iron Bullet of fiue hundred pounds weight vnto the Gibbet at
Pont Charenton: They thought it was not well boared, and therefore
they would haue it cleansed and charged againe. The Caster
playing the Gunner, scoured it so carelesly, as hee left fire in
it, so as hauing charged it anew, and put in his Bullet; the Bombard
hauing no fire set to the touch-hole, discharged of it selfe,
blowing vp the Caster ino the Aire into many peeces, which
slew (neere and farre off) two and twenty men, and burnt and maimed
many others.The Chronicle addes, that the peeces of the Casters body were gathered together, and buried in the Church of S. Merry, and that they cried in the streets; Pray vnto God for I.

            If Christian Princes would haue vented out in any other place
then in Europe,Death of Mahomet 2. that warlike heate, which turmoyled them to their
owne ruines, God had giuen them a goodly occasion to employ,
both the Camping Troupes of Lewis the 11., and all the forces of
other Christian Princes, to the ouerthrowing of that of the Turks,
which was wonderfully shaken by the death of Mahomet
               
                  Mahomet the second, Emperour of the Turkes, dyed the the 3d. of May, 1481. in the 52. yeare of his age.: Hee
dyed at that time in Nicomedia: Pope Sixtus was so glad, as he appointed
three festiuall daies,

Church was deliuered from such a scourge: dying hee cursed
Rhodes thrice: he was a wiser and more polliticke Prince then
any of the house of the Ottomans, as he who in all his conquests added
pollicy to force. Hee was thicke, synowy, and strong of
body, he had an Aquiline nose, and so crooked, as the end hung
ouer his lip: Being yong, he beganne to take delight in the actes
of Alexander the Great, promising himselfe to surpasse or equall
him.
                  Mahomet propounded no other patterne vnto himselfe then that of Alexander, not to imitate him in his vertues, but in his ambition. The first day he sate in the Throne of Amurath
               
                  Amurath dyed before the Castle of Croy, in the yeare 1450. his father
(who raigned 32. yeares,
                  Mahomet surnames himselfe the Great. a Prince much beloued of his owne, and
iust vnto his enemies) he would be surnamed the Great.
            In shew he held Mahomets Religion, but hauing beene bred vp
as a Christian by his Mother, who was daughter to Lazarus
Prince of Seruia, & instructed by her in the Prayers, & Confession
of the Christian Faith, when he came to the Empire he found himselfe
in so great a doubt & distraction what he should beleeue, as he
resolued not to beleeue any thing, caring no more for the Gospell,
then for the Alcoran, making a scoffe at Mahomet, whom he termed
to be a Slaue & a Thiefe, holding his Prophecies for Fables, and his
Lawes for Impostures. The father dying had recommended vnto
him his yong sonne Turcin, being but eighteene Monthes old, and
he had promised not to make him feele the rigor of the house of the
Ottomans: But as he had no faith towards God, so he kept none with
men,Wee must not expect any obseruation of faith, from a Prince that hath no Religion. he forgat this promise, for death had no sooner closed vp
his fathers eyes, but he drew this poore Infant out of the Nurses
armes, to beate out his braines against the wall, saying; that hee
would not haue his father interred alone. Moses, one of his chiefe
seruants, entreated him not to defile his hands in his owne bloud.

This reason did not moue him, but onely to change the executioner,
for he commanded him to kill him. Moses caused water to bee
brought, and powred such aboundance into the mouth of this infant,
as he did both smother him and drowne him. The mother
seeing this Inhumanity, fild the house with fearefull cryes, and
made terrible imprecations against Mahomet, who to comfort her
said; That she sought in vaine to reuiue her sonne with teares, that she
should conforme her selfe vnto the Law,This custeme is inhumane and vnnaturall. But we must not expect iust Lawes in a

comming to the Empire should suffer his brethren to liue, for that there
could be but one Head in the Empire, nor but one Sunne in Heauen: but if
shee desired any other thing, whatsoeuer it were, she should be sure to obtaine
it. This woman changing her griefe into reuenge, demanded
the heart of Moses;Reuenge of a woman. Mahomet instantly commanded that he should
be bound hand and foote, and with the same knife which she thrust
into his body, she opened his side, pulled out his heart, cast it to
the dogs, and was therewith pacified.

               Amurath had another sonne of sixe months old, called Calepin,
and foreseeing it would be impossible he should escape death, if he
were knowne for his son,Treachery of Haly Bassa.
                he recommended him to Haly Bassa intreating
him to saue him. This Treacherous wretch to purchase the
fauour of the new Prince, discouered this innocent creature vnto
him. Calepin was veiwed and knowne by thirty Matrons, and presently
strangled. Haly Bassa, did not liue long in the impunity of
this treachery, for after the taking of Constantinople, Mahomet
caused him to be strangled, accusing him of Infidelity, & of Intelligence
with the Christians, and that he had diuerted his father
Amurath from the siege of that Citty. Hee carried his designes
higher then his Predecessours, he breathed nothing but the Monarchy
of the whole world, and the desire of glory made him to
loue those which keepe the glory of Princes from decay, and to
fauour men of knowledge
                  Mahomet much delighted in Histories and Historiographers fauoring Iohn Maria of Vicenza, for that hee wrote the Persiā warres against Vssan Cassan, in the Turkish and Italian tongues. against the intention of his Lawgiuer,
who the better to keepe vnder the minds of men, and to
make them subiect to the yoke of seruitude, did forbid them the
knowledge of learning: Hee caused to be written in the Arabian
tongue, the liues of great Captaines, and especially that of Alexander,
whom he tooke for his Paterne; but he had not his generosity
in battels, nor his moderation in victories: He vsed it more
cruelly,Cruelties of Mahomet at the taking of Constantinople, & other places. when as at the taking of Constantinople, hee caused the
head of the Emperour Constantine to be carried in mockery
through out his whole Army, and troupes of men to be slaine like
sheepe. The most apparant which were retired into Saint Sophias
TempleThe Temple of S. Sophia, which had beene built by the Emperour Iustinian, was spoyled of the treasure, and pretious relickes, which Constantine the Emperour had preserued so deerely: It was made a Brothel-house, and a Stable for horses. being brought before him as he was at meate, he gaue
himselfe that cruell content, to see their heads flye off vnder the
hang-mans sword. When as he tooke Trebizond he gaue his word
to the Emperour Dauid Comnene, and to his two sons, he led them

in triumph to Constantinople, with the chiefe Noblemen, their
wiues and children, but this was but to adde vnto the infamy of
their death the quality of their misery, and to make the spectacle
more solemne, causing them to be publiquely executed. At the
taking of Chalcide,
                  Mahomet besieged Chalcide in Negrepont, in th

                   yeare 1470. Hee tooke it in 30. daies & lost 40000. men. it was a capitall crime to pardon any man
being aboue twenty yeares old: He caused some Noblemen
of Albania to bee fleed by peece-meale, and caused this barbarous
inhumanity to continue fifteene daies, to the end hee
might haue time to taste the sweetnesse which he tooke in this
cruelty.
            He besieged the Castle of Iaisse in Bossina, the King yeelded
by composition, that he should carry away all that was within it,
but there was no faith kept with him, for he caused him to be bound
vnto a Tree, and to be shot to death, reproaching his auarice vnto
him, that he had rather saue himselfe with his Treasure, then with
his Honour.There is nothing more shamefull and disho

            He had emploied Mahomet Bassa in his greatest affaires, and loued
him as one that had bene bred vp with him from his youth.
This miserable man had beene a Christian, and in his greatest honours
did still sigh for Christian liberty; for the greatest haue no
other title but of slaue to the great Signior, and although hee
were aduanced aboue the highest in the State, yet his nature being
proud and ambitious, he held himselfe vnder all, so long as hee
should be a slaue, and that he should see one or two aboue him.
An ambitious spirit cannot endure any thing higher then it selfe. Marcus Crassus is the picture of men of this humour. This foolish ambition had so blinded him as he could not bee satisfied to precede so many millions of men, but he held himselfe in a maner, the last of all, & that all things failed him for that they esteemed him onely inferiour to two. Plut. in the life of Marcus Crassus.
                Trusting therefore in his Maisters loue and fauour, he made him
a sumptuous feast, and at the end thereof offered him fifty thousand
Crownes, beseeching him to declare him free, and take from
him that odious name of slaue, leauing him that of most faithfull,
and most obliged seruant.Pride troden vnder foote. 
               Mahomet was so incensed at this demand, as hauing instantly commanded this Bassa to couch with
his belly against the ground, hee set his foote diuers times vpon
his necke, vntill that this miserable wretch began to cry: I thanke you
my Lord, I thanke you, it is too great a happinesse for me to liue vnder
your feete. To liue after this, was to declare himselfe vnworthy to
haue receiued life,Generosity of a yong boy of Sparta. and to haue lesse courage then that Boy
of Sparta,A yong boy of Sparta being forced to serue, said he would not do it. He spake the word and performed it, for when as they commanded him to bring a Chamberpot he ran his head against the walles: whereupon Seneca saith. Tam prope libertas est, seruit aliquis? Doth any man serue, when as liberty is so neere? who seeing himselfe forced vnto a seruice which
his condition should not refuse, cryed out

Wall.
            The siege of Belgrade was the Theater of his power, and
misery, for he neuer made greater attempt, nor had a mightier
Army. Hee had caused his Cannon to bee carried in peeces
by his Souldiours, and when hee was in Mysia hee made diuers
Peeces to bee cast of an vnmeasurable greatnesse, for hee tooke
delight in those fearefull Engines, hauing at the Siege

of Constantinople imployed a Bombard, to moue the which, he
vsed the force of two thousand men, and of seuenty yoke of oxen.

That all was in disorder, the Bassa of Asia slaine, the chiefe Captaines
put to rout, forty thousand men dead vpon the field, the Ordinance lost,
and that they lost time to thinke to take the Towne, which the onely presence
of Iohn Coruin made impregnable. These words put Mahomet
into such a rage, and rage into such despaire, as cursing both
heauen and earth,
                  Mahomet seekes to poison himselfe. and blaspheming God, he called for poyson to
kill himselfe, which being refused him, he set fire of his Campe,
and retired.

He imputes it to his Gourmandize, and to the punishment of
God. It may be it was that legge into the which Bladius, brother to
the Prince of Valachia, stabd his knife, to saue his honour from
that Goat, who would haue forced him to the infamous and vnnaturall
lust of a barren Venus:

Conspiracy being discouered by a Christian, he caused the Conspirators
to be strangled; and from that time he suffered not any

reasons Mahomet is the second of those great Princes, whom Phil.

time: King Lewis the eleuenth, is the first, and Mathias Huniades

The designes which hee had vpon Lorraine and Prouence,
were executed in adding wisedome to occasion, and force to
reason.
            To vnderstand this proceeding we must know that Iohn Duke of
Lorraine,Estate of Loraine. did first marry Sophia, daughter to Eberhard Earle of
Wirtemberg, and had two sonnes, Charles and Fredericke:
The children of Charles Duke of Lorraine were, Ralph, Lewis, Charles, Robert, Frederick Ma

                        y, married to Enguerand, Earle of Coucy, Margaret to the Earle of Baden, and Isabell to René of Aniou. Charles succeeding him in the Dutchy of Lorraine, married
Margaret daughter to Robert of Bauaria Count Pallatine, by
whom he had many children which dyed before him, leauing no
heire but Isabell. Fredericke Earle of Guise, married Margaret,
daughter to Henry Earle of Vaudemont, and had Anthony Earle
of Vaudemont. Charles married his daughter Isabel to René Duke
of Aniou, Calabria, and Bar, Earle of Prouence, King of Sicily,
Naples, and Ierusalem: Of their marriage came Iohn, Lewis,
René, Charles, Elizabeth, Margaret, Yoland, and Anne: After the
death of Duke Charles, René would haue entred the Dutchy, as his
wiues Inheritance: Anthony Earle of Vaudemont opposed himselfe
by this reason, that the Males exclude the Females.At the Councell of Constance Anthony Earle of Vaudemont demanded of the Emperor Sigismond, the inuestiture of the Dutchy of Lorraine against René of Aniou, for that it was a see of the Empire, wherof women were not capable. The
controuersy was first ended by Armes, René lost the battell of
Blanuille and was taken prisoner by Anthony Earle of Vaudemont,
who gaue him to Phillip Duke of Bourgundy, for that hee
had succoured him; afterwards by the marriage of Yoland daughter
to Renè and Isabel, with Ferry sonne to Anthony of Vaudemont,
the Dutchy of Lorraine remained in effect to René the Husband
of Isabell,
               
                  Renè of Aniou D. of Lorraine. and in hope to Ferry husband to Yoland. Iohn succeeded
in the Dutchy of Lorraine; Hee had married Mary
               
                  Iohn and Mary had foure children, Isabel who was married to Iames King of Scotland Rene, Iohn, & Nicholas.
                daughter
to Charles Duke of Bourgundy, who dyed in her deliuery of
Nicholas, Marques of Pont, her third sonne, who succeeded in
the Dutchy of Lorraine, after the death of his father and brethren:
Hee left the affection which his Predecessours had borne
to France, and fell to the Duke of Bourgundies party, vpon
hope that he would giue him his daughter in Marriage. Death
surprised him in the yeare one thousand fiue hundred seuenty three
in the thoughts of his Marriage, and to renew a second enterprise
vpon the Towne of Mets,
                  Nicholas Duke of Lorraine would haue seized vpon Mets by this Strat

They entred, but seeking to seaze vpon the gate, the Portcullis was let downe, and they all taken and slaine in the Towne which they would haue surprized. the first hauing beene vnlucky and vnfortunate.
            Thus there remained not any Male of the Branch of the
Dukes of Lorraine, there was not any but that of the yonger
brethren of Vaudemont and Guise.Branch of Vaudemont. The Law preserued the
right of the succession for the daughters of René Duke of Aniou,
and of Isabel of Lorraine: Margaret Queene of England being a

prisoner pretended not any thing: Yoland widdow to Ferry Earle of
Vaudemont succeeded: Shee was mother to many children, and
the right of Priority gaue the title of Lorraine to René, but Yoland
reserued the authority and command vnto her selfe, the which
held ten yeares.
            
               René assured himselfe to be Earle of Prouence, as he was Duke
of Lorraine, that his Grandfather, by his mother side, disposing

Earledome of Prouence to Lewis the eleuenth: That the losse of
the battell at Gransson, hauing altered the minds of many Princes
towards the Duke of Bourgundy, King René changed that
which hee had done to institute him his Heire, and that being
come to Lyon, he flatly renounced his friendship, and did consent
that Prouence should bee vnited to the Crowne, vpon condition
that the King should set at liberty his daughter, being Widdow
to Henry the sixth, King of England, and prisoner to Edward,
and that for her ransome hee should pay fifty thousand
Crownes, that in regard of this summe shee should renounce the

that hee came vnto him the yeare following being at

               Beside the contentment which the obseruation of these names may giue vnto those families which haue any interest therein, it serues to the curiosity of diuers qualities vnited in the same persons, the which at this time seeme incompatible. Hee would also that if hee dyed in Prouence,
the Archbishop of Aix, and the great Seneschall of
Prouence, should bee among the Executors of this Testament.
            The King being aduertised that René Duke of Lorraine
made practises in Prouence, and fearing that by his meanes

grieuing very much at the vnfortunate, and ill successe of his enterprises.

King of Naples by the Pope, and instituted Heire by
Iohn the second, who had succeeded Ladislas her brother. This

great Captaine had entred it nine hundred and fifty yeares
before, and had expelled the Gothes. This Citty in one night became
wholly of the Arragon faction. René left it, and returned
into France with much griefe for his losse, but with more resolution
to liue in peace, detesting warre and ambition which entertained
it.

word with Lewis of Aniou.
                  Alphonso had promised by expresse capitulations, not to trouble Lewis his cozen, in the Realme of Naples: But a Crowne is too sweete a morsell not to breake with a friend, and to seeme too full of conscience: Hee perswaded Queene Ioane to adopt him, and shee for assurance of this Adoption, deliuered into his hands the two Castles of Naples.

posting to kisse his hand,Battell of Sarmy, wonne by Iohn Duke of Calabria. and to declare themselues for him. Hee
wonne the Battell of Sarmy and Saint Fabian, and was wonderfully

(who fearing least the prosperity of the French affaires would preiudice
the liberty of Italy) had not made a league with the other
Princes, to succour the Arragonois, beeing besieged in Barry, a
Towne ill fortified, and worse furnished against the necessities of a
Siege. But all their league had preuailed little, if it had not beene
fortified by Scanderbeg, that other Mars of Albania, whom Ferdinand
called to his succours, and whom Pope Pius the 2d coniured
to assist him: Hee came, in regard of the strict amity hee had had
with Alphonso, and was exhorted to this voyage by Paul Angé,
Archbishop of Duras. Scanderbeg ioyned at Duras with twelue Italian
Gallies; and from thence came to Ragusa,Ragusa in old time was called Epidaurum vpō the Adriaticke sea. It hath a Castle, which in those times was held impregnable, the gouernment is Aristocraticall. attending his

                Duke of Calabria, to raise the siege of Barry,
and wonne the battell of Vrsare. The Duke escaped the danger by
the switnesse of his horse; he recouered Troy, where he was receiued,
and drawne ouer the wall with a cord: from thence he caused
himselfe to bee conducted to Genoua, where hee found a Gally,
which carried him into France, despairing euer to doe any more
good at Naples, nor in Sicile; from whence he carried nothing but
the bare name of Duke of Calabria. He was followed by some Captaines,
who (for that they had run the same fortune) durst not remaine
vnder the command of the Arragonois;Count Picenin hauing escaped this danger, remained for a time hidden in Italy, Francis Sforce Duke of Millan, hauing drawne him vnto him by a false promise to make him his sonne in law, deliuered him to K. Ferdinand, who put him to death so as René grewe
old in the complaints of this vsurpation, fauoured by the Popes:
All his hopes were dead for the recouery of his fore-fathers Inheritance;
The inuestiture of the Realme of Naples, hauing beene once granted by the Popes to the house of Aniou, could not bee giuen away against their liking to that of Arragon. We heare often in their pleadings, Id quod nostrum est sin

                and to fill vp the measure of his sorrow, hee saw the first
Branch of this Powerfull and Royall house of Aniou wither in his
sonne and grand-childe.
            
               René surviuing, his sonne and grand-childe dyed in the yeare
1480. A Prince who had great and eminent qualities, worthy of a
better fortune: hee was a great Iusticer, and an enemy to long dispatches.
He said sometimes, when as they presented him any thing
to signe, being a hunting, or at the warre, that the Pen was a kinde
of Armes, which a Prince should vse at all seasons.K. René, although he were in Armes, did not forbeare to doe iustice to them that demanded it, saying, That the pen of Princes should neuer be idle, that long expeditions made them to loose the loue of their subiects. They write that he drank not any wine, and when as the Noble-men of Naples demāded the reason, he answered, that it had made Tit. Liuius to ly, who had said, that the good wines caused the French to passe the Alpes.

his Treasurers brought vnto him the Royall taxe, which was sixteene

or barenesse of the season; and when as they told him, that

sometimes the whole taxe. Hee contented himselfe with his reuenues,

his time in painting, the which were so excellent, as they are yet to
be seene in the Citty of Aix: he was drawing of a partridge when
as they brought him newes of the losse of the Realme of Naples,
yet he would not draw his hand from the worke, such pleasure hee
tooke therein.
            He liued long. A President of Prouence making an Oration before
King Charles the ninth, in the yeare 1573. said, that hee had
beene seene by some that were then liuing. Hee instituted an
Order, which hee called of the Cressant. The Knights carried a
Cressant, or halfe Moone vpon their right arme, with this Motto,
l'Os en Croissant; encouraging them thereby to seeke and desire
the encrease of their valour and reputation. Hee dyed at
Aix, his wife caused his body to bee transported into France, and
by a witty pollicie deceiued the Prouençals, who would haue
had it. His death made no other change in Prouencae, but of the
person:
                  Charles, Nephew to René, succeeds him. 
               Charles his Nephew, sonne to the Earle of Mayne,
was acknowledged Earle of Prouence: but his time was very
short: for hee dyed before he could finish the second yeare of his
reigne.

and lesse betwixt his death, and the taking of possession: for on
the nineteenth of the same moneth of December, one thousand
foure hundred eighty one, the King sent a Commission to Palamedes
Forbin, a Knight, Lord of Sollier, Chamberlaine to the Earle
of Prouence, to take possession, and to command in the Countrey
in quality Lieuetenant generall, with absolute power to dispose

The quality of this Commission, was a great Testimony of the
seruice which he had done the King, hauing solely disposed his
Maister to make this goodly present vnto France. But as all changes
cause amazement, there was some trouble to execute this
Donation, some holding the party of Lorraine, and others of
France.

                  René, duke of Lorraine discontented Duke of Lorraine, finding his friends feeble, and his power
weake against the King, was not willing to grow obstinate in

Prouence:Hee that encounters one that is more mighty, doth but vndoe himselfe. More mighty is to be vnderstood in dominions, subiects, force and treasure. A wise Italian saith to this purpurpose: Si tu truoui vna machina cresciuta per la felicita & disciplina d'ottocento anni, discostati da essa, che è cosa impossibile, quando pur ella cadesse, che tu non rouini sotto.

and a regiment of a thousand foote. The King sent a garrison of
Scottish men vnto Bar, vnder the command of the Lord of Aubigny,
hee caused the Walles to bee repaired, and the Armes of
France to be set vpon the gate, such as are yet to be seene.
            Hee remained in Italy till after the Kings death, which day hee
held to be the rising of his hopes, the which were onely supported
by the assurance which the Duke of BourbonThis hope was not vaine: for in the first yeare of the reigne of K. Charles, he was restored to the Dutchy of Bar, and had a company of an hundred Lances giuen him. gaue him, that this
rigorous season would be followed with a greater calme.Warre against Ferrara. The Venetians
entreated him to accept the charge of Generall of their
land Army against the Duke of Ferrara. It was a warre which
shaking the peace of Italy, brought the peace of Christendome
into question, and gaue a great aduantage vnto the Turke,
who beheld these Tragicall furies neere at hand. And this was the
cocasion.
            After the death of Borsio of Esté, Hercules of Esté his brother
would succeed in the principality: Lionel of Esté, their brother, had
left Nicholas his sonne, who had the same pretension. Italy was in
a maner diuided, the one for the Vncle, the other for the Nephew.
The Venetians did succour Hercules so powerfully, & so fitly, as the
Scepter of his fathers remained to him. He married Elenor, daughter
to Ferdinand of Arragon, and being fortified with this new alliance,
he suffered the heate of friendship, which his fathers entertained
with the Venetians, to grow cold; as commonly Princes
doe not long follow their predecessors steppes, and if they commend
their Orders, yet they subiect not themselues vnto them.
                  Borsio had very carefully entertained friendship with the Signiory of Venice. When there fell out any controuersie betwixt them for their limites, or that their Officers did attempt vpon one anothers Iurisdiction. Borsio came to Venice with a small troope, like a priuate person, to giue reasons vnto the the Senate.
He restored the Salt-pits of Commachio, contrary to the ancient
Conuentions: hee tooke from the Venetian Merchants the exemptions
and freedomes of Imposts which they had enioyed:
he caused a Fort to be built neere vnto Cap d' Argent, to bound his
Estates, and dissembled the wrong which the Magistrate of Venice,
residing in his Citty by accord had receiued, hauing suffered him
to be excommunicated by the Archbishop of Ferrara.
            The Venetians,The venetians proclaim war against the Duke of Ferrara, although tired with warre by reason of the great
ruines which they had receiued by the Ottomans, yet they declared
it against Hercules of Esté, they grounded it vpon the necessity of
their defence, which iustifieth all kindes of proceedings, and makes
all that to be found good, that is profitable. All times are in season.
When there is question of a defence, there is no regard to be had to Iustice or Religion. A certaine and ineuitable danger iustifies Armies. The Romans held some dayes vnfortunate for enterprises, but when as necessity forced them, they feared not any thing. Dies certos & euitabiles obseruabant cum inferenda in hostes arma non propulsanda forent. They did obserue certaine auoidable dayes when to assaile an enemy, but not to repell him. They raise two Armies, one by land, and another by sea, the one
to run along the Costs of Apulia and Calabria, and to hinder the
succours of Ferdinand, the other to remaine in the riuer of Pau.

            Ferrara was besieged, and so prest with the valour and good
fortune of the Assailants, as it could no longer hold out. The Pope
(who had incited the Venetians to this warre) exhorted them to
peace;He declares him selfe against them. and seeing that they would not harken vnto it, declared
himself for the Ferrarois: he drew the spiritual sword against them,
& strook them, interdicting their Common weale. Baptista Zeno, &
Iohn Michele, 2 Venetian Cardinals, did coragiously resist this resolution;
yet the Pope notwithstanding their contradiction, proceeded
on: It is true, that as in the heate of Armes, they doe not alwayes
thinke of religion, his censures were contemned by the Venetia

who did not respect them as good physicke, but as an
Emperikes plaister, the which Popes were wont to vse for all kinds
of sores. They found it strange, that hee would force them vnto a
peace, the which notwithstanding had not beene obserued when
they were busied in warre against the Turke. The Princes of Italy
made a league against them, and an Assembly of the Confederats,
which was held at Cassal-maior, in the territory of Cremona: Fredericke
Gonzague, Prince of Mantua, was chosen Generall of
the Army, the honour of the enterprise, and of the chiefe authority
being reserued to the Arragonois: There was not any Prince,
Citty, nor Common-weale in Italy, except Genoua, but was engaged
in this enterprise, to ruine the greatnesse of Venice.The greatnesse of Venice was then suspected to all the Potentates of Italy, & if it had beene augmented with the estate of Ferrara, the way had beene open to greater designes. 
               René
of Lorraine (whom the death and ruine of Charles of Bourgondy
had aduanced to the reputation of one of the greatest
Captaines of this age) serued most gloriously in this Expedition.
            
               Both parties were soone weary of this warre: they spake of treating
of a peace at Cesara, but this Proposition tooke no effect. It
was continued at Tourbolles betwixt Robert Sanseuerin, and Lewis

               who finished it, and it was concluded, That the Venetians
should returne into all the places which they had lost, during this warre
in Lombardie, and should retire all the garrisons which they had on either
side of the riuer of Pau: They should ruine all the Forts which
they had made on the bankes thereof, and should restore to Hercules of
Este all that they had taken from him, except the P

they should retaine vnto themselues, & should enioy the same rights, both
old and new, which they were went to haue in Ferrara, and there abouts.
Such was the end of the sociall warre, which cost the Venetians in
lesse then 2 yeares, three millions, and 600000 duckets. This peace
was receiued with much content after these turbulent and ruinous
seasons. They made bon-fires and combates with great pompe at
Venice.When

Pope Sixtus hearing of this Accord,Griefe of P. Sixtus for the Peace. died for griefe: He had incensed
all the Potentates of Italy at the Assembly of Cremona, against
the Venetians: his courage and resolution went beyond all the designes,
threats, and attempts of his Enemies: And when as to terrifie
him, they declared, that they would cause him to bee cited to
appeare before a Councell, hee made it knowne, that hee endured
these threats,Resolution of Pope Sixtus.

wickednesse, to force them to yeeld vnto the Church the goods which
they had taken from it. Platina addes, that this answere was a proofe
of the vigor of this Popes spirit, and of the greatnesse of his courage,

or letting bloud, as the most wholesome remedy for the disorders

                   yeare after the comming of our Sauiour, whereas Matthias was named to the Apostleship, and the Assembly might be of 120 faithfull. The second in the same yeare for the election of Deacons, of which number St. Stephen was. The 3d

                   for the the tolleration of circumcision for a time, that they might bury the Synagogue with honor in the 58th
                   yeare. Of these foure Councels the Acts of the Apostles speakes. cap. 1. 15. & 21. and hath beene euer
since vsed. The King was not very carefull to procure this remedy;
being incensed for that which Pope Sixtus had done against the
Florentines, he forbad the transport of gold and siluer to Rome,
and commanded the Bishops and Prelates of his realme, to assemble
at Orleans, whither he sent the Earle of Beaujeu to preside. But
he shewed not the like zeale and courage which his father had
done in the Assembly of the French Church at Bourges. Where
there is question of Gods seruice, they must proceed after another
maner, then when it concernes but the Interest of men. Publicke
buildings must be made after another manner, and of another matter

teares, he defended that of God against the people with Armes.
The King came to Orleans to passe to Clery, remaining there but
halfe a day to breake off the Assembly; hee was satisfied to haue

The Chronicle of Basill reports a strange History of the passion,
(or rather furie) wherewith a Iacobin Frier was transported, whom
it names Andrew, Archbishop of Krane, a man of learning and
courage; who thrust on by presumption,Presumption carries mens minds out of the common way, it followes vnknowen courses, & embraceth nouelties. A spirit presuming little of it selfe, remaines in the bou

mindes from their duties,
                  Andrew, Archbishop of Krane, preacheth against the Pope. to wander out of the common way) past
the mountaines, came to Basill, and preached in the Cathedrall
Church against Rome, as against a new Babylon, coniuring the
Emperour, and K. Lewis the eleuenth, to procure the Assembly of a
Councell against her scandals. Pope Sixtus the fourth was no sooner
aduertised hereof, but he commanded the Magistrate of Basill
to deliuer him into the hands of his Iustice. The Senate answered,
that they had already giuen aduertisement thereof to the Emperour
Fredericke, and attended his pleasure; beseeching the Popes
Nuntio to haue patience, and to assure himselfe that there should
not be any thing done in preiudice of the holy Sea.
            The Archbishop on the 13 of Iuly, the same yeare 1482. caused
a declaration to be published; by the which, lamenting the ruines
of the Church, he coniured and entreated all Ministers & Pastors
to succour it;xcomE nicated by the Pope. and by vertue of the Decree of Constance, to assemble
at BasillThe Councell of Constance in the 39 Session decreed that euery ten yeares they should assemble a general Councell. to aduise of the remedies: and for that the Pope had declared
him excommunicate, he appealed against his sentence; and
hauing no better reason to obiect against this excommunication,
then the want of power, he maintained that Sixtus the fourth had
not entred into S. Peters Chaire by the doore, but like a thiefe; that
he made trafficke of holy things, and that he tooke delight, not to
feed, but to fley Christs Flocke.
            The Princes and Common-weales of Italy were not in good
termes with him, all threatned him with a Councell: And although
that Pius the second, his Predecessor,Pope Pius the second did excommunicate those that did appeale from the Pope to a Counceil. Iulio the 2d

                had called such forme of
proceeding against the Pope, Execrable; yet it seemed they could
finde no better meanes to restraine the excesse: Euery man cryed
after the reformation of abuses; but that which might be commendable
in publicke complaints, did not iustifie the boldnesse of a
priuate man, who presumed to censure the Pope: and the number of
fooles doth not excuse the folly.A common errour giuest some excuse, but the number of them that faile, makes not the fault lesse. It is alwaies ill done to play the foole with them that are not wise. 
               Sixtus declared him an Heretick,
and a troubler of the Churches quiet, from whose body he was cut,
like a rotten member, vnworthy to exercise the ministery, to hold
any dignity, or to be partaker of the holy Sacraments, condemning
him to remaine prisoner in a Monastery, with bread and water, vntill
he had made full expiation of his crimes. In like manner, the
Emperour found the proceeding of this Bishop very bold, & gaue
him to vnderstand, that seeing he was but a priuate person, he desired
to know by what authority he pretended to call a Councell. He
answered, That the publike necessity of the Church approued his zeale,
and coniured the Emperour to maintaine it, after the example of the Emperour SigismondThe Emperor Sigismond laboured Christian-like to smother the new opion of the Hussites of Bohemia, he procured the conuocation of the Councell of Costance, & was there in person. 
               and his predecessors, who had not spared any thing
for her quiet and peace, and to root out abuses: wherfore he besought him
not to shew himselfe difficult to grant out Patents and necessary pasports

for the convocation of a Councell: otherwise hee should answere before
God for the ill which his negligence would make incurable.
            
            The 4th day of December Peter of Kettenheim, Pryor of Velpach;
the Pryor of Erford, and the Pryor of Mortau; present themselues
anew vnto the Senate of Basill, and declared that they had charge
to proceed against them by all the rigors of the Churches iustice, if
if they did not deliuer this reuolted person into their hands, to be
exemplarily punished. He was honoured by some, like a St. Paul,
that great Citizen of heauen, the pillar of Churches, an earthly Angell,
and a heauenly Man: he was contemned of others as a seditious
man, an Abironite, and a Rebell. Some thought it hard, that,
because he had said (not secretly, like vnto spies, and slaunderers,
but publickly, and in the Cathedrall Church of such a Towne) that
fire was at the doore, that the mine was ready to play, to ouerthrow
the whole building, and that Sathan had planted his ladders
whilst that the Centinels slept, they wold entreat a Bishop so rigorously;
and that, howsoeuer, they should consider the thing that was
good and wholesome,They say, wee must consider the Councell apart, and him that giues it apart. The Ephores caused the aduice which had been giuen by a bad man, to bee pronounced by one which was good In his quae à malis bene fiunt, hic tenendus est modus, vt appareat authorem displicuisse non factum. Plin. Paneg. Traiani. and not the person that might be passionate.
They also remembred, that many great personages about that time
had said,Words of Gerson.
                that in these disorders they might follow extraordinary
motiōs, either of powerful authority, or of charitable admonition.In the time of K. Charles the seuenth, euery man spake of reformation. Gerson presumed to say, that the pursuite might bee made, Per quos cunque fideles praesertim maiores authoritatiua potestate, siue charitatiua admonitione. Gers. in Propos. vtil. ad extirp. schis.
Others said, that the desire was good, but being guided by pride &
presumption, it made him odious that propounded it, that hee
which was sttooken with death, for that of his owne motion he had
put forth his hand vnto the arke, fearing lest it should fall, did serue
as a terrible example, shewing how dangerous it is to deale vnreuerently
in holy things.
            The Senate answered,Basill excommunicated by the Pope. that they could not satisfie the Popes desire,
before they vnderstood the Emperous pleasure. Vpon this answere
the Towne was interdicted. The Emperour sent a Franciscan
Frier to Basill, who had audience in a great assembly, where
there assisted the Embassadours of the Princes of the league of Italy,
In this assembly assisted Iosias of Seligni, Bishop of Syon & Grenoble, Anthony of la Roche, Pryor of Mortau, Claude of Tholsugeo
                     •
                  , and William of Rochefort. where hee deliuered his charge, and spake of this Archbishop,
as of a Goliath, who had raised himself against the Lords host.
Hee said also, that being at Rome for the affaires of the Archduke
Maximilian, when as the Pope had beene aduertised of these troubles
and motions for the calling of a Councel, the Pope had commanded
him to go to the Archduke Sigismond, and then vnto the
Emperour, to know of them whether they did approue and fauour
this revolt:Pope cō
                  plaines of the towne of Basill. and in like manner, to complaine that the Towne
of Basill, which had beene alwayes very obedient to the Holy
Sea, had suffered it selfe to bee carryed away very inconsiderately
with such Impostures and Impressions:The desires, and the effects of Desires which tend to reunite the members of one Family vnder one head, are iust and commendable, and God doth assist them. There is none but Sathan which hath fauoured and aduanced schisme and diuision. We are all of one stuffe, we make but one part of the garment, we haue need but of one seame Sarrura tantum opus est. But it is not fit to heare all them that speake. That the

Emperour hauing found, that whatsoeuer he did for the calling of
a Councell, proceeded from extreame hatred; and that his reason
was wholy conuerted into passion against the Pope, and impudent
arrogancy, presuming in the quality of a priuate person, to attempt
the reformation of the Church, and to call a Councell, the
which belonged onely to the Pope. The Emperours intent was,
It was not for that the Emperour did not earnest

                   to come or send to Mentz, to the end they might remedy the necessities of the Church in the yeare 1423. but hee did not allow of this particular Instance. that they should seize vpon the person of this Archbishop, and
that they should put him into safe keeping, and in such a place,
whereas he might be represented vnto the Pope.
            At the same instant he produced the Emperours letters patents,The Emrour commands the Archbishop to be app

                  ehended.
by the which, commandement was giuen to all Prouinces, Potentates,
Townes, and Commonalties to apprehend this Archbishop.
Then directing his speech vnto him, he exhorted him to acknowledge
his error, and to humble himselfe to the holy Sea, that hee
might recouer the Popes fauour, who seeing his repentance, might
haue pitty on him, offring to that end all the good offices that hee
could desire from him.
            
               The Archbishop answered in this sort: I haue neuer failed in obeence
and respect to the Emperour,The Archbishop resisteth in his proposition. and nothing hath moued me to speak against
the Pope, but the zeale of Gods honor. I can make a distinction betwixt
the person and the dignity; the Chaire, and him that sits in it. I
haue, with much griefe, seene the scandals and abhominations which abound
in Rome; and that the Pope is more pleased to flee

                I haue thought that there was no meanes to remedy
it, but by the holding of a generall Councell; and seeing that contrary to
the intention of the Decree of the Councell of Constance, they had let
passe aboue thirty yeares without holding of a Councell; and that the Decrees
of that of Basil were not obserued, nor executed, hauing often conferred
with the Cardinals at Rome, and found that the mischiefe was
neglected, I addrest my selfe to the Senate of Basill, as the most conuenient
place to make my good intentions knowne: and if I haue therein erred, I
submit my self to the iudgment of the Emperour, the French King & the
Councel, and take the Vniuersity of Paris for my aduocate, protesting that
I had neuer any intent to offend the Pope, neither can be called a Slanderer,
hauing truth for a warrant of that which I speake; beseeching that I
may haue three daies respite giuen me to answer more pertinenly to that
which is obiected against me.
            
               Hereunto the Frier replyed, that if there were any disorder in the
Church, there were doctors to teach and correct, whose doctrine they shold
rather follow, then their maners and actions,The doctrine may be good, & the life bad: If the Pastor liues wel, it is his profit; if hee teach well, it is thine, take that which is th

                  e & meddle not with another mans. A bad and barren ground, may beare gold. and that it did not belong
to him to vndertake the correction.
            And for that in this Discourse hee shewed his wilfulnesse, hee did
summon the Senate of Basill to forbeare to protect him, and to
apprehend him prisoner. The Nuncios and Commissioners, deputed
by the Pope, made the like instance, saying; that they
could not refuse him vnto the Pope, who was his lawfull
Iudge.
            
               
The Senate of Basil referred the dicition of this businesse to
the next Councell. The Popes Nuncio and other Deputies were
there, and the Arch-bishop appeared, where the contention was
long, and vrged with great vehemency and affection, of either
part,In the Assembly of the Senate of Basile, on Saturday, the 21 of December 1483. the Archbishop of Krane was arested prisoner, when as they consulted whether they should do it. The Embassadours of the Princes of Italy which were in

him the time for the calling of a Councell, and had bound him
not to dispossesse Angelo Corrario, who had carried the name of
Gregory the twelfth, from the dignity of Cardinall or Legat: That
the same doctrine of the Councell of Constance had beene followed
and practised in that of Basile:The Councell of Constance in the fourth Sessiō made a Decree, declaring that it represented the Vniuersall Church, and had power immediately from God, the which euery man was bound to obey, yea the Pope himselfe. that if they tooke away that
constancy which was necessary for the obseruation of their decrees,
they thrust the Church into distemperatures and languishings,
like vnto those bodies which haue their sinewes strained, and
their members and bones displaced.
            The Popes Ministers said, on the other side, that the Church was
a perfect Monarchy; that she had not her beginning from Dauid,
Alexander, Augustus, nor Fredericke, neither did she acknowledge
any other establishment: that the Church did not depend of any
other Iudge but of God; That euen the Councell assembled at
Sinuesse
                  •
                would not forcibly condemne that poore Idolatrous
Pope, who since was held for a great Saint. and who by a
wonderfull weaknesse, and base feare of death, had obeyed the
impiety of Dioclesia
                     •
                  , and sacrificed to his Gods, for prostrating
himselfe vpon the ground, confessing his fault, one of the Fathers
of the Councell
                  In this History of Marcelline wee finde often that the Bishops said: Iudica causam tuamnostro iudicio non condemnaberis: & that after his confession one of them sayes: Iuste ore suo condemnatus est & ore suo Anathema suscepit Maranatha, Quoniam ore suo condemnarus est, nemo enim vnquam iudicauit Pontificem, nec prae
                     •
                  ul Sacerdotem suum, quoniam prima sedes non iudicabitur a quoquam. tooke the word, saying▪ he had iustly condemned
himselfe by his owne mouth, hee hath submitted himselfe to
excommunication. Neuer any one did iudge the Pope, for the
first Seate is not to be iudged by any; That the Councell of Constance
binding Popes to the execution of his decrees, had respect
onely to Anti-popes, and not to them whose election was holy
and lawfull: When as some said that the first Seate was not to bee
iudged by any one, the others replyed, that it was vnderstood of
priuate Assemblies, and not of a generall Assembly of the whole
Church.
            The day was spent in these long Disputes, and night approaching,
Cinthius of Vrsin, Commander of Saint Iohn of Ierusalem,
entred the Senate, layd hold vpon the Arch-bishop and led him
away prisoner to the Tower of Spalen. The Senate was much
offended, and commanded the Popes Nuntio to depart the
Towne, seeing that his charge was ended. He retired himselfe, and
caused new Declarations and Excommunications against them
of Basill to bee published at Rahnfield, Constant, and other
places, forbidding all sortes of persons to conuerse with
them:
            
               
The prisoner in the meane time languishing in expectation of
what should become of him, tooke the shortest course for his liberty,
and iudging that if he liued in paine, his basenesse was the
cause of it, and that death might giue him a free passage, he changed
his patience into dispaire: so as on the Thursday after Saint
Martins day, in yeare one thousand foure hundred foure score and
foure, hee was found strangled with the cord of his bed: This
execrable kind of death was kept secret vntill that they vnderstood
the Popes minde; after which the executioner of Iustice entred
into the prison, put the body into a pipe, and cast it into the
Riuer of Rhine.To kill himselfe hath beene held an act of courage
                     •
                  : Plato forbids it in his Lawes: The Thebians detested it, and the Athenians did cut off his hand, that had slaine himselfe, & did cast it on the common dunghill. The Popes Deputies returned to Basill,
and the Excommunication hauing beene obserued three daies,
was taken away, and the Towne deliuered from the Popes
censures.
            Yet for all this they did not cease to wish that the Pope would
earnestly embrace the reformation of the disorders of the Church.
            Desires of this kind are iust, but wee may not presse them with
heate of passion and indiscretion of zeale.
            An example shewing that it is not reasonable, in such sufferings
and perplexities of the Church, that the pride of any priuate person
should presume to reforme it: Wee must leaue those
thoughts to Princes and Magistrates. The simple multitude
must attend with patience at the foote of the
Mountaine, vntil that Moses descend to let them vnderstand
the will of God: The Ship wherein
that holy Family is included, which hath
neither sight nor day, but towards
heauen, shall in the end appeare
most glorious ouer the
waues of the deluge, and
shall come vnto the
Mountaine of a
happy tranquillity.

Of LEWIS the eleuenth.
THE TENTH BOOKE.
            
               IN the beginning of the yeare 1480.1480.
               Lewis beganne to dye, and to feare
death, the which comes neuer so fitly,
but it brings with it terrour and amazement.Life must bee considered by the end: If it bee good and glorious all the rest is proportionable. Quomodo fabula, sic & vita, non quandiu, sed quam bene acta sit, refert. Nil ad rem pertinet, quo lo
                        •
                     o desinas, quocun
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      voles, desine tantum bonam clausulam imponas. Life is like vnto a fable: It imports not how long, but how well it be acted: It skils not where thou leauest, leaue where thou wilt, so thy conclusion be good. Sen.
                His forces grew weake, but his
courage was fortefied & strong, vpon
an apprehensiō which he had that they
would make designes vpon his graue,
and that they would not stay vntill hee
came to the end of his Carriere. Hee
desired to end it with the Authority, Maiesty, and Reputation that
he had begonne, and would not that they should know him dying,
nor that they should hold him mortall: Hee workes so, as in
the West of his life, the shadow of his reputation and respect is
as great as at the Noone-day of his raigne: Yet he finds that his
iudgement hath not the force and vigour which it formerly had;
that the remainder of his life is become sower,Age is alwaies accompanied. that age comes
not alone,When as wine and life grow low, they become sowre. Antiphanes.
                hauing brought him diuers discommodities, an incorrigible
melancholy, agitations of the minde, a slow Feuer, and
the paines of the Emerauds: He hath more prouision then he hath
way to go, he gathers and laies vp when hee should abandon and
let go.Age becomes couetous when it hath not any need of goods, it feares the earth should faile it: One demanded of Symonides why he was so sparing in the extremity of his age; for that said he: I had rather leaue my goods after my death to my enemies, then in my life time to haue neede of my friends.
                His designes are great and spacious, and his desires grow
yong, hee cannot free himselfe from new hopes, his soule is as it
were hung betwixt the feare of death and the hope of life, his vnderstanding
is a Milstone which the continuall course of affaires
doth turne day and night: And although his life passeth away
in languishing and griefe; yet had he rather endure the paine, then
not to be, desiring rather to be freed from it, then from life, the
which how painefull soeuer it be, hath some houre of ease:There i
                     •
                   no life so languishing and full of paine, but it is supported by some hope freed from the feares of death: When a
                     •
                   
                  Antisthenes the Philosopher was in extreame paine, hee cryed out, Who shall deliuer me frō these miseries? Diogenes presenting a knife vnto him said; This, if thou wilt, and that soone. I do not say of my life (replyed the Philosopher,) but of my paine.
                For if

paines be violent they are short, and if they be short, they giue
no leasure to complaine: Going to heare Masse at a little Parish
neere to the Forges of Saint Chinon,
               The King suddenly and dangerously sicke. hee found himselfe very ill,
and fell into a great weakenesse, and faintings, loosing his
speech and all knowledge. Hee was speedily succoured by the
Signior of Bouchages, who was his Phisition, and afterwards
Arch-bishop of Vienna, hauing taken a glister he recouered
his spirits, went to horse, returned to the Forges and there
dyned.
            But hee had so great a difficulty in his speech, as hee could not
be vnderstood but by signes. Phillip de Commines, who serued him
as Grome of his Chamber in this sickenesse, was also his Truchman

                  He vnderstood little of what was said vnto him, but he felt no paine: Hee made mee a signe to lye in his chamber, he did not pronounce many words; I did serue him fifteene daies at his meate and about his person, as Groome of his Chamber; the which I held for a great honour, and was well respected. Phil. de Com.
                when as he confest himselfe to the Officiall of Tours: And
for that being surprised with this sickenesse they carried him from
the Table vnto the fire,An Apoplexy vnperfect, and would not suffer him to come neere
vnto the windowes; hee remembred all this, and being come vnto
himselfe, he demanded who they were that had staid him by
force, and kept him from taking of the aire, being named vnto
him, he chased them away and would no more see them, for hee
did neuer like that King Charles his father should be forced to
eate, for that the Subiect should not in any thing force his
Prince.Wee doe not willingly see thē that haue beene the secret witnesses of our faults, or imperfections. The Ape beholding it selfe and seeing his foulenesse, his wrinkles and deformed shape, breaks the glasse.
            
            He thought that as soone as a Prince suffered himselfe to bee
gouerned by his seruants, he was, as it were, in tutelage and seruitude,
                  Lewis maintaines his authority to the last gaspe.
and he would not that this great authority, the which he had
so absolutely maintained all his life, should bee in any thing
restrained, so as immagination being weakned and troubled by
age; Melancholy and distrust could not endure that he should bee
contradicted or disswaded from any thing, hauing these words
often in his mouth: Do you thinke that I know not what I do? Nothing
did so much afflict him,He feares contempt the forerunner of sedition. as the feare that his infirmity
should be knowne:There is nothing that a Prince, which beginnes to grow old should so much preuent, as to make it knowne that hee grows heauy, & that the vigour of his spirits is weakened: For ambition of rule is so itching a thing, as euery man will giue order to these defects. For hee thought that as soone as his weakenesse
and infirmity should be discouered they would hold him as
dead, and vnprofitable to the world, that he should be contemned
of his Subiects, who would passe sudenly from contempt to sedition.
            Hee feared that in the end they would make him beleeue that
his sences were distracted, and that they would controule him
in the expedition of affaires: wherefore, as soone as he felt his
faintings past, and that his spirits beganne to returne, hee would
dye in action and standing:
                  Vespasian being tormented with a bloudyflixe, whereof he dyed, did not forbeare to rise and stirre, his Physitions told him that it did encrease his griefe, perswading him to lye quiet, but he answered them; The Emperour must dye standing.
                he caused all the dispatches, made
by his Secretaries,Hee cals for dispatches and expeditions. to be brought vnto him, seeming to vnderstand
more then he had vigor, or light of vnderstanding: Hee
made shew to reade the letters, and although he sometimes turned
them vpside downe, and had little knowledge, yet no man
durst aduise him.
            
               
The misfortune of this accident was happy for Cardina

Balue,
               Cardinall Balue was imprisoned in August, in the yeare 1469.
               Cardinall Balue set at liberty. whom hee remembred among the scruples of his consciences:
Hee had taken as much pleasure to ruine him, as he had
receiued content to raise and aduance him: He was first imprisoned
at Montbasson, hee did confiscate his goods, and gaue his
moueables to the Commissioners which made his Processe:
His plate was sold, and the money deliuered to the Treasurer of
the warres, Tanneguy of Chastell, Gouernour of Rousillon had
his Tapestry-hangings: Peter of Orioles, Generall of the Finances
his Library, the Lord of Crussoll a peece of Tapestry of twenty
elles, with the ground of Gold, certaine skinnes of Sables, and
a peece of skarlet of Florence: If wee should onely consider the
malice of this mans nature, who was a deceiuer, treacherous, and
ambitious, and so knowne by the Italians, amongst whom hee
had liued, and there dyed,
                  Ierome Garimbert
                  
                     •
                  speakes of this Cardinall after this manner: Egli fu di natione Francesce da Verdune pouero, pl

                     rie. Hee was a Frenchman borne, of Verdune, a poore Plebeian, wicked, and alwaies couetous of gaine and filthinesse. the cause of his imprisonment cannot
be but iust; His spirit which had lodged him there twelue
yeare, for that hee had employed all his pollicies and inuentions
to nourish ciuill discord, and which like vnto the serpent drew in
the whole body where he might passe the head, furnisht him with
a notable stratageme to set him at liberty.
            He pist and dranke his Vrine so secretly as they thought this
retention would kill him.His pollicy to get out of prison. The King caused him to bee visited, his
Physitions told him that his life was desperate, whereupon the
King (who was weakned with his infirmity) entred into some
scruple, that hee had done wrongfully to haue kept a Cardinall
twelue whole yeares in a Cage of Iron, that the Church
was scandalized, and his liberty wronged. The Cardinall of
Saint Peter ad vincula (who afterwards was called Iulio the second,
and was come into France to mediate a peace) tooke the
King in this good thought,The question is great vpon the exemption of Church-men out of the power of Princes: Some hold it is ordained by the Law of God, and others by grace and concession. made him to apprehend the offence
of the Church, in the long captiuity of such a Minister, and
entreated for his liberty, the which was presently granted: Balue
went to Rome, and was all the remainder of his life an enemy to
France, and for this cause was much fauoured by Ferdinand King
of Naples: he dyed Bishop of Preneste, and was interred at Saint
Praxede.
            
            This Prelate had all his life time warlike thoughts and
inclinations, and a chollericke and stirring spirit: The Cronicle
saith that in the warre of the Common-weale, hee went day and
night on horse-backe to visite the Guards: Hee got a Commission
from the King to go and muster the Souldiers at Paris. The
Earle of Dammartin seeing the confusion and disorder which
this Prelates ambition caused in publicke charges, besought the
King to suffer him to go and hold a chapter in the Cathedrall
Church at Eureux.
            If contrary aspects and shadowes raise and grace things opposite:Generosity of Cardinall Estouteuille.
               
the great and excellent vertues of William of Estouteuille
Cardinall of Rouan, will shew themselues heere gloriously:

Hee was the ornament of the Cardinals of his age, and neither
feare of danger nor apprehension of ill didTo do good where there is no danger is a vulgar thing, but to do good where there is perill is the proper office of a good man: to do euill is too easy and too base. hinder him from
doing good. Rome cast her eyes vpon him, as Athens did
sometimes on Aristides; He was wonderfull iealous of the dignity
of his Robe, and considering that the world was but a
Theater, on the which euery man was bound to play the part,
which his vertue, or fortune, had giuen him, hee would alwaies
performe his with constancy and honour: King Charles
the seuenth, commanded him to go to Rome, with the Embassadours
which hee sent to Pope Calixtus the third, to yeeld
him obedience, but hee excused himselfe, not for feare to expose
his sufficiency,Ignorance & weaknesse feare any encounter, for that they thinke being cō
                  pared one with another, their imperfections will presently appeare. to the encounter of a greater, but not to
offend the honour of his Cardinals place, which did not
allow him to accept of any Legation, but from the Popes
authority.
            With the same courage that he maintained the honour of his
Hat, hee defended that of the Church, and of France.
The Barrisell, or Prouost of Rome finding a man in committing
a flagrant delict or heynous crime, and hauing no hangman
to execute him, presently forced a poore Priest, whom hee
found begging in the streete, to doe this office: Hee laboured
in vaine to tell him that he was a Priest, and a Frenchman,
and that he had neuer done an act vnworthy the one or the
other:Cruelty of the Prouost of Rome. The Prouost, who had abandoned the Helme of reason to
the storme of choller,A iudgement transported with choller, is like vnto a Shippe without Pilate and without helme, or a lodging, out of the which the maister is expelled by the fire and smoake which is in it: The end of all that is done in choller is the beginning of rerepentance. the which had fild his spirit with fumes,
felt himselfe so transported with passion to punish the crime, as
hee would not hearken vnto the innocent, but threatned to
make him play the part of the offendor, if he would not do that
of the Hang-man.
            The feare of death, which had forced greater men to doe
worse, made him resolue to this infamous excution, after
which he retired himselfe, holding downe his head for shame,
into the house of Cardinall Estouteville, where hee complained
of this wrong, and demanded iustice. The Cardinall
considering that by the iniury of this poore man, the dignity of
the Church, and the honour of the Nation was interressed, sent
for the Prouost, and hauing let him know his fault, commanded
his Muletier to hang him at the barre in his Hall, with one of his
Mules halters: At the sight of this Prouost, hanging at the window,
the Popes Officers made great complaints, and the
Cardinall Estouteuille was ready to retire into France, but
Pope Nicholas being aduertised thereof blamed the cruelty
and iniustice of the said Prouost, who had so affected the
punishment of another,It is the ordinary course of iniustice to plunge it selfe into the mischiefe wherhinto she would draw others: Dat poenas dum exigit: They bee ruines which breake vpon that whereon they fall. as hee had not considered into what
danger hee engaged himselfe: Hee commended the Cardinals

iustice, and entreated him not to leaue Rome.
            He remained 28. yeares there, and dyed the same yeare when
as King Lewis the eleuenth left this life: Hee was made Chamberlaine
to Sixtus the fourth, Bishop of Ostia, and Deane of the
Colledge: Hee caused Saint Augustines Church to be built, and
did much inrich that of Saint Mary the Great: The Chanons of
this Church, and the Monkes of the other, did not yeeld that respect
vnto his memory which they ought: For being ready to interre
him they fell to quarrell for his Roabes, with so great a disorder,
as the rings were taken from his fingers, and hee
had like to haue beene stript naked by the indiscretion of those
whom he had cloathed.
            This first sickenesse of the Kings continued some 15. daies,
During this sickenesse all 
                     •
                  ffaires were dispatcht by the Bishop of Alby, by his brother the gouernour 
                     •
                  f Bourgundy, by the Marshall of G
                     •
                  e, and the Lord of Lude, who were lodged in two little chambers vnder his. at the end whereof he went to see the Campe of his new disciplined
souldiers, which hee had erected, and caused them to bee
put in battell, in a Valley neere to Pontdelarche in Normandy,
hauing caused a great number of Tents and Pauillions to be made
to lodge them in field, and Carts to enclose them and to
serue as a Trench: For the entertainement whereof hee must
make new leuies for money, and excessiue taxes, for it did amount
yearely to a hundred and fifty thousand pounds Sterling: They
that were about him when this sickenesse tooke him,Oppressiō of the people. considering
how much the people were opprest, and thinking that hee would
neuer recouer it, made diuers decrees for the suppression of this
Taxe.
            Many thought that this sickenesse had toucht his heart, and
made him more sencible of the miseries and calamities of his
subiects, for the remonstrances so often made vpon this subiect
had not preuailed any thing, and they expected no ease but what
should come from his owne motion:Hee had much opprest his people (saith Phil. de Comines) and more then euer any King did, Authority and perswasions could not moue him to ease them; It must come frō himselfe, as thē he would haue done, if God had preserued him from sicknesse, & therefore it is good to doe well whilst we haue leasure, & that God giues health and vnderstanding to men. He propounded to reforme
all the disorders of his Realme: If hee might not haue the honour
to haue reigned well, he desires to make his reigne better
at his death then in his life, thinking nothing makes a Prince to
be more lamented, then when he dies in some great action for the
good of his Realme.
            He meant to begin this Reformation by Iustice,The Kings desire to reforme Iustice. and Phillip de
Commines saith, that he loued not the Court of Parliament of
Paris, for that he disliked many things: He had so much contemned
to giue great Offices to the recommendation of merite and
sufficiency, and therein to consider the honour and condition of

knowledge, and they might say that France was betrayed by Asses,
as Troy had bene by a horse,That age was in the thicke darkenesse of ignorance, the which doth weaken all resolutions of wel-doing. Diogenes said that Troy had beene betrayed by horses, and the common-weale of Athens was lost by Asses. petty-fogging did triumph in the
Pallace, and did plunge them that came for iustice into gulfes of
confusion: It became insupportable by long and tedious delayes,
and therefore he vndertooke to cut off the proceedings of
the instructions of suites, and those long formalities which
made iustice like vnto a Vine, which, not being cut, brings forth

much wood, and little fruit. Lawes are made for publike infirmities,
and yet when there were most lawes, the Common-weale was
most corrupted, and weakest.To shorten tedious sutes, and to cut off that which is vnprofitable, and superflous in laws, hath beene the enterprises of great Princes, of Theodosius, Iustinian, Ch

            But such good thoughts came to late: they say that the Moule
opens her eyes when shee is ready to dye. The functions of his
soule were languishing and deiected. It was no more that great
Spirit, which gaue life and motion to all the spirits of his Realme,

work; and who, remaining in his Cabinet,Wisedome workes great effects without mouing from one place▪

                kept all his neighbours
in awe. The remainder of his life was at the discretion of all kindes
of languishings. This cold Melancholy could finde no heate, it
was chill in the hottest dayes of the yeare,His waywardnesse & melancholy. and did plunge him into
a perpetuall waywardnesse, insupportable to his followers, and
much more vnto himselfe. Melancholly and sicknesse drew him by
one and the same way vnto death. They sought all meanes to
cheere him, and caused Musitians to play before him, they brought
many sheepheards of the Countrey of Poictou, to sing, to make
him merry, and to keepe him from slumber, which drew him to a
perpetuall sleepe. But as the flame is smothered by smoke, so this
great desire of life, and this base feare of death blemisht the beauty
of the goodliest actions of his age.We must drink this cup ioyfully when God presents it. He that hath a firme hope of enternall life, should not feare a temporall death. This careful desire of life retaines nothing of the generosity of the minde. Maroboduus non excessit Italia per duodeviginti annos consenuitque multum imminuta claritate ob nimiam viuendi cupidinem. Maroboduus went not out of Italy for the space of two and twenty yeares, and hee grew old, hauing much blemished his glorry, by his too great desire to liue. Tacit. Annal. lib. 2.
               
            
            A yeare after hee fell into a relapse of his sicknesse at Tours,
where as he was taken with a more violent convulsion then at the
first,Relapse of the Kings sicknesse at Tours. so as he was held for dead, and remained some two houres laid
vpon a mattresse. The Signior of Bouchage, and Philip de Commines
made a vow for him to S. Claude, and he writes, that presently
after he recouers his speech. A change which the minde of man
should consider as all other meruailes of the hand of God, by the
humility of his zeale, and not by the subtilty of his iudgement.The reason of that which is done miraculously depends onely of his power that hath done it. S. Gregory saith that miracles, debent considerari per studium & non discuti per intellectum.
               
He went to Argenton to change the aire, and remained there a
moneth very sicke; then hee returned to Tours, and from thence
past to S. Claude to performe his vow, where hee left an euerlasting
memory of his piety and deuotion.The Chronicle saith, that in this voyage, for the safety of his person, he led eight hundred Launces, and sixe thousand foott.
            
            At his returne hee past by Salins,A Parliament erected at Salins. where hee erected the Parliament
of Bourgondy, which the ruines and extreame fury of the
warre had chased from Dole. He made ordonances for the gouernment
of Iustice, the which are yet obserued in the Franch-County.
Being at Beaujeu in Beaujolois, he was aduertised of the death
of Mary, Dutches of Bourgondy, who had fallen from her horse
going a hunting, and had left two children, Margaret and Philip,
for the which hee was not sorry, foreseeing that this death would
breed some alteration in Maximilians affaires: for the Gantois

could not suffer the command of Maximilian, nor Maximilian endure
the humors of the Gantois.

birth, and had not seene him, neither did he suffer him to be seene

men of the Realme had seized on him, against his father Charles the
seuenth, he feared the like attempt.

            One of the greatest griefes and discontents which he might haue
at the end of his life, was the apprehension of blame which
France would giue him, to haue neglected the breeding and Instruction
of this Prince, and to haue so late sought to repaire those
defects: he would that the admonitions which he gaue him in the
presence of his most confident seruants, should bee published in
forme of an Edict, and enrolled in soueraigne Courts, to the end
his subiects might know, that if his sonnes reigne were not answerable
to his hopes, the cause should not be imputed to his fathers
Instructions.

               Admonition made by the king to the Dauphin. by the grace of God, King of France, Dauphin of Viennois,
Earle of Valentinois, and Dioys, to all those to whom these Presents
shall come greeting, Wee let you vnderstand, that considering the beginning
of all things, and the end thereof, euen of humane Nature,
whose dayes are short: And that God our Creator hath giuen vs
such great graces, as it hath pleased him to make vs the head Gouernour
and Prince of the Noblest Region and Nation vpon Earth, which
is the Realme of FRANCE; whereof many Princes and Kings our
Predecessors, haue beene so Great, Vertuous and Valiant, as they haue
purchased the name of The Most Christian King,
               The Kings of France cary the Title of Most Christian since Clovis. Charles the Bald is called Most Christian in his Coronation. Pope Innocent, & Honorius the 3d. in their Bulles to King Philip Augustus, and to Lewis the eighth, called them, Most Christian. The Apostolike Legate, and three Bishops named in their Letters, write that the Realme of France is Most Christian. Du. Tillet.
                as well for reducing
many great Countries, and diuers Nations, inhabited by infidels,
to the good Catholicke Faith, rooting Heresies and Vices out of our
said Realme, and maintaining the Holy Apostolicke sea, and the holy
Church of GOD in their Rights, Liberties and Freedomes, as for
doing many other goodly deedes worthy of eternall memory, so as
some are held for Saints, liuing in the glorious company of GOD in
his Paradise, which our Realme, and other our Countreyes and Signiories,
we haue (thankes bee to GOD) so well entertained, defended,
and gouerned, as wee haue augmented and enlarged it of all sides, by
our great care and diligence, and by the aid also of our good, faithfull,
and Loyall Officers, Seruants and Subiects, notwithstanding that soone
after our comming to the Crowne, the Princes and Noble-men of our
Bloud and Linage, and other great Noble-menThe Princes and Noble-men of the League, were Charles of France, the Kings Brother, Iohn of Anjou, Duke of Lorraine and Calabria; Iohn, Duke of Alencon; Charles of Bourgondy, Earle of Charolois; Iohn, Duke of Bourbon; Francis, Duke of Brittanie; Iames of Armaignac, Earle of Marche, and of Castres, Duke of Nemours; Iohn, Earle of Armaignac his vncle; Iohn, Earle of Dunois, and of Longueville, Bastard of Orleans; Lewis of Luxembourg, Earle of S. Pol. Charles, Lord of Albert, father to great Alain, and Anthony of Chabannes, Earle of Dammartin. of our said Realme, or

the greatest part of them, had conspired, plotted, and attempted against
vs, and the Common-weale of our said Realme, many great practises,
treasons and conspiracies, so as by meanes thereof, there hath followed
so great warres and diuisions, as it hath caused a wonderfull effusion
of humane bloud, ruine of Countries, and the desolation of multitudes of
people, the which hath continued since our said comming, vnto this present
day, and is not yet fully quenched, but may, after the end of our dayes,
reviue, and continue long, if some good order and course be not taken.
            Wherefore, hauing regard hereunto, and to the age wherein wee are,
and to the certaine infirmity wherein wee are fallen, for the which
wee haue beene in great deuotion to visite the glorious body of Saint
Claude; so as with the helpe of our Creator, wee are much amended,
and haue recouered health. Wee therefore resolued, concluded and determined,
after the returne of our said voyage, to see our most deere
and well-beloued sonne Charles, Dauphin of Vienna, and to instruct
him in many notable thingsHappy are those Princes which learn the formes of Gouerning well, by the examples and instructions of their fathers. Leon receiued them from the Emperour Basillius, and Philip Augustus from Saint Lewis. For if the highest knowledge of a Prince bee to know his Estate, the knowledge cannot bee more faithfull, nor certaine, then from those▪ which haue the experience. The Booke of the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenete, for the Instruction of his sonne associated to the Empire (the which is now remaining in the Kings Library) is onely vpon this subiect; and as Monsteur Casaubon, who hath it in keeping, writes in an eloquent Epistle vpon Polybius: Sciebat vetus regnandi Princeps ad negotia gerenda in quibus Repub. salus continetur illud adprimè defiderari vtingenia hominum probè nota sint quibus cum agitur siue illi sint subditi; siue amici, siue socij, siue hostes. The Prince who was old in Gouernement, knewe well, that in matters which concerned the safety of the Common-weale, it was chiefly to bee desired, that the Dispositions of men, with whom they are to deale, bee well knowne, bee they Subiects, Friends, Allies, or Enemies. for the direction of his life in good manners,
gouernement, entertainement and conduct of the Crowne of
France, if it please God hee come vnto it after vs. For the accomplishing
whereof, after our returne from our said voyage, into our Towne
of Ambois, wee went into the Castle of the said place, where our said
sonne the Dauphin was, whom we haue alwayes caused to bee kept, and
bred vp there; where, in the presence of a certaine number of Nobleblemen,
and Ladies of our Bloud and Linage, and other great Personages,
men of our Councell, Captaines and Officers, both to vs, and
said sonne, wee haue called our said sonne before vs, and haue caused
those words and Remonstrances which followed to be deliuered vnto
him.
            First, after a recitall made by vs of the aforesaid things, or of the
greatest part of them to our said sonne, wee haue let him vnderstand,
how much wee desire, that after vs he might (with the aid of God) come
vnto the Cromne of France, his true Inheritance; and that he might so
gouerne and maintaine it, as it might bee to his honour and praise, and
to the profite and vtility of the Subiects of his Realme, Dauphiné and
other Countries and Signiories, and of the Common-weale.This Instruction regards onely the setling of the Princes affaires, and doth not extend vnto the duties of Conscience, nor to those vertues which edifie Kings, Piety and Iustice. But to what end so many Instructions? To make a Princes conduct happy, wee must wipe these wordes out of his minde, If it please, it is lawfull: If it may bee, it shall bee. A good Prince should not will any thing, but what hee ought. Caesar
                        •
                      cum omnia licent, propter hoc minus licet: vt foelicitatis est posse quantum velis, sic magnitudinis velle quantum possis; vel potius quantum debeas. For that all things are lawfull to Caesar, therefore they are the lesse lawfull: As it is a happinesse to doe what thou wilt, so it is a greatnesse not to will any thing but what thou mayest, or rather what thou oughtest. Plin. Paneg. Traja.
               
            
            
               Item, That if it pleased God to work his will on vs, and that our son
should come vnto the Crowne of France, wee haue commanded and enioyned

him, as a father may doe his sonne, that he shall gouerne himselfe
and the said Realme, Dauphiné, and Countries, by the Councell and aduice
of our kinsmen, Lords of our Bloud and Linage, and other Noblemen,
Barons, Knights, Captaines and wise men of our Councell; and especially
of those whom he shall know and finde to haue beene good and
faithfull to the deceased, our most honored Lord and Father (whom God
absolue) to vs, and to the Crowne of France, that haue been vnto vs good
and loyall Officers, Seruants and Subiects.

                     n writes in the fourth booke of his Common-weale, Chap. 4. that K. Lewis the 
                     〈◊〉
                   made another Edict, declaring all offices perpetuall, if resignation, death, or Fortune, did not cause some change, and hee ordained, that a Destitution by forfeite should not take place, if the forfeiture were not adiudged.
            
            
               Item, Wee haue also expressely commanded and enioyned him, that
when it shall please God he come vnto the said Crowne of France, that
he shall maintaine all the Noble-men of our Bloud and Linage, and all
other Noble-men, Barons, Gouernours, Knights, Esquires, Captaines and
Commanders at warre, in their Offices and charges, and all other, hauing
the command of men, and guard of Townes, places, and Forts, and
all other Officers, either of Iustice, or other, of what condition soeuer,
not changing or disappointing any of them, vnlesse they bee duely found
faulty and disloyall,An Officer which feares to be disappointed, holds all his actions pure, and keepes himselfe from failing: Yet a Prince should neuer displace without cause, and one of the greatest commendations which they giue to king Robert, is, that he neuer disapp

                  ed any Officer if he had not offended. and that there may be a due declaration made by Iustice,
as is requisite in that case.
            
               Item, Vnto the end our sonne may, and will, consider of, entertaine
and accomplish our said Ordinance, Iniunction and commandement, wee
haue laid before him the great miseries, inconueniences, and ir-repairable
losses which befell vs soone after our comming vnto the Crowne, for
that we had not maintained them in their estates, charges, & Offices,King Lewis the eleuenth coming to the Crowne, did suddenly disappoint all his fathers ancient seruants, who handled him in such sort, as he was ready (as hee confest after-ward) to quit his Crowne and his estate.
the which hath continued long, to the great oppression and ruine of many
of our Countries and Subiects, and doth yet continue, although that (God
be thanked) we haue not lost any thing of the Crowne, but haue augmented
it with great Lands and possessions; hoping shortly, with the pleasure
and good will of our Creator, to settle peace and tranquility: And
that if our said sonne should doe the like, and should not continue the said
Noble-men and Officers, the like, or worse, might happen vnto him; and
that as hee loues the good honour and increase of himselfe, the said
Realme, and others our Countries and Signiories hee should haue
a speciall care not to doe any thing to the Contrary, for what cause soeuer.
            Which Remonstrances made by vs to our sonne, the Dauphin, for the
good of the Crowne of France, and to the end the said Ordonances, Commandements
and Iniunctions made vnto him, should take effect, and bee
in perpetuall memory, wee haue demanded of our said sonne,A marke of great mildnesse in a seuere Prince, and of great bounty in a difficult Father, hee doth not vse his authority ouer his sonne for so iust a command. Hee first sounds his will, then hee suffers him to consult with his obedience, the bond whereof is sealed with the Seale of Nature, the which hath not giuen to men any Commission to command others, and to make them subiect, except the Father, whom Procles calleth, The Image of the Soueraigne GOD.
                what hee
thought, and whether he were content, willing, and resolued to entertaine
the same things, and other deliuered by vs, and especially touching
the said Charges and Offices. Whereunto he hath humbly made answere,
and said, That he would willingly obey, acomplish, and performe with all

his power, the Commandements, Instructions, Ordonances and Iniunctions
which we gaue him, for the which he did most humbly thanke
vs.
            Moreouer, wee commanded him to retire himselfe with some of his
Officers which were there present, and conferre with him vpon those
matters which hee had propounded vnto him, and resolue whether hee
would entertaine all that wee had enioyned him: The which hee hath
done, and then he spake these, or such like words vnto vs: Sir, with the
helpe of God, and when it shall bee his pleasure that these things
happen, I will obey your commandement and pleasure, and will
performe and accomplish all that you haue enioyned me. Wherevpon
we said vnto him, That seeing he would doe it for the loue of vs,
he should hold vp his hand, and promise so to do and hold: The which he
hath done.
            
               Item, After many other things declared by vs, concerning the same
matter, and also of many Noble-men our aduersaries within our realme,
A Prince cannot leaue a more profitable and fruitful precept vnto his sonne, then to make him knowe the friends of his Estate, to cherish them; and the enemies to beware of them: the one and the other are known by the effects; but men regard but the face, and God seeth the heart. who haue alwayes beene contrary to vs, and our said Crowne, from
whom part of the miseries and inconueniences aboue mentioned, haue
sprung, to the end he might haue a watchfull eye ouer them, we haue recommended
vnto him some of our good and loyall Seruants and Officers
which were there present, and some absent, letting him vnderstand
how well and faithfully they had serued vs, as well against our enemies,
and about our person, as also in many and diuers sorts. Of which things,
and of euery their circumstances and dependances, we haue ordained and
commanded our louing and faithfull Notary and Secretary, Mr. Peter
Parrent, to make all Letters, Provisions, Patents and declaratory clauses
of our said will and commandement, that shall bee needfull; as well during

We will that full credit shall be giuen vnto the Copy therof, made vnder

            The date of this Edict discouers the mis-counting of Philip de
Commines,
               
                  Philip de Comines was sent into Sauoy, to set at liberty the Signior of Illins a Dauphinois, whom the King had giuen for Gouernour to Duke Philebert his Nephew. When as the Earle of Bresse sawe the Kings Armie at Maston, hee did what they desired. who saith, that in the yeare 1483. the King would see
the Dauphin his sonne, whom he had not seene in many yeares before,
and that soone after he had spoken vnto him, he fell into the
extremity of his sicknesse, whereof he died: for this Remonstrance
was made in the Castle of Ambois, in September 1482. and the
King died not before August the yeare following. But to resolue
the doubt of times, it may be that the King some few dayes before
his death, had a will to see the Dauphin, when as they conducted
him to Paris, to make his entry, and to celebrate his marriage, and
that Philip de Commines not beeing at Ambois when this first Remonstrance
was made, beeing stayed in Dauphin or Sauoy, whether
the King had sent him with Troopes, against the Earle of
Bresse, hee had no knowledge thereof, and therefore hath written,
That the King had not seene the Dauphin in many yeares before.
            
            If a History bee the Image of Truth,A History is the proofe of time, the light of truth, the life of memory, the mystery of life, and the Trumpet of Antiquity. It is the Image of truth, and as the image is perfect, that doth rightly represent the Originall, so a History should represent all things in their simple truth. and if Truth can haue
but one vniuersall face in all things, how can it accord the
Chronicle with this Edict? It writes, that the King going to
Saint Claude, and before his departure out of Tourraine, sawe
the Dauphin at Ambois, and gaue him his blessing: That
in the moneth of October, the same yeare, beeing fallen into
a Relapse of his sickenesse, hee caused himselfe to bee carried
to Ambois to exhort him to that which hee should doe, which
makes mee to wonder, if in matters that bee secrete and important,
Writers doe not alwayes giue full, perpetuall, and
immutable Assurances, seeing that in these they dispense so
freely with the Certainety.
            The Instructions which the King gaue vnto the Dauphin, were
found Good and Holy, but they could yeeld no good fruits,
but with a peace. All the rest without it had beene of small vse,
there being nothing whereof a Father, who leaues a yong heire,

should bee more carefull, then to leaue him his inheritance quiet
and assured.
            Being therefore resolued to giue a peace to France, who attended
it as a gift from heauen,There can bee nothing giuen more pleasing, no
                     •

Gantois, to preuent all difficulties which the Father might propound

they would haue no more warres with France. They insulted ouer
him, doing and vndoing many thing contrary to his Intentions.

peace, solicited the King and the Archduke thereunto, to
ioyne their forces against the common enemy of Christendome,
and had sent the Cardinall of Saint Peter ad Vincula to exhort
them.
            The Deputies of either side met at Arras:A Treatie of peace and marriage. they layd open
all the Pretences of the Crowne of France to the House of
Bourgondy. The Kings intention was, that the Riuers should
returne vnto the Sea, from whence they came; and his reason was
grounded vpon the Law of the Realme, which giues no part of
Reuenues of the Crowne in propriety to the Females; and portions
giuen to the Princes of France, passe not to their daughters,
when as they leaue no sonnes.In old time the Infants of the House of France had their Portions in Soueraignty. This was abbrogated in the third race, and so ordered, as the yonger sonnes could not pretend any thing to the Succession of the King their Father, but a prouision for their entertainement, the which, (hauing no Heires Males) returned to the Crowne. Heereupon there was a Sentence giuen to the benefite of King PHILIP the third for the Earledome of Poitiers, and Lands of Auuergne against CHARLES the first, King of Sicile, brother to Saint LEVVIS, in the Parliament of Tousaints, 1283.
               
Finally, vpon that Maxime, That the reuenues of the Crowne are Inalienable,
and not subiect to prescription: For men cannot prescribe any
thing against God, nor priuate men against the Estate. To apply
the square vnto the stone, and the Hypothesis vnto the Thesis,
the Kings Deputies did shew that the Dutchy of Bourgondy, the
Franch-County, with the Earledomes of Flanders, Artois, and
Henaut, were peeces of the Crowne. If their discourse was not in
these tearmes, it was so in substance.
            The beginnings of the diminution of Flanders, as they of all the
great Empires of the world, haue beene weake, vncertaine, and
fabulous.Estates, as all other things in the world, haue three times, the beginning, the decrease, and the declining. The Countrey was peopled by a Colony of Saxons,

               Lewis of Bethunes, or of Mallaine, married Margaret daughter
to the Duke of Brabant, and had his onely daughter Margaret,
who was first married to Phillip Duke of Bourgundy, and afterwards
to Phillip the Hardy, sonne to King Iohn. From this truth
we must conclude, that the Crowne of France, had the right of
homage, and of Soueraignety ouer the Earledome of Flanders,
before this marriage. The like is said of the Townes of Lisle,
Douay, Orchies, and Bethunes.
            Consequently, Artois cannot bee separated from France, no
more then the Earledome of France from whence it is come,County of Artois. for
the parties follow the nature of their whole. King Lewis the ninth,
performing the will of Lewis the eighth, his father, gaue it for a
portion to his brother Robert, vpon condition that he should not
transferre it to the daughters which should be borne of his marriage
with Maude daughter to the Duke of Brabant: For these reasons,
the treaty of Arras betwixt King Charles the seuenth, and
Phillip the second Duke of Bourgundy, did expressely reserue the
Fealty, Homage, and Soueraignty, of those lands which did hold
of the Crowne.

this alliance, the two Bourgundies were vnited, and of this marriage
came Phillip Prince of Bourgundy, who was married to Ioane

his death the Dutchy of Bourgundy came vnto the Crowne, by
the right of returne, and by proximity of bloud, King Iohn being
found neerest to the succession. This proximity is easie to verefie,
being certaine that Robert, Duke of Bourgundy had foure sons, and
two daughters, by Agnes of France, daughter to King Saint Lewis,
Hugh, or Hughues, Eudes, Lewis, Robert, Ioane, and Margaret; Hughues
was Duke and dyed without children; Eudes succeded him, Ioane

            The Deputies of Flanders were well instructed what they
should answere, and if they had not beene a deniall had serued for
a sufficient reason, for in disputes of consequence, to consent were
base, and to deny wisedome. They said, that reasons drawne from
Lawes, and Customes obserued, did not proue that successions,
Fees, and the place of Peeres, were incompatible with the quality
of women: Iudith daughter to Charles the Bald, brought vnto her
successors Earles of Flanders, the Low Coūtries, with their largest
limites:The ancient bounds of the County of Flanders, were betwixt the Ocean Sea, and the Riuers of Escault and Somme. The same Prouinces haue beene gouerned in diuers seasons
by women, Margaret of Alsas, Ioane of Constantinople, and
Margaret of Mallaine.

In France, women are capable to hold the places of Peeres, and to giue their opinion in the iudgement of Peeres. Maude Countesse of Artois did assist at the Processe of Robert Earle of Flanders, in the yeare 1315. And in this quality, the Dutchesse of Orliance, and the Countesse of Artois, were adiourned to iudge the Processe of Iohn Monfort Duke of Brittany. The examples are in Normandy, Guienne, Tholousa, and Brittaine.

                  or, daughter to William Earle
of Guienne had that goodly Prouince in marriage: Alphonso brother
to King S. Lewis, was Earle of Tholousa by his wife: Maude of
Artois,
                  Maude of Artois, caused Robert, Grand-child to Robert the second Earle of Flanders, to be excluded from the succession by two decrees, the one made, by Phillip the Faire, at Asmeres, the 9 of October 1309. and the other by Phillip the Long, 1318. by the iudgement of Phillip the Faire, succeeded in the
County of Artois, by this onely reason that the daughters were capable
of this succession, and that representation had no place in the
direct line.
            To all this the Deputies of France answered suddenly;Answeres to the obiections. 
               That
Prouinces once vnited to the Crowne can bee no more dismembred:
               
That great Empires should endure great changes and alterations,
if the Females were made equall to the Males in the right of succession,
for their Crownes should not be dismembred into many
peeces, for that we finde in Common-weales in generall, and in
Families in perticular, more daughters then sonnes; That if examples
had more force then reason, and that they must decide the
controuersy by the number, they might not contradict the authority
of King Phillip the Faire, who would that the County of
Poictou, which hee had giuen to Phillip his sonne, should returne
vnto the Crowne for want of Heires Male, by reason whereof,
when as Eudes the fourth, Duke of Bourgundy, and Ioane of France
his wife, daughter to Phillip the Long, had pretended the succession
of the County of Poictou, against King Charles the Faire,

                  Phillip the Faire, would that the County of Poictou which he gaue to Phillip his son, who was afterwards King of France, Surnamed the Long, should returne to the Crown for want of Heires Male, vpon condition that the King should be bound to marry the Daughters. they were reiected by a Decree of Parliament giuen the 22. of
February: The same hath beene obserued in other Portions of the
Princes of France, for the Prouinces of Berry, Orleans, Anjou,
Maine, the Countie of Clermont, Artois, Alançcon, Perche, and
Eureux.
            The Deputies did not agree vpon these points, and the proofes
could not be so cleere, but there would be still found some exception
or diuersity: Moreouer, they treated for two Princes, who
stood not vpon words but held all things doubtfull, wherefore
they thought it fit for the good of a peace to giue more power to
trust then to iealousy,In Treaties it is neccessary to vse all the cautions which wisedome and foresight can inuent, but in the end wee must trust them with whō wee treate, else it is impossible to resolue any thing. which is a shelfe, against which affaires
suffer ship-wracke: They did winke at many things, and did turne
from that which the necessity of affaires did forbid them to encounter:
For in Treaties of this sort, Hee that can giue, must
giue, and hee that cannot, must seeme liber all of that which hee can
neither sell nor keepe; He that will haue all, looseth all. Matters past
as they desired, not by the rigor of restitution, but in fauour of the
marriage of the Dauphin Charles, with Margaret Princesse of
Flanders;
                  Margaret of Austria was married to the Dauphin, but shee was not his wife, for in the yeare, one thousand foure hundred foure score and twelue, He sent her backe, and married the Dutchesse of Brittany: Shee was married to the Prince of Castile, who dyed in the first yeare of his marriage. For the Arch-duke and the Estates representing Prince
Phillip as Heires to the Princesse Mary, appointed for her Dowry,
and promised, the Counties of Artois, Bourgundy, Mafconois,
Auxerrois, Salins, Bar-sur-seine, and Noyers for her, and
her Heires, Males and Females: For want whereof all the
afore-named land should returne to Prince Phillip, and to his
Heires.
                  Phillip the first, was married to D. Ioane of Castile, and had many children, Charles the fift, Emperour: Ferdinand King of the Romanes, then Emperour, and King of Hungary. D. Elenor Queene of Portugall and France, D. Maria wife to Lewis king of Hungary. D. Isabella Queene of Denmarke, D. Katherine, wife to D. Iohn King of Portugall.
               
            
            That if the lands returned to any other but Prince Phillip and his
Heires, then the King might retaine them vntill the controuersy
were decided, for the Townes of Lisle, Douay and Orchies,
the which should be done within three yeares after the case should

happen: The said Signiory should be gouerned vnder the Dauphin,
who should make satisfaction for the mony borrowed in the
Counties of Artois and Bourgundy, and suffer that the pensions
granted by former Princes should take effect.
            And if the marriage were not consummated, all those places
should returne to Prince Phillip, reseruing onely a Dowry of fifty
thousand Florins by the yeare, assigned vpon Bois de Vincennes,
Montargis, Crecy, and other places of Champagne, Bry, and
Touraine: That during the minority of Prince Phillip, and before
his marriage, the King, nor Dauphin, should not demand
the gouernement of his Low Countries: There was a generall

for the recouery of his lands.
            All priuileges giuen by the Princes should remaine to them
that had obtained them. The houses of Flanders at Paris, and
Conflant, should be restored to Prince Phillip, and that of Artois
to the Lady Margaret.

meanes to arme against them; not considering that flying one
mischiefe they did runne into another, giuing the King meanes to
haue them at his discretion, and that they were like vnto the horse,

with some remorse to haue beene bound for the quiet possession
of his Realme, to the cruelties, and inhumanities, which he committed
against his owne bloud: For he put to death King Henry the
sixth, and Edward Prince of Wales his sonne, with the Duke of
Clarence his brother.
            The cause of this brothers death is not very certaine: The most
common opinion is, that hee would haue armed to succour
the Princesse of Bourgundy, contrary to his brothers liking.

Coniurer,All the answeres of Sorcerers are doubtfull, and deceiue them that trust in them: They spake truely, meaning the Duke of Glocester, and the King deceiued himselfe vnderstanding it of his brother of Clarence. that his name that should succeed him beganne with

hee put him to death in a But of Malmesey. Others haue

and that the Dutchesse Margaret, sister to Edward,
fauoured his Designes, which the King (not wishing so great a

fortune to his brother) hindred. That at the same time one of
the Dukes seruants, hauing beene condemned to dye for poyson,
the Duke of Clarence was offended, and spake in such sort as the
King, taking his words for threates of some great trouble,
caused him to die in pryson.

any to sue for him, He left two children, Margaret who was married
to Richard Poole, and Edward whom the King made Earle of
Warwicke.
            All the crosses which Edward had suffred did not so much
afflict him, as he receiued contentment at his returne from the
warres of France, for the peace which he had brought backe, and
the Treatie of marriage which he had made of his daughter with
the Dauphin of France, and the pension of fifty thousand
Crownes: So when he saw the Dauphin married vnto the Lady
Margaret of Austria, he was so grieued as hee resolued to returne
into France to reuenge this iniury: Choller and griefe were so
violent in his soule, as he dyed, the tenth of Aprill, at Westminster,
whereas the Parliament was assembled to resolue vpon the
warre of France. His body was carried to the Castle of Windsor,
and interred in S. Georges Chappell: He had tenne children by Elizabeth

daughters were declared Bastards, by the Parliament, for that a
Bishop affirmed that hee had married Edward vnto a Lady of
England before that hee was married to the Lady Elizabeth
Riuers: Hee caused himselfe to bee Crowned King in Iuly following.

Lewis, who would not make any answeres vnto his Letters,
nor heare his Embassadours, calling him most inhumane, cruell,

            The King assisted the Earle of Richmond, who being set at
liberty by the Duke of Brittany, past into England with three

as it had neede of a Prince of more greate respect
and farre better experience, and yet for that hee was neere allied
to the Kings of France and Castile, the most factious were quiet,

and tooke the oath of Alleageance, when as hee entred with incredible
applause into the Towne of Pampelone, the tenth of
December, in the yeare, one thousand foure hundred foure score

            Presently after his Coronation, Ferdinand King of Castile
offered him Ioane his second daughter in marriage: The Queene
his mother did still protest that her will did wholly depend vpon
King Lewis the eleuenth her brother: The History of Spaine
saith that he had a desire to marry her to D. Ioane, a Nun at Coimbra,
to the end hee might renue the pretensions which shee
had to the Realme of Castile, as daughter to Henry the fourth;
and by this meanes, hee did alwaies assure himselfe of the
County of Rousillon. But when as his mother had brought
him backe into Bearne, hee was poisoned at Pau, playing on a
Flute. Hee dyed with this griefe that his life nor death did not
profite any man,As no man should desire to liue to himselfe alone, so that death is honourable which is imployed for the publicke: Turpe est sibi soli vivere & mori. Plut.

great spirit then when he liues and dyes not for himselfe. Dying
hee spake these holy words, which the mouth of the Sonne of
God pronounced a little before his death: My Kingdome is not of
this world: If hee had liued, he was borne to be a great Prince, but
the world (to speake truely) is so small a matter, as the Phylosopher
had reason to mocke at Alexander, who had carried the Title of
Great.

to Iohn of Albret; Iohn of Foix, Vicount of Narbona her Vncle,
did quarrell with her for the Earledomes of Foix and Bearn, saying
that these lands, lying within the Realme of France, whereas
women did not succeede, Queene Katherine could not pretend
any thing, and did by force seaze vpon Maseres and Monthaut,
and besieged Pamiers, but could not take it. Queene Katherine
aduertised King Lewis the eleuenth with this inuasion,
France doth furnish many examples against the Vicount of Foix, to shew that the daughters, being neerest of bloud, did exclude the Males that were farther off. who sent Commissioners into the Country to forbid the Vicount
of Narbona to proceed by way of fact, vpon paine of loosing his
right.
            This controuersy was of such importance as he himselfe would
be iudge thereof,Controuersy for the lands of Foix, Bern, and Bigorre. and after him Charles the eighth was Arbitrator:
In the end they must passe by the censure of the Court Parliament
of Paris: Iohn of Foix Vicount of Narbona, and after his decease,
the Kings Atturney Generall, as Tutor and Gardien to Gaston of
Foix his sonne, said against Katherine of Foix, that daughters being
vncapable of dignites, by reason of their sexe, might not succeed
in the Realme,King Charles the eighth, sought to make an agreement betwixt the parties, and therefore committed it to the Cardinall of Foix, and Monsieur D'Alby, but seeing they could not agree, hee sent them to the Court Parliament, All which proceedings in writing were imparted vnto me by Maister Galland, one of the most famous Aduocates of the Parliament. Dutchies, or Counties, but onely the Males,

and that they might not dispose thereof by Testament.When as they say that women are incapable of dignities, it is to be vnderstood of charges, which consist in Functions and Offices. A Woman cannot be a Consull, a President, or a Chancellour; but when the dignity is patrimoniall, and annexed to the Fee, such a dignity may belong vnto a woman, as wel as the iurisdiction.
            
            
               The King caused a Consultation to be made of all the learned
Lawyers of his Realme, to know what his Neeces right was. They
found that it depended vpon this Maxime; That the Nephew, or
Grand-childe represents his Father and Grand-father in the right of
Primogeniture, or first borne. That this right is transferred to the
children of the elder, although hee die before the Father, and holds the
place of lawfull heire.
            They did also consider the custome, and common obseruation
of this Realme, where the eldest sonne dying, and leauing a sonne,
hee succeedes the Grand-father, as his Father should haue
done: The Grand-fathers second-sonne being excluded from
all pretention: for the Nephew excludes the Vncle, and representation
hath place in this Realme, in Fees which are not diuisible.

the Peeres of France in his Court of Parliament, Ioane of Brittany,
married to Charles of Blois,

of Brittany, as representing her Father, against Iohn, Earle of
Montfort, her Vncle. She was daughter to the Duke of Brittanies
second brother, and the Earle of Montfort was the third brother.
Allain, Lord of Albret, as sonne vnto the eldest, Vicount of Tartas,
who was deceased, succeeded his Grand-father in the Landes of
Albret, and excluded from the succession the Lord of Sancte Bazille
his vncle, and the Lord of Oruall, his Grand-fathers yonger
brother.In the house of Albret there are many Earledomes: The Earledome of Gaure, the Earledome of Dreux, the Earldome of Peyragore, and many Vicounties and Baronies. They held that house in the time of King Lewis the eleuenth, to haue sixe thousand pound sterling of yearely rent.

should succeed, as the neerest vnto her father. Lewis, Earle of Flanders,
had but one daughter, the richest heire of Chrstendome, the

her Father, who was the eldest.They hold that the Countesse of Vendosme did not succeede in the Earledome of Saint Paul by right of succession, but by a Treaty of peace, and that her Vncles were all incapable of this sucession, for that the Landes of Lewis of Luxemburg her father, had been confiscate.
            
            The Earle of Lauragais left but one daughter, who succeeded
in the Earledome, whereof she made donation to the French

haue remained in the house of Bourbon by transaction.The King made Donation of the Earledome of March, to Monsieur de Bourbon, and his wife: The Duke of Nemours children beeing restored to their Landes, there was a sute to ouerthrow this Donation, and then an Accord was made, by the which the Earledome of Marche remained to the house of Vendosme and Bourbon, the Duke of Nemours children being otherwise recompensed.

That in all Dutchies, Counties, Vicounties, Baronies, Lands and

Signiories, the daughters being neerest in degree haue succeded,

had liued, he would haue decided this controuersie, in giuing
sentence for the Neece against the Vncle: His iudgement
had beene grounded, first vpon the right of the first borne, and representation:
secondly, vpon the conuentions of marriage betwixt
Gaston of Foix, and the Lady Magdalen of France, making expresse
mention, that the children which should bee borne, should succeed

Quae malum ratio est habere Imperatorem qui samam curare non nouerit, qui quid sit Respub. nesciat, nutritorem time at, respiciat ad nutricem manum, magistralium ictibus, terrorique subiaceat, faciat eos Consules, Duces, Iudices, quorum vitas, merita, aetates, familias et gesta non nouerit. God forbid the Princes and Fathers of the Countrey should be tearmed children▪ whose hands their maisters must hold when they subscribe, and who are drawne to giue Offices with childish delights: What a misery is it to haue an Emperour which knowes not how to maintaine his fame▪ nor what a Common-weale is, who feares his Tutor and is subiect to stripes and terror, and shall make them Consuls, Dukes, and Iudges, whose liues, merites, ages, families and actions hee doth not know. which was ill for himselfe, and worse for his subiects.
His mother Elenor, sister to Iohn the second, King of Arragon, was
depriued by the Estates, of the Regency which her Father had left
her: Peter, Duke of Coimbra, caused her to bee poysoned. Alphonso
tooke Armes to reuenge his mothers death: Peter was slaine
before Lisbone with a poysoned Arrow. They would haue married
Alphonso to Ioane, the supposed daughter of Henry the fourth,
King of Castille: this Tragedy hath beene formerly plaid. He died
at Sinta, being nine and forty yeares old, in the yeare one thousand
foure hundred, eighty two, and the three and fortith of his reigne,
and was interred in the Royall Monastery of the Battell of the order
of preaching Friers.
            After the warres betwixt him and the King of Castille, and the
vnfortunate voyage which he made into France, hee did nothing
but languish. He saw himself forst to passe into France for succors.
Fortune could not set him in a more wretched estate for there is
nothing so miserable, as to see a Prince expeld his Countrey, and
begging. Pitty is presently changed into contempt, and the consideration
of that which is honest, doth not ouer-sway that which is
profitable. They may well say, that kings are brethren, that one royall
bloud cals another, that their interrests are common, that Rome
is his mother, the Senators his fathers, their children his brethren;
yet if the aid which he demands, doth not benefit him that giues it,
he shall returne more discontented then he came.In great deliberations, profite goes before honesty. Demetrius, sonne to Seleucus, hauing beene giuen in hostage, and bred vp from his infancy at Rome, intreated the Romans to restore him to his Realme, which was held by the children of Antiochus; and to moue them thereunto, hee called Rome his Countrey and Nurse, the Senators his fathers, and their children his brethren. But for all this the Senate inclined to that which was most safe and profitable, they assisted the children of Antiochus, being weake and yong, suspecting much the great courage of Demetrius, who was in the flower of his age.

Thus behold three Kings imbarked almost at one instant in the
shippe of Death,Death of the Dutchesse of Bourbon. onely God knowes the port whereunto they
are arriued: hee did call at the same time, the Lady Iane of France,
Dutchesse of Bourbon, to the end that Lewis should not be grieued
to leaue the world. The Chronicle calles this Princesse, Most noble,
Powerfull, Holy, and the example of good liuers. She died in the Castle
of Moulins, in May, 1482.
            She had laboured all her life to entertaine loue and friendship
betwixt the King her brother, and the Duke of Bourbon her Husband,
knowing that the concord of France, and the greatnesse of
her houshold, depended thereon, and we may ascribe vnto her, the
glory of the peace which was made at Ryon, by the which the
principall fire-brands of the great fire of the league, were quenched;
Whereupon all they that loued quyet, cast their eyes
vpon those of this Princesse, and held them the Pleiades of
France, whose sweete Influences made the Oliue-tree of peace to
flourish.Princesses, by whose meanes peace doth flourish, are the Pleiades of Estates, wherein they are allied. Pliny saith, that the Oliue-tree springs vnder the Influence of the Pleiades. Con

                     ipiunt oleae virgiliarū exortu haec sydus illarū est. Polybius saith, that among the Grecians the Caduce, and among the Barbarians the Oliue is a signe of peace & friendship.
            
            At the same time dyed Iohn of Bourbon, the second of that
name, Earle of Vendosme. Here amazement stayes me suddenly,
why in all the History of King Lewis the eleuenth, Philip de Commines
hath neuer made any mention of that Nursery of Caesars and of
Alexanders, and of that Royall branch which hath brought forth
the greatest King that euer ware Crowne or Scepter. He speakes
of foure sonnes of Iohn the second, Duke of Bourbon, of Charles
Cardinall of Bourbon, of Peter, Lord of Beaujeu, of the Bishop of
Liege, and makes no mention of Iohn the second, Earle of Vandosme,
who liued vnder the reigne of Charles 7, and continued vnto
the end of Lewis 11. wee must not wonder if the Chronicle hath
forgotten it, it doth often follow toyes, and leaues most famous actions.
As there are iniuries which are repaired by the quality only
of them that doe them,The basenesse of him that doth a wrong, defaceth the fearing of the iniurie. Crates hauing receiued a blow on the face by Nicodromus, a Man of base condition, was contented for revenge to set these words vpon his wound: Nicodromus faciebat.
                so we see writings of so poore a fashion, as
it is indiffrent whether they be inserted or not.
            But how comes it to passe that so diligent, so exact, and so iuditious
a Writer had neuer cast his eyes vpon this house, which had
held all them of France in admiration, and had not spoken of the
actions of Iohn the second, Earle of Vendosme, which were no
workes of ambition, but of vertue, and had not glory for their
simple obiect, but the contentment of his owne conscience, desiring
rather they should be grauen in the memory of good men,
then vpon the front of publicke workes.
            An Historian that doth surpasse honour, wrongs the publicke,
and as a sacriledge doth rauish the recompence of vertue,The sweetest fruit of a great and heroicke action, is to haue done it: they are deceiued which thinke to giue any other glory vnto vertue, then it selfe. She cannot finde out of her selfe any recompence worthy of her selfe. and
doth enuy the fruit that may grow thereby. For although that men
may be borne generous, and full of heate for the loue of vertue,
yet it is needfull that the precepts and Images be often represented

vnto them, and that the statues which 
                  〈◊〉
                set vp in the Temple of
memory, grauen with the sciffers of eternity, should bee shewed
them; yet it is not sufficient to shew them adorned with the Palmes
and Crownes of their Triumphes; they would haue them represented
in such sort as they may seeme to breath, speake, and say
vnto them:Mens mindes are excited to the loue of vertue, by the examples of glory & honor, which adornes the memory of men whom she hath made famous: werefore Polybius saith, that they did represent to the youth of Rome, their Images, as liuing & breathing, to encourage them to that desire of honour which doth accompany good men. Poly. lib. 6. 
               You shall be as we are, if you will liue as we did.
            
            This labour may haue great defects: they are found in the most
perfect,A History should be free from loue or hatred. but they shall rather seeme to come from want of Iudgement,
then of will, the which I finde free, in this kinde of writing,
from hatred and loue, furious passions which disguise both truth
and false-hood. They shall rather reproch me with ignorance, then
with lying, and my writings shall alwayes haue more salt then
spleene; with what face shall they appeare in this age, so much
bound vnto the Kings glorious actions, if they were dishonored
as the rest, with so iniurious a forgetfulnesse of his Predecessors.
            
               Iohn, Earle of Vendosme, great great Grand-father to Henry the
fourth, King of France and Nauarre, was sonne to Lewis, Lord
Steward of France, and Gouernour of Picardy, sonne to Lewis,
Earle of vendosme, sonne to Iohn, Earle of Marche, sonne to Iames,
Constable of France, the yonger sonne of Lewis of Clermont,
Duke of Bourbon, eldest sonne to Robert of France, second sonne
to S. Lewis. His Grand-mother was Katherine, heire to the house
of Vendosme, his mother Ioane of Lauall, daughter to Guy of Lavall,
surnamed dé Gaure.
               The Signiory of Laual was erected to an Earldome by K. Charles the seuenth; at the instance of Lewis of Burbon, Earle of Vandosme, & was the first act of Soueraignety which he did after his Coronation.
            
            His father dyed in the yeare of our Lord 1447. and this death
happened in a time so full of troubles, as hee was forced to gird
his sword vnto him, more for the necessity of common defence,
then by reason of his quality, or for seemelinesse. Hee past his first
Apprentiship in Armes, vnder the braue Achilles of France, Iohn
of Orleans, Earle of Dunois, and was at the siege of Rouen, Bourdeaux
and Fronsac with Iohn, Earle of Clermont, sonne of Charles
Duke of Bourbon, and Carles of Bourgondy, Duke of Neuers. He
serued King Charles the seuenth in all occasions that were offered
to restore France; and to free it from the oppressions of her enemies,
and did merit the Title of Most faithfull seruant of his Kings
will, and an inuincible companion of his dangers.
            
            These two qualities which should haue purchased him loue
with his successor,Loialty of the Earle of Vandosme. were the cause of his disgrace, wherein hee did
comfort himselfe by the knowledge he had of this Princes humor,
who did not loue any of his bloud, nor them whom his Father had
loued. This was not able to withdraw him from his duty: for hee
still preserued the reputation of the ancient fidelity of them of his
house vnto the Crowne.This branch of Vandosme hath that of glorious, that it hath neuer left their kings, in a maner all the Princes of France were of the league of the Common-weale; yet Iohn, Earle of Vandosme, would not hearken to it. When as the Duke of Orleans tooke Armes against the Lady Anne of France, he drew vnto his party Charles, Earle of Angoulesme, the chiefe Noblemen of France; onely the house of Vendosme remained with the Kings Gouernesse.
            
            
               
And although that Iohn the second Duke of Bourbon had declared
himselfe of the league of the Common-weale, for that the King
had dispossest him of the gouernment of Guienne, from whence
he had expelled the English, and had reduced it vnder the obedience
of the Crowne, yet would he not imbark himselfe in the same
ship; and for that he would not looke vpon this storme from a safe
shore, he was present at the battell at Montlehery, with Francis and
Lewis his children; one of which was prisoner to the Earle of
Charolois. As the example of the head of his house did not make
him reuolt, so the feeling of his owne interest did not make him
discontented. His father had carried the Staffe of Lord Steward,
and his great grand-father the sword of Constable of France. King
Lewis the eleuenth disposed of the one and the other in fauour of
men, as farre inferiour in comparison of his merites, as in qualities
of his birth; yet he did not murmure, nor seeme discōtented, considering
that it is no more lawful for the greatest Prince of the bloud,
then for the least Officer of the Crowne to prescribe a law to the
Soueraignes will, to make it yeeld vnto his passions; and that the elections
of Kings, in the distributions of honors, are not subiect to
the rules of distributiue Iustice, which obserues a proportion betwixt
recompence and merit.The King of France holding his Crowne of God only, & the ancient Law of the Realme, distributes honors as he pleaseth. It is a great violence to force a a minde full of courage, to hate that which hee loues, and to ruine that which he hath raised. In the end this charge of Lord Steward
is returned into the house from whence it went: It did honor
others, Charles of Bourbon, Earle of Soissons doth honor it at this
day by the great and goodly qualities which heauen addes to the
greatnesse of his birth: he restored order in the kings house, and reuiued the glory of his Maiesties seruice.
            With the same courage that Iohn the second followed the King
against his rebellious subiects, he serued him against forraigne enemies,
He was present at the great Assembly at Ambois, with all the Princes of the bloud, and the chiefe Officers of the Crowne, to resolue a warre against the house of York in England, & against the duke of Brittanie, where there was a league made for the defence of the house of Lā
                  caster, and Edward, sonne to King Henry the sixth, was married to the Earle of Warwicks daughter. and was imployed with the Duke of Bourbon to disperse
the storme wherewith King Edward the fourth threatned France,
being come thither not so much to fight as to receiue the triumph
which the vanity of his ambition promised him.
            The proofes of his seruice are not verified by those of recompence;
and wee may say, that this Prince, beeing not present
at the distributions of the great honours of the Realme, had no
great share in the Kings fauours and bounty: Wee see him hold
his ranke at the Coronation, and in the Assembly of the Estates,
but being none of those that were honoured with the first
colours of the Order of Saint Michael, hee hath remained in
the ranke of those great Spirits, whose contentment dependes
onely of themselues. All the Princes of the bloud cannot haue
all the honours of the Realme. All Planets make not a shadow:
the refusall of a dignity augments the glory of him that hath well
deserued it, and the concession doth not make him famous that is
vnworthy.They ordained statues for them that had made war in Affricke against Tacfarinates, though they did not vā
                  quish him. Dolabella went thither, defeated him, & slue him; he demanded the same honours which had been giuen to others, which Tiberius refused, & Taci

            He had sixe daughters, Ioane of Bourbon, married to Iohn the second,
Duke of Bourbon: Catherine, married to Gilbert of Chabannes:
Ioane, wife to Lewis of Ioyeuse: Charlotte, married to Engelbert

Charles his eldest sonne, the first Duke of Vendosme, married Frances
of Alençon, and had by her seuen sonnes, and six daughters: the
second of his sonnes was Anthony, who married Ioane of Albret,
Queene of Nauarre, and heire of the house of Foix, Albret, Bearn,
and Armagnac. Of their marriage was borne Henry the fourth, king
of France and Nauarre: their third sonne was Lewis of Bourbon,
Prince of Condé, father to Henry, Prince of Condé,
to Henry
Prince of Conty, to the Cardinall of Vendosme, and to Charles,
Earle of Soissons, and Grand-fahter to Henry, Prince of Condé,
first Prince of the bloud. The yonger sonne of Iohn the 2d Earle of
Vendosme, was Lewis, head of the branch of Montpensier, and of
Roche-sur-yon, whom death hath cut off from this great tree. There
remains one daughter, promised to the Duke of Orleans, the Kings
second sonne.
            Death freed the Earle of Vendosme from the cares which a longer
life had augmented by the iealousies and distrusts which the King
conceiued of all the Princes of his bloud, & which kept him continually
in the diuers agitations of hatred and feare. It is impossible
but that he who by his extreame rigors & seuerities hath offended
many, should feare alwayes: hee cannot trust his subiects as his
Children, seeing he hath not entreated them as a Father,Loue is a strong guard of a Princes person. Agesilaus said, that he wold liue safe without gardes, if he cōmanded his Subiects as a good father doth his children. He must be beloued of his subiects, and feared of strangers.

his share of the feare which hee hath made common. Wheresoeuer
hee casteth his eyes, he seeth markes of his seuerity; so hee
findeth not any one but puts him in feare: hee hath feare of his
Children, feare before him, and feare behind: and as in his life hee
had alwayes desired more to be feared then loued, so in the end he
found himselfe composed of the same humor, fearing more then
he loued.
            
               Hitherto it seemeth he did not trust any man but Peter of Bourbon,
Lord of Beaujeu, his son-in-law, in whom he had so great a
confidence, as he referred vnto him all the care of his affaires, when
as the pleasure of hunting entertained him in the Forrests, not for
some few dayes, but whole moneths. The Author of the Annals of
the house of Bourbon, who hath seene the originals of many great
treaties, speakes after this maner: This Peter of Bourbon, Lord of Beaujeu
was in such fauour with the king, as his Maiesty desiring to retire
himselfe from affaires, kept commonly at Chamois and places thereabout,
a Countrey, at that time, full of wood, and wilde beasts, causing the said
Lord Peter of Bourbon, his son-in-law, to remaine at Montereau-faut-yonne,
to bee chiefe of the Councell, to whom all men repaired for their
dispatches which had any businesse in Court.A Prince must be feared and loued, but for that it is difficult to haue these two things concurre together, it were better and more safe to be feared, for that Princes which haue grounded themselues vpon the loue of the people, haue found, that there is nothing more inconstant, & men do sooner offend him that makes himselfe to be loued, then hee that is feared, yet must they not in seeking to bee feared, make themselues odious. The King loued the woods
and hunting to free himselfe from cares, reposing all vpon the said
Lord of Beaujeu. His Maiestie also said, That hee did hate deadly
them of Bourgondy, Aniou, Alençon, and the Dukes of Brittanie
for their pride.
            
               
               And contrariwise, that hee loued Charles of Artois, Earle of Eu,
for that hee retained nothing of the arrogancy of his predecessours, and
them of Bourbon more for their mildnesse and humility.
               It is not the first testimony which the kings of France haue giuen of the mildnesse, wisedome and moderation of the Princes of the house of Bourbon. When as King Charles the

                  y, giuing a reason hereof openly, That he loued those Princes, for that they had neuer serued any other maister, and had neuer had any ambition nor design against the state, neither had they euer giuen him any occasion to complaine of them.
                This vertue
was neuer found in a great spirit, but it did purchase power and affection
with others. Pride is barren, humility fructifieth: a vine
spreading vpon the earth beares excellent fruit, the high and
straightest Cypres-trees are vnfruitfull.
            Hee was not so bountifull of his fauours to the Lord of Beaujeu,
but hee was as sparing to the Duke of Bourbon his brother:
he had an implacable hatred against Iohn, Duke of Bourbon, sonne
to Charles, the Achilles of France. This hatred was nourished with
a fresh apprehension, for that this Prince lamenting the disorders
of the State, the miseries and oppressions of the people, and the
bad vsage which Charles, Duke of Berrie suffered, had laid the first
foundations of the league, had left it by the Treaty of Ryon, and
re-entred againe into it vpon despight, for that during this Treaty,
the Duke of Millan, by the Kings commandement, had ouer-run
and ruined his Countrey of Beaujolois and Forrest.
            But for that hee was a Prince of great power, great courage, and
great credit in the heart of all France: hee would not euaporate
this fire of reuenge and indignation which hee had against them,
and considered rather what he might doe, then what he should do.
And the Duke, who was acquainted with the disposition of this
King, knewe well, that all Princes write offences done them in
brasse, and the seruice which they receiue, vpon sand; wherefore he
remained long in his Dutchy of Bourbonois, and would not come
to Court.
            The King, whose chiefe care was to weaken his enemies, and
to diuide them, gaue him the gouernement of Languedoc, dissembling
the remembrance of things past. Vpon this assurance
the Duke of Bourbon shewed that hee did not breathe any thing,
but the Kings seruice; neither had he any greater content, then to
yeeld him proofes equall to his affection: and therefore hee followed
him to Peronne, and we must beleeue that without him
in this voyage hee had giuen his Enemies more courage to
execute those dangerous councels, hauing resolued to stay him:
For besides the respectes of Alliance, the Duke of Bourgondy,
respected this Prince, who had the two principall
partes necessary in great Captaines, Valour and good Fortune.The two qualities necessary in the Generall of an Army are, Valour and good fortune. Duo sunt quae Claros Duces faciunt, summa virtus, summa foelicitas. Lat. Pac. Paneg.
            
            Wee haue formerly seene, that the Constable of Saint
Pol did what hee could to drawe him to the Duke of Bourgondies
partie,Fidelity of the Duke of Burbon and to make him ioyne with the King of Englands forces;
and that this braue Prince made it knowne, that nothing was able
to shake his loialty, no not if he should be reduced to the misery

of Iob,
               An extreme oppression is no lawfull cause to arme against the Prince, rebels seeke pretexes and coulors to shadow their discontents, but good subiects suffer with patience. although that the sincery of his actions could neuer
wipe away the blemish which distrust had put in this Princes eyes,
yet would he not trouble the content which hee had receiued by
the testimony which his conscience gaue to fidelity and vertue.
The King also fore-seeing that if his enemies were fortefied, with
his fauour and forces, hee should be much troubled, hee coniured
him to come vnto him. The Duke excused himselfe vpon a
resolution which hee had taken to liue quietly in his house, the
which no man could enuy him, hauing purchased it with incomparable
toyles and crosses. Hee besought the King to suffer
him to rest in the port of this tranquility after so many stormes, and
to content himselfe with the seruice which the other Princes of his
house, and his Bastard the Admirall did him.
            The King entreated and coniured him to come, and to reape
the same fruits in Picardy which he had sometimes receiued in
Guienne,The honour of the glorious victory of Fromigny is giuen to Iohn the second Duke of Bourbon, who then tooke the title of Earle of Clermont, for hee charged the English with such fury, as with the losse of tenne men onely, hee defeated fiue thousand English, and tooke 1400. prisoners. to the shame and confusion of the English, sending
the Bishop of Mande vnto him to deliuer his requests, and recommendations
more confidently, and to assure him that the occasion
was not lesse glorious then at Fromigny.
            The Duke being loath to faile France in so great an occasion,
and remembring that his predecessours had not desired a more
glorious graue then to die vpon a field of battell couered with
the bloud of their enemies,The Princes of the house of Bourbon who haue dyed for the seruice of the Crowne, are Peter of Bourbon, slaine the 19. of September 1356. at the battell of Poicters, Iames and Peter his sonne at the Battell of Brignay neere vnto Lyon: Lewis at the Battell of Agincourt 1415. Francis at the battell of Saint Bridget on holy Crosse day in September 1525. Iohn at the battell of Saint Laurence, 1557. and Anthony at the siege of Roan, 1562. and to free the King from all conceite,
that he had a will to giue eare vnto the Constable, who did
solicite him with all vehemency, he deliuered the Constables letters
into the Bishops hands, protesting that hee would neuer carry
Armes against the Kings seruice. The effects did not differ from
his words; for seeing the Duke of Bourgundies troupes approach
to enter the Country, he went to horse and put them to rout: The
Earle of Conches was slaine there, the Earle of Rousillon Marshall
of Bourgundy was taken prisoner there, with the Earle of
Dammartins sonne, and the Signiors of Longy de Lisle, Digoin,
Ruygny, Chaligny, and the two sonnes of the Signior of Viteaux,
one of which was Earle of Ioygny: Being then assured of the
discent of the English, and that they had passed the Sea, he came
vnto the King with sixe hundred horse, and commanded part of
his Army which was neere vnto Beauuais. Matters being reduced
to those tearmes that the King desired, and the King of England
hauing repassed the Sea, he retired himselfe to Moulins to performe
the last duties to his mother,The Lady Agnes of Bourgundy dyed in December 1476. Shee was wife to Charles Duke of Bourbon, and mother to Iohn the second of that name, Duke of Bourbon, to Charles, Cardinall and Arch-bishop of Lyon, Peter Lord of Beaujeu, Lewis Bishop of Liege, and Iames who dyed at Bruges, and to the Lady Ioane of Bourbon, married to the Lord of Arlay, Prince of Orange, and Margaret of Bourbon, wife to Phillip Earle of Bresse. and from that time resigned
his aboade at Court vnto his brethren.
            After the Duke of Bourgundies death, hee would not bee an
actor in the warre which the King beganne against his daughter,

King should haue giuen it a better and a more reasonable Title,
then a simple desire to ioyne the Low Countries to his Crowne,
this so free and true a iudgement did much offend the King, who
from that time resolued to let the Duke of Bourbon know that
this last offence had renewed the feeling of the first: He caused secret
informations to be made against him, yet doubting his courage
& reputation, he would not haue the rigor of his iustice aime
directly at him; Hee beganne with his Officers, and gaue commission
to Iohn Auin, Councellour in the Court of Parliament,
and to Iohn Doyac, to enforme against him, thinking that to free
themselues from trouble they should bee forced to engage their

his Atturny, the Captaine of his Guard and many others,
who appeared with more confidence to defend themselues, then
slander had assurance to accuse them; vpon their answere the
Commissioners knew not what to say, and the Court of Parliamen,

Bourbon, whose probity and integrity (two rare qualities in that
age) had purchased him the surname of Good, and the affections of
all the people, enlarged them: The Chronicle saith, that this proceeding
was against God and Reason.
            It was a very sencible griefe vnto him to see his loyalty called in
question, and his seruices contemned. But hee considered all
these occurrents with an open eye, and a resolute brow, with the
a

thereof with a setled spirit, lamenting the bad counsell which entertained
the King in his great rigours in an age which was not fit
for it.Seuertty is not good in a Prince whose age is declining, It is needefull to purchase loue, Galba knew it well. Some other would not haue forborne teares for so peircing
a griefe, he would haue lost his sleepe, and his body should
haue found no other rest but that which disquietnesse brings by the
agition of the mind; but afflictions which assaile good men do
them no other harme but burne the bonds which hinder them to
lift their hands, with their hearts, vp to heauen. They blesse the
name of God in the midst of flames, Imprisonment doth not depriue
him, which suffreth for iustice, of the sweetnesse of a profound
sleepe: His rest is so sound as the Angell of the Lord which
comes to deliuer him, must awake him.
            It is now time that Lewis go the way which these great Kings
haue traced vnto him. There wants nothing but this peece to the
triumphant Charriot of death, and hee could not desire better
company then of these three Kings his neere kinsmen, who were
there already,Hauing passed through all the charges of life, we must not refuse that of death: Seneca said to him that was loath to leaue the charges and offices wich he had exercised in his life time. Quid tu nescis v

                he had passed by all the offices of life, there remained
nothing but the last: but it is the most difficult, and would bee
lesse if he had thought on it in time; if going by the way of life, he

had thought of the lodging of death, those feares which hold him
in worse estate then death it selfe, should be dispersed. Accidents
foreseene a farre off, considered without amazement, and attended
with resolution, do not trouble the minde like vnto those which
surprise it: His thoughts were ingaged in so many mortall and perishable
things, as he had small care of Immortall, and yet these
went before him and attended on him, and the others followed
after him and abandoned him: He hath busyed himselfe to gather
vp Attlantas Apples, and hath so much the more hindred the fruite
and prise of his course; In the way of health he that staies, retires;
and hee that retires looseth himselfe and goes astray. There are
three sorts of men whom God loues not, they that stay, they that
turne backe, and they that wander: Wee must giue courage to the
first, call on the second, and direct the others.
            
               Lewis found himselfe to be in so difficult a passage as he had need
to be encouraged,
                  Lewis fals into new apprehensions of death. supported and directed,It is a sweete consolation to a Princes minde among the trances and feares which are found in the passage of life and death, when hee hath not to doe with any but himselfe, that all his enterprises are ended, and that he may say, I die content. hee could not but
murmurre against the Law of Nature which did not suffer him to
glut himselfe with the pleasures of life: But to haue content of the
rest at the point of death, hee must make prouision thereof
throughout the whole course of his life: That word, I dye content,
is not alwaies found in the mouth, nor proceeds not from the heart
of Princes, who haue had so much paine to content thēselues, & in
whose liues, as in those of other men, we finde, Vanity, weakenesse,
inconstancy, and misery: The great oppositions which Lewis makes
against the decree of death, shew that he is not yet content with
the fruits of life: He complaines that he hath discouered the Port,
and desires to thrust himselfe againe into the violent waues of the
world; He thought that a little more life would haue made him
reape the fruites of so many designes which hee had sowne in diuers
places, and did grieue that death would not suffer him to see
that ended which he had begunne.
            Yet it is a very remarkeable thing that before his death he saw all
things new or renued in all other Kingdomes of Europe, as if the
eternall prouidence of God, had not left him in the world, but to
consider these great changes which did amaze England, Arragon,
Nauarre and Scotland. And although they were things farre from
his sight, yet could he not but be passionate, and informe himselfe
as interressed in all things: His curiosity notwithstanding was staid
by the respects of his Religion,Offers of Bajazeth to the King. in contemning the offers of
friendship which Bajazeth made vnto him, who sent him a list of
all the Reliques which his father had found at the taking of Constantinople,
and of the Holy Land, promising to deliuer them vnto
him; so as hee would assure him of Zizimi his brother, who
had yeelded himselfe to the Knights of Rhodes. This peece is
worthy to bee related:
                  Zizimi reuolts against Bajazeth.
                
               Mahomet left two sonnes, Bajazeth
               
                  Bajazeth was the elder, and Zizimi the yonger, who said that he was the Emperours son, for that hee was borne during the raigne of Mahomet, and Bajazeth before. the
elder, surnamed by the Turkes Ildrimy, that is to say, Lightning,
he cōmanded in Paphlagonia towards the black or Euxin Sea, Iohn
called Zizimi, that is to say, Loue, was at Conio a city in Licaonia,

the Ianisaries were diuided which of the two should succeed, the
first was held effeminate and dissolute, the other led a more manlike
and martiall life: The controuersy was followed by a great
sedition, and the great Turkes Treasury was spoiled; many desiring
that the Scepter should bee giuen to him that had the best
sword.The Law of Nations hath alwaies preferred the

Basha, remained victorious, and Zizimi was forced to retire himselfe
into Asia the lesse, from whence he passed to Ierusalem and
then to the great Caire, towards the Souldan of Egypt.
            The great Caraman hearing of the diuision which was betwixt
these two brethren, held it a fit occasion to be embraced, to recouer
the Realme of Cilicia which Mahomet had taken from him,
whereupon he inuites and solicites Zizimi by letters and Embassadours
to ioine with him. They make an Army, and present themselues
neere vnto Mount Taurus to giue Battell vnto Bajazeth:
Zizimi considering the inequality of their forces (for the Army
of Bajazeth consisted of two hundred thousand men) and that if
hee fell into his brothers hands, he would put him cruelly to death,
he thought there was no other retreate for him but to the Christians.
In any sencible griefe, or when any execrable thing was spoken, the Iewes and Mahometans, rent ther garments. Among the acts of choller and fury of Maximin, obserued by Capitolinus are these: Incurrere in parietes, vestem cindere gladium arripere quasi omnes posset occidere. To runne against the wals, to cut his garments, and to draw his sword as if hee would kill all men. This was not without doing great violence to his conscience,
breaking his habits in signe of breach of his heart, in such
resolution, for he was a great obseruer of his religion, and so iealous,
as hee fell into fury when hee saw a Turke drunke:
Hee dranke water with sugar, and sometimes wine, so as it were
mingled with spices and other liquors, saying, that this mixture
did alter it, in such sort, as it was no more wine. There is not
any Law whereas humane pollicy doth not finde some exceptions.
            By the aduice therefore of Caraman, hee left his wife and children
with the Soldan of Egypt, and resolued to seeke his fortune
and succours among the Christians, and to retire himselfe to
Rhodes, hauing written this letter to Bajazeth.

                        Bajazeth receiuing this letter and hauing read it, remained two daies retyred, and would not bee seene, shewing a wonderfull griefe, that his brother had retired to the Christians, especially to the Knights of Rhodes, the greatest enemies hee had in Christendome. thou a breaker

particular, which weare a Crosse, for the great hatred they beare vnto
our powerfull House: I am forced to retire my selfe vnto them to saue
my life, and thou art the onely cause of this mischiefe: If thou hadst
granted me that which I desire so iustly I had remained peaceably vpon
the frontier, and thy brother, a Mahometane as thou art, and of the
same bloud, should not be forced to ioyne with Christians, with whom
it would be impossible for him to serue God according to the ceremony

of our Law,
                        Zizimi was alwaies sad and melancholicke, being depriued of the exercise of his Religion▪ At the first feast which the great Maister made him, there was Musicke of all sorts of Instruments; yet hee was nothing the merrier. They brought before him a scullion of the Kitchin, a Turk who was a slaue, who sung, or howled out a song after the Turkish manner whereat he took a wonderfull delight. I attend from God the reuenge of so great a wickednesse,
and do pray vnto our great Prophet to giue thee a punishment equall
vnto thy crime: If our father had fore-seene thy impiety, I assure my
selfe that with his owne sword, or by poyson, he would haue taken away
thy life. Hee hath exalted the house of the Ottomans, and it seemeth,
thou takest delight to ruine it: But it is impossble that an Empire which
thou hast vsurped with so great tyranny and cruellty, should continue
long, the building cannot be firme vpon so bad a foundation. The day
will come, when to reuenge thine impiety, some one will do the like to
thee and thy children, that thou attemptest against me and mine. Adue
and looke to the ruine which threatneth thee.
               
            
            
               Zizimi was well receiued at Rhodes the 24. of Iuly 1482. the
great Maister sent Aluaro of Estuniga Prior of Castile with the
Gallies of the Order to conduct him,
                  Zizimi comes to Rhodes. he went himselfe to meete
him with all his Knights: Zizimi was amazed to see himselfe receiued
with so great honors in a Towne which his father would haue
ruined. Hee made it presently knowne that hee had a desire to go
into France, and to cast himselfe into the Kings Armes, although
he were inuited by many other Princes to come vnto them.He is conducted into France. The
great Maister hauing thereupon receiued commandement conducted
him thither.
            They tooke Saye before him,The Say which is taken to Princes is ancient, Xenophon in the first of his Cyropadia shews how the Persians did vse it. Tacitus speaks of Halotus, who carued the meate, and tooke Say to Claudius: inferre epulas & explorare gustu solitus. Athaneus saith, that the Romans called him that had this charge, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                as they vse to other Princes (an
ancient custome and knowne to the Romanes who had it from the
Persians) whereat being amazed, and desiring to let them know that
he was not come thether to distrust, he did eate of euery dish that
was set before him, before any Say were taken: Noble and generous
minds (said Zizimi) are not distrustfull, I feare not to be poysoned among
such braue and noble Knights, and if I had feared it I would not haue
trusted my safety in their hands, I wil liue among them as a priuate man,
and not as a Prince: Bajazeth was so fearefull least he should be set at
liberty, and trouble his Estates, as he payed yearely 45000 Ducats
to the Treasury of the Religion, 35000. for the entertainement
of Zizimi, and 10000. to repaire the spoiles which Mahomet
his father had done them at the siege of Rhodes,There was an accord made betwixt the great Maister and Bajazeth, the 8. of December 1482. the which is worthy of memory; for that it may be said that the great Turke to liue in peace, and fearing that Zizimi should returne into Turkey, was forced to yeeld himselfe tributary to the Knights of Rhodes. and would that
the Embassadours which carried the first payment should passe into
Auuergne to see in what estate he was.
            The great Maister wrote to all the Princes of Christendome,
that if they did not contemne this goodly occasion to diuide the
Empire of the Ottomans, by the meanes of Zizimi, they might spoile
him of all the Estates he had taken from the Christians, and by so
pretious a Gage, bridle all his designes, in such sort, as Christendome
might remaine long in peace and tranquility, for hee should
not dare to attempt any thing, whilst his brother were in the Christians
power.
                  Bajazeth feared both at home and abroad, Zizimi had friends, he put all them to death whom he suspected to fauour, and among others Acmath Basha, who had taken Otranto, Isaac Basha was dismist from his Offices. But at this season Italy was full of diuisions. The
Pope, Venetians, and Siennois, were in league against Ferdinand
King of Naples, the Florentines, and the Duke of Milan: The Emperour

made an excuse that hee could not intend it. Christendome
did not reape the profite it might haue done, and neglected
this occasion, as the precedent offered by one of the sonnes of
Amurath, who had made himselfe a Christian, and maintained that
Mahomet was vnlawfull, and supposed.

               Mathias Coruinus King of Hungary sent his Embassadours to
the Pope to entreate him to be a meanes to deliuer Zizimi vnto
him, promising by this meanes that Christendome should be reuenged

and bloudy battell of Varna: Let vs stay our eyes vpon the excellent

chiefe of his seruants, and from that time he resolued to be reuenged,
but hatching his reuenge vnder a faigned forgetfulnesse, hee
sware to Temisvuar vpon the Sacrament neuer to remember it, and
for a greater proofe of his loue he presented him with a robe of
Scarlet embroidered with Gold: hee caused Ladislaus and Mathias
to come to Buda, vnder colour to giue vnto Ladislaus a charge for
the execution of a great designe, and the conduct of a mighty Army
against the Turke, and to Mathias the place of Liuetenant
generall of the Realme. They went rashly, not considering how
their father had sometimes aduised them not to trust an incensed
Prince.Two brethren which thinke they haue offended a Prince, should not suffer themselues to be taken together. The King not thinking himselfe bound to hold his word

misfortune) answered; That if he were a King, he would cause their
wickednesse to be punished after another manner. These two brethren
did serue for an example to reason, which assures how dangerous a
thing it is to trust a Prince that is yong, powerfull, offended, and ill
aduised. He did not long enioy this reuenge, for soone after being
at Prague he was poisoned by a Lady, incensed for that he had left
her to marry Magdaline daughter to King Charles the seuenth.

word, and opinions are like vnto peeces of coine, which although
they be scarce currant, yet are accounted so if they haue course. Resolutions
which are taken in such assemblies are not alwaies grounded
vpon the knowledge of that which is, but of that which is maintained
to be: He caused them which had the authority, to say that
Hungary could not be without a King, & that they could not chuse
a better then Mathias: That if the Election might not be done willingly,
he was there to haue him crowned by force, and saying those
words he drew out his Cimeterre, which he sware not to sheath
againe vntill a resolution were taken conformable to his.

of Hungary said, that they should not loose any time to seek
another Prince,It is easy for the sonne to mount to honors when as he finds that his father hath prepared the way. and that they would not desire one better known,
more generous, nor of a better Race: Finally, they declared him
King of Hungary.
            The aduice of this Election was carried speedily to George Poguebrac,
King of Bohemia, who was at supper, Mathias sitting at the
lower end of the table, hauig read the letter, he caused him to come
and sit aboue him;To go from a prison to a royalty, from great misery to a supreme honour, are the effects of GODS Prouidence and bounty, who rayseth the humble and throwes downe the proud. 
               Mathias was much amazed, his condition made
him to dobut that which he vnderstood not, and his thoughts were
obscured with the variety of false immaginations. After supper Poeguebrac
told him what had hapened, saluteth him & embraceth him
as king of Hungary, and entreateth him to loue him as his brother;
Mathias promiseth it, and their promises were confirmed by his
marriage with Katherine, daughter to Poguebrac, with whom hee
caused him to be conducted into Hungary.
            He beganne to triumph as soone as to raigne, for to fight & vanquish
was all one vnto him. At one time being followed by his
owne forces, which were greater in courage and discipline then in
number,These three qualities were eminent in Iohn Huniades, Valiant, Wise, and Generous, Ducum omnium (saith the History) qui cum Turcis arma contulerunt illotempore cla

Of all Commanders which had made warre against the Turke, hee was at that time the most famous; watchfull to fore-see, patient in expecting, swift in embracing, resolute in pursuing all occasions, and happy in effecting them. He did gloriously end three great enterprises, the one
against the Emperour Fredericke, whom he forced to yeeld him that
which he held of the Crowne of Hungary; the second against the
Bohemians, whose factions and conspiracies he ouerthrew, and the
third against Mahomet the 2. to whom he gaue many occasions to
think that the valour, conduct, and generosity of Iohn Huniades his
father were reuiued in him.

assaults seized vpon Zerbenic, where are those goodly Mines of

burnt, and ruined Romansarre. The flames of the fire of his
Iustice, did amaze all Moldauia: all the furies came out of Hell to
follow his Armie, and to reuenge the iniuries of Christendome
vpon those Infidell Prouinces. A warre which was all cruelty, and
a cruelty which was all iustice; victory which is alwayes insolent,
and especially in ciuill warres,Pitty nor Mederation doe not alwayes purchase fauour in a Conquerours heart, they are forced somtimes to giue place vnto liberty, and therefore Tully saith, that victoria ciuilib▪ bellis sēper est insolens, Victory is alwayes insolent in ciuill warres. had no pitty, but of those which
had no more need: he had rather ruine Towns to saue soules, then
to saue Townes, and ruine soules: he left in all places, such markes
of the furies and terrors of the warre, that euen at this day the
Countrey laments the effects, and numbers the examples. That
which the sword did spare, was consumed by fire and famine.
            And therfore the name of Mathias was at that time a terror to the
Women and Children of Hungary,His valour & conduct who in all occasions performing
the duty of a Generall, and yet somtimes running the hazard
of a Souldier, as if his body had bin borrowed; he was wounded
in the thigh with an arrow. He did so diminish the number of
his enemies, as the prouince was assured, and his Armie rich with
spoyles.
                  Mathias is taxed with ingratitude, for that hee had made warre aagainst George King of Bohemia, who had giuen him liberty, and his daughter in marriage. This warre was vnfortunate to either, and preiudiciall to Christendome.
            
            Being returned to Agria, he came to Buda, where he receiued
letters of intreaty from Pope Pius the second, and from the Emperour
Fredericke to make warre against the Hussits, the which he vndertooke.He makes warre against the Hussites.
It was not his only obedience to the head of the Church
which drew him to this warre, nor any desire to triumph ouer the
truth, ambition had a great share in it, the desire of a newe
Crowne made him forget the good vsage which he had receiued
in his imprisonment from Poguebrac, and dispensed him of those
bonds which cannot bee dissolued by death, nor discharged but
by life. Great enterprises are not scrupulous, and if the lawes of
piety are to be violated, it is to content those of ambition. They
write that these two Kings made warre ten yeares,
                  MATHIAS King of Hungary, and GEORGE, King of Bohemia, made warre tenne yeares for Religion; And in tbe end they agreed, that his Religion should be the better, whose Foole did vanquish the other at fist. and that the
combat of their Iesters, fighting at fists, reconciled them. In the
end Mathias dispossessed George Poguebrac of the prouinces of Morauia,
Silesia, and Lusatia, and death of his Crowne.
            
               Mathias caused himselfe to be proclaimed and crowned King of
Bohemia,
                  Mathias crowned King of Bohemia. and Marques of Morauia. Some Bohemians refused to
obey him, and framed a faction vnder the name of Ladislaus, son
to Casimir, King of Polonia, whom they did acknowledge for
their King. Mathias came thither, and prest them so eagerly, and
intreated them with such rigor and seuerity, as all the Townes

submitted themselues to his will, to haue his peace and pardon:
These long and and troublesome warres had so wâsted his treasure,
as hee was forced to make vse of the Clergy goods. The Prelates
of Hungary opposed themselues, and the chiefe Noble-men
of the Realme ioyned with them,This conspiracy was so stro

force might doe; now hee shewes himselfe so wife and temperate,
as returning into the way of the duety of a good Prince, he doth
easily reduce his people to that of good subiects:That Prince is wise which doth not disdaine to giue some satisfaction to his subiects whom he hath offended, especially when he feares a greater mischiefe. And by this
meanes many who had cast themselues into his enemies Armie,
returned vnto him. Ladislaus beeing coopt vp in Nitria, was
forced to make an Accord with Mathias, and to returne into
Poland.
            
               Casimir his father apprehending this shamfull retreat, and taking
his part of the Affront, reserued the whole reuenge to himselfe;
hee leuied an Armie of threescore thousand fighting men, Polonians,
Bohemians, Russians and Tartarians, and entred into Morauia
and Silesia, to recouer that which Poguebrac had lost. The
first beginnings were so fauourable, as not regarding the inconstancy
of fortune, he suffered his thoughts to wander in the common
error of Princes, who neglect the storme, during the calme of
their affaires.In great designes Princes thinke on

                  y what they should doe when they haue executed them, & cast not their eyes vpon that which may hinder the execution, and which as Polybius saith, hath neede of great prouidence Polyb. lib. 11.
               
            
            
               Mathias held it not fit for his reputation nor courage to attend
them, hee goes to meete them with eight thousand horse, and hauing
furnished the Towne of Vratislauia with victuals and munition,
he lodged himselfe in the sub-vrbs, and there attendeth them
with a resolution not to hazard any thing.A Prince shold not stay vntil his enemy come vnto him, and force him to feed him at his charge. Euery day they made
Sallies and Skirmishes to the Polonians losse, who neuer returned
but with griefe for some prisoners taken, but many more
slaine. And to shew that hee did little esteeme their Attempts,
and that hee could loose little, and get much, he caused scaffolds
of Wood to bee built vpon the Walles for the chiefe Ladies
and Gentlewomen of the Towne,It is a great aduantage for a Generall of an Army, when hee is assured that victory brings him great profit & great effects, and that the losse cannot equal the gaine. and for those chiefly who were
not made but to bee beloued. They beheld the Knights who
made Sallies vpon their Enemies, and cast themselues couragiously
into dangers for their sakes. At their returne they commended
their valours, and encouraged them to continue. If they
were hurt, they were the first that drest them, if they returnd victors,
they presented them the prisoners Armes and colours which they
had taken.
            The Princes of Germany desiring to diuert this storme, and fearing
that this fire, kindled vpon the Frontier, would flye further, laboured
to quench it: Ernestus, Duke and Elector of Saxony, and
Iohn, Marques of Brandebourg,The courages of these 3 Princes were vanquished by the eloquence of the Marques of Brādeburg, who in the Assembly of three Kings, of Casimir, King of Polonia; Ladislaus, King of Bohemia, and Mathias King of Hungry, discoursed with such grauity and vehemency, vt prae admiratione adstantes obstupuerint.

horse, and presented themselues before Vratislauia, protesting
that they came thither to no other end, but to set vpon him that
would not liue in peace. So by their meanes a peace was concluded
the 12. of February, in the yeare 1475. and Silesia was diuided
betwixt Ladislaus and Mathias.
               
                  Mathias makes war against the Emperour
            
            This war being ended, he began an other against the Emperour,
he besieged Bohemia, and forst the Emperour to demand a peace.
Pope Sixtus, and the Senate of Venice (for that they would not incense
the Emperour) tooke from him the pensions which they had
giuen him, to the end that the Emperour should not think that they
fauoured his designes;Death of Mathias Huniades.
                yet for all this Mathias did not forbeare to
presse the Emperour to effect that which he had promised him; &
seeing that hee thought to entertaine him with the vanity of his
words, hee began the warre againe, and besieged and tooke Hambourg
vpon the confines of Austria and Hungary.
            
               Mahomet thinking to make his profit of this diuision, ouer-ran the
Countries of Dalmatia, Carinthia and Friuly, and carried away a
great number of slaues; but they were set at liberty, and they that
led them cut in peeces, being incountred by Mathias Captaines.The portrait of of

The Emperour Fredericke sought a peace of him; the which taking
no effect, there was a truce concluded. Soone after Mathias
               Hee that hath written the History of the kings of Hungary, ends the discourse of Mathias life in these tearmes: In somma non si può diro altro di vantagio: se non ch'e vanita il persuadersi, che altre personnagio si trouasse alhora in tutte lc parti pareggiante l'inuitto & glorioso Matthia Coruino: se l'ambitione d'vna principessa Aragonesse non lo hauesse tyrannegiato. To conclude, there can bee no more said, but that it is a vanity to think that there can bee any one sound comparable to the inuincible and glorious Mathias Coruinus: if the ambition of a Princesse of Arragon had not tyrannized ouer him. died
at Vienna in Austria of an Apoplexie, in the yeare 1490. being 47.
yeares old. He had taken to his second wife, Beatrix daughter to
Ferdinand, King of Naples, by whom he had not any children, suffering
himselfe to be transported with her ambitious humors, enemies
to all rest.
            The commendation which is giuen him of a great Prince, and a
great Captaine, doth not blemish that to haue made the Sciences
and learning to flourish againe, and to haue fauoured them that
made profession thereof, and among others, Iohn of Monroyall,
the Ornament of the Mathematickes: He replenished his library
with the rarest bookes hee could finde, out of the which are come
some fragments of Polybius, and Diodorus Siculus.
               A Prince which affects glory, esteemes them that are the Trumpets. The most valiant haue done things worthy to be written, and haue written things worthy to be read, Corn. Sulla, Caesar, Augustus, Claudius, Traian. Adrian.
                If after the death
of Mahomet they had put Zizimi into his hands, as he desired and
besought the Pope, he had ouer-throwne the tyranny of the Ottomans:
for Bajazeth vpon these apprehensions, sought to be at peace
with him; but the Pope would haue him make warre against the
Hussites of Bohemia.
            Let vs returne and see what Lewis doth in his sad & melancholike
thoughts of that day which must bee the Iudge of all the rest: he
hath giuen an end to all his designes, and the law of Nature will
haue him end: he
                  •
                doth not liue but by intreaty, and the dayes
which remaine serue onely but to the end he should husband them
that they might profite those which hee hath past and lost. His
Seruants comfort him, and his Physitians haue no meanes

to cure him: they entertaine him with vaine hopes, and diuert his
thoughts from any thing that might augment his waywardnesse:
And for that they told him, that a Northerly winde, which did
then reigne, made mens bodies sickly, and did hurt the fruits, he
commanded the Parisians to goe in Procession to S. Denis, to cause
it to cease.The Chronicle saithn, that to appea this, Northerly winde, all the Estates of Paris went diuers dayes in procession to S. Denis in the moneth of February, & that the same prayers were made in May following for the kings health.
            
            But he was more troubled with distrust:Distrust of Lewis 11.
                It is a torment vnto him,
in comparison whereof all his other afflictions seeme light: Hee
feares his sonne should deale with him, as he had done with Charles
the seuenth his father, and that he would bee the head of a faction.
When as Peter, Duke of Bourbon his son-in-law, entred into his
chamber, he would see if they of his traine were not armed. Hee
liued in as great feare amongst his owne followers, as a passenger
can doe in a thicke Forrest which is haunted with Theeues and
Murderers.The Prince is happy which distrusteth not his subiects, but can sleep safely with them, yea among the woods, as Eberhard, Duke of Wittemberg said.
            
            Hee feareth lest they should aduance his dayes, that the old factions
would reuiue: In former times hee dissembled all, now hee
distrusts all; he doth not remember what was past, but to be reuenged
of offences: he doubts his son-in-law, distrusts his daughter,
and feares his sonne. And to the end the weakenesse of his minde
should not bee iudged by the indisposition of his body; and to
make it knowne that they be not the legges,Authority and Seuerity should support the contempt of olde age: the Empeperour Seuerus being full of the gout, the great men of his Count contemned him, and gaue the Title of Emperour vnto his sonne: Seuerus caused himselfe to bee carried vnto the Pallace, and commanded those proo

                but the minde which
commaundes and reignes, hee makes diuers Ordonances, which
make the people thinke that they cannot come but from a sound
iudgement, and a firme and vigorous disposition: for although
that these desires seemed to haue ridiculous causes, yet they proceede
from a great and constant resolution to end his life in
action.
            But he was no more but a walking Anatomy, and euery man
wondred how hee could liue▪ 
               Philip de Commines saith, that in the
voyages which hee made to diuers places after his first sickenesse
at the Forges of Chinon, His great Heart carried him. Now hee
hath not any about him but two or three men of base condition,
and bad fame, who after his death were presently chased from
Court: hee did often change the Groome of his Chamber, and
all other sorts of seruants; and to excuse this change, hee said, that
it was one of the pleasures of nature. Hee did not suffer them to
speake vnto him of any Affaires, but such as could not bee
dispatched but by his Commaundement. A Prince in his perfect
health should not bee troubled nor importuned with euery
thing.Whilest that a Prince busieth his head about matters of small consequence, the most important passe away and are forgotten. It is not fit to trouble a prince with all sorts of Affaires, nor to binde him to play the part of a Chauncellor or President.

extraordinary, and did things which the originall calleth strange.

            It seemeth that Philip de Commines doth great wrong vnto the
memory and courage of such a Prince, when hee saith, that neuer
man feared death so much, or did so many things to thinke to auoid
it; and who in the apprehensions he had that they would aduance
it, he neither trusted sonne, daughter, nor son-in-law: what
a madnesse, to offend Nature to auoid that which shee hath ordained?

            They told him, that in Calabria there liued one called Francis
of Paulo, an Hermite of an admirable holinesse and austerity of
life; who did great miracles: he neuer ceased vntill he had obtained
leaue from the Pope to draw him into France, thinking that
by his presence and prayers he might prolong Life, and recoile
Death. This holy man had not purchased the reputation of sanctity
by false Titles: he had made profession from his Infancie
                  Francis of Paulo borne of meane parentage, profest himselfe an Hermite from his youth. Hee went out of his Hermitage to build a little Church neere vnto Paulo, where hee layd the first foundations of his Order vpon humility, calling them Minimes that shold make profession, and vpon austerity, binding them by a fourth vow to a

incredible humility and austerity of life. God had giuen him the
gift of Prophesie, and had vsed his hands to make his power
knowne. He had past the straight of Sicile vpon his Cloke spred
vpon the Waues, the Maister of the Barke refusing to receiue
him, and reiecting him as an vnprofitable burthen. The King sent
men expresly to Naples to haue him come: hee past by Rome,
where he was honoured of all men for the holinesse of his life. Entring
into the Kings Chamber, hee cast himselfe at his feet, intreating
him to prolong his dayes: he would willingly haue had the
Sunne descend ten degrees, and the shadowes of his Diall to haue
gone backe▪ 
               Philip de Commines doth not report the Answere of
this Hermite, and hath depriued vs of so iust a curiosity, hee
saith onely, That hee answered as a wise Man should doe. Hee went
not with that ostentation which we finde in them that are learned:
for hee was such a one as Saint Francis desired his Religious men,
should bee more skilfull to pray then to reade,Francis of Assise said, that hee had rather haue his religious men skilfull in praying then in reading. hee had a
sweete, pleasing, and easie speech, and his language was Italian,
not common, or much knowne vnto the French, which made him
to bee admired. Wee must beleeue, that this light of the Spirit

            God did much fauour this Prince, to send him a man of this
condition to helpe him to dye; who among many great qualities,
necessary to this Office, euen towards such a King, might
speake freely vnto him, without dissembling, or flattery: For
Princes in these extreamities haue need of men which should
not bee like vnto the sonnes of Zebedee, who spake of Scepters
and Honours, when as Christ discoursed of the Crosse: They
must let them know, that the world, and all that is great and admirable
in the world, is vnworthy of the soule, which is not
made for the world, but the world is made for it.The health of the body depends of the soule. The soule (saith Chrysostome) was not made for the body, but the body for the soule, who so neglects the first, and is too carefull of the second, looseth both. That beeing
of a substance exempt from corruption, and by consequence,
from death, cannot haue an obiect disproportionable to her power,
nor can delight in mortall and corruptible things; and being

is Truth, and there is no other Truth, but God. The great
world hath but one sunne, the lesser but one soule, and both haue
but one God.
            This good man vndertooke to make this Prince capable of
two things, the hearing whereof is difficult to men, and Kings are
very hardly taught: to loue God, and to contemne the world. The
world entertaines their minde with so many things which men
think worthy of loue, as they cannot lodge any other affection in
their hearts, and do not thinke of the loue wherewith the Angels
liue and burne, being the fire of the Intellectuall world, as the Sun
is of the coelestiall, and the Elementary of ours. Princes in stead of
louing God, loue themselues, they finde that all is made for them,
they dispose so absolutely of all the beauties and pleasures of the
world, as they desire no other: they haue vnder their powers so
many great and goodly spirits, as they haue no will to change their
abode, to see them of the other world;One demaunded of Cercidas the Megapolitaine if hee dyed willingly. Why not, said hee▪ For after my death I shall see those great men, Pythagoras among the Phylosophers, Hecateus among the Historians, Homer among the Poets, and Olympus among the Musitians. Ael. lib. 13. de Var. Hist.
                all is made for them, nothing
is spoken against them: for them the fish cut the waues, the
birds beate the aire, beasts march vpon the earth, and men runne,

toyle, sweat and kill themselues; wherefore when in the end conscience
commands them to raise their thoughts towards the place
whither their face is turned, to mount towards their beginning, to
breathe nothing but eternity, to contemne the fumes of the world,
and to admire the light of Heauen, they haue their heads so heauy,
and their eyes so dazled, as they cannot vnderstand, that Hee
that loueth the world, the loue of God is not in him. They eye cannot, at
one instant, bohold both heauen and earth.
            The exhortations of Francis de Paulo did cast some seeds of the
loue of God into this Princes heart; but the cares of the world
were the birds which carried it away, and did smother it in the
thornes of affaires. The fruits of a slow piety, which doth flourish
but in the Winter of mans life, doe neuer ripe well. It must bee
manured in due time:That piety comes late when it hath not recourse to God, but at need. Byon had vanquished Athens, & had poysoned many spirits with the impiety of Theodorus, his maister being reduced in the end to languish of a great infirmity, hee began to acknowledge, that there were Gods, but it was to cure him. A mad man (said be that writ his life) not to beleeue that there were Gods, but whē he had need of their helpe. Diog. Laert. lib. 4.
                the same God which would haue fire
burning alwayes vpon his Altar, will that fire burne continually
in a Princes Heart. It was sometime kindled well in that
of Lewis, but the first winde of worldly affaires blew it away.
            His heart had good inclinations when as necessity and afflictions
prest it; but hee suffered them to wither at the first
Sunne-shine of prosperity. A mischiefe which is naturall to the
fragilitie of men, who doe no good, but for the feare of euill,
and make themselues voluntary slaues to things whereunto they
should command, and which are made for them▪ There is not
any man but would blush at the reproach which his owne conscience
may giue him, that if hee had giuen him the tenth part of
the time which he hath imployed for his flesh, it should bee much
better.This reproch is like vnto that of Marcus Varro, in his Satyrs. Si quantum operae sumpsisti vt tuus pistor bonum faceret panem, eius duodecimam Philosophiae dedisse tempore bonus iampridem esses factus. If thou hadst spent but the twelfth part of that time in philosophy which thou didst to haue thy Baker make good bread thou hadst in time been made a good man.
            
            
               Lewis then following the first traine of his life, seemed to haue
more Deuotion then Conscience, more trembling with superstition
then constant in Piety,
                  Alexander was strooke with this infirmity, who hauing liued impiously, dyed superstitiously. A. his death there was none seene about him but Diuines and South-sayers, who made prodigies of the lightest things. more desirous of the health of
his body, then of his soule: for hauing made a prayer vnto Saint
Eutropeus to recommende vnto him the one and the other,
Claudius of Seissell said, that hee caused the word Soule to bee
put out, saying; That it was sufficient if the Saint made him to
haue corporall health without importuning him with so many
things.
            Hee was growne so confident that his holy man would
cure him, as hee still sent to Plessis to tell him, that it consisted
onely in him to prolong his life: The more hee trusted this
good man, the more he distrusted all his seruants.Such extraordinary guards and distrusts were not without cause: for as Phil. de Commines saith, some had an intent to enter into Plessis, and to dispatch matters as they thought good, for that there was nothing dispatched; but they durst not attempt it, wherein they did wisely, for there was good order taken. The Castle was
well guarded, the Walles were fortified with great barres of Iron.
The guard stood Centinell in the Ditches, hauing command to
shoot at any one that should aproch before the gates were opened

Hee would willingly haue drawne the ladder after him going to
bed: hee daily changed his seruants, and depended vpon the
austere humors of Iohn Cottiere his Physitian, to whom hee gaue
monethly ten thousand Crownes, not daring to refuse him any
thing, and promising whatsoeuer hee desired, so as hee would
chase away that fearfull apparition

hee shrunke downe betwixt the sheetes. This Physitian did
sometimes braue him, saying; I know well, that one of these mornings
you will chase me away as you haue done others; but I sweare by God, you
shall not liue eight dayes after. This poore Prince in stead of vsing
him as Maximin did his,
                  Maximin the Emperour commanded his physitions to be slain for that they could not cure his wounds. gaue him whatsoeuer he would, Bishopprickes,
Benefices, and Offices. The holy man of Calabria on the
other side watcht, fasted, and prayed continually for the King, neither
was it euer possible to diuert him from the thoughts of his pouerty.
The King could not giue enough to the one, and could not
force the other to receiue any thing.
                  Antipather King of Macedon said, that be had two friends at Athens, Phocian & Demades, The one hee could neuer content with giuing, and the other he could neuer moue to receiue any thing that bee offered him. Plut.

had not any in his Court, but his Physitian and maister Oliuer.
Euery man began to bee weary of this solitarinesse. The French
desire to see, and to presse neere their King: They doe not
Court it in vaine, and doe not serue an inuisible maister: Hee
ordained diuers businesses, both within and without the Realme,
sending to fetch diuers things out of farre Countreyes for ostentation
and rarenesse;The more rare and vnknowne things that Princes haue, the more apparant is their greatnesse, and therefore they cause many beasts to bee kept for shew, as Tygres, Lyons, and Ounces. as little Lyons in Affricke, Rayne-Deere
and Buffes in Sweathland and Denmarke, Allans in Spaine,
Mules from Sicile, and little Grey-houndes out of Brittanie:
Hee changed his Officers, cashiered his Captaines, tooke away
their pensions, and all to bee spoken of, fearing they should hold
him to be dead, although it bee very hard to conceale the death
of a great King.There is nothing can bee lesse concealed then the death of a prince. They might say of his designes, as Stratonicus
did of the Rhodians buildings: That he vndertooke things
as if hee had beene Immortall: for hee feared, that in doing
nothing, the people would bee curious to know what hee did,
not apprehending so much the hatred of his subiects as their contempt.
                  Stratonicus said, that the Rhodians did

            In these last and extreame languishings hee caused the peace to
be proclaimed at Paris,Publication of the peace. as the Archduke had done at Brussels: for
it had bin said, that it should be published in the Courts of Parliament
of France, and in the chiefe Townes vnder the Archdukes obedience,
and sworne by the Abbots, Prelats and Noblemen of the
countries of Artois & Burgondy, to the end it might be known that it

was not onely made with the Princes to continue during their
liues, but with the Princes and people. The Princesse Margaret

to Duke Phillip. The Earle of Beaujeu, and the Lady Anne of
France his wife receiued her, and conducted her to Amboise
whereas as the Dauphin was: Shee made her entry into Paris in
the beginning of Iune, and was married in Iuly.
            
               The Chronicle reports the pompe of this entry in these termes.
On Monday the second of Iune,Entry of the Lady Dauphin into Paris. about fine of the clocke in the euening,
the Lady Dauphin made her entry into Paris, being accompanied by the
Lady of Beaujeu and the Admirals wife, with other Ladies and Gentlewomen,
and they entred by Saint Dennis gate, whereas were prepared
for her comming three goodly Scaffolds; in the one, and the highest, was
a personage representing the King, as Soueraigne; On the second were
two goodly children, a sonne and a daughter, attired in white Dammaske,
representing the said Dauphin, and the Lady of Flanders; and
in the other vnderneath, were the personages of the Lord of Beaujeu,
and of the Lady his wife; and of either side of the said Personages
were the Armes of the said Lords and Ladies: There were also
foure personages, one of the Husbandmen, another of the Clergy, the
third of Marchandize, and the last of the Nobility, euery of which
made a short speech at her entry.
            The marriage being celebrated at Paris, whereunto all the
chiefe Townes of the Realme were inuited, The King would
haue his sonne returne to Amboise, not holding if fit that this new
Sonne should rise before the West of his life. This great reioycing
of all France did but augment his heauinesse, to see himselfe
forced to quit the place vnto his sonne: All the helpes which the
Art of man could inuent were imployed: He caused the holy Oile
to be brought,This Vyall of holy Oile was seene by Philip de Commines vpon the Cupbord in the Kings Chamber, at Plessis, at the houre of his death. Others baue written that the gaue vp the Ghost as it arriued. the Clergy of Paris, the Court of Parliament,
the Vniuersity, and other Companies, went in Procession, the last
day of Iuly 1483. to meete it at Saint Anthonies in the field, it was
lodged that night in the holy Chappell, and the next day passed
on, and was followed with the same company vnto our Lady in
the fields. Phillip de Commines saith, that he had an intent to take
the like vnction that he did at his Coronation: Others haue written
that it was to know the declining of his life, for when the King
is dead, it is empty, and filleth againe miraculously for the Coronation
of a new.
            On Monday, the 25. of August, he fell into that extremity of
sickenesse which ended his daies,Last actions of Lewis the eleuenth. and forced him to acknowledge
himselfe, not onely mortall and dying, but as death: At that time
he sent vnto his sonne, all such as came to see him, saying vnto
them: Go vnto my sonne, your King, serue him well: giuing to euery
one some charge to deliuer vnto him, but most confidently to
Stephen de Vers, Baliffe of Meaux, who had bene his Gouernour:
He sent vnto him also his chiefe Officers, the Chancellour with
his Seales, and all his traine, the Captaines and Archers of his

Guard, his Hunts-men and Faulkeners. But his intent was not to
suffer them long there, if hee recouered his health as assuredly as
he felt his courage firme, and his iudgement strong, the braine
not being troubled with the maligne fumes of his infirmity, for he
had a continuall loosenesse: So wee see that the soule in this seperation

            Soone after hee fell into great faintings, which made him to
loose his speech, but he recouered it, to will the Duke of Bourbon
to go vnto the King his sonne, and that hee should haue a care of
him,Commandements extraordinary of the King. charging him with many extraordinarie things, the which
had caused terrible accidents if they had encountred a froward and
difficult spirit: Philip de Commines in this place speakes what hee
thinkes good, and confirmeth his opinion by the euents, Hee gaue
him all the charge and gouernement of the King, and commanded him
that some men should not come neere him, telling him many good and
not able causes, and if the Lord of Beaujeu had obserued his commandements
in euery point (or at least in part, for there were some extraordinary
cōmandements which were not to be kept) & that in the generality be
had obserued thē better, I think it had been profitable both for the Realme
and himselfe, considering those things which haue since happened.

            This commandement of the King incountering a spirit, which
was milde, tractable, and temperate, had not the effects it should
haue had. Bounty, and mildenesse are sometimes negligent in
matters which require heate, and quickenesse. This Prince was one
of the best of his age, being nothing but mildenesse and courtesie.
The more rare these qualities are in Princes,Humility and courtesie are goodly qualities in great men: Humanitas tam clara in imperatore quam rara est. Nam quum indiscreta felicium predissequa sit superbia, vix cuiquam contingit & abundare fortuna & indigere arrogantia.

                   to fortune, it seldome happens that any one abounds with good fortune and wants arrogancy: The which was alwaies so hatefull to our fore-fathers, as they held contempt more grieuous then seruitude. Lat. Pac. Pan.
                the more excellent
they are: arrogancy neuer faileth in them who haue no wants,
and pride doth alwaies follow felicity: It is a miracle to see a
great Prince, courteous, milde, and affable. Rome found not
any Surname more odious, for the last of her Kings, then that of
Proud, and comprehended in that word all the vices, for the which
she changed the forme of her gouernment, and supprest the Royalty
in despite of the King; Yet the mildenesse and facillity of this
Prince gaue a great foundation to the troubles which happened for
the Regency of the Realme.

must he be content that she present her selfe, and that she take his
Crowne from his head, as she hath done the Armes, Club, Scepter,
and Sword out of the hands of Achilles, Hercules, Alexander,
and Caesar: They that had charge of his conscience, expected
when he himselfe finding his strength to faile would acknowledge
it. The resolution to signifie this iudgement vnto him, was taken
betwixt a Diuine, his Physition, and Maister Oliuer: They went
roughly unto him, and with small respect, like vnto men which
had added impudencie to the basenesse of their condition, there
speech was after this manner:Indiscretion of thē that speaks to Lewis the 11. of death. 
               Sir, wee must discharge our consciences,
hope no more in this holy man nor in any other thing, for vndoubtedly
you are a dead man, thinke of your conscience, for there is
no remedy: Euery man spake something briefly, to let him know
that they were all of one accord concerning his death: He answered,
I hope that God will helpe mee; and the flesh desiring to deceiue
the Spirit by a vaine confidence of her forces, and to declare
herselfe openly against the constancy and resolution, which this
last point of life required of him, to make them iudge of his courage,
she made him say, I am not, it may be, so sicke as you thinke: Being
halfe dead he counterfeits himselfe whole; The spirit, body, &
forces faile him, onely dissembling holdeth good: Hee desired rather
to weare in languishing, then couragiously to breake in sunder
the chaine which (although he were a great Prince) held him in
the seruitude of life.
                  Lewis hath had great resemblances in his raigne, and in his life, to the

death
                  Tiberius did all he could to conceale his death, it being bruited abroad Caligula thought to enter into the Empire, but behold the dead man demanded meate, and his successour began to quake for feare: Macro who had beene one of his fauourits, seeing him to continue too long, caused him to be smothered with couerings.

fainting: They that were about him held him for dead, and euery
man thought of his owne priuate affaires: But behold sodainely
the dead man called for meate, they saw him reuiue in an instant
hauing a plaine speech, a firme vnderstanding, and a iudgement
such as in the vigour of his age, disposing of many things
for the good of his Estate, as if this fainting of his bodily force
had beene nothing but to suffer his spirit to meditate: saying;
Tell Des Cordes that hee giue ouer the enterprise which wee haue

made so many vowes vnto her, and had receiued such visible effects
of her intercession, as he would haue her Temple the depositary of
his bones.

thought that he should haue continued vntill the next day, yet hee

branch of the Kings of France, but he liued little,I thinke, saith Phillip de Commines, that from his infancy, he neuer had but troubles and afflictions vntill his death, and if all the good daies which hee had in his life, wherein he had more ioy and pleasure, then trouble & care, were well numbred, I beleeue there would bee few sound, and that for one of pleasure & ease, their would bee twenty of paine and affliction. hee that hath
beene long at Sea in stormes and tempests, and hath neuer arriued

long in the crosses of this life, cannot say that his life hath
beene long, but that hee hath continued long in the waues of

            Hee dyed not with this griefe, not to haue done any thing in the
world, he that in dying carryeth no other marke of his being, but
old age, departeth shamefully out of this life: Lewis the 11. left it
not with that remorse to haue beene idle, & to haue let the torrent
of age slip away, without retaining some-thingOf running water there is nothing kept but what is drawne forth to vse; In like manner of the course of life, there remaineth nothing but what vertue reserueth for glory to haue liued: Tantum habes à currente flumine quant

liue, and to repent to haue liued, when he had attained vnto it, he
would willingly haue kept backe that tearme, in the which nature
by the great infirmities wherewith hee was brought low, chased
him out of this life, not as from a Ship-wracke, but as out of
an Inne where hee had made good cheere.
                  Themistius compares the death of old mē, to the going out of an Inne, and that of yong men to a Shipwracke. In like manner Princes,

fathers heart a Vow neuer to know any other woman but the

foure hundred three score and foureteene: This losse caused him
to shut himselfe vp for some few daies, in the Castle of Amboise,
refusing to see or to bee seene of any, not considering that
Kings children were men borne in the cries and groanes of their
mothers, and bewayling their owne miseries like to other men.

                  Stratonicus an Artificer of Athens, hearing that the mother of Timotheus cryed out at her deliuery, said; How wold she haue cryed, if she had made an Artificer? Hee mocked at that common slattery, which spake of Kings children, as of the children of the Gods. Atheneus.

and comforted by this reason: That the thing which

               Anne
was betrothed to Nicholas Marquesse of Pont, Grand-childe
to René Duke of Anjou, but hee did not marry her, for the
Duke of Bourgundy being iealous of this Alliance propounded
vnto him the marriage of Mary, his onely daughter, to
draw him by this vaine hope, from the seruice of this Crowne:
Shee was married to Peter of Bourbon, Ioane his third
to daughter was married to Lewis the twelfth, and put away in
the first yeare of his raigne: So as finding her selfe hatefull
vnto her husband, and vnpleasing to many, shee left the world:
Being vnmarried she wedded herselfe to solitarinesse, the which shee had desired all her life: In her Infancy, the King demanded of her of what Order shee would haue her Confessour, and shee made choice of the Gardien of the Franciscan Fryers at Amboise. Her father loued her not, for that Nature had giuen him cause to
complaine of her deformity, hauing not ingrauen any makes of
her fauours, neither vpon her face nor on her person, for she was
blacke, little, and crooked:Beauty, is a peece of so great recommendation, as they that are not fauored there-with, are lesse pleasing euē to them that by Nature should loue them. The Signior of Lesguiere her
Gouernour did hide her often vnder his Gowne, when as the
King met her, to the end hee should not bee troubled with
the sight of her. The hatred of King Lewis the eleuenth, her father,
the death of Charles the eighth, her brother, and the diuorce
of King Lewis the twelfth, her husband, changed all the sweetenesse
of her life into the bitternesse of the Crosse, and imbarkt
her as in a tempestuous Sea, whereas shee found no other
Port but that of death. The children of great men to become
the children of God, are bound to drinke of the cuppe

of afflictionHappy are those paines and afflictions which are to amend & saue, not to ruine & destroy the afflicted: The Crosse is the marke of the Cittizens of heauen, they whom the hand of God disdlaines to strike, are such as he disdaines to amend. as well as the meanest. The way to heauen is full
of Thornes: The flaming sword appeared at the entring of
Paradice: The Land promised to the faithfull aboundeth with
plenty of Milke and Honny: Milke is first bloud before Milke;
Honny is drawne from bitter flowers, Roses grow among
Thornes.
            Her husband loued her not,Cause of the dissolution of the marriage of Lewis the twelfth. and yet during the time of his
imprisonment in the great tower of Bourges, he receiued no other
succour, nor assistance but from this Princesse. The cause of
their Diuorce was Sterrility, and want of consent in marriage.
CLAVDIVS of Seyssell saith that hee gaue her vnto him, to
the end that sterrility, and barrenesse, might depriue him of
all meanes to haue children, so much he hated and abhorred the
Bloud Royall.The cause of this diuorce was fterility, and want of consent in marriage: Lewis declaring that King Lewis the 11. had forced him to marry her.
            
            Her consolation was in this solitarinesse, for that shee recouered
the liberty which shee had long desired: The King gaue
her the Dutchy of Berry for her portion, the Towne of Bourges
was her retreate, with a yeerely pension of one thousand two hundred
pounds Sterling. Shee made the Order of the Religious of
the Annunciado, otherwise called the Order of the Virgin Mary,
the which was allowed and confirmed by Pope Alexander the
sixth, in the yeare one thousand fiue hundred and one, and shee
caused the Monastery of Saint Laurence of Bourges to be built:
The habite of her Religious women is a blew, or skie couloured
Gowne, a white Kercher, and a red Scapulaire, with a Cord of
tenne Knots, signifying the ten Vertues, or Consolations, which
the Virgin Mary had in her lifeThe ten Knots of this Cord had relation first to the purenesse: secondly, to the wisedom; thirdly, to the humility; fourthly, to the faith; fiftly, to the vertue, sixthly, to the praise; seuenthly, to the obedience; eighthly, to the pouerty; ninthly, to the patience; and tenthly, to the pitty of the Virgine Mary.
               : She dyed at Bourges, the fourth
of February, one thousand foure hundred and foure: Her body
was burnt, and the ashes cast into the wind in the first
troubles, when as the Earle of Montgomery tooke the Towne of
Bourges.
            
               Charles his sonne succeeded him at the age of thirteene yeares:
The Histories of those times, speake much of the greatnesse of
his courage, and the weakenesse of his braine: They all agree that
hee neither had any great vnderstanding, nor much wit: Two
great defects in two little words, the which are much dilated in
the actions of his life, whereas wee see that hee attempts lightly,

Secret suggestions and whisperings which circumuent none more then them that giue eare vnto them.

               : If the felicity of an estate dependeth
of obedience, if to obey well depends of commanding well, if to
command well depends of a Princes wisedome, what good cōmandement
can be expected from a Prince, who neither hath a sound

iudgment, nor hath gotten any thing to make it better? What hope
is there that hee shall euer be able to command others and himselfe
well?
            After that Philip de Commines hath shewed that hee was touched
with the like feuer of the braine to Charles the seuenth his
Grand-father, and to Lewis the eleuenth his Father, who both
feared their Children; and that for this cause hee soone past ouer
his griefe for the death of the Dauphin his sonne: He addes,
that this Prince was alwaye little,Dispositiō of Charles the eighth both of body and vnderstanding;
but hee was so good, as there was neuer a better creature seene. Claudius
of Seissill saith, That hee was a good Prince, Noble, and of
a greater courage then of body, couetous of honour and glory,
desiring all good and honest things as much as his age
could beare, and that hee failed in the flower of his youth, when
as hee began to vnderstand his owne affaires. Peter Desrey a
Champenois, who hath written his Chronicle, saith; That hauing
past the weaknesse of his first Age, youth gaue great hopes
of more force and vigor of his Spirit, and that hee did exercise
himselfe in the knowledge of many things, which make Princes
learned in the difficult knowledge of all.The knowledge how to reigne and commaund, is the highest and most difficult of all others. Bookes may helpe much, for that they furnish examples whereof the shortnesse of life cannot see the hopes. But a good vnderstanding doth all. The knowledge which comes frō books, may serue for an ornamēt, but not for a foundation. The Phylosophy of Princes is constancy, faith and sincerity, other scyences are but as Paintings, as Plato saith. 
               After the death
of his father (saith this Chronicler) and that hee had taken vpon
him the Royall dignity, he began very willingly to reade bookes written
in the French tongue, and had a desire to vnderstand the Latine;
and to do like a good Prince, hee imployed his youth willingly to serue
God deuoutly, and to heare the councell of wise men, desiring to learne
how to gouerne well.
            
            Notwithstanding that the carelesnesse of Lewis the eleuenth
to haue him Royally instructed, and bred vp, hath ministred occasion
to the most famous Historian of those times, and which
hath beene since, to write that which cannot bee spoken but of
a Prince, ill bred, and worse brought vp: yet let it not displease
him: for this Charles, whom hee giues vs for an Ignorant Man,
is the same whom hee compares vnto Iulius Caesar, for that his
comming and his victory in Italy was but one thing.
                  Carlo condotto ad allogiare al Castel Capoano gia habitatione antica de re Francesi hauendo con marauiglioso corso d'inaudita felicita sopra l'essempio di Iulio Caesare prima vinto

                  he veduto & con tanta facilita che non fusse necessaria in questa espeditione ne spregare maivn padiglione ne rompere mai pur vna lancia. Charles being conducted to lodge in the Castle of Capua, an ancient habitation of the Kings of France, hauing with an admirable course of vnheard of felicity, beyond the example of Iulius Caesar vanquished before hee had seene, and that with so great facility; as in the expedition he had no need either to pitch a Tent, or to breake a Launce.
                For it
is true, that hee strooke more amazement into Italy at the brute
of his comming, then the Gaules had done by their descent in
former times.
            Hee put all the Potentates in alarme, Pisa at liberty, Florence
in feare, and Sienna in iealousie; and hauing the effects
of his desire greater then those of his hopes; hee entred armed
into Rome, with his Launce vpon his Thigh, hee planted his
Cannon on the Market-place, and made himselfe to bee acknowledged and admired of all men for the Deputy of the liuing
God, for the reformation of the disorders of Italy: and
without striking stroake, or pitching any Tent, hee entred a

Conquerour into Naples; and in his returne, hee marched (as it
were) vpon the belly of Italy, being all banded against him, to hinder
his retreate. And although that France hath not reaped the
glory and fruit which shee promised vnto her selfe by this voyage,
it sufficeth that the cause was iust and glorious: for wee must
iudge of things not by the euents and executions, but by the causes
and motions of their wils that haue done them.He that considereth of things by the euents, doth iudge of the whole Image by the heele. In all occasions we must settle our iudgements not vpon the issue & execution but vpon the causes & intentions of them which doe them, and the differences of things.

            This course might haue carried me vnawares to vnfold the
whole part of the Table. Behold (by the grace of God) wee are
come to the banke; It is sufficient to haue written the Fathers
History, leauing the Sonnes to some other. But before wee
end, wee must repasse vnto the Iudgements of the actions
of this Prince. That done, wee will enter into the
great Carriere of the toyles and glory, the Combates
and victories, the Vertue and Fortune
of the greatest Prince that euer
was before or after Lewis
the 11th.

            THE CONTENTS OF
the eleuenth Booke.
            
               1 LIberty of Iudgements vpon the life of Lewis the eleuenth.
               2 A particular examination of his actions, his piety, his deuotions, &
pilgrimages, his good deeds to Churches, his behauiour toward the Pope.
               3 What he was towards King Charles the seuenth his father, towards
his sonne, his wife, and the Princes of his bloud.
               4 Maiesty: The care hee had to preserue the respect: hee did not affect
pompe: who were the chiefe officers of his Crowne: hee is very wary to
confer titles of honor and dignity, he contemnes the mark of maiesty.
               5. Magnificence: The order and expences of his house: he receiues the
Embassadors of forraigne Princes with great state. His buldings.
               6 Clemency: He leaues no offence vnpunished: his Prisons and Cages of
Iron, a rigorous vsage of the Dukes of Alençon and Nemours: Hee
reuengeth old offences which he had receiued before he was King, and
forgets not them of the league: Seuerity in the end makes him fearefull
and distrustfull.
               7 Iustice: He institutes the Parliaments of Bourdeaux and Dijon: hee
loues not the Parliament of Paris: a free and couragious admonition
made by the President La Vacquerie: how chiefe Ministers should
carry themselues to Princes: Of the Kings Audiences.
               8 Wisedome: He was alwayes accompanied with feare, he let slip the occasion
to do his businesse in England and Flanders, he can choose men
and draw forraigne Princes to his deuotion, as the Archduke of Austria,
Cosmo di Medicis, and others; he drew vnto his seruice the
Lord of Lescun, and Creuecoeur, and Philip de Commines. His
tongue offends his wisedome.
               9 Liberality: He is neither couetous nor liberall: he hath formes to giue
which bind much: hee entertaines many Pentioners: his liberality
passeth to excesse, empties his Coffers, driues him to necessity, and to
lay rigorous Impositions vpon the people.
               10 Valour: Proofe of the greatnesse of his courage in diuers encounters,
what care he had of warre. His policie and military discipline.
               11 Knowledge: He had more knowledge of learning & the s
                     •
                  yences, then
other kings his predecessors. The pittifull estate of the profession of
learning vnder his reigne, his Apothegmes and Answeres.
               12 Temperance: Hee had two base daughters: his priuate kind of life:
his domesticke pleasures: his exercises and his confident seruants. Diuers
other obseruations vpon his life and Historie.
            
         
         
            
            ¶THE HISTORY
Of LEWIS the eleuenth.
            THE ELEVENTH BOOKE.
            
               MEN iudge freely of the liues of Princes
after their deaths:Iudgmēts are free after death. the glistering of

                   that the court of the Emperour Iovinian was full of flatterers, said, that then adored the p

                and the Iudgements
which are made, are purged from flattery,
which doth alwayes augment the
good, and diminish the ill which they
do. That King doth greatly binde him
which speakes of his life, when he giues
him no occasion to lye in commending
him: For Princes are neuer so perfect, but Truth may finde
great exceptions in the goodliest qualities of their praises; and before
that the Statue be made perfect, there must much Marble bee
taken away, and the forme exactly sought in the substance. Philip
de Commines saying that hee had seene the greatest Princes of his
time, and in them all there was both good and euill, for that they
were men; he addes for truth, freed from all flattery, That God had
created Lewis the eleuenth more wise, more liberall, and more vertuous
then all they, and that in him there were more things belonging to the
office of a King and Prince, then in any of the other. I haue in a manner
(saith he) seene them all, and knowne what they could doe; wherefore
I deuine not.
            
            This great authority which hee preserued vnto the last gaspe,Liberty of iudgment vpon the life of Lewis 11.
               
and carried into death, was supported by three mighty pillars,
which his owne wisedome had raised, Seuerity, Constancy, and
Reputation.Maiesty is the inuincible f
                     ••
                  t of a Prince, it is better preserued by s

                  uerity, then by too great 
                     〈…〉
                  .
            
            But for that these good soules are like vnto the Mill-dew of the
starres, which looseth much of her purenesse passing by the Regions
of the aire; and by the entrailes of Bees which forme it; and
that the gold of Princes vertues cannot bee drawne absolutely
pure from their liues, being alwayes mixt with diuers strange matters,
we must consider if the piety which was in him, hath retained

nothing of superstition or hypocrisie, his elemency of feare, Iustice
of cruelty, wisedome of subtilty, liberality of prodigality, and
his other goodly qualities of Art and dissimulation. Euery man
may now speake his opinion without feare of displeasing, or
blame of flattery:
                  Praises which are not necessary are best: Neminem magis laudare Imperato
                     •
                  em decet, quam quē minus necesse est. praise may passe on freely, and boldly, without
any other necessity or bond, then the respect which euery man
should haue to preserue the memory of Princes, against the outrages
of slander.
            Posterity, which vnderstands not things, but by the voice of such
whom benefites or offences haue bound to remember them, doth
alwayes receiue flatteries and lies for truth.Flattery or hatred do most cō
                  monly turne an History out of the right way of truth, & therefore Tacitus protests, that they of whom he speakes, are not known vnto him neither by offences done, nor by benefits receiued Mihi Galba, Otho, Vitellius, nec beneficio, nec iniuria cogniti.
                It is fitting in painting
to represent Hanniball and Antigonus halfe-faced, to hide the
eye which they wanted; but a History must shew the whole face, to
the end that Princes may find their owne vices in the portrait of others.
This hath noted them, to shew that there is nothing perfect
in this world; and if the Tapestry of this Princes life bee faire and
pleasing, viewing it on the right side, you shall finde the backe very
much disfigured with knots and seames.
            We must not seeke his Elogies in the Histories of strangers,
                  Buchanan saith, that Lewis 11. Tyrannidem exercebat, practised tyranny; and that there was nothing more common, Quam ex vsu & suis cō
                     modis sine discrimine 
                        •

                      sed precipue agnatis Principibus, then of custome, and for his owne profit, to deceiue any without distinction, especially the Princes of the bloud.
who speake as if God had suffred him to liue for the miserie of the
Common-weale, and the ruine & desolation of the people, whose
fatnesse and good estate he held dangerous for the health of the
whole body; holding for a Maxime, that they should not do ill vnto
the people, nor attend any good of them.
            
               In the end the Chronicle speakes after this manner: This King in
his life time, by reason of some men that were about his person, as Oliuer
the Diuell, called Dain his Barber, Iohn Doyac, and many others,
to whom hee gaue more credit then to any men of his Realme, did during
his Reigne, many Iniustices, wrongs and violences, and had brought
his people so low, as at the time of his death they were almost in despaire.
            All this is nothing but a rough draught of his humours:Plety and Religion of Lewis the 11th.
                To
view the whole Table wee must consider what his Religion and
Piety was towardes God, and his obedience towardes the Pope:
then wee will passe to his affection toward his Wife, his Sonne,
Father, and his neerest Kinsmen the Princes of his Bloud, and his
Seruants. Of all these things the Iudgement shall bee reserued
to truth and discretion, which will haue the memory of Princes
to be alwayes reuerenced; and that they speake of their defects,
not as of vices, but as of imperfect vertues.The vertues of Princes shold be spoken without flattery, & their vices by discretion, they must not set downe their defectes plainly, but passe them ouer as vertues which are not perfect. It is the aduice which Plutarke giue, writing the life of Simon.
                For the first, the
good is alwayes good, and the euill is alwayes euill; Opinion
cannot change the essence of things, they are very hardy which
will haue actions to bee other then they appeare: Slander hauing
no strong sight to behold the brightnesse of vertue, vseth
false spectacles, and calleth that Feare which is Wisedome, Hypocrisie
that which is Deuotion,

                  arde iudgment of Claudius Seissel.
                and Inhumanity that which is Iustice.
I finde that Claudius Seissell hath iudged very boldly of the
Deuotion and Piety of this Prince, thinking that he hath pierced

into the very inward parts, by the obseruation which he hath made
of the outward man. He hath represented him very melancholicke
and superstitious, alwayes trembling and terrified with the horrour
of eternall paine. His deuotion
               True p
                     •
                  ety supports it selfe, she will haue the soule cheerefull & obedient, and that a good man bee so, although that nothing should bee euer knowne. (said he) seemed to bee more
Superstitions then Religious: For to what Image, or Church of GOD,
and Saints, and namely of our Lady, that he vnderstood the people had any
deuotion, or where there were any miracles done, he went thither to
make his Offering, or sent some expresly thither. Hee had moreouer his
Hat full of Images, the most part of Lead and Tinne, the which whensoeuer
any good or bad newes came vnto him, or that the humour
tooke him, hee kist, falling sometimes suddenly downe vpon his knees,
in what place soeuer hee were; so as hee seemed rather a man distracted
then wise.
            
            Such censures belong to him who doth keepe and iudge the
hearts of Kings;God the Iudge of Hearts. but it is true, this Princes Religion was wholy
outward, retaining nothing in his heart. It was popular and ceremonious,
as if he had had for the obiect of his worship a visible
dignity, and that it were sufficient to appeare holy, and not to
bee so.Religion will haue an exterior and publicke exercise with her Ceremonies. The Prince is bound vnto it, and it is Impiety for any other to contradict it, and to trouble the order, But the seruice which is done by the Spirit, is answerable to the essence of God, who is all Spirit, and that which is done outwardly, is more for vs them for him.
            
            His Chronicle saith, that on a Sunday, the eighth of September,
going from the Tournelles to our Ladies Church, hee past by the
Church of Mary Magdalen, to subscribe himselfe a brother and companion
of the great brotherhood of the Bourgeses of Paris. The God of
the people is the God of Kings, but the exterior seruice of Religion
allowes many things to the simplicity of the people, which are
not fitting for the maiesty of Kings.
            If wee shall iudge of causes by the euents, wee may say, that
the Pilgrimages on Foote and Horse-backe,Pilgrimages of Lewis 11 and the most zealous
deuotions of this Prince, haue often couered designes which
were repugnant to Piety and Iustice: Hee did therein alwayes
circumvent some one, and vpon this opinion, that the shew of religion
workes wonders in the beleefe of men,The people opinion of their Princes holinesse workes great effects. Sertorius with his Hinde had gra
                     •
                  en such a superstition in his Souldiers mindes, as they did not thinke that they were gouerned by a man who had more iudgement thē they, but they did firmly beleeue that it was some God which guided them. keeping them from
iudging rashly of his life and actions, whom they saw so familiar
with God. They say, that he did fit his religion to his designes, and
not his designes to his religion. They did not in those times speake
of that most impious Maxime;Maxim of Machiuel.
                
               That it is sufficient for a Prince to
seeme outwardly religious and deuout, although he be not so. A Maxime
of Atheisme, which mockes at God, to deceiue men: at God, who
in the end confounds hypocrites, & wil be serued with an vnfaigned
heart, whereof hee sees and sounds the deepest bottome.They make Machiuel Author of this Maxime, that a new Princce cannot obserue all things for the which men are esteemed good; being often constrained for the maintaining of his estate, to doe things contrary to faith and religion, to leaue the good when he may, and to do the euill when he is forced. We
may well say, that the world lookes but to the exterior, and that
which is in shew. It is not possible in matters of religion, whose
actions must be so often reiterated, that hypocrisie should still
ioyne them so well together, but some one will dis-band and discouer
the deceite. The Signior of Haillan, Historiographer of

France, who hath promised to publish the whole History of
this King, and hath giuen vs an abridgement in his booke, which
is excellent and iuditious touching the affaires of France, speakes
of his Religion after this manner: Neuer Man was more superstitious
then hee, hee did things which were good in shew, but
to a bad intent, thinking by his superstition to deceiue both GOD
and the world. The superstitious feare not to doe euill for the opinion
they haue to obtaine absolution by the acts of their superstition.Hipocrisie cannot continue long, lying cannot deceiued long. The night lasts not, but whē the Sun is far from the Horizon. Iudgements are setled vpon that which they see, wherefore Machiuel saith, It concernes euery man to see, and few to feele, but in the end the maske falles. Hee
tooke from the poore to giue vnto Churches, and did more oppresse
his people with Tributes and Taxes, then any other King of his Predecessors,
and therefore hee made his subiects to bee ill affected vnto
him.
            
            Hee confest himselfe often, for that once a weeke hee touched
them that were troubled with the Kings euill.Curing of the Kings euill. It is the onely miracle
which hath remained perpetuall in the Christians religion, and
in the house of France. That this griefe, whose beginning is an incorrigible
ill digestion, a hidious vlcer to looke on, dangerous to
touch, and for the most part incurable, should bee healed by these
words: The King toucheth thee, and God cures thee, is a wonder beyond
the reach of discourse and iudgement.That Clouis did first cure the Kings Euill, is drawne out of the Epistle of Hormisda a Pope. S. Lewis addes to the Ceremony of touching, the signe of the Crosse. His arme is at Poblette, whither they that are sick of that discase▪ go in pilgrimage to be cured. I say aperpetuall
miracle:The Kings of England haue the same vertue. for since Clouis the first Christian King, it hath continued
to them which succeeded to his Religion and Crowne. Other
Realmes haue had the like graces giuen them, but they haue
not continued: The Kings of England cured the falling sickenesse,
they of Hungary the Iaundise, and they of Castille those that
were possest.
            I could not finde what men he imployed for the seruice of God,
and the conduct of his conscience.Wee finde that he, who was the head & directer of Gods seruice in the Kings house, was cald Apocris
                        •
                     ire vnder the first race, Arch-chaplain in the secōd, and great Chaplain, or great Almoner vnder the third. I reade, that besides the great
Chaplin, or Arch-chaplin, hee had two Chaplins and one Clarke
of the Chappell; and that a Franciscan Fryer called Iohn Vouste,
did for a long time exercise one of these charges.
            The Chronicle saith, that a little before his death hee made a
Doctor of Tours, called Maister Martin Magistri, his Councellour
and Almoner, who dyed at Clerry after the voyage of
Saint Claude. In the accounts and expences of his House, wee
finde, that hee bound the Citty of Tours to giue euery day in
the Weeke (Friday and Saturday excepted) a peece of Royall
Beefe a foote square to the Lepers and Hospitall of Tours; and
for the performance thereof gaue a hundred pounds sterling to
bee imployed in the purchase of lands for the foundation of this
peece. Leprosie, which growes from an Adust and Melancholy
bloud, demands meates that are lesse earthly;The aire, water and nourishmēt may not only alter the temperature of bodies, but also of the minde. Sunt qui non corpora tantū verum etiam animos valeāt mutare liquores.
                being certaine,
that nourishment ingenders diseases, and being ingendred, entertaines
them.
            Hee granted vnto the holy Chappell at the Palace of Paris,
the moities of the Regalities to bee imployed in the entertainment
of the Church and Ornaments. Hee founded the Religious
Nuns of the Aue Marie, which was the ancient Conuent of the

Beguines, a kinde of Religion, which was (as it were) Neuter, betwixt
the Maries, and other religious Women: his picture, and
that of Queene Charlotte is to bee seene in the quire in glasse.
He did enrich the Church of our Lady of Clery, and of Victory,
with great reuenues. Being at Lyon in the yeare 1476. he gaue vnto

Our Lady of good Councell. The letters of dispatch shewe the
great deuotion of this Prince to the seruice of the virgin Mary, and
begin in these tearmes: Hauing had consideration of the great and singular
graces which God our Creator hath heretofore done vs, at the Intercession
of his blessed Mother, the glorious virgin Mary; in whom, after
God her sonne, we haue alwayes had our chiefe refuge and hope: and
who, in the conduct of our greatest affaires, hath alwayes imparted vnto
vs her grace and Intercession to God her sonne; so as by her meanes, and
aid, our Realmes and Signiories are, by the grace of God, preserued, entertained,
and remaine in peace, vnder vs and our true obedience, notwithstanding
any enterprises, practises and conspiracies which haue
beene made since our comming to the Crowne, against vs and our said
Realme, Signiory and Subiects, as well by our enemies and aduersaries, as
other our rebels and disobedient subiects, their adherents and complices.
He did institute many godly things, the obseruation whereof hath
continued vnto our times:The institution of the prayer which is made at noone by the sound of a bed, was the first day of May, 1472. his deuotion to the virgin Mary made
him ordaine, that at noon-day euery man should pray at the sound
of a bell, and say the salutation of the Angell for the peace of the
Realme.
            The Emperour Charlemaine had great and eminent vertues:The commendatiō of Charlemaigne.
                hee
declared himselfe enemy to Didier, King of the Lombardes, who
had reuolted against the Pope: he pacified Italy, subdued the Saxons,
and expelled the Sarazens out of Spaine. But this enterprise
was greater and more hardy then profitable and needfull: for Gannes,
otherwise called Gannelon betrayed him, and was the cause of
that memorable defeat of Roncivaux,
               In the valley of Ronceuaux dyed these valiant Captaines, Rowland, Reynold of Montauban, and Ogier the Dane▪ 
                  Charlemaigne made these foure verses vpon the death of Rowland his sisters sonnes

                     Tu patriam repetis tristi, nos orbe relinquis,
                     Te tenet aula nitens, nos lachrymosa dies,
                     Sed qui lustra geris octo & binos super annos,

                where those braue and generous
knights were lost, whose incredible valour is no more beleeued,
then the truth of the Romance. He ioyned the Roman Empire
to the Monarchy of France. But the Emperiall Diadem did not
cure the great afflictions of the minde which he had all the time of
his Empire, by the reuolt of the Sarazens in Spaine, the Sclauonians,
or Danes, and the Normans. Three yeares before his death, at
the age of 68 yeares, he gaue himselfe to holy contemplation, and
to the care of Religion, and the Church;Founder of the Vniuersity of Paris. he erected the Vniuersity
of Paris, by the aduice of Alcuin his Schoole-maister, and did people
it with the most learned men of his time.
            
               
Hee had soure wiues and many Concubines, the greatnesse of
his vertue, and the wonders of his reputation, made him to be
adored of his subiects, and redoubted of strangers: The Sophie
of Persia, and Prester Iohn of Ethiopia sought for his alliance:
He built two goodly houses,His Buildings. the one at Iughelheim the place
of his birth, the other at Nieumegue; hee built the Bridge at
Mentz, a worke of tenne yeares, the which, the yeare before his
death was ruined by a suddaine fire, in lesse then two howres: He
built the Church of Aix la Chapelle where he is interred: During
his life he caused sixe Councels to be called, at Mentz, at Rheims,

                  Phillip de Commines visiting the Church of Pauia, and beholding the statue of Iohn Galeas Duke of Milan on horseback to be higher then the Altar, whom a Chartrous Monke, borne at Bourges, called Saint; he demanded of him why he called him Saint, seeing the Towns which were painted about him were so many markes of his tiranny, hee answered softly, in this Country we cal all thē Saints that do vs good, hee built this Monastery. King Lewis the 11.
would that the day of his death should be solemnized like Sonday.
The Church doth not solemnize the birth of Saints, it makes
the day of their death a Feast, which is another kind of birth then
the first, there being no more proportion betwixt the world out
of which they go, and heauen whereinto they enter, then there
is betwixt the wombe out of which they go, and the world whereinto
they enter. He caused his Statue to be taken out of the ranke
of the Kings, to make an image vpon the Altar of the Chappell at
the Pallace with that of Saint Lewis; he would also haue his owne
in his ranke, after another fashion, kneeling before the Image of
our Lady.
            But how great soeuer his zeale was vnto the Church, yet would
he haue the Popes know, wherein, and wherefore, they were bound
vnto the Crowne of France: The Kings of France haue deserued,

It is also found that at the last wherewith she is threatned

Church shall neuer bee ouerthrowne so long as the Crowne of
France shall endure.

wrongs which the Temporall power might receiue from the Spirituall.

Benefices, by Buls and expectatiue graces, vpon paine of confiscation
of body and goods, giuing the moueables, iewels, and horses
of all the offendours to them that should discouer them. Hee
appointed Commissioners in the chiefe Townes of the Realme, to
see and peruse the Buls and prouisions which should be brought
from Rome, that he might know whether they were contrary to the
priuileges and liberties of the French Church;The Signior of Gaucourt

the Bishops and Prelates which remained in the Court of Rome, to
watch ouer their Troupes, and to be resident in their Bishoprickes,
vpon paine of priuation of the Temporall of their Reuenewes, and
to prepare themselues for the holding of a Councell at Lyon when
it should be called, vpon the instance which he would make vnto
the Pope: He was aduertised that Religious Friers going to generall
Chapters of their Orders out of the Realme, were imployed to
carry packets,Religious men imploied in messages. and intelligences, he made a defence for the going
to any Chapters which should be held in forraine Prouinces;The defences by this Edict giuen at Selongnes the third of September 1476. were generall against the Religious of the Order of Cisteaux, of the Charthusians of Clugny, and the fowre begging Friers; But the Chartusians are not subiect to the punishment, by the same Edict it is spoken of the Friers Minors of the three Orders. the
punishment was diuers: He appointed banishment for them of Cisteaux
and of Clugny, and declared them incapable to hold any
Benefices in France, and in regard of the Begging Friers, besides
banishment, he said that he would root out, and expell the Realme
all them of that Order which should infringe his Edict.
            Howsoeuer he did reuerence Church-men, yet would hee not
haue them stray from publicke instructions,Sermons of seditiō. to censure affaires of
Estate; for such kinds of discourses do more trouble the minds of
men then comfort them: They be but cloudes which breake forth
into brutes of sedition, incense Princes,Discourses of affaires of State in a troublesome and difficult time enter into seditious Spirits, as burning nailes do into greene wood. They be Conduit Pipes, saith the President Du Vair, by the which dest

                  ll the affections wherewith the people are seasoned, and afterwards thrust on to good or bad actions. and are like vnto the arrowes
of Thrace which were shot against heauen to appease it: He
was aduertised that Frier Anthony Fradin, a Franciscan born at Ville-Franché
in Beaujollois, spake too boldly of the bad gouernment of
affaires: He sent Oliuer le'Dain to Paris in the beginning of the
yeare 1479. to forbid him to Preach. The multitude (which runnes
as it is led) mutined against this pursuite, and followed this Preacher
in troupes to defend him,The people go like troupes and consider not; Quo eundum, sed quo itur: Whether they must go, but whether they go. yea the women carryed stones and
kniues, to vse against such as should come to offend him.
            From one liberty they saw diuers spring, as faults follow one
another, and this sedition was ready to cause great tumult:Light faults should be repaired by pardon, and great by seuerity; and a Prince, as Iulius Agricola saith, must not alwaies bee pacified with the punishment, he must rest oftentimes contented with the repentance of such as haue 
                     •
                  rred. Nec poena semper, saepius poenitentia contentus esse debet, Tac. The
Court of Parliament preuented it in such sort, as they gaue the
King subiect rather to content himselfe with the repentance then
the punishment of this silly multitude. They commanded the Frier

to go out of Paris, and not to Preach seditiously in any other Prouince;
They did consider that France had seene and suffered terrible
agitations by the violence of these spirits, and that England had
beene violently afflicted vnder the raigne of King Richard, by the
seditious Sermons of one onely man, who seeking to confound all
Orders by a pernicious equality, Preaching alwaies in his Sermons
that when as Adam did eate the Apple there were no Gentlemen,
that Nature, the Minister of God, had created all men of the same
forme, and had cast them in the same mould, as brethren and companions
lodged on the same earth,The Bishops of England hauing forbidden the Pulpit to Iohn Ball an English Priest, he went to Preach seditiously in the fields, causing himselfe to be followed by the people, where in the hearing of 200000. he began with these tearmes. and if God would haue made
this distinction amongst men, he would haue ordained this difference
from the beginning.
            
               A great man of that time spake these words vpon that subiect,
which are so worthy and true,Discourse is a powerfull charme. as the History shall not stray to step
a little out of the High-way to consider them. In truth (saith he)
the force of speech is a powerfull thing, especially hauing life giuen it
by passion; for you would say that it doth, in a manner, mould and fashion
mens soules, and that it is a fire kindled, which incountring another
body inflames and sets it on fire,When Adam delu'd, and Eue span: Who was then the Gentleman? how farre off soeuer it bee, like
vnto Naphte, which kindles at the very sight of the fire.What cannot Eloquence do in the mouth of an honest man and of credit, seing that comming from a seditious spirit, it workes such great effects. One word of a man of credite, saith Polibius, may diuert men from bad enterprises, and draw them to good: The eloquence of a wicked man is like poyson in a cup of Gold. I haue often
obserued when, not with any eloquent discourse, but with words which
were scarce intellegible, and without any discourse of reason, they haue
put the people that heard them into choler, for that they were so: so easily
do passions cōmunicate by words, and passe from him that speaks, to him
that heares. The same iealousy which a husband hath for the honour
of his wife, the feeling which the son hath for the loue of his
father, the same motions which a faithfull Minister hath for the
loue of his Prince, a Preacher should haue for the Glory of God,
he should dry away for the zeale of his house, and for the increase
of his seruice; any other passion that transports him is but fury.
            Next to the seruice of God, piety respects the obedience and
honour which we owe vnto our parents.How Lewis was towards his father. It is true that Lewis offended
against this Law, not onely in his first age (whose weaknesse &
facillity to the impressions of other men might excuse his errour)
but in his full vitility, which made him inexcusable, when as hee
could not be ignorant that his duty towards his father was so naturall,
so religious, and so strictly commanded, by Diuine and Humane
Lawes, as all other duties yeeld vnto it.All the offices of Piety yeeld to that of the child to the father, the sonne which sees his father & his sonne in danger of their liues, if he cannot rel
                     ••
                  ue both, he must abandon his sonne to saue his father, for the dutie which hee owes him is more ancient then the love which he heare
                     •
                   vnto his children: Cymon being vnable for his pouerty to bury his father, before he had paid his debt, sold his owne liberty. The ioy which King
Charles the 7. had of his birth did not continue so long as the sorrow
he had for his disobedience; when he was borne he had cryed
Noë like others, and this word which in the beginning did signifie
rest & consolatiō, was a presage of the crosses & toiles which he endured.
It is true that this sowre seuerity wherwith he controuled his
actions, was cause of his disorders & excesse;The rough, seuere, and imperious proceeding of fathers towards their children makes them to grow insolent and disordered. It is a Diuine counsell which Saint Paul giues vnto fathers: Parentes he prou

                     m: Parents prouoke not your sonnes to anger, least they turne away their minds. For being vnwilling

to dis-ioyne the authority of a father from that of King, he chose
rather to keepe him in feare and obedience by the seuerity of the
one then by the mildenesse of the other: He thought that he had
no better meanes to enioy this spirit then by keeping him short,
and restraining the violent motions of his courage, and that being
in necessity he should be alwaies in obedience.
            He was eighteene yeares old before he had any portion allowed
him, no not that which did belong vnto him from the day of his
birth; for the father considered that if at the age of twelue or thirteene
yeares, when as he had no part in the Estate, he should haue
beene had of some great faction, the increase of meanes and
yeares would haue drawne him to great enterprises. The first example
of his disobedience was the trouble of the Praguery, which
hath bene formerly related, when as he suffred himselfe to be surprized
and stole away from the Earle of March, his Gouernour,
whom Chroniclers haue called a Prince of the Bloud, and erroniously
haue taken the husband for the wife. For it is true, that
Iames of Bourbon,The Lady Elenor of Bourbon daughter to Ieames of Bourbon Earle of March, was married to the Earle of Perdriac, sonne to the Earle of Armagnac. Earle of March, King of Naples, and sonne
to Iohn of Bourbon first Earle of Vendosme, hauing but one
daughter of his first marriage, gaue her to Bernard of Armagnac
Earle of Perdriac, who by this marriage carried the name of Earle
of March, and Gouernour to Lewis the 11.They write that Lewis chased away the Earle of March, for that hee had aduertised King Charles that the Duke of Alençon was come to Ni
                     •
                  rt to subborne him.
            
            For this reason it was late before he gaue him the gouernment
of the Country of Dauphine, neither would hee that the displacing
of Officers should depend vpon his capricious humours,
this wise father hauing found that his actions were so wandring,
inconstant, and contrary to themselues, as it was a difficult thing
sometimes to beleeue that they proceeded from one spirit, for
there is nothing equallMens mindes change not according to the motions of reason but according to occasions: Nemo non quotidie consilium mutat: There is not any man but changeth his minde daily. if it comes not from the same resolution,
wherefore in the Letters Pattents, which were granted at Charleiu
the 28. of Iuly, 1440. the King reserued not any other thing, but
that he should not displace those Officers which were setled in
their charges, and that the Chancellour of France should keep the
seale of Dauphine.
            For the taking of possession of this Prouince, he sent Iohn Signior
of Gamaches, a Knight, and Gabriel of Bernet Signior of
Targey, a Squite, Steward of the Kings house to Grenoble,
whom he termed his Embassadours; they presented the Kings letters,
and the Dauphins, to the Councell of Dauphine, in the presence
of Iuuenal of Vrsins a Knight, Lord of Treynell, Leiutenant
of that Prouince, in the absence of the Lord of Gaucourt,
who was Gouernour, and of the chiefe Noblemen of the Prouince.
            
               Stephen Guillon President in that Councell made an Oration
vpon this subiect, but after such manner, as it discouered the rudenesse
and simplicity of the matter, for who so should discourse
now after that manner, they would wonder why the feete should
do the eares so much wrong as to suffer attention.A Babler demanding of Aristotle if his discourse were not strange; no, answered he, but yet a man hauing feet should not giue himselfe so long patience to beare thee. They found

men in those times who knew how to speake, but few were able
to discourse eloquently, It is easy to iudge of the beauty of the
building by the frontespice: Behold the first periode of this Oration,
Seeing it is the pleasure of my Lords the Embassadours to our
most redoubted Lord and Prince my Lord the Dauphin Lewis, that I
should say some-thing vnto you concerning the matter of their Embassage,
to obey them as I ought, I will speake it as well as I can, with
the help of our Lord & of his Mother, and also with the good supportation
and correction of them and you my Masters, and the better to relate it I
take for my Theame: Fillius ditus est nobis dominator Dominus & in
manu eius potestas & Imperium: I say the third and the ninth chapter:
In those times publicke actions were performed like Sermons, and alwaies they tooke some passage of Scripture for the ground of their discourse. The whole Discourse is of the like straine, and extends it selfe
vpon the Dauphins praises, being drowned, as it were, in the allegations
of diuers passages of Diuinity and Law.
            I thinke in those daies they had more regard to deeds then
words,Simplicity of the eloquence in the old time. and that they had more care to do then to speake, that their
discourses were without pompe or vanity, and did not fauour of
that bold babling which will make men beleeue, that he which is
beaten should make reparation, and that the vanquished is victor.

                  Thucydides and Pericles, had charge of the gouernment of the Common-weale of Athens, yet could neuer agree, Archidamus King of Lacedemonia, termed their contention a wrastling, and asking Thucydides who was the stronger, he answered: When I haue throwne Pericles downe be makes them that see it beleeue that he is not vanquished, but that hee stands still. But in this action there is neither choice of termes, nor choice
of reason; and for that he would not haue it wholy without inuention,
he stands vpon the letters of Lewis his name, and saith that
that in this word Ludouicus there are nine letters, the first represents
the Liberallity of this Prince, the second that he was Vertable,
the third that he should Domineere, and be feared; the fourth
that he was Orthodoxall, the fift Vigilant, the sixt a Iusti

                  er, the

he fell vpon that of 
                  •
               his Embassadours, and said that the Signior of
Gamasche, who was called Iohn, was a fore-runner to IESVS
CHRIST, and the other the Angell which did fore-tell his
Incarnation to the Virgin MARY, for that his name was GABRIEL.
            
            Such kind of writings are like vnto Medals, which men
esteeme more for their stamps, and for the testimony they giue
of the doubts of Antiquitie, then for their proper beauty: neither
doe wee see any but giue some light in the obscurest difficulties,
and serue in the managing of great affaires. We see in
the beginning of his discourse,The Dauphin is not acknowledged Prince of Dauphiné vntill the King hath giuen him the power. how this President labours to
satisfie them who held, that Dauphiné should acknowledge
the Dauphin from the day of his birth: for he maintained, That
the eldest sonne of France, could not bee acknowledged for Prince, and
Lord of Dauphiné, vntill it should please the King to giue him the prouisions
and command.
            
            The History sets downe how he retired into Dauphiné, and
from thence into Flanders: A wonderfull hearts griefe vnto the
King,Griefe of K. Charles the 7. which did accompany him vnto his graue; In either of his
vioages, he was alwaies accompanied by necessity: His seruants

purses being emptied in the voiage of Dauphiné, they borrowed
a hundred Crownes of them of Romans. The Bill which
hee made is carefully kept among the publicke writings of that
Towne. It is true, that Lewis the eleuenth, was such towards
Charles the seuenth his father, as hee desired not that Charles
the eighth his sonne, should be like vnto him, and doubting that
the disposition of his nature might be helpt by his nourishment,
hee did not care to breed him vp in those vertues which are
worthy of a Prince. These defects proceeded not so much
from the fathers fault as from the time,In th

                  rant: They say also that Italy being giuen more to learning then Armes, had giuen a great aduantage to them that had conquered it. where the old errour was
sworne by the greatest Families, that the study of learning
did daunt their courages: Hee would not haue him learne any
more Lattine then these few words: Qui nescit dissmulare nescit
regnare:
               King Lewis the 11. would not haue his sonne learne any other Art, but how to dissemble, in the which he had pasi Maister; he also said that in reading bookes he should find so many accidents and perils, as he would becomelesse couragious. A Prince leaues his sonne learned enough, when he hath
made him capable to force obedience: Obedience is the Science
of Princes.There is not any Science necessary for a Prince but to command well, and to bee well obeyed.
            
            Of his two daughters hee loued none but her whom hee
gaue to the Duke of Bourbon, the eldest was a sadde encounter
to his eyes. Hee fayled also in the affection which hee
ought vnto the mother, for hee gaue her not so good a
share of his heart as shee ought to haue had. CLAVDIVS of
Seyssell saith: That whilst hee was in the vigour of his age, hee
was not loyall of his person, Hee alwaies kept her meanely attended,
in some Castell for the most part, whether hee went some times
to see her,
                     Lewis the 11. a bad Husband. more for a desire to haue Issue, then for any delight
hee tooke in her; and for the feare shee had of him, and his
sowre vsage of her, it is credible, that shee had no great delight
nor pleasure in his company: But that which is worse, towards
the end of his daies hee sent her into Dauphiné, and did expressely
command that shee should not bee neere his sonne when hee should
bee King. Of all the contentments of life that of marriage is
most to bee desired: It is a roughs passage, the waies are flanked
with Bushes and Thomes, it is impossible to go vnto the end
of it, but some Brier or Bramble will catch hold of you:
Marriage is good of it selfe, but it is subiect to bad accidents: To explaine this truth, Gregory brings a comparison of a way which is cleane and straight, & yet hath on either side brambles which may catch hold: In via quidem munda non offendimur, sed à latere nascitur quo pungamur. We are not hurt in a cleane way, but it growes from the sides wherewith we are prickt. Greg. 12. Moral.
                And the great Prince, which did draw all sorts of Sciences
aboundantly out of the Treasures of the Eternall Wisedome,
doth number the concord of Marriage among his chiefest
felicities, holding him happy that hath a wise wife, and aduowing
that there is not any thing more pleasing vnto God then
Nuptiall Concord.
            That of brethren is no lesse pleasing vnto him,
                  Lewis bad to his brother. there was not
any betwixt the King, and the Duke of Guienne his brother, and
wee cannot say that of them which is written of the two Twinnes,
Two brethren were held Twinnes, for that being toucht with the same Infirmity, the beginning, progresse, and declining was equall in either of them. August. lib: 5. de Ciuit.
                that the one had a feeling of anothers infirmity: There was no

resemblance of Complexions and Will betwixt them. The
Duke of Guienne hauing seene that his presumptions in the
League of the Common-weale, and those of the Dukes of Brittany,
Bourgundy, Bourbon had beene recompensed, and to
draw fauours from the King, it was good to make himselfe to
bee feared, hee still continued his practises with them that
might terrifie him, and held his spirit in the apprehensions of
warre.
            This great rigour, which the King vsed towards him, might
well bee excused and maintained with this great reason, not
to make the Princes of the bloud great in a time of trouble
and liberty. If his brother had had a greater share in the
State, and if his portion had lyen neerer to his enemies,
the League of the Common-weale had continued longer. In
the beginning hee thought to content him, in giuing the
Dutchy of BerryThe Dutchy of Berry was giuen him for his portion in Nouember 1461. & in the yeare, 1465. he entred into the Dutchy of Normandy, and the Lands which the Duke of Orleance held there, as the Counties of Mortaigne and Longueuille. to him, and to his Heires Male, then the
Dutchy of Normandy, with power to impose all sorts of Subsidies:
But hee did all this onely for the necessity of his affaires,
and to dispierce, and cut assunder the storme of the League:
Soone after, hee draue him out of Normandy, and compelled
him to retire, and with-draw, himselfe into Brittany, as poore
as euer.
            This seuere course was approued and allowed by the three
Estates, who held it not fit, nor conuenient, to pull so goodly a
Flower from the Crowne, saying; that hee should rest himselfe
contented and satisfied with the offer which the King made him
of twelue hundred pounds Sterling yearely rent, with the Title
of a Dutchy, and foure thousand eight hundred pounds
Pension:This offer was made, according to the Ordonance of King Charles the fift, in October 1374. by the which he would that Lewis of France his second son should haue twelue hundred pound sterling yearely rent, for his portion, and 4000. pounds giuen him to furnish him. In the end, hee gaue him the gouernement of Guienne,
but hee commanded Iohn of Popincourt, President of
the Accounts at Paris, not to inuest him with his Letters,
before hee had deliuered, and resigned vp the others, and made
his renounciation: This was but a scantling of the whole peece,
for of this great, spacious, and goodly Prouince of Guienne,
hee had nothing but the Country of Bourdelois, Bazadois, and
Landesse: Hee neither enioyed it long, nor yet possessed it
quietly; for being there, hee presently found great troubles
for the limites, and bounds, which the Kings Officers stroue and
contended for, and for the which the Duke of Bourgundy
would haue taken Armes, but it was compounded and verefied by
the Court of Parliament two yeares after. Death gaue him
a more contented, quiet, and certaine Portion in the other
world.
            If death had not done the like grace to the Duke of Orleance,
and drawne him out of the cares and afflictions of this
life, hee had declared the cause of the same resolution
the which hee made knowne to King CHARLES the seuenth:
The violent death of LEVVIS Duke of Orleance his

father, hauing inuited the English to mount vpon the Stage,
and there to act the part of Kings of France for many yeares,

death to the defence of the Crowne: Hee was taken prisoner at
the battell of Agincourt, and carried into England, where hee remained
fiue and twenty yeares. His liberty and rest came from
thence, from whence proceeded the causes of the miseries of
his house, and of his captiuity. Phillip Duke of Bourgundy,
paied two hundred thousand Crownes for his ransome, married
him to Mary of Cleues his Neece, and gaue him the Order
of the Golden Fleece,The Duke of Orleance receiued the Order of the Duke of Bourgundy, after his returne out of Englād, in the yeare 1440. Hee was not receiued by King

his quality.Assembly at Neuers in the yeare 1442. This discontent made him to ioyne with the intentions

regard them better then he did, and to reforme the disorders of the
Realme.The discontented Princes assembled at Neuers, in the yeare 1442. The Archbishop of Rheims Chancellour of France, was sent to moderate their choller, and to assure them of all they desired.
            
            This was presently repaired, for the English made their profite,
and the Duke of Orleance recouered the ranke, and authority
which the dignity of his birth gaue him neere the
King: Who employed him in the conference which was made
at Tours, for a Truce betwixt France and England, vnder the fauour
whereof hee vndertooke the conquest of Milan, after the
death of PHILLIP MARIA. The successe of this enterprise
did shew that hee had beleeued them too lightly who had
represented it so easy; as the first day hee should arme, Lombardy
would giue him the Castle of Milan. Hee past into Italy to
take possession of the Dutchy,It is a great errour in a Prince to beleeue that lightly which is represented vnto him of the facillity of a great designe, notwithstanding that the most temperate are subiect to suffer themselues to bee carried away with these goodly perswasions. Credulitas error magisest quam culpa & quidem in optimis cuiusque mentem facillimè irripit. Credulity is an errour rather then a fault, and it doth easily creepe into the best mens minds. Cicero.
                But as it hath beene alwaies
reproached vnto the French, neuer to thinke of their returne
when they passe the Mountaines, being there hee was presently
vnfurnished of all necessary meanes to worke any great effect,
and was forced to end his enterprises as soone as they beganne. The
conquest of the County of Ast was the fruite of his voiage, the
rest remained to FRANCIS SFORCE. This County of Ast
serued him for a retreate for some time after, the greatnesse
of his courage not suffering him to remaine neere the King,Cause of the Duke of Orleans death. for
the small esteeme he made of him. A contempt which did wound
his heart with so sencible a griefe, as CLAVDIVS of Seyssell
finds no other cause of his death.
            
               Lewis Duke of Orleance was successour to this bad vsage, and
to the end that this contempt might bee a counterpoise to the
greatnesse of his courage, hee would haue his breeding lesse exquisite
then his generous disposition could beare, and forced him to
marry his daughter, who was weake and crooked,The Author of the remembrances of the Royall House of Bourbon saith, that Lewis the eleuenth, caused Lewis Duke of Orleance to bee bred vp as grossely as he could, to abate that generous heart of the house of Orleance, Claudius of Seyssell saith, that he vsed him very roughly, and sought to kill him. giuing him a

boane of griefe and repentance to gnawe for aboue twenty
yeares.
            According to the Maxime, to humble the Princes of his bloud,
hee intreated the Earle of Angoulesme no better, and would not
suffer him to thinke of marrying the Princesse of Bourgondy, desiring
rather that that great and mighty Estate should be in the power
of a forraigne Prince. Hee doubted the courage of them that
were neerest allied vnto him, and held them (as it were) ouerwhelmed
vnder the rocke of contempt and necessity, and kept them
from great charges. The springs of his bounty were drawne dry
for them, for he vsed France like vnto an Orchard, where as they
cut, pull vp, and transplant trees at their pleasure.
            That great and wonderfull house of Bourbon, which alone can
reckon as many triumphes as France hath had enemies, and which
before all others carried a Ducal Crowne, auoided these stormes.
This royall family of Bourbon hath bin so much esteemed by our anciēt Monarks as it was the first among the Princes of bloud that was honoured with the Title of a Duke: for although the Dutchy of Bourgondy were long before the erection of the Dutchy of Bourbon, yet it was neuer comprehēded in the house of France, but since Charl

firme,Greatnes of the house of Bourbon. forcing him to conuert his spleene and hatred into other effects
of loue and affection. For he he gaue the first Coller of the
Order to Iohn Duke of Bourbon, his brother, who had married
the Lady Ioane of France, daughter to Charles the seuenth, and the
Lady Agnes his daughter, to Peter of Bourbon, to whom he committed
all his important affaires; hee gaue him the inheritance of
the Earle of Armagnac, yet he would not haue him carry the Title
of Earle.
            
               Maiesty. Next to the duties which binde a Prince to serue God,
and to loue his Allies, there is not any thing which should keepe
his spirit more in action then the care of Maiesty: for it is so delicate
a spring, as if it slip or breake, the whole frame of authority
is in disorder, and he becomes a king of a Tragedie. When I speak
of Maiesty, I meane not that, to maintaine that a Prince should
liue like vnto the Kings of Persia, in a Castle with three Ditches,Ridiculous grauitie of Princes.
and as many Walles,The Kings of Persia were rather worshipped then reuerenced by their subiects. They remained in a Castle with three Ditches & three walles, speaking to few, and yet had news daily from all parts of their Empire, from the straight of Hellespont to the East Indies, by Centinels which were set vpon the mountaines. that they should not speake vnto him, but
through a trauers, like vnto the Kings of Borney: that hee should
not see his subiects, but bare-headed, and couered with ashes; or
that hee should not shew himselfe but once a yeare, like to the first
Kings of France: But my meaning is to speake of that inuiolable
and glorious respect which bindes a Prince not to say, do, or yeeld
to any thing contrary to the dignity of his Crowne, which cannot
endure to be forced, and doth neuer shew himselfe in publicke actions,
but with what is fit and necessary for his greatnesse and power.
The words and actions of Princes are so considered, and the people iudge of them as they vnderstand them; and therefore should alwayes appeare Maiesticall, and (if it may bee) Diuine. And ancient Grecian said, That a Prince should not speake before the people, but as if hee were vpon a stage in a Tragedy. This Maiesty is like vnto Moses Rod,Maiesty compared to Moses rod. the which being held in
the hand, was the Instrument of admirable things; but creeping
on the earth, there was nothing but horror and contempt.
            
               
               Lewis the eleuenth was alwayes very carefull to maintaine this
Maiesty, being wonderfull desirous of reuerence, respect, and reputation,
and yet his priuate and familiar actions were very
contrary. This care was the last garment he put off; hee shewed
it vpon the tigpe of his lippes when as hee thrust forth the last
words of his life. He gaue it two supporters, Feare and Admiratition,

                another would haue maintained it with Loue and Authority;
but hee mist this first way at his comming to the Crowne, and
could neuer after recouer it: hee found such sauadge humors, and
so accustomed to liberty, that as the intemperance of the Patient
iustifies the seuerity of the Physitian, he was forced to vse fury to
make mad men wise.
            Thus his Maiesty was feared of the greatest Princes of Europe,
it was not contemned of any man without punishment,
and it was reuerenced of all his subiects. This Maiesty was like
vnto those Pictures which seemed fairest farre off. It was admired
in forraine Prouinces, but it was something blemished by
his carelesnesse and facility, wherewith he did often wrong his
greatest actions.

Horse at his Coronation. Yuon of Fau his chiefe Hunts-man,
Lewis of Lauall, Lord of Chastillon, was maister of the Waters
and Forrests.
            The ancient order of France was, that Knights Banneret, the
Maister of the Pantrie, the chiefe Caruer, and the chiefe Cuppebearer
should serue the King at the foure Annall Feastes, and
to either of them was giuen foure poundes sterling: but when
as Lewis the eleuenth neglected this Gratuity, they forgot the
Dutie.
            It is one of the precepts of Maiesty, that the markes of Soueraignty
bee not imparted to any,A prince shold not be more sparing of any thing then of honours which depend of his maiesty. yet hee suffered the Prince of

prisoners, when hee made his first entry into any Towne where
he commanded.In this priuiledge, but for once to Charles Earle of Angoules me, prisoners for high Treason were excepted. It was granted in the yeare 1477.
            
            Hee was very staied in giuing Titles of Honour and Dignity
to great Families: a Prince cannot bee too warie therein: for it
falles out often, that the considerations which fauour the priuate
merite of any one, end with him when hee dies; but when
the dignitie is tyed vnto the person, as the feodall titles of Dukes,
Marquises, Earles and Barons bee, the Family for the which the
gratification was made, is dispossest thereof, when as the Landes
goe away.Many disallowed that the feodall Titles of Dukes, Marquises, &c. should bee giuen in France to the Land, and not vnto the Bloud, for it happens that some one loosing the land, doth also loose the meanes to maintaine the Title which remaines. Hence it comes that in England such dignities are
not annexed to the Landes and Fees,Policy in England for the titles of Houses. but to the Bloud, and the
Descendants of the Familie. The German doth not impart it to the
whole posterity, but onely to them which descend from the
Males.
            There are two houses which bee so great and famous of themselues,
as they honour the titles which are giuen them. King Charles
the seuenth his Father, hauing made the Earledome of Foix a
Pairie for Gaston of Foix, hee confirmed this erection; but hee
made not any new. This house of Foix was in those times one of
the most famous in Christendome, and compare with Soueraigne
PrincesWe find that in great ceremonies the Earles of Foix are named before the Princes, and had precedence of the Earles of Vendosme. There is no other reason but that the eldest of Princes houses precede the yonger of other houses, and therfore at the Estates held at Tours, the Earles of Neuers, Eu and Foix, had precedence of the Earle of Vendosme.
            
            
               
               Gaston of Foix, who liued in the time of King Charles the fifth, went
equall with Kings: when as King Charles the sixth was at Tholousa,
he sent the Earle of Sancerre Marshall of France; and the Signior
of Riuiere, one of the chiefe of his Councell to the Earle of
Foix, who was then at Mazere, to intreate him to come vnto him,
or else he would goe to see him. He did not excuse himselfe vpon
the Indispositions of his great Age, and being sorry that hee had
not preuented this summons, he parted from Mazere with six hundred
horse, and came to the King to Tholousa.Traine of the Earle of Foix. The History saith,
that presenting himselfe vnto the king, hee was followed by two
hundred Gentlemen, all cloathed in silkes; among them there
was noted the Vicount of Bruniquet and his brethren, Roger of
Spaine, Lord of Montespan, issued from the bloud of Arragon,
and head of the house of Montespan,
                  Espagno let of Spaine, sonne to Roger of Spaine, sonne to Leon of Spaine. and the Lord of Corras,
who first raised the honour of the Earles of Caramain, a great
and rich family,Beginning of the houses of Mō
                  tespan & Caramain allied to that of Foix, and who (seeing that Houses
and Families haue their periods like to all other worldly things)
could not desire a more glorious fall, then into the house of Monluc,
where it begins to reuiue. King Charles the sixth requited this
visite at New-yeares tide in the yeare 1390.At this voyage the Earle did institute King Charles the sixth his heire, the which hee would not accept, for that he would not defraud the Vicount of Chastellan his lawfull Heire.
            
            He fauoured the house of Lauall with the like declarations of
honour,House of Lauall. the which was long before held for one of the worthiest
of France, hauing neuer wanted children, nor the first dignities
and alliances of France, hauing for their stemme the House of
Montmorency,They drawe the beginning of the first house of Montmorency, to the time of Saint Denis, by whom the first that was conuerted among the French Knights, was a Lord of Montmorency, and therefore the ancient Deuice of this house is, God helpe the first Christians.

in their Armes, but fiue Cockle-shels Argent to the Crosse.
Wherefore he would that Francis of Lauall, Lord of Gaure, sonne
of a daughter of king Charles the seuenths sister, should go in rank
with the Earles of Vendosme, as well in Councell as in Parliament,
and in all other publike actions; and caused his letters to be
dispatcht at Mans the nine and twentith day of Nouember 1467.
to serue for a speciall and perpetuall priuiledge to his posteritie.
            He had much contemned the glorious and honourable markes
of Maiesty.Princes had alwayes men appointed to serue in time of peace and warre for the ornament of their maiesty, and royall greatnesse. Heralds were instituted in France for that respect, in time of peace they carried mayles vpon their breasts, and in times of warre their Coat of Armes powdred with Flowers de Luce. I haue obserued in the Church and Cloister of Saint Catherine du Val of the Schollers, twenty of their Tombes which shew the forme of their Maces and Scutchions. 
               Bodin writes, that hauing chased away almost all the
Gentlemen of his house, hee imployed his Taylor for a Herald at
Armes, and his Barber for an Embassador, and his Physitian for a
Chancellor, as an ancient king of Syria did Apolophanes his Physitian,
whom he made the president of his Councell. Philip de Commines
obserues it, when hee shewes how much hee was troubled
to furnish out a Herald which he sent to the King of England. Heralds
were necessary for the Maiesty of a Prince, in actions of war,
and in the most solemne dayes of peace.
            
               
They had diuers names, and diuers charges, and they either
carried the Titles of the Soueraignes, Prouinces, or of some other
famous occasion, as in France the Heralds are diuersly named,
and wee finde often in the History of France, these names
giuen to Heralds:

They say it grew vpon that which Clouis said in the battell neere to Colleyn, when as fearing to loose it, hee promised to beleeue in Iesus Christ, worshipped by Clotilde his wife, and to hold him for his Ioue. Since that time they cryed in their battels, Monjoye Saint Denis, as if they would say, Christ whom Saint Denis hath preached in Gaule, is my Ioue, that is to say, my Iupiter.

wherein a great man of Italy hath erred, and moues them that
obserue it, to laugh; for hauing found in our Histories that King
Lewis the eleuenth had sent two Heralds to Bajazeth to complaine
that hee had broken the peace with the Venetians: hee
sets downe their names after this manner: Monsieur Gaudio de
Saint Denis, Monsieur de Saint Michel, whereas hee should haue
saide, The Herald Monjoy Saint Denis, and Mont Saint Michel.
            
            They were created at great and solemne Feasts, and when they
presented Wine vnto the Prince, hauing drunke, he gaue the cup
to him whom he made Herald, wherwith he should make his Scutchion.
Oliuer of la Marche saith, that Philip Duke of Bourgondy did
somtimes giue them the name of that Country whereas the Wine
which hee then dranke, did grow: which done, the other Heralds
gaue him the Coate of Armes, charged with the Princes
Armes.
            There were more Ceremonies at the Creation of a King at
Armes: for his sufficiency was to bee testified by all the Kings at
Armes,Creation of Heralds and Heralds that might bee found, and they were distinguished
from others by a Crowne croslet, which they carried
on their heads. Their chiefe charge was to make a distinction
of the Armes of Families, to preserue the ancient, and preuent
the vsurpation of new. They might forbid them that were
no Gentlemen to carry Armes which were not fit for their profession,
or for Gentlemen to carry any other Crests then their
Fathers had done, or to open the Helmet, or to crowne them
without permission.
            It was also their duty to keepe the Blason of Armes of Houses,
There were great considerations in the forme of Scutchions, and in the Crests of Armes. A Knights Scutchion might bee cut square, or voided at his pleasure, wherevnto a Crest was added, taken out of part of the Armes, and the Helmet shut, and stand

of the Deuices and Colours of Soueraigne Houses, as White
for France, Blacke for England, Red for Bourgondy, Blewe for
Savoy, Yellow for Lorraine, and Greene for Anjou. The King at
Armes in the house of Bourgondy had a care that such as were
made noble, should not carry a field gueles, for that it was the
colour reserued for the Prince.
            This house did greatly obserue the Respects and Ceremonies
of a Soueraigne pompe.Magnificence of the house of Bourgondy. When the Duke did eate at any solemne
Feast, besides all the ordinary state of Kings, he had behinde
him the Kings at Armes, and Heralds with their Coates and

Crownes, and before him were set, at a low Table, two Vshers, and
two Sergeants with their Maces, who had alwayes their eyes vpon
his, to execute his commandements vpon the least signe he should
make; yea, to take the greatest prisoners which could not be taken
else-where.
            These Charges haue beene contemned by the contempt of persons
which haue not desired them, but to couer the indignity of
their birth. In former times they were not held but by Gentlemen,
whose honour carried them vnto dangers with the same
courage that they which are lesse generous flye from them. They
had the guard of the Kings Chamber, and had that charge which
since the Archers of the Guard haue.The S

proofe of their valour at the battell of Bouuines, vnder Philip
Augustus, by reason whereof Saint Lewis did build the Church of
Saint Katherine du Val des Escoliers, and King Charles the fifth appointed
the brotherhood there, whereas at this day many Tombes
are to bee seene, which haue preserued the ancient forme of their
habit and Armes.
            That which Philip de Commines obserues of a Gascon which
came into the place where as the King was at the stoole with
three or foure, confirmes this opinion of the small care hee had
of the formes befitting Maiesty; for although there were no Vshers
at the doores,Duty of Chamberlaines. yet this facility to enter euen into the Cabinet, was
dangerous. His Predecessors had prouided for it, and the Chamberlaines
were boundThe first care of the kings person belongs to the Lord Chamberlaine, he was bound to lye at the Kings feete, whē the Queen was not present, and so Peter, Lord Chamberlaine to the king S. Lewis, was buried at Saint Denis, at his maisters feet, as hee serued him liuing. And at this day in the Assembly of the Estates, & when as the King sits in Iustice, the Lord Chamberlaine sits at his feet. by the duty of this charge, not to suffer
it: but hee contemned it all the time of his reigne, vntill the end,
when hee was more carefull of it then was needfull, passing from
a great facility and confidence, to a rigorous seuerity and distrust
to keepe his gates shut: wee finde these words very remarkeable
in the Ordonance of King Philip the long: After the care of the
soule, they must not bee so negligent of the body, as through negligence,
or bad guard any perils arriue, especially when for one person many
troubles may happen. Wee therefore ordaine, and doe therewith especially
charge our Chamberlaine, that no vnknowne person nor boy of
poore estate enter into our Wardrope, nor lay their hand, nor bee
at our bed making, and that they suffer not any strange sheetes to bee
layd on. And wee command the Steward of our house, that our Pantrie
or Kitchin, and all other Offices of our house bee so well and carefully
kept, as no danger may arriue, and these things wee will
haue obserued in the houses of our Company, and of our Children.
            
            The other precept of Maiesty,Great Offices shold not be hereditary. is not to continue great Offices
in one Family,The perpetuity of great charges is dangerous. They that haue commanded long, are loath to obey. Antiquitas voluit Prouinciarum dignitatem amica successione repara

had, who hauing beene fiue times Consull, and vndergone
many great charges, intreated the Senate not to conferre that
Honour vnto his sonne; not that hee thought him vnworthie,
but that hee knewe well, that the Common-weale should receiue
preiudice by the perpetuity of great Offices in one Family.
In an other occasion Quintus Fabius Maximus did shewe, that in the election of great Charges there should be no respect had but of the publicke good, hee would not consent that T. Octacilius, who had married his wiues daughter, should bee Consull, for that hee held him not capable of that charge; nor of courage to make head against Hanniball. T. Liu. lib. 24.
                This was to loue the State more then himselfe. Lewis the eleuenth
tooke more delight then hee receiued content or profite
to change his Officers often. When as a place is executed
worthily and profitably by any one, his dismission is vniust, and
the Princes seruice is wronged:Offices are to bee maintained if they be good. for if the place bee not supplyed
by a man of the like experience and sufficiencie, the Common-weale
is damnified:As the ruine of Families comes commonly from new seruants, so the fall of Estates proceedes from new magistrates which enter into Offices without experience. those that are new come, beeing
greedy of gaine, preferre their owne priuate Interest before all
publicke consideration. The soundest Estates haue alwayes some
vlcers: to change the remedy, and to change the Physition is one
thing. Wounds haue no time to close vp, when they doe often
change plaisters.
            Hee dismist the Duke of Bourbon from the gouernement
of Guienne,Changes in diuers Charges. and gaue it to the Bastard of Armagnac:
                  IOHN of Andie, Lord of Lescun, bastard of Armagnac, Earle of Comminges, head of the house of Riberac. Hee
tooke from the Lord of Bueil the Office of Admirall of France,
and gaue it to the same Bastard, and afterwardes to the Bastard
of Bourbon his Sonne-in-lawe, who did him great seruices;
yet hauing no consideration thereof, hee tooke from him
the Gouernement of Picardie, to giue it to PHILIP of Creuecoeur,
Lord of Cordes. Hee would haue the Lieutenants in
the Gouernement of Bourgondy to hold their places as the
Wolfe by the eare: Hee tooke it from Des Cordes, and gaue it
to Chaumont, who died in the yeare, one thousand foure hundred
eighty one.King. Lewis the eleuenth being discontented that the Lord of Tremouille had not taken Dole, hee tooke from him the Gouernment, and gaue it to Charles of Ambois, who was gouernor of Champagne.
            
            Hee tooke the Seales from PETER of Moruillier, and gaue
them to IUVENEL of Vrsins, from whom hee had taken them
when he came to the Crowne, them hee gaue them to Peter of Oriole:
Hee tooke the Office of Marshall of France from the Lord
of Loheac, and to restore it to him againe hee tooke it from the
Earle of Comminges, bastard of Armagnac. Charles of Melun was
his Lieutenant in the Citty of Paris, hee dispossest him of that
charge to giue it the Earle of Eu, and made him Lord Steward
of his house.
            Entring into Paris hee made Iames of Villiers Lord of Lisle-Adam
               
Prouost of Paris. After the Warre of the Commonweale
hee dismist him from that Charge, and gaue it to ROBERT
of Estoteuille. His whole Chronicle is full of these changes
in all sorts of dignities and Offices.
            
               Magnificence.
               Magnificence of Lewis 11.
                The Maiesty of a Prince is followed by his
Magnificence, which is one of the Flowers of his Crowne; It
is a Foile which giues lustre to this Dyamond,
                  Iamblicus cals Magnificence, the crown of the Empire of princes, & saith, that it is chiefly admired among the principall actions of a Prince. it shewes it
selfe in many places, and vpon many occasions; but her Theter
is in his House, and at his Court, shee presides in his expences,
and appeares in the priuate Ornament of his person.
            
               Lewis the eleuenth did respect it so little,Habit of Lewis 11. as to see his Apparrell
you would haue said, that he desired to liue poore, and to dye
rich. Hee attired himselfe plainly in course Cloath, and tooke
no delight to see sumptuous Apparrell. His Chronicle saith,
That hee ware Doublets of Fustian. Whether hee did it to
make his Fashion more popular; or (by his example) to cut off
vaine and vn-necessary expences, thinking that a King, who
should carry nothing that doth sauour of a Woman, is more adorned
by the Ornaments of the minde, then by those of the body.
A Princes habit should not be too stately, & ful of pompe. Romulus attiring himselfe in scarlet, or purple lost the loue of his people, nor lasciuicous and dissolute, like to Nero, Calligula, Commodus and Heliogabalus, nor of a strange fashion, for the which Hieron of Syracusa was odious vnto his subiects. It neuer represents him well apparrelled but once. This was
when to conclude the Treaty of Conflans, hee went to the Mercers
Grange with a small Traine, and little brute, Attired in a
long Roabe, loose, furred with Ermines, the which was much
more seemely then the other garments which hee was accustomed to
weare.
            
            There is to bee seene at this day in the house of a Councellor
of State,Bed of Lewis 11.
                the bed wherein hee lay, the which wee cannot behold
without admiring the excesse of this Age, and the simplicitie of
that. It is of Yellow and Carnation Damaske, without any Lace,
and the Fringe without fashion. Bodin saith, That in scorne hee
ware a greasie Hat, and the coursest Cloath. In the Chamber
of Accounts there was an Article found of his Expences, making
mention of two shillings for a newe paire of Sleeues to an
old Doublet; and another Article of three halfe-pence for a Boxe
of grease for his Bootes,300000 L sterling. and yet hee raised yearely three millions
more then his predecessors had done, and did alienate a great part
of the Crowne lands.
            The expence of his house was much lesse then that of many Noble
men of that time. All things were very exact there, frugality was recommended
in such sort, and superfluity so odious, as they needed
not to passe out of Sclauonia
               Dissolution hath been great in priuate persons by the examples which Athens doth produce, and among others, of Aesope, a player of Tragedies, who being come into Sclauonia to eate Creuices, which were much esteemed in that Prouince, when as they told that those of Affricke were better, he sailed into Affricke. into Affrick to eate creuises. By the accounts
we find that they increased according to the years voyages
and affaires. It did not exceed three thousand six hundred pounds
starling vntil the yeare 1480, when it amounted to foure thousand,

three hundred threescore and one pounds, eight shillings Sterling:
In the yeare 1481. it came to sixe thousand sixe hundred
sixty and eight pounds Sterling:The expence of the Kings house for that which concerned the mouth onely, was in the yeare 1471. two thousand 800. and three pounds two shillings Sterling: In the yeare 1472: 2900. pounds: The yere 1473, 3280. pounds: In the yeare 1474. 2520. pounds Sterling. The yeare 1475. 3020. pounds. In the yeare 1476. 3040. pounds. in the yeare one thousand, 4. hundred seuenty and seuen, three thousand 600. and foure score pounds: In the yeare 1478. 3480. pounds, and in the yeare 1479, 3700. pounds sterling. And yet hee went not from
Plessis, from the eight of Nouember vntill the seuenth of September,
the yeare following, that he was carried to be buried
at our Lady of Clory.
            The number of Seruants for the ordinary seruice of this expence
was not great, their wages small in comparison of these
times. They serued the whole yeare, and it beganne in October.
There are none but these set downe in the rowle of his voluntary
pensions. Two Chaplins, and to either of them twenty shillings
a month, and to a Clarke of the Chappell tenne shillings: A
Gro
                  •
               me of the Kings Chamber nine pound a yeare; Fowre
Squires of the Kitchin to either twelue pounds a yeare: One
Hastler, one maker of Brothes, a Sauce-maker, a Head-cooke, a
Butler, and two Groomes of the Carriages, to either of them
twenty shillings a month: Two Vnder-Cookes of the Kitchin at
sixeteene shillings a month; a Porter, a Pastry man, a Baker, two
Carters, to either of them sixe pounds a yeare: To a Groome of
the Stable, and two to assist him, eight and forty shillings a
month: A Farrier twelue pounds: The Maister of the Chamber of
the Kings Treasor had sixe score pounds, and the Comptrouler
fifty:King Lewis the 11. gaue thirty pounds of increase to Martin Barthelot, Maister of the Chamber of his Treasure, but the chamber of Accompts would not allow of it without a speciall command, the which was dispatched at Paray le Moinat the sixt of Aprill 1481. They gaue but fiue shillings for the Groomes Liuery, and
foure and twenty shillings for Cloakes for the Clarkes, Notaries,
and Secretaries of the house and Crowne of France.
            His expence was not all in one place, many did profite by it,
and did draw their commodities out of the liuely Springs of the
Princes Magnificence:
                  Lewis remained little at Paris but most at Plessis. I haue obserued in the Accomps of the
Chamber of the Treasure,By the Accompts of the Kings house which were made monthly, we find that in twelue yeares they were made. but twice at Paris, the one in the Kings house, and the other in that of Maister Iohn of Popin court. that there past not any yeare but hee
made many voiages, and that Paris saw him but seldome: In the
meane time he kept not his Chamber to liue at his ease, neither did
hee imitate the first Kings, who did not shew themselues vnto their
subiects but like the Images of the Gods, which they drew once a
yeare out of their gilded boxes: He did visite his Prouinces, hee
spent not the twelue monthes in one sole lodging of the Zodiake:
Neither did hee send his affaires to the Maior of the Pallace.
                  Clouis the 2. the 12. King of France beganne to giue to his successours, vntill Charlemaigne, the name of idle, They were seene but once a yeare.
            
            Magnificence doth not alwaies consist in the priuate expences
of a Princes house,Magnificence how farre it extends. in numbers of Horses and Dogs, nor in the
shew of Lyons, Tygers, Leopards, or Elephants; it should appeare
in Receiuing, Lodging, Feasting, and defraying forraine
Princes and their Embassadours: This Prince in such occasions
made it knowne that Magnificence doth not dwell but in Kings
houses, and that Frances was the Theater: Hee receiued in this
manner the King of Portugall, the Queene of England, and the
Prince of Wales her sonne, René of Aniou King of Sicile, the

Duke of Sauoy, and the Princesses of Sauoy, Anne, Louyse, and
Mary.
               The expence of these three Princesses came to forty two pounds eleuen shillings and a peny, from the 28 of October to the 24 of Nouember.
            
            By the same respects of Magnificence, which will that a Prince
labour to content the eyes, and minds of others, as himselfe,
A Prince doth many things wherewith hee might dispence if hee had none to content but his owne s
                     •
                   lf: Magnum est personam in Repubtueri principis qui non animis solum, sed occulis ciuiū seruire debet. It is a great matter to maintaine the person of Prince in a state, who is not onely bound to serue the Cittizens minds but also their eyes. Cic.
                hee made many other expences, which were esteemed and commended
both by his Subiects and Strangers: He did often, and for
many daies, feast and defray the Embassadours of England, Hungary,
Arragon, and Naples. In the yeare 1477. in March, the king
of England sent the Lord Howard to visite him, being followed
by three score and tenne persons, whom he defrayed all the time
of his abode in France. The good cheere hee made vnto the
English at Amiens, after the Treaty of Pyquigny, and the twelue
pipes of wine, of the growth of Fay Monjan which hee caused to
be conueyed to Deipe to giue to Edward King of England, bound
the English to those cries of ioy which were heard in their Army,
and at their departure: A largesse for the Noble King of France.
            
            But as there is one kind of Magnificence which is all in shew,
and doth purchase great applause among the people, so there is
another which is not so glorious and hath much fruite: It is that
which giues pensions to strangers, and doth bind them to serue
the Prince,He doth gratefie his memory in binding learned men vnto him who haue credit with posterity. Senec.
                which doth nourish, aduance, and recompence good
wits, entertaines excellent Artists, fauours good inuentions, and
all those that haue any credite with posterity.
            There is also an other which is Religious,Religious Magnificence. and which hath not
beene knowne but by the most Christian Kings, who without
wronging the greatnesse of their Maiesty made their houses a refuge
for the miserable: Robert sonne to Hugh Capet had commonly
a thousand poore men in his traine, hee gaue them horses to follow
him, and to pray for him:
                  Lewis the 9. was founder of 28. Colledges in France, who dying commanded his sonne to bee deuout to God, and charitable to the poore. 
               Lewis the eleuenth had ordinarily
sixe score, and in Lent two hundred and forty, whom he fed with
meate from his Table.
            And yet this is not the whole extent of Magnificence, it goes
farther, and will be seene in Plaies, Shewes, and Iousts, and in
things which are rare, and not common;In publicke calamities, the Greeks and the Romans did vow Hecatombs, they did sacrifice a hundred beastes vpon so many piles of wood: Si verò Imperatorum votum esset, centū Leones, centum
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      Aquilae vnà mactabantur. If it were the Emperours vow then were there a hundred Lyons, and a hundred Eagles, slaine together. when as the people did
vow Hecatombes of hundred Oxen, and a hundred Sheepe,
the Emperours did offer a hundred Eagles, and a hundred Lions:
But the expence which is wholy employed for sight, entertaines
the people but till they thinke of the belly▪ A remembrance
which dispenceth with all other things, and hath no share in publicke
cares, but that which doth prouide meanes to content it,
The multitude cares not for the conduct and good successe of affaires, so they find corne at Market: Vulgo vna ex republica Annonae curae. The common people haue no care of the Common-weale, but for Corne. when it endures any want, all Sights, all Plaies, all Sports are tedious,
and makes them say that the Feast is made at their
charge.
            The Princes Magnificence must therefore shew her effects in
things whereas the pleasure incounters with profite, and which
passe not with the contentment which the spirit takes in admiring

them, like vnto the daughter of Maruell which inamels her halfe
circle vnprofitably in the Aire. The Prince must not imitate the
pride of the Pharaohs of Egypt, who employed the sweate of their
Subiects, and the treasure of their Cofers in workes of Ostentation,
They say that the Piramides were vnprofitable workes, but the structure was profitable for the Prince, who by this meanes made his subiects to labor, whom idlenesse had corrupted and drawne to reuolt and sedition. and studied more for vanity then profite: Wherefore Princes
haue caused their Magnificence to be renowned in publicke works,Workes of vanity and ostentation.

               autifying of Townes, which seemed not to haue bene
ruined but to be re-edified more stately, and which haue purchased
the honour to haue left them to their Successours much fairer then
they had receiued them from their Predecessours.The Citty of Romewas bound to the Emperor Augustus for her decoration, and most glorious ornaments, therfore he said: Roman lateritiam accepi, marmoreā relinquo: I receiued Rome built of Brick, I leaue it of Marble.
            
            Wee do not see that he did any great workes in Buildings, for it
is a hard matter for a Prince to hold a Sword in one hand, and a
Trowell in another. Hee caused the Church of our Lady of Clery
to be built, and repaired that of Victory neere to Senlis, he did enrich
and beautify by his bounty the High Altar, with 16. Lampes
of Siluer: His Statue stands on the right hand, wee see it also on
the Portall with that of Queene Charlot, and their Armes round
about, with those of the Dauphin. Phillip Augustus had caused this
Church to be built in remembrance of the happy victory which he
had against the Flemmings:The battell of Bovines in Iuly, 1214. wonne by Phillip Augustus against Otho of Saxony, and Iohn King of England: Ferdinand Earle of Flanders was takē prisoner there and carried to the uure, and the Earle of Salisbury an Englishman to Saint Quentin.
                There remaines nothing of the ancient
building but the Body and the Cloister, the Inclosure of the
Church, all the Quire and the Portall are new, and carry a remarkable
difference of the Architecture of these two raignes: The first
is plaine and low, the other is stately and more raysed then those
times did beare.
            He hath not left in France any other marke of this publicke care,
and although that Phillip de Commines giues him the honour to
haue done more then his Predecessours, in the fortification of his
Realme, yet it was so little as neither the memory nor the fruite
hath remained to his successours.The Romane Emperours haue preserued their memory by the reparatiō of publicke ruines. Augustus restored the Theater of P. Emilius: Tiberius that of Pompey: Caligula the walles of Syracusa Vespasian the Capitoll. Titus the Theaters: Antonyn that of Adrian, and Alexander Seuerus Traians Bridges. This glory which hath beautified
the Bayes of victorious Princes, and which hath giuen a
dumbe eloquence to Marbles to eternise their names, did belong
to Henry the fourth, the restorer of ruines, whereof France imputed
the cause as well to the liberty of the French, and carlessenes of
her Kings, as to the iniury of times & the designes of her enemies.
As wee may giue him the glory to haue restored life, order, & liberty
to France, so we may say that he hath giuen her a new face, new
force, and new beauty: The Fortresses of France, which did tremble
and humble themselues at the first approach of any enemy, are
become inexpugnable. The Kings houses which seemed desart, &
had felt, with the rest, the fury and liberty of troubles, do now cary
vpon their Frontespice, the glorious markes of the felicity of his
Raigne: Barren and inhabitable places are become fertile and frequented,
Townes are added to Townes, and Riuers ioyned vnto
Riuers for the facillity of the Commerce.
            All Bridges, Ports, Passages and High-waies are honoured with
the eternall Monuments of this Princes care for the greatnesse of
his estate, and the necessities of his people, who besides his part

of these publicke workes, retires with one hand for the reward of
his toyles, that which he paies with the other for the tribute of his
duty; for the Treasury of France which hath a continuall ebbing
of that which it receiues, doth not resemble that of some Emperours,
which neuer restores any thing of that which it takes, and
therefore it hath beene compared to Charibdis,The treasure of a couetous Prince is compared by Latinus Pacatius, to the Gulph of Charybdus. Noster ille pirata quicquid vndecunque cō
                     uenerat, id nobis sibique periturum in illā specus sui Caribdim congerebat. Boni nostra ad aerariun
                        •
                     , vna & perpetua via ibāt, nullas eorum reliquias, nulla fragmenta, vel sero victa fastidio, illa cō
                     munis vorago reuomebat. That our Pirate whatsoeuer came from any place, that did hee thrust into his Carybdis to perish both for vs and himselfe: Our goods went one way continually to his treasure, and that common Gulphe: and being glutted did not vomite forth againe any relickes or fragments. but with this
difference that this Gulph casts to shore whatsoeuer it hath deuoured,
but nothing comes out of that bottomelesse pit. Thus
the profite made the toyle pleasing, and they which labour so profitably
complaine during the Solstice of Summer that the day
passeth away too fast: Thus the poore cannot excuse their misery
whilst they haue armes left them:A Prince should entertain publike workes least that idlenesse bred sedition, and that the poore may haue no excuse that they want meanes to get their liuings, for where there is idlenesse they alwaies find Mutines and Theeues. Thus idlenesse, the plague of
States, is banisht, and finds no retreat but among idle hands which
steales the fruits from them which labour.
            The structure of these great and incomparable workes, whereas
we see the marueiles of the industry of Mirons, of Phidies, Appelles,
and Lysippus, and which are worthy to be accounted the
eighth wonder of the world (if it bee true that there were seuen)
could not be effected but by that great Augustus and most victorious
Prince, the best of the Kings of France and Nauarre:The most glorious Title of a Prince is that which the Senate ordained for Traiane. Nee videri potest optimis in sua cuiusque laude praestantior. Minus est enim Imperatorem & Caesarem & Augustum quam omnibus Imperatoribus, & Caesaribus & Augustis esse meliorem. Hee cannot seeme the best that doth not excel them all in their own vertues: It is lesse to be an Emperour, a Caesar, and an Augustus then to be better then all Emperours Caesars and Augustus: Plin. Panegeric.
                None
but the Duke of Suilly, great Surueiour of France, could execute
his Commandements with more order, courage, and care.
France is bound vnto him for her decoration, the enriching of her
Crowne, the restoring of her rights, and the recouery of her first
beauty and felicity. For her he hath first put in practise that great
Maxime of polliticke knowledge: To mainetaine fertile places by
commerce, and barren by handy Trades: This Eloge is not mine owne,
I receiued it from the Kings owne mouth.
            
               Clemency:
               Clemency This goodly Pearle is not seene in his Crowne;
The vertue which rayseth Kings to heauen is Clemency:

                     Orbi quietem, saeculo pacem suo,
                     Haec summa virtus, petitur hac coelum via.
                     Sen. in Octau.
                  
                this great and royall vertue which pardons the afflicted, rayseth vp
them that are deiected,
                  Lewis the 11. knew not how to pardon. and breakes the current of choller, was
vnknowne vnto him: Yet neuer Prince found more occasion to
winne himselfe honour, but that deceitfull Maxime, that a Princes
iustice may alwaies and in all cases dissemble,A Prince may mingle prudence with Iustice, he may bee a Doue and a Serpent, with these three conditions, that it be for the necessary, apparant, and important good of the State, that it be with measure and discretion, and that it be for an offence, and not to offend. and sow the Foxes
skinne vnto the Lyons, fil'd his raigne with tragicall examples of
seuerity, and gaue him in dying that contentment not to haue left
any offence vnpunished.
            
               
Phillip de Commines being to liue vnder the sonnes raigne,
hath not written all he knew, and could haue spoken, vpon the fathers,
and yet he saies but too much to shew his rigour. Hee was
(these are his words) suspitious, as all Princes bee which haue many
enemies, and which haue offended many, as he had done: Hee was not beloued
of great men, nor of many of the meaner sort, and had charged
his Subiects more then euer King had done.
            
               If Commines would haue painted out a cruell Prince, hee
could not haue imployed other coulours then those wherewith
hee sets forth his rigorous prisons, his Cages of Iron, and his fetters:Cardinall Balue inuentor of these Cages of Iron, was lodged there with the first, and continued 14. yeares. Lacum fodit & aperuit eum & incidit in foueā quam fecit. He digged a pit and opened it, and fell into the Ditch whic
                        •
                      hee had made.
Hee saith, That they were of wood couered with plates of Iron,
that he had caused Germanes to make most heauy and terrible fetters
for mens feete,Rigorous prisons of Lewis the eleuenth. and there was a ring to put vpon the legge, very hard
to open like vnto a choller, the chaine was great and waighty, with a
great bullet of Iron at the end, much more weighty then was fit, and they
were called the Kings Snares.
            Although that punishments be the effects of Iustice, and very
necessary, for that hee hurts the good which pardons the wicked,
yet it caries some shew of cruelty, when as the Prince himselfe
seemes more carefull thereof then he ought, and that hee doth
employ them as well against innocents as those that are guilty:
The more rare executions bee, the more profitable is the example. Remedies which curemildly, are to be preferred before thē which bur
                     •
                  ne & mutulate: To affect new punishment, and against accustomed manners of the Country are markes of cruelty. 
               I haue seene (saith Phillip de Commines) good men prisoners with
fetters on their feete, who afterwards came forth with great honour,
and receiued great fauours from him, amongst others, a sonne to
the Lord of Gruture of Flanders, taken in battell, whom the King

doth but distract mens minds, the violent gust of the
Northen wind cannot make a passenger to abandon his Cloake,
whereas the Sunne casting his beames by little and little, doth
heate him in such sort as hee will bee ready to strip himselfe
into his shirit: Generous horses obey the shaddow of a small
Wand, whereas Asses tell their paces by the number of their
blowes.
            The raigne of this Prince was wonderfull stormy, they could
not say of him as of Antonyn, that hee had shedde no bloud.
The raigne of the Emperour Antonyn was so good as Herodian called it 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . that is to say without bloud. 
               Tristan his great Prouost, who for his barbarous and seuere
behauiour, did as iustly as Maximin deserue the name of
Sowre, was so ready in the execution of his rigorous commandements,
as hee hath sometimes caused the innocent to bee
ruined for the offendor: Hee alwaies disposed this Prince rather
to vse a sword to punish faults, then a Bridle to keepe them from
falling.
            A more temperate Spirit would haue staid him, and Princes
in these stormes doe but what pleaseth them which guide
the effects of their Wils. A Prince is no lesse dishonoured by
the multitude of executions,A multitude of executions, saith Seneca, breeds as bad a reputation to the Prince, as a multitude of Burials to a Physitian, too great rigours makes the paines contemptible, augments the number of offendours, and makes them to become wicked through despight. then a Physitian receiues

blame by the death of his Patient: Claud of Seyssell could not
say any thing more bitter to the memory of this Prince then that
which hee writes: That there were seene about the places of his abode
many men hanged vpon Trees, and the prisons, and other houses neere,
full of prisoners, who were often heard day and night, crying out
for the torments which they endured, besides others which were cast into
the Riuer.
            
            
               Many great Princes haue felt the seuerity of his humours: Iohn
Duke of Alençon had in the end as much cause to murmurre
against his iustice, as hee had to commend his Clemency in the
beginning of his Raigne. Hee had beene cond
                     •
                  mned to loose
his head vnder Charles the seuenth: The King restored him to his
liberty and honour, to make him some yeares after vndergoe
the like censure:The Duke of Alençon being prisoner in the Casile of Loches was led to Paris the sixt of Iune, 1473. by the Lord of Gaucort, & Chaletiere Steward of the Kings house, with 24. Gentlemen and 50. Archers. Hee caused him to bee apprehended
and carried to the Towre at the Louure; His Processe was made
in the yeare one thousand foure hundred three score and foureteene,
and a Sentence pronounc't the eightenth of Iuly in these
termes:

touching the great and heynous crimes committed by him, by the
conspiracies, practises, and treaties which hee hath many and
sundry times had, and made, with the English, the ancient enemies
and aduersaries of this Realme, and other Rebels disobedient to the
King, and to the great preiudice of the King, and subuersion of the
publique good of the Realme, forgetting, through ingratitude, the
great grace that the King had done him,The King going into Touraine about the end of the first yeare of his raigne, found Iohn Duke of Alençon prisoner at Loches, and set him at liberty. infringing the conditions
for the which the King had pardoned him, and likewise the quality of
other crimes which hee had committed: Hauing also seene and considered
all that was to bee seene in this party, with mature deliberation,

to receiue death, and to bee executed by Iustice, and with all hath
declared all and euery his goods forfeited to the King, the execution
notwithstanding of the said Iohn of Alençon, reserued vnto
the Kings good pleasure. The King freed him from the paine, but
hee left him one more tedious then that of death, Ignominy and
Imprisonment.
            
            Hee did not also suffer René King of Sicile his Vnkle by the
mothers side to liue in peace: Hee commanded his Court of
Parliament to make his Processe, But it made him answere that hee
could not bee iudged of Treason but in the Kings presence.

                  Bodin in the fourth booke of his Common-weale, the sixt Chapter, saith; that the Court of Parliament made this answere the twenty sixth of April one thousand foure hundred three score and fifteene: It had done the like in the Duke of Alençons Processe in the time of King Charles the seuenth, In the yeare 1458. Hee had the courage to withstand this brunt, and as wee haue

seene, attended vntill that time had cured the vlcer of the Kings
hatred against him.
            The Duke of Nemours could not escape the seuerity of his Iustice,
the which hee had contemned by great relapses into the
same faults. If the Duke of Bourgundy had returned a Conquerour
from the Suisses and Lorraines, the King would haue beene
no lesse troubled to put him to death, then to set him at liberty:
Captiuity is a meanes to free the soule from the tyranny of the body: It is an act of çenerosity to contemne death more then to hate life. Fortium virorum est magis mortem contemnere quam odisse vitam. Q. Cur. lib. 5. The tediousnesse of his prison had disposed his soule to leaue
that of the body without griefe, to contemne death and to hate
life.
            Princes finde the offences of them they haue bound vnto
them more sencible and lesse pardonable: The King had erected
the County of Nemours into a Dutchy,Relapses of the Duke of Nemours. he had pardoned him
his felony of the League of the Common-weale, and yet forgetting
the effects of such a bond, and his oath of fealty, presently
after the Duke of Guienne was retired into Brittany hee sent
a man vnto him, disguised like a Frier, to offer him both his body
and goods, protesting to serue (as hee did) against the King his
Soueraigne Lord. The Duke of Guiennes death forced the Duke
of Nemours to flye the second time to the Kings mercy, for a
second pardon, which the King granted him vpon an oath which
hee tooke neuer to conspire against his Prince:The extract of the Processe sent to the Prouines and Parliaments, shewes that this oath was taken in the presence of sixe Apostolike Notaries, and sixe Royall Notaries, and vpon the Crosse end Crowne of our Sauiour. soone after hee
assisted the Earle of Armagnac, and renewed the practises and
intelligences which he had with the Duke of Bourgundy: All
these inconstant actions weere degenerated into so many crimes,
which might not remaine vnpunished, and which did assure him
that death could not surprise him. His soule was bound to resolue
the same day that hee entred into resolutions, which could not be
otherwise expiated.
            
               Innocency may bee surprized, crimes cannot, for the offence and the punishment are Twinnes: it is also a kinde of content to foresee which way wee must passe. Iulian dying did thanke the Gods for that they had not kild him by surprize. The King caused him to bee taken at Carlat, and sent him
prisoner to the Castle of Pierrescise, which was then without
the walles of Lyon. A while after hee caused him to bee conducted
to Paris, where his Processe was made by the Court of
Parliament.By an accord made betwixt King Lewis the eleuenth, and Iames of Armagnac Duke of Nemours, the 17. of Ianuary, in the yeare 1469. the said Duke did renounce his place of Peere, being content to be tryed as a priuate person, if hee did faile in his obedience to the said King, who did not shew that rigour, but did furnish his Court with Peeres for his iudgement, made at Noion the fourth of August 1477. Du Tiller.
                The Lord of Beaujeu Earle of Clermont was
President by the Kings Commission: Hee confest all that hath
beene formerly spoken, and moreouer that hee had had intelligence
with the Constable of Saint Paul to seaze vpon the
King and Dauphin:Confessions of the Duke of Nemours. That the Duke of Bourgundy had sent
him word if hee could take them hee should haue the Citty of
Paris and the Ile of France for his part: That the Dauphin should
be deliuered into the hands of Monsir 
               de Bresse, and the King transported
out of the Realme of France:The Duke of Nemours confessed more that hee had consulted and giuen credit to a Frier a Doctor of Diuinity, whose bookes had beene burnt in the Bishops Hall at Paris. Vpon these occasions
he was condemned to loose his head at the Hales in Paris, the

fourth of August, one thousand foure hundred three score and
seuenteene: Hee was a Peere of France, but this quallity was
omitted in his Sentence, for that by an accord made the seuenteenth
of Ianuary, in the yeare one thousand foure hundred
three score and nine, hee had renounced his place of Peere,
and was content to bee tryed as a priuate-person, in case of relapse.
            The sentence of death was pronounced vnto him by Peter of
Oriole Chancellour of France:A Prince shold alwaies keepe his word inuiolably, and hold faith the foundation of Iustice. It is a great glory for a Prince when his tongue and heart agrees.

for it appeared not, nor to the Kings Clemency, which
was tyred with releeuing him, hee appealed to Faith, which is the
first vertue of a Prince, saying: That hee had not yeelded but vpon
assurance of a pardon, which was promised him. The King protested
that he had not promised him any thing, and that he would rather
haue forced him in the Castle of Carlat, then receiue him to
saue his life, hauing so often deserued death. Hee therefore would
haue the chiefe points, whereof he was conuicted, drawne out
of his processe, and sent to other Parliaments throughout the
Prouinces, to the end they might know what had incensed the seuerity
of his Iustice.
            Hee neuer pardoned any that had beene ingaged in the league
of the Common-wealth, nor those which had banded themselues
against him to follow his brothers dessignes. His hatred against
the Bishop of Paris appeared most after the death of this Prelate,
for being aduertised that hee was lamented by all the Orders
of Paris, hee commanded the Prouost and Aldermen of Paris to
make him an Epitaph, which shewed the bad seruices hee had
done his Maiesty, by his intelligences with the Princes of the
League. As they that were neerest vnto his bloud haue felt the
effects of his wrath, so they which thought themselues to be neerest
vnto his heart haue not beene freed,
                  Princes fauors are not immortall. Fato potentiae (saith Tacitus speaking of Maecenas) raro sempiternae, an satias cupit, aut illos cum omnia tribuerunt, aut his cum iā nihil reliquum est quod cupiant. and haue not growne

that is fauoured being full of fauours doth not care to husband

Lord of Ludé, and the Earle of Sancerre in. Antony of Chasteauneuf
Lord of Lau, may well be produced for an example, both
of his fauours and of the miseries which doe accompany fauorites:
The Chronicle saith that hee was chiefe Butler of France,
Seneschall of Guienne, Lord Chamberlaine to the King, and

caused him to bee put in prison in the Castle of Suilly vpon Loire:
He commanded Tristan to draw him from thence and to leade him
to Vsson in Auuergne, but he escaped.
            
               
Many were punished for this euasion, Charles of Melun, a man at
Armes of the Admirals company, and Captaine of Vsson lost his
head at Loches, his wiues sonne called Remonet, and the Kings Atturney
at Vsson.
            This Charles of Melun must not bee taken for Charles of Melun
who commanded in the Bastille, when as Paris was besieged by the
Army of the league, and who could not auoyd it, but his fidelitie
was otherwise censured by his King then it appeared in the proofes
of his seruice. He felt the stormes of fortune in the disgrace which
hee receiued when as the king tooke from him the Office of Lord
Steward of France, to giue it to the Lord of Craon.
            The ordinary examples of new punishments for old faults made
repentance vaine: his searches being feared of Innocents, did forbid
them that were guilty to trust vnto the assurances of his clemency.
All were in feare, and stood vpon their guard, not so much
for him as against him. They knew well, that he had his eyes blindfold,
to strike of euery side, according to his choler, and the suddennesse
of Tristan,
               Seuerity of Tristan the Hermit. who had reduced the markes of Maiesty to the
Sword and Halter. If hee had sworne by as many Gods as the Aegyptians,
Assyrians, Persians and Grecians did worship,The Egiptians did worship as many Gods as the Earth brought them forth fruits, the Assyriars as many as they had Town: the Persians as many as they saw stars, or fires the Gretians as many as they had fountaines. no man
would haue trusted him; wherefore they that followed his brother

to serue the Duke of Guienne, who honoured him with many
charges, and among others, with the guard of his person, had
retired himselfe vnto his house at Nancy after the death of this
Prince:If a Prince hath any subiect of choller, it should bee open, and soone gone, it is not generous to conuert it into hatred. and the King, who had both his choler sudden, and his
hatred long against offences of this kinde, and who neuer held the
smallest that were committed against him, to be light, sent to take
him prisoner by his Gossip Tristan, and held him about a moneth
in suspence what he should doe with him: for hee had committed
no fault, but in seruing the Duke of Guienne loyally, preseruing his
faith vnstained amidst great temptations, and seeing himselfe a
prisoner, hee did more glory to bee an Innocent in prison, then
guilty at liberty:Admirable is

of him, if he had a will to serue him as faithfully as he had done
his brother. He answered, that he could neuer do so great seruice
vnto his Maiesty; but his affection would be greater; and that the
seruice which he had done vnto the Duke of Guienne, was a proofe
of the fidelity which he would alwayes shew to him that should be
his Maister. The King told him, that hee would vse his seruice, and

of strangers,The Infidelity of subiects forceth Princes to imploy strangers for their guards. Alex. Seuerus was the first which tooke souldiers of a rough aspect terrible & fearfull, and therefore Dyon saith that his entry into Rome was odious. The Emperours did ordinarily imploy Gaules, Italia

of an hundred Gentlemen for the guard of his person: then remembring
that his wife had beene much altered and distempered

with his imprisonment;
                  Lewis fears the reuēge of women. and that the weakest are strong enough to
doe mischiefe, hee said vnto him; Hearken Captaine Claude, women
are bad when they will do a mischiefe; behold a paire of perfumed gloues
which thou shalt carry to thy wife from me, with fiue hundred Crownes
which are in them: I know that she was much afraid when as my Gossip
Tristan went to take thee, bid her that shee should not wish mee ill,
and come againe to mee three Moneths hence with thy Companie.
I giue thee one of my best Mules to carry thee more easily.
            
            This was the first French Company, there hauing beene none
before but that of Scottishmen,The first guard of the body was Scottishmen, & therefore the Captaine of the Scottish guard carries the Title of the first Captaine of the Guardes of the Kings person: he begins the yeare, and serues the first quarter. and it is called at this day, The ancient

displeasure which he receiued during the wrath and indignation of
King Charles his Father. Three great personages of the Parliament

and afterwards a President. Guy Pape, a Councellor in the same Parliament,
and held by the soueraigne Courts and Vniuersities of all
Europe, the Oracle of the Law, and René of Tomassin, a Councellor
also, felt in their Age, the rough blowes of this Princes remembrance.
They had all three declared themselues for the Father
against the sonne, and not willing, in this diuision, to wauer
betwixt Iustice and Discretion, resisted his designes, and diuerted
all those which strayed from their duety to follow this
Prince.
            As soone as Lewis came to the Crowne, hee remembred all
this,A Prince which pardons offences, giues a great peace vnto his conscience. The Panegerick of Constantine hath this goodly passage: Sibi imputet quisquis vti noluit beneficio tuo, nec se dignum vita iudicauit quum per te liceret vt viueret: tu quod sufficit conscientiae tuae etiam non merentibus pepercis
                        •
                     i. Sed ignosce dicto non omnia potes, dij te vindicant & inuitant. Let him impute it to himselfe that would not make vse of thy bounty, neither did he thinke himselfe worthy of life, when he might haue liued by it: thou to satisfie thine owne conscience, hast spared euen them that deserued it not. But pardon me, thou canst not doe all, the Gods reuenge thee, and inuite thee. not to make vse of it to the glory of Clemency, and to the
content of a good Conscience, which takes delight to pardon euen
them which deserue it not, and remits the reuenge to God, but
to giue new punishments to old offences; and as his nature was
more prompt to reuenge an offence, then to reward a good seruice,
and more easie to hate then to loue,They are very naturall passions to be sensible of iniuries. It is a dulnesse and basenesse to haue no feeling of an iniury, and it is folly to hold that for an iniury which is not. Irasci in quibus non oporter, insipiens est: non irasci in quibus oporter, insipientis est. Arist. in 3. Eth. hee caused a Commission
to bee dispatched the two and twentieth day of Aprill, in the
yeare 1462. and sent it to the President of the Chamber of Accounts,
and to one of the Stewards of his house, to make the Processe
for these three good seruants to king Charles the seuenth.
            
               
               The chiefe points of the Accusation were, That they had assisted
and seconded King Charles in the detention of Dauphinè (for so
they spake) from the Dauphin Lewis, the true and onely Lord of
that Prouince: That they had crost the designes of their Soueraigne
Lord, and that the generall Estate of the Prouince, assembled at Grenoble,
did not grant him a summe of money to supply his wants when
as hee was in Flanders. That Baylé had imprisoned all his seruants
which came about his affaires, and depended wholly of king Charles;
from whom hee had obtained, for one of his sonnes, the Archbishoppricke
of Ambrun; and for another, the place of Atturney Generall.
            The accused were heard, and the Innocency which they felt
in their Soules, did put such generous words into their mouthes,
as the Iudges hearing them, did not distinguish good men but
by the hatred of their Prince, and their hard Fortunes, holding
them more worthy of the Recompence of Prytaneus,
               The Iudges consulted after what manner they should put Socrates to death: Cicero saith, that vpon the diuersity of their opinions, hee spake after this manner: Ego ob ea quae feci dignū me censeo qui publicitus alar in Prytaneo.
                then
of the Seuerity of Areopage: Yet they were forced vpon these
Accusations, to pronounce a sentence the second of Iune following,
by the which they were declared, conuicted of Felonie,
Ingratitude and Treason committed against the Dauphin,A sentence very rigorous. depriued
of their Offices, Charges and Dignities, and condemned to restore
the Fees receiued by them since the Dauphins departure into Flanders,
their Fees, Landes, Signiories, Iurisdictions, and other goods
depending of the Dauphin confiscate, and themselues banished for euer
out of Dauphiné, with defence neuer to returne againe vpon paine of
death.
            
            They ended the remainder of their dayes vnder the rigour of
this Iudgment, and and left nothing to their Children, but the
hope of a milder Reigne, hauing not tasted any vnder this
Prince.Those which had beene Donotaries of these goods, would not leaue them, and opposed to the Letters of CHARLES the eighth, that of LEVVIS the eleuenth, by a Sentence solemnly giuen by the Commissioners in the presence of the Kings Lieutenant, dated the eight and twentith day of Iune, in the yeare 1484. It was said, Priorem sententiam minus debité fuisse latam nec talemeos pati debuisse, sed po
                        •
                     ius absoluendos. The first sentence was not duly had, neither should they haue suffered it, but were rather to bee absolued. M. de Franc, Treasurer of France at Grenoble instructed mee herewith. After his death, King Charles the eighth, by his letters
dated the three and twentieth day of March, in the yeare 1483.
restored them to their Honours, Fame and Reputation, and would
that all their goods should bee restored vnto them, notwithstanding
any opposition which was made by them that held
them as confiscate.
            The examples of this seuerity shewes the reason of the feare
and distrust which troubled his minde, and kept him shut vp like
the vestall fire, and set Care and Silence in guard about him, being
reasonable that hee should feare those which hee had hurt:
for neither great nor small can loue them that haue wronged them.
Herewith accords that which Claudius of Seyssell hath written.The feare which growes from rigour and seuerity doth neuer purchase the peoples loue. Oderunt quem me▪tuunt. And it is hard long to resist the publicke hatred. Plebi multae manus, principi vna ceruix. A multitude hath many hands, and a Prince but one necke.
He openly discouers the feare which he had of his subiects when as

hee heard say,
                  Galeas D. of Millan brother in law to the King. that Duke Galeas Sforce had been slaine by certaine
Millanois in the Citty of Millan vpon a festiuall day, and in the
Church: for he augmented his guards about his person, and forbad
them to suffer any man to approach neere him; and if any one
did striue, hee commanded them to kill him. And moreouer hee
caused a page to carry a Pertuisan after him, to defend himselfe if any
should offer to outrage him; the which (beeing come into his
Chamber) was set at his beddes head: And truly it appeared plainly
at his death, whether he were beloued or hated: for then all sorts
of people reioyced, few were sorry for it; no not his very seruants,
and they to whom hee had done most good. But if nothing
but the dislike of the people had blemished the memory of this
great Prince, it had not beene lesse glorious; the Iudgements of
the multitude are Iudgements of folly, and the affections of the
people are alwayes indiscreet, they reiect that which is good, and
approue that which is bad; what they say is false, what they commend
is infamous, what they vndertake is fury, and they make
things greater then they are.They that haue wel known the people, haue compared their iudgements to a tempest. In Imperita multitudine est varietas & inconstantia & crebra tanquam procella, sic sententiarum commutatio. In the vnskilful multitude there is variety & inconstancy, and often like vnto a tempest, so often they change their mindes. Cic. pro domo sua.
               
            
            
               His Iustice.
               Iustice. They cannot depriue him of the honour of the erection
of two parliaments, to doe iustice to them of Guienne, and
of Bourgondy. He instituted that of Bourdeaux in the beginning
of his Reigne, and that of Dijon presently after the death of
Charles the Terrible. We haue shewed before how much he was
grieued for that hee had not reformed many things that were deformed
vnder his reigne, and especially the administration of Iustice.
He had beene bred vp in an Age so full of liberty, that as he
had beene forced to see and suffer many iniustices,A Prince shold neuer dispence with the lawes of reason. Those words are flatteringly tyrannicall, Licet si libet, in summa fortuna id equius quod validius, nihil iniusta quod fructuo sunt; sanctiras, pietas, fides priuata hona sunt, qua iuvat Reges eant. That is lawfull that they list; in a great fortune that is iustest that is of most force, there is nothing vniust that brings profile; sanctity, Piety and Faith are priuate vertues: Kings may go which way they please. The Law is the Prince which wee must obey, the head which wee must follow, and the rule whervnto we must apply all our actions. Arist. 3. Polit. It is the inuention and the gift of the Gods. Demost. in Aristog.
                so hee did not
care but to doe iustice himselfe, according to the lawes of his will,
thinking that his duty was contained within the limits of his pleasure,
and reason within those of his will.
            But admit his life were so pure and sincere,Hatred of Lewis 11. against the parliamēt. as the most seuere Cato
could finde no cause of reprehension, yet would it bee hard to
excuse that which Philip de Commines saith, That hee hated the Parliament
of Paris, and that hee had resolued to bridle it. This is
not like a little flye vpon the face of his reputation to beautifie it,
but a malitious vlcer to disfigure it. It is the duty of a good Prince
to giue authority to the administration of his soueraigne Iustice, to
maintaine those venerable heads which conceiue the Oracles, and
preserue the rules of state, who are alwaies laden with mortar to repaire
the ruines, and are the Ministers and Interpreters of the law,k
which is the rarest inuention, and the most excellent gift that Heauen
hath giuen to men.
            The rootes of this hatred were very deepe, and the first effects
did appeare in the yeare 1442. when as K. Charles the 7. his father

left him at Paris, to command there in his absence. The Earle of
Maine sought to make vse of this occasion, and of his fauour to
haue certaine priuiledges verified. The Court of Parliament being
prest, and in a manner forst, put this clause in the verification; By
the expresse commandement, to shew that if their suffrages had been
free, it had not been done;We finde often in the Registers of Soueraigne Courts these words, De expresso mandato: and De expresissimo mā
                     dato, and sometimes, Multis vicibus reiterato.
                he sent for the Presidents of the Court,
and commanded them to put out that clause, else hee would leaue
all, and would not go out of Paris vntill it was done. The wisdome
of the Court contented him, the clause was put out of the Decree,
and retained vpon the Register.
            The change which he made in the Parliament presently after his
Coronation, was a branch of this root;
                  Iohn of la Vacquety was Recorder of the Town of Arr as, when as after the death of Duke Charles the King did send to summon it to yeeld. La Vacquerie said that it might not be, for it was of the ancient patrimony of the Earles of Flanders, & descended to the 
                     •
                   daughters for want of heires male. and I thinke that it serues
for a reason, for that vpon the execution of the Treaty of Conflans,
the letters were directed to the Chancellour and Priuy-Councell
before the Parliament. It is also true, that hee would
often haue had the willes of the Court liable to his; and that hauing
threatned it vpon the refusall it made to verifie some Edicts
which it had found vniust,Whether a Magistrate bee allowed to quit his Office rather then to verifie an Edict, is a question treated by Bodin in the second booke & fourth chapter of his Common-weale, but very superfluous, for there is not any one but knowes therein what he should doe. the President la Vacquery (whom hee
had drawne from the seruice of the Princesse of Flanders) came
vnto him with a good number of other Presidents and Councellors
in their scarlet roabes. The King being amazed to see this
red procession, demanded wherefore they came. Sir, (answered la
Vacquerie) we come to resigne vp our places into your hands, and to endure
whatsoeuer it shall please you, rather then to wrong our consciences
in verifying the Edicts which you haue sent vs. Hee was very sensible
of these words of Conscience, and did not willingly like of any
thing that was spoken to charge it: he presently called them backe,
and promised neuer to doe any thing but what should bee iust
and reasonable: yet this course was not commended by them
who compare a Magistrate leauing his charge (for that he cannot
allow of the Princes will) to a Marriner which abandons the
Helme during a Tempest,A Magistrat
                     •
                   should not quit his charge for any respect. or to a Physitian, who iudging the
Disease incurable, doth not vovchsafe to apply Remedies to
asswage the paine when as hee sees those that may cure it are in
vaine.
            In these occasions the examples of good men, whom wee
must imitate, and the aduice of wise men whom wee must honour,
should carry a light before iudgement. Hee who first (in
France) had the keeping of the sacred Seales of two Crownes,
seeing himselfe sometimes forced to haue the constancy of his
duety striue with the absolute commandements of the King,
shewes how others, ouer whom the dignity of his Office, his vertues,
experience and merits giue preheminence, should compose
and gouerne their Actions.
            When as the King, to free himselfe from the Importunity
of some Spirites which are hard to content, and who abusing
discretion in demanding, grow discontented when they vse liberty
in refusing, commandes him to passe the Seale for things which

exceede the ordinary formes of Iustice, and are both without
President and Reason.Example is a cleere light in doubtful things: for those which are not grounded vpon example, cannot bee maintained by reason. Quod exemplo fit, id etiam iure fieri putant. That which is done ly example, that they thinke lawfully done. Cic. ad Sulpitium.
                Hee hath beene heard to say, that hee
should hold himselfe inexcusable, vnworthy of his charge, and
to carry the Title, of the first Minister of the Kings Soueraigne
Iustice, if hee did represent vnto him the wrongs which
it receiued in commaunding him things forbidden by the lawes,
and which should bee odious to his owne iudgement, if importunity
had not rather wrested then obtained them from
his bounty;Iustice is the felicity of Empires. they haue seene how discreetly to his Admonitions
hee added most humble prayers not to wrong the most sacred
thing which the wisedome of God hath left to Princes for the
felicity of their estates.
            And when these Admonitions haue not preuailed, that his
Maiestie hath had other motions, and that the effects which seemed
contrary to Iustice, haue made him see causes which
Time, the Men, and the Affaires haue made lawfull and necessary,
hee hath alwayes conuerted his Reason into Obedience,
contenting himselfe to haue shewed the integrity of his minde,
without opposition against the will of his Prince, which is aboue
the Lawes, and doth declare all that iust which doth accomodate
his Affaires: for there is no Lawe which commaundes a Magistrate
to ruine himselfe in maintaining Iustice against the power
of his Prince; and Wisedome, which carries a light before all other
vertues, will that a man faile in any thing rather then himselfe.Among the Precepts which Polybius sent to Demetrius, to draw him out of the danger into which youth and indiscretion had ingaged him, this is remarkable. Quit all rather then thy selfe.
               
            
            When as the Princes will strayes from reason, it must bee
reclaimed mildly by discretion; wee must thinke that hee can doe
nothing without the aduice of his Parliaments:Kings haue alwayes had a Councell a part, to consult & resolue vpon the great affaires of their estate. The peeres of France did not enter into the Kings Councel, & their quality did not priuiledge them, if they did not please the King. It is also obserued in the Ordonances for the gouernment of the realme, and for the Regency in the absence and minority of Kings, they doe not in any sort speake of the Peeres of France. The King
should bee no King if there were (in his Realme) an Authority
aboue his. Great resolutions, which concerne the safety of the
State, are not treated of in great Assemblies, where as the secret,
which is as the soule, cannot bee long kept in, but doth euaporate.
Matters are neuer kept secret in great Assemblies: whatsoeuer was done in the Senat of Rome, was blowne abroad, the Senators Children told newes to their Mothers; and Titus Liuius wonders that the Embassadors of Greece and Asia had discouered nothing of the speech which King Eumenes had vsed in open Senat against King Perseus.
               
            
            Monarkes haue alwayes had a Councell separated from the
Senate, which is otherwise busied enough with the flowing and
ebbing of Sutes, and they haue not onely reserued great affaires
to their Councell, but they would haue chosen persons confifidently
to impart vnto them their most important affaires. This
is not without President: for the greatest and most happy Founders
of the Roman Empire, had (besides the Senate) a Priuie
Councell of few persons.
                  Iulius Caesar had for his priuy Councellors, Q. Paedius, and Corn. Balbus: Augustus had Maecenas and Agrippa, with whom hee treated his greatest, and most important Affaires.
            
            
               
The Parliaments haue the care of the execution of the Kings
Edicts, they publish them, and cause them to bee obserued:
they keepe the Registers, that at neede they may haue recourse
to them. It is true that Princes haue sometimes shewed themselues
so absolute in their willes, as the wise men of their Councell,
not beeing able to restraine or moderate them, haue often
allowed the oppositions which the Parliaments haue made to
their Edicts, and fauoured them for that they were conformable
to reason, and agreeing with the publicke good. For although
the Soueraigne bee aboue the Lawes, and that hee may derogate
from Right and Law, wherein Soueraignty doth properly
consist, yet it is necessary that the absolute power bee restrained
by the Ciuill, and that he consider, that in destroying the Law,
and offending Iustice, he is like vnto the Iuy, which puls downe the
wall that beares it vp.
            
               I leaue it vnto the wise to consider, if they did well to put into
the mouth of King Charles the ninth,Words of K. Charles to the parliament. (the thirteenth yeare of
his Age, and the second of his Reigne) these wordes:
               These wordes are reported by Bodin in the 3d
                   book of his Common weale, the first chapter, and hee addes, that the Parliament made other admonitions, for that there was a diuision vpon the publication of his Letters, which gaue occasion of the Decree of the Priuy Councell the 24 of September following, by the which the diuision was declared void, & the Parliament forbidden to put into deliberation the Ordonances proceeding from the King concerning affaires of State; the which was also done by letter patents in the yeare 1528. I will not
that you deale with any other thing but to doe good and speedy Iustice:
for the Kings my Predecessors haue not set you in the place where you
are, but to that effect, and not to make you my Tutors, nor protectors
of the Realme, nor preseruers of my Citty of Paris: And when I
shall commaund you any thing, if you finde any difficulty, I shall bee
content you acquaint me with it; which done, without any further reply
I will bee obeyed.
            But when the State is gouerned by a wise Prince, whose reputation
is grounded vpon great and eminent vertues, they haue
no other part in the Estate,The Authority of the king is an Ocean. but the Honour and the Obedience.
The duety of a soueraine Magistrate is to obey the Prince, to bend vnder his obedience, to cō
                  mand his subiects, to defend the warlicke, to resist the mighty, and to do Iustice to all. A Regall power is an Ocean, into the which all others,
like vnto Riuers, loose their name: They bee as Starres, which
borrow their light from the Sunne, and haue none in his presence.
            It is sometimes necessary that they resist those commandements
which haue beene rather extorted by importunity, then obtained
by reason from the Princes motion; and the admonitions
which they make in such occasions, should bee alwayes considered.
But if the Prince haue other Reasons, and other respects,
and that his thoughts go not the common way, it is not for them
to shew themselues difficult, neither must they attend a third command;
and it were better to dissemble and support some things
extraordinary to the Princes will, then to incense him. It is well
knowne, that the obstinacy and resistance of PAPINIAN to
the will of CARACALLA, made him more cruell and violent.
                  Caracalla hauing put his brother Geta to death, he commended Papinian to make his excuse vnto the Senat. Papinian answered suddenly, That he would not do it, and that it was not so easie to excuse, as to commit a particide. Caracalla incensed with this answere, put him to death, and continued his cruelties, which a more discreet proceeding had restrained. Spartiat.
               
Wise men thinke one thing, but they do not vtter it: They alwayes

wayes goe one way, but they goe not still the same pace. If a
storme hinders them from comming into the hauen, it is wisedome
to obey the Winde, and not to bandy against the Tempest.
The Office of a Wise man is comprehended by Cicero in these words: Vt in nauigando tempestati obsequi arti
                        •
                      est, sic omnibus nobis in administranda Repub. proposit
                        •
                     m esse debet. Non idem semper dicere sed idem semper spectare. As in sailing it is Art to obey the Tempest, so should all wee doe in the gouernment of the Common-weale. Not alwayes to speake the same thing, but to look to the same end.
            
            
               Lewis the eleuenth strained his absolute power vnto the
height: His Prouost went and tooke prisoners out of the Consergerie
of the Pallace, and caused them to bee drowned
right against the Mercers Grange. Towardes the end of his
dayes, hee found his Conscience much opprest with the contempt
of Iustice: hee would haue repaired it, but he was come to
the Sabaoth of the weeke, when it was no longer lawfull to labour.
            In Aprill 1482. hee sent vnto the Court of Parliament an Act
of the Oath which hee tooke at his Coronation,The King in his Oath at his Coronation, doth promise to defend his subiects from all violence & wrong, and that in all iudgements hee will commaund equity and mercy, to the end that God, who is mercifull, may grant it to him and his subiects. to exhort
them to doe good Iustice, and to free him from that bond. It is
that wherein the condition of Princes is to bee lamented: They
are laden with the very weight of their Consciences, and with
the excesse which hath beene committed throught all the Orders
of the Realme, for that they haue neglected the remedies. What
peace can a soule haue which labours to fight against his owne
faults and other mens?It is a troublesome enterprise to correct his owne vices, and to striue against other mens. Neque enim multum prodest vitia sua projecisse si cum alienis rix 
                        •
                     ndum est. Neither hath hee profited much that hath cast away his owne faults, if hee must contend with other mens. SENEC.
               
            
            Hee that shall consider how easily hee did communicate with
all sorts of persons, and how willingly hee did heare them, he
will thinke that if hee had not a care of Iustice in generall, hee
had done it to all men in particular: But hee erred as well in
this, as in any other thing. But it is equally bad to giue eare to
all the World, and not to any man, and hee made it knowne,
that in matters which are held perfect among men, there is alwayes
some thing to bee taken away, or added, and that is onely
perfect, where there is nothing wanting, nor any thing that exceeds
it.There is nothing perfect in the vertues of men: Nothing can come from man that is in euery degree perfect. Nunquam è mortali semine nascetur qui sit omnibus bonitatis numeris absolutus. Hee shall neuer bee borne of mortall seede that shall bee absolute in all goodnesse, DIONYS. HALIC. lib. 8.
               
            
            
               PHILIP DE COMMINES hath obserued in two places of
his History, that his eare was open to euery man. In the first
hee saith; Neuer any man did lend so much eare to men, nor did
enquire of so many things as hee did, nor that desired to knowe
so many men. In the second: Hee medled with many meane things
of his Realme, which hee might well haue forborne, but his humour
was such, and so hee liued. And his memory was so great, as hee remembred
all things, and knew all the world, both in all Countries,
and about him.
            It is the office of a King to heare the complaints of his subiects
with mildenesse and gentlenesse, which doth not blemish Maiesty.
God who hath constituted them Iudges ouer their Subiects, will

require reason of the Iustice which hath bene demanded and not
done,
                  Kings should giue an account of the administration of Iustice ouer their people: Wisd. 6. Audite Reges terrae & intelligite, discite iudices finium terrae, praebete aures vos, qui continetis multitudines, & placetis vobis in turbis nationū, quoniam data est à Domino potestas vobis & virtus ab Altissimo, qui interrogabit opera vestra, & cogitationes: quoniam cum effetis Ministri regni illius nō recte iudicastis nec custodistis legem Iustitiae

                  , ne
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   secum dū voluntatē Dei ambulastis: Heare 
                        •
                      yee Iudges of the earth, vnderstand, &c.
                To demaund Iustice of a King is to do him a kind of homage
which doth not belong to any other, and to confesse that he
holds the ranke ouer men that God doth ouer Kings: But for that
they cannot participate with euery thing, see all, heare all, not bee
euery where,Princes relye vpō their Ministers. they relye vpon the dilligence and fidelity of their
seruants, whereof some assist them with their wits, counsell, and
tongues, and others with their hands, swords, and fortune. France
hath alwaies beene seconded by men of this quality, it brings
more forth daily, and is not weary of so many Childe-birthes.
Princes are like worke-men, their Officers are the Iustruments with
the which they may cut and fashion as they please: And although
all charges bee distinguished and haue their bounds, that the
Trowell may not do the office of the Hammer, yet they tend all
to one end, the seruice of the Prince, whereon depends the publick
safety, which is the perfection of the worke.
            The Princes eare is like vnto the Temple of the Goddesse
Horta, which was alwaies open, but the prayers must be short and
guided by reuerence and humility, for Iupiter of Crete hath
eares at his feete: Those which are vniust, are dead towards the
King, and mortall towards God for him that makes them: Wee
must speake vnto the King as if God vnderstood it, and none must
speake vnto God as if we were vnderstood by men. There are
some which demand things of Kings which they would not giue
to them that aske them, and others that would blush if the prayers
which they make vnto God were knowne: Wherefore a Prince
sends such petitions to whom hee pleaseth to see if they bee iust
and ciuill; It were impossible for him to heare them and determine
them, without doing wrong to those affaires which require no
delay to resolue on. The greatnesse of his Maiesty is wronged
when as they make him discend into the care of base things.
It is importunity to a Prince to giue him an account of base things, When as Pliny wrote to Traian, De seruis damnatis quise Ministerijs publicis immiscuerunt. Of slaues condemned who had wrought in the publike workes: Hee addes this Preface to his Letter: Salua magnitudine tua, Domine, descendas oportet ad meas curas cùm ius mihi dederis referendi ad te de quibus dubito. My Lord, sauing your Greatnesse, you must descend vnto my cares, hauing giuen me leaue to impart my doubts vnto you. Wisedome, which is the light of his actions, and the Serpent
which shadowes his fore-head,
                  Bochoris King of Egipt being by nature rough, sowre, and violent, the Goddesse Isis sent him a Serpent, which wrething about his head did make a shadow, to the end his iudgement should bee seasoned with Prudence and Iustice. forbids them to trouble their
heads for all sorts of affaires, the which are often represented by
men, which neither see farre off nor much behind them, who confounds
their discourses in the beginning, and speaking without
reason would be heard with patience.
            Wee must beautify this discourse with the same authority
which gaue lustre vnto the precedent. The discourses which are
held at the Table of the Chancellours of France are alwaies vpon
some goodly Subiect, pleasing to learne, and profitable and necessary
to vnderstand, and wee may say, that delicacy of wits
findes that there which excesse did furnish to the appetite of

                  〈4 pages missing〉
               
               
men for foure monthes, to deliuer into his hands the foure chiefe
Townes of Brabant, Brussels, Antwerpe, Macklin, and Louan, and
to leaue him the Country of Flanders in Soueraignety without
homage if he could conquer it. These offers proceeding rather
from the necessity of affaires, then from the Kings intention, who
desired nothing but to aduance his affaires in Bourgundy and
Artois, and to diuide and weaken his enemies forces, were well
and wisely weyed by the King of England,The lesse which is profitable and certaine is to be preferred before the more which is vnprofitable and vncertaine. The King of England desires rather the Countries of Bullen in effect, then Brabant & Flāders in hope: neither could the English consent vnto a warre which did interrupt their Trafficke with the Low Countries. who answered that
if the King were so well minded to make him a sharer of his
conquest, he had rather haue some of those which were already
conquered in Picardy, and that in deliuering him Bulloine hee
would declare himselfe for him against the Princesse of Bourgundy.
            The King then hauing contemned the way of mildenesse and
reason to follow that of force and fortune, neglected also the occasion
which this first amazement of the Princesse and her people
put into his hands, and leauing her the liberty to marry her selfe,
and to carry those goodly Prouinces to a strange house, all things
became impossible: Maximilian, hauing married the Princesse, raysed
with great solemnity the order of the Golden Fleece,
                  Oliuer dela-March, reports the ceremony which was made at the raising of this Order, and saith that they wondered the King had not preuented the Arch-Duke. to shew
that he would also restore the affaires of that house.
            Yet for all this they do not leaue to giue him the honour of the
wisest of his age:Partes of wisedome. He made his wisedome appeare in that he could
consult and deliberate well, he could iudge and resolue well, and
he could leade and execute wel; This wisedome was wholy his, and
depended not of the motion or discourse of any other: Wherefore
when as he demanded of Brezay, Seneschall of Normandy, the
reason why he said that his horse was great and strong, being but
little and of a weake stature: For that (answered Brezay) hee
carries you and all your Counsell. It is a very singular grace of heauen
when as the actions of Princes, vnfurnished of Councell, succeede
happily: For as a Prince hath need of a soule to liue by, so
is it necessary for him to haue counsell to raigne:Euery Prince hath two Councels, one interior and the other exterior: The interior is that which growes in his head from his owne knowledge and vnderstanding: The exterior is of those that assist him in the managing of affaires. It is weake
councell which consists onely of yong heads: Yong men may well
haue some good points, but they are like vnto those of the eares
of corne: The force of councell consists in wisedome which is
not gotten but by experience, and experience comes not but with
time: A man may be borne capable of wisedome, but onely time
makes the wise; Yong Vines carry Grapes aboundantly, but the
old make the good wine: In all that he vndertooke hee shewed the
force of his spirit; speaking of Armes hee seemed neuer to haue
done any other thing but fight with men and besiege places, and
discoursing of affaires of Estate he seemed to haue past his whole
life in Councell.Great Spirits are alwaies entire in any thing they deale in. When as Cato had Armes in hand bee seemed neuer to haue practised any other thing: When as hee spake of Sciences a man would haue said hee had neuer gone out of the Vniuersity.
            
            Hee informed himselfe curiously and exactly of all things, and
of all persons whom he knew not to be capable to shew any arte
or disguising: A Prince addes much esteeme and respect vnto his
reputation when as he beleeues that he knowes all. Phillip de

Commines obserues an effect of his wisedome to sow discord and
diuision among those that would agree against his seruice: King
Lewis our Maister vnderstood that Art better; to diuide men, then
any other Prince that I euer knew; and hee spared neither his Siluer,
Goods, nor Paines, not onely towards the Maisters, but also to the seruants.

            Another act of his wisedome to haue kindled, and entertained
the fire which did consume the forces and burnt to ashes the ambition
of his enemie; In causing the instruments of the warre of Germany,
Swisserland, and Lorraine to moue, he remained at peace:
Hee had meanes to discharge his Realme of the vnprofitable burthen
of men which cannot liue but in trouble: As the flowing and
ebbing is necessary for the Sea, to discharge it of the great scumme
and filth which a calme gathers together, so a great Empire must
purge it selfe and cast forth the bad humours which a dead and idle
life drawes together.
            Although his promptnesse in speaking hath oftentimes hurt
him,Silence a soule of great actions. yet would hee haue it knowne that his very Hat had no
part of his secrets. Silence is the Pole and Axletree of enterprises,
the which must not onely be in words, but also in gesture and countenance,
for the eyes and the face are the dumbe interpreters of
the mind:He that doth manage a great designe must know how to gouern his tongue, but much more his minde, for Polybius saith that many haue discouered by their faces the designes which they haue kept in their hearts. They cannot be executed but at certaine times, vpon
certaine places, with certaine men, and by certaine meanes; if the
one or the other be neglected or discouerd, all must go to smoake.
The concurrence of many things is necessary for the execution of
a designe, the failing of one is able to ruine it, but there is neuer
enough when they talke too much.
            Wisedome hath also cause to complaine of his tongue: Hee
hath often paid for the liberty of his speech: But who can impose
silence to Princes? The liberty of Speech is a marke of their authority,
it is the point and seasoning of discourse, but the diuersity of
occasion makes it perilous: It sometimes offends the most mild and
patient spirits, and as euery wound hath his griefe, so there is not
any wound that seemes light to him that feeles it, and oftentimes
they fall into incurable vlcers:Nothing can happen more troublesome to free men then to bee debarred of the liberty of free speech. The liberty of free Discourse (saith Democrates) is a signe of courage and generosity. 
               There are houres when wee may not
speake anything,A rule how to speake. others when we may speake some thing, but none when
wee may speake all.
            
            Besides the exact intelligence of his affaires, he had a great
iudgement in the choice of men, and an admirable wisedome to
entertaine them and keepe them. He esteemed them, bound them
vnto him, and did not suffer them to languish in any discontent,
nor to attend the fruits of their seruice: He knew how to lay
the stone-worke, to enrich the Iewell, and to beautefie it with
Amaile, gold, and ornament: Hee not onely knew them of his
Realme that were most capable to be imployed in diuers functions
for his seruice, but also who were the most worthy Ministers with
Neighbour Princes: Hee knew in what heads did reside the
sufficiency of England, Spaine, and Portugall, and did not cease

This great and profitable skill to diuide their minds, that might
hurt him, did not onely stetch to the seruants and ministers of the
same Prince, but he knew how to diuide Princes of one bloud and
family. He did gouerne the affections of Sigismond at his pleasure,
The Archduke Sigismond of Austria was wonne by the King, whose party hee followed both against the Duke of Bourgondy, and the Archduke Maximilian. He reuoked the adoption which hee had made in his fauour, beleeuing them that sayd, that to shorten his hopes, hee would shorten his life. and turned him sometimes against the Archduke Maximilian,
his perswasion being of such force with this Prince, (who was
good and tractable) as he made him beleeue that Maximilian had
designes against his life, the sooner to get possession of his Estates,
which were assured him after his death. Sigismond in the end discouered
this fraud, and found that the ruine of the Archduke his Nephew,
toucht him so neere, as the Franch-County could not bee
lost, but the County of Feret would be also exposed to great danger,
and had great subiect to apprehend the increase of greatnesse
of so mighty a neighbour; and therefore hee yeelded to a leuie of
some troopes in his Estates of Elsasse and Ferret, which were imployed
to relieue and defend Dole, the chiefe Town of the Franch
County, which was besieged by the Lord of Chaumont, of Ambois.
            The King found meanes in loosing Sigismond, to winne the
Captaines that led the Troopes, so as they suffered a great number
of Franke Archers of the Kings Campe to slippe into the
Towne with their Troopes, who seizing vpon the Gates, gaue
entry to the rest of the Armie. The Towne was exposed to sacke
and pillage,Sacke and desolation of Do

away, neither was there any house exempt, but whereas the Generall
was lodged.A lamentable example of the misery of those Townes which are relieued by forraigne forces, whose fidelity being gotten & maintained by money, depends alwayes of him that offers most. From that time Dole was called the Dolorous.
            
            By the same skill of winning men, and knowing how to vnknit
knots without cutting the Corde, hee had at his deuotion the most
confident Ministers of England. Philip de Commines saith, that he
was imployed to win the Lord Hastings, as the Duke of Bourgondy
had formerly done to haue him his friend at a thousand Crownes
pension. Hee was very difficult to resolue; but as Siluer is like
vnto Cephalus Arrow, which is neuer shot in vaine, that a long pursute
shakes the most constant resolutions, hee suffered himselfe to
be wonne for two thousand Crownes pension.
            The King sent Peter Cleret, one of the Stewards of his House,
vnto him, to carry him this Money, and to bring backe a quittance
to bee put with the rest, and to iustifie hereafter, that not onely
Hastings Lord Chamberlaine, but also the Lord Howard high
Admirall, the Lord Chainey, Maister of the Horse, and Thomas of
Montgomery had beene Pensioners to the French King. This was
said to make a gaine in giuing, and to make a Trade of liberality.To hope for profite of that which is giuen, is to trafficke, and to put money to vsury, it is to thinke to

               Philip de Commines doth plainly set downe what past betwixt them.
Cleret demanded a quittance, and Hastings was not so ill aduised as
to giue him any: Cleret let him vnderstand that hee had to doe
with a Maister who was very distrustfull, and if he did not make
it appeare how he had deliuered this summe vnto him, he might

say he had stolne it; and therefore he desired onely a letter of three
lines vnto the King.
            Hastings seeing that there was some colour in his reasons, but
much more in those which did not allow him to write, gaue him
to vnderstand,Wisedome of the Lord Hastings.
                   that they should trust his Faith and Word,There is nothing that doth binde more then the assurance which wee take of the fidelity & conscience of any one. It is easier to breake ciuill bonds then them of honour. which
hee esteemed more then an hundred bondes in writing. Hee
therefore answered after this manner; Sir, that which you say is
reasonable, but this gift comes voluntarily from the King your Maister,
and not at my suite; if you will haue mee take it, you shall put it into my
sleeue, and you shall haue no other letter nor testimony: 
                  •
                will not that it
shall bee said by me, that the Chamberlaine of England hath beene a
Pensioner to the French King, nor that my quittances bee found in his
chamber of accounts.It is iniustice to cause benefit to be hurtfull & infamous to him that receiues it. The said Cleret rested satisfied, left him the money,
and came and made this report vnto the king, who was much offended
that he had not brought him a quittance; but he commended the said
Chamberlaine more then all the other seruants of the King of England,
and he was euer after paid without giuing quittance.
            He was so great an Architect, as he imployed all sorts of spirits,
fortunes and conditions in the building of his designes. Hee did
not only seeke to haue at his deuotion the chiefe Ministers of kings,
but hee also drew them vnto him, that had credit and authority in
free Townes and Common-weales, therefore he loued great Cosmo
de Medicis, and was grieued for his death, which happened in the
first yeares of his reigne. The lawes of wisedome did binde him to
enter frendship with a house,Commendation of the house of Medicis.
                whose great felicity drew the greatest
of Europe to admiration. Vertue doth force euen Enuy it selfe to

greatnesse of the house of Medicis, was to depriue the Colossus of
vertue of his shadow, which is glory.
            
               Lewis 11. had great reasons to esteeme him, knowing that great
Cosmo de Medicis had made Francis Sforce Duke of Millan, that the
wealth of his seruants had raised the hopes of many great Princes,Riches of the house of Medicis.

not returned into his Realme, and the Duke of Bourgondy had lost
his credit in Italy. In those times they did not speake but of the Piety
and Magnificence of great Cosmo de Medicis, who had opened

            Trafficke cannot receiue a more sencible iniury then by the calling
downe, or raising of Money, which wrongs the Law of Nations.
If there bee any thing in an estate which should bee immutable,

it is the certainty of their valour. Wisedome is not commended
but for the constancy of that which she resolues:A Prince who is the warrant of publicke Iustice, & subiect to the law of Nations, should not suffer the course of Money to bee variable & vncertaine, to the preiudice of his subiects & strangers, which treat & traffick with them. Wherfore the Kings of Arragon comming to the Crowne, tooke an Oath, not to alter the Coines which were allowed. she learnes
fit accidents which are mutable and immutable to reason, which
is constant and one, and not reason to accidents. When as the
course of Money is disordered and vncertaine, all is in confusion.
Lewis the eleuenth changed the course of coins in the yeare 1473.
hee ordained that the great Blankes should goe currant for eleuen
Deniers Turnois, which before were worth but ten; he reduced another
coine called Targes,Orders for Coins. to eleuen Deniers, which past for
twelue. The Crowne at thirty Souls, three Deniers Turnois, and
after this proportion all other peeces. Then considering that one
of the causes of the weakning of Coines grew for that the Officers
tooke their Fees and entertainements from the rights of the
Mint, which should bee vnknowne in great Estates,The Ancients knew not what the right of Minting meant, and the Coines were not imparted for the fees of officers, which were taken frō other kindes of mony, to the end that the coyning of money should be free from all suspition of deceit, it was done in publicke places, as at Rome in Iuno's Temple; and Charlemain did forbid any to bee coined but in his Palace. and are
not seemely but in petty ones, where they draw profite from euery
thing, and augment their Reuenues by the coining of money.
In the yeare 1475. he displaced the Generals and Maisters of the
Mint, and set foure Commissioners in their places, Germaine de
Merle, Nicholas Potier, Denis the Britton, and Simon Ausorran, and
ordained that the Kings crownes of Gold which before had course
for foure and twenty Souls Parisis, and three Turnois, should goe
for fiue and thirty peeces of eleuen, being worth fiue and twenty
Souls, eight Deniers Parisis, and they should make other Crowns,
which should haue a Halfe-moone in stead of a Crowne, which
was on the rest, and should be worth thirty six peeces of eleuen of
the value of twenty six Souls, six Deniers, and new Dozains, at 12
Turnois a peece.

No man holds himselfe bound for that which is giuen by importunity,

            This vertue, which (through excellency) is simply called Vertue,
and which containeth many other vertues, all Heroicke
and Royall, Magnanimity, Wisedome, Assurance, Constancy, and
Perseuerance to vanquish, breake and endure all kindes of accidents
and difficulties, which returnes from Combats in the like
sort it goes, feares death no more in Armes then in his House,
and hath his seat in the Heart and Will.
            This Prince had not learned the Art of Warre by discourse,
hee went to Horse at the age of foureteene yeares, and continued
vntill his Father had expelled the English out of his
Realme.Hee that is no Souldiar but by seeing battels painted, is like vnto him that vnderstands musicke, but can not sing. Hee made proofe of his Courage at the battell of
Montlehery, at the Alarme and Assault of Liege, and in the
Warre of Artois. His Wisedome corrected the heate of his
Valour: for that which was esteemed valour before hee was
King, would haue carried the name of Rashnesse after he came to
the Crowne.
            PHILIP DE COMMINES saith, that (of his owne nature)
hee was somewhat fearefull, and would not hazard any thing.
But euery where, and in any great occasion hee giues him the
glory to haue carried his resolutions beyond all kindes of accidents
and dangers. Wee must iudge of Courage by all the dimensions,
and not onely by the height and greatnesse, but also by
the length and extention, not being sufficient to bee valiant, if it
continue not.

those of mis-fortune, and the vigor of his enemies: Shee is a learned

and routs produce the precepts which frame sufficiency, and assure
the iudgements of Architects, Pilots and Captaines.
            Hee gaue Military charges to them that were capable to discharge
them, he loued men that were resolute to dangers, and did
them good. By the Capitulation of the Castle of Hedin, Flamen of
Launoy, who was gouernour, remained in the Kings seruice,There is no other thing to bee considered in the prouisiō of great Offices which cannot bee executed but in presence & person, but experience and sufficiency. Tiberius regarded the quality of the birth, so as it were seconded by proofes of vertue. Mandabat honores, nobilitatem maiorum, claritudinem militiae, illustras domi artes spectando, vt satis constaret non alios potiores fuisse. He gaue honours, respecting the Nobility of the Ancestors, their valour in warre, and their good deserts at home, so as it might appeare there were not any more worthy. Tacit.
                all
his lands being then in the Conquerours power and dominions,
the King gaue a pension to Raoul of Launoy his sonne. After the
siege of Hedin, the King did batter Quesnoy le Comte, made a breach
and gaue an assault, Raoul of Launoy, to begin his seruice by some
notable proofe of his courage and valour, did clime vp the ruines
of the Wall, through the blowes, fire, and flame, so couragiously,
as the King seeing and admiring his courage, said aloud, Hee is too
furious, hee must be bound. The place being taken by assault, the king
sent for him, and said vnto him: Passion of God my friend, thou art but
too furious in a fight, we must binde you to moderate your heate: for I
will not loose you, desiring to make vse of your seruice more then once.
And in saying so, he put a Chaine about his necke of fiue hundred
Crownes, and gaue him a company of foot-men.The presents and rewards of Princes are Chaines and Manacles which bind and captiuate mens affections. Hee was
made Bailiffe of Amiens, and Lieutenant for the King at Genoa.
They of his house haue for a long time carried a Chaine about
the Scutchion of their Armes, in remembrance of this gratification.
            Armes then were the delight of this Prince in his youth, wisedome
gaue him Maximes, contrary to those of his courage, when
hee was king, and yet in all places wither hee sent his Armies,
commanded by his Liutenants, and in those where hee was himselfe
vpon the Frontier of Flanders, hee alwayes made it knowne,
that his wisedome to resolue, and his presence to execute, made
the principall part of the happinesse of his affaires. He had all the
time of his reigne Armies on foote,Contempt of discipline in Souldiers. and they giue him the honour
to haue entertained greater and more mightie Armies then his
Predecessors,One demanded of Agesilaus what parts were requisite to make a great Captaine, hee answered, Courage against his enemies, and wisedome and iudgement to make vse of occasions. and to haue had more care of Men of Warre, Fortresses
and Artillery. All this is seene in the Precedent booke, speaking
of his new erection of Troopes to haue alwayes the body of
a great Armie ready to guard his Estate and person, and to suppresse
any sudden reuolt, holding it indiscretion to attend necessity
for the leuying of Souldiers. They of his time liued very licentiously.
The complaints that were made presently after his death,An Estate should haue ordinary & extraordinary forces: the ordinary is vnderstood of Companies which are entertained in Forts, and neere vnto the Prince: the extraordinary is in Armes which are leuied, entertained and imploied in occasions of warre. to

the Estates at Tours vpon this subiect, were vehement; and it
was particularly said, That the men at Armes, the Gentlemen of the
Ban, the Franke Archers, and the Suissers, had done infinite harme vnto
the people; that the Souldiers not contenting themselues with the
goods they found in the labourers houses, forced them with cudgels to
goe and fetch Wine, Fish, Spices, and other excessiue things from the
Towne.
            
            
               King Lewis the eleuenth sought to remedy these disorders, and
to settle discipline, to make the Souldiers more modest and moderate,
Military discipline consists in three poynts, Continency, Modesty, and Abstinency. By the first they avoyd voluptuousnesse, which makes courage fainte. By the second they frame thē
                     selues to valor, and it hath these three poynts: Velle, vereri, & obedire, to Will, to feare, and to obey. By the third they are content to doe that which is allowed. and to hold their hands free from all violence. But hee
did it not effectually: for his Edicts had neither constancy nor execution.Edict to reforme Souldiers.
The Chronicle saith, that in the yeare 1474. being at
Creil, hee made an Edict touching the Men at Armes of his
Realme, by the which hee declared, That a Launce should keepe but
sixe horses: that is to say, the Launce three horses for himselfe, his
Page and Cutler, and the two Archers two horses, and one horse for the
Groome, and that they should no more haue Paniers to carry their Armes;
and withal, they should not lodge aboue one day in a village. And moreouerit
was proclaimed, That no Merchant should sell vnto the said
Men at Armes, or lend any Silkes and Chamblets, vpon paine of loosing
the money which the said Souldiers might owe them by reason thereof:
and also that they should not sell vnto them any woolen-cloath of aboue
three shillings three pence an Ell.
            The disorder of Silkes was as great in those times as it had been
little knowne in precedent Ages.
                  PHILIP the faire made an Ordonance for the reformation of apparrel, according to the condition and difference of persons. There was no mention made of Silkes, for that the vse was not common, nor known in France. It allowes a Duke, Earle or Baron of sixe hundred pounds sterling a yeare rent, or more, to make foure suits of apparrell euery yeare, and no more, and as many for their wiues, and forbids Lawyers and Clarkes which are not in dignity, to make Gownes for their bodies of cloth of aboue sixteene Soulz the Ell of Paris. This dissolution was one of the
causes of the rarenesse of Gold and Siluer, which was no more to
bee found but in Chaines of gold, and in their purses who had had
meanes to transport it out of the Realme to haue Silkes. The Estates
of France complained at Tours, and it was said, That euery
man was clad in Veluet and Silkes, and that there was not a Fidler,
Groome of the Chamber, Barber nor Souldier but ware it, that they had
Collers, or Rings of Gold on their fingers, like the Princes, and that there
was not treason nor villany but they committed to continue this disordered
sumptuousnesse of apparrell.
            
            
               Science.
               Science. If hee were learned by Art or by Practise, wee must
looke vnto the effects of his good Conduct, with the which (like
vnto Perseus with Mineruas Courtelax) he had cut off the head of
the Medusa of reuolts and sedition in his Realme. If it bee true,
that in his time simple honesty,Innocency doth commonly lodge with Ignorance and Simplicity. The troubles which haue molested the world, are not come from the simple. The learned, or they which presumed to know all things, haue framed them. Simplex illa & aperta virtus in obscuram & solertem scientiam versa est. That simple and open vertue is turned into obscure and cunning knowledge. and ignorant vertue were degenerated
into a Science, or knowledge of dissembling, or subtilty,
we must hold him for the most learned Prince that euer bare Scepter
in his hand, or Crowne vpon his head. Hee had (saith Philip
de Commines) his speech at commandement, and his wit perfectly

good, without the which bookes serue to small purpose. They
make men learned, but not wise; and the difference is great to
haue a full head, or a head well made, to bee sufficient or learned,
instructed in contemplation or in action.They teach men diuers Sciences for their vse, and to excell in them. Princes should learne, Regere Imperio populos, To gouerne the people. A Princes Science is to
know how to command. Philip de Commines saith, that hee was
learned enough.
            The Author of the Annals of Aquitane writes, That hee had
gotten more knowledge, as well Legall as Historicall, then the Kings
of France were accustomed to haue. And although hee were not
of those times, when as they met with Emperours going to the
Schooles with Bookes vnder their Armes,Lucius met with M. Antony, who went to see Cyrus the Philosopher, son to one of Plutarkes sisters, this Prince said vnto him, That it was a goodly thing to learne, euen for a man that grew old. To whom Lucius all amazed, answered, O Iupiter Romanorū Imperator iam apetente senio gestans librum qui pueris mos est preceptorē adit. O Iupiter the Roman Emperour growing old, goes vnto his maister, carying a book, as school-boyes vse to doe.
                nor was not of the
humour of that other Emperour, who forgat his Dinner to
heare Lessons,
                  Charles 4. Emperour loued learning in such sort, as being in in the schooles at Pragne, some comming to put him in minde of dinner, hee said vnto them, that hee had dined, preferring
                     •
                   the contentment of the mind before that of the body. Aen. Silv.
                yet that great leasure which hee had in Dauphiné,
and afterwardes in Flanders, accompanied with a desire
to learne (which is the first steppe to mount vnto knowledge)
could not leaue him in the ignorance of things necessary to reigne
well. On a time he vsed his Latine to good purpose: Pope Sixtus
had sent Cardinall Bessarion,
               Cardinall Bessarion borne at Trebisond, and Monke of S. Basil was made Cardinall at the Councell of Florence by Eugenius the fourth, and sent Legat into Germany to reconcile the Emperour and the Archduke Sigismond brethren. a Grecian borne, to mediate a peace
betwixt him and the Duke of Bourgondy. Hee had beene imployed
in great Embassies in the time of Pope Eugenius, who
had made him Cardinall, and of Pius the second, the which hee
ended happily. This was the cause of his death: for hauing begun
with the Duke of Bourgondy, as holding him the most difficult
to draw to reason, the King tooke it ill, and imputing it to
contempt, or to some priuate passion, as hee presented himselfe
at his Audience, hee laid his hand vpon his great beard, and said
vnto him: Barbara Greca genus retinent quod habere solebant.
               The Grecians called all other nations barbarous. Plat. in Menoxeno.
                An
Arrow shotte not against Greece, which gaue the name of
Barbarous to all other Nations, but against the Birth and Inciuilite,
or Indiscretion of this Cardinall, whom hee left
there, and commanded to bee so speedily dispatched, as he knew
his stay there was no more pleasing vnto him, then his Indiscretion.
The feeling hereof did so afflict him, as soone after returning
to Rome, hee fell sicke at Thurin, died at Reuenna, and confirmed
that Truth, That Embassages ambitiously affected, doe neuer succeed
happily.
               
                  A graue and true sentence spoken by Iohn Caruagial Cardinal of S. Agnolo, Nessuna legatione ambita puo hauer desiderato fine. No Embassage affected can haue a desired end. Ier. Garimbert.
            
            Who so had the Apothegmes, the goodly speeches, and good
words of this Prince, should enrich this discourse with so many
pearles and pretious stones. There comes nothing from the mouth
of a great King, full of wisedome and experience, but should be as
curiously gathered vp as the crums which fall from the table of the
Gods.
                  Damis did curiously collect the words of Appollonius. Some misliking that 
                     •
                  e busied himselfe with such trifles, said that he had done like vnto dogs, which gather vp all the crums and fragments which fall from their maisters tables. Damis answered, You say well, but this is a banquet of the Gods, and all that assist at it are Gods also, the Officers suffer nothing to be lost.
            
            
               
               Philip de Commines hath obserued this: A King hath more force
and vertue in his Realme where he was annointed and crowned,
then he had without it.
            To haue serued well, doth sometimes loose men, and great seruices
are recompenst with great ingratitude;Iudgment vpon the recōpence of seruices but this may happen
as well through the errour of them that haue done the seruices,
who too arrogantly abuse their good fortune, as well to their Maisters,
as their Companions, as through the mistaking and forgetfulnesse
of the Prince.Princes seeing the merites and seruices to bee so great, as they cannot recompence them but by great aduancemets, they doe not willingly looke vpon them, who as often as they present themselues vnto their eyes, seeme to demand recompence. Beneficia eo vsque laeta sunt, dum videntur exolui posse. Vbi multum antevenere pro gratia odium redditur. Benefits are so long pleasing as they thinke they can bee payd; but when they haue exceeded, hatred is repayed for thankes. Tacitus, lib. 4.
               
            
            To haue good in Court, it is greater happinesse for a Man
when as the Prince whom hee serues doth him a great fauour
for a small merite; wherefore he remaines bound vnto him which
should not bee if hee had done so great seruices as the Prince had
beene much bound vnto him. Wherfore hee doth by nature loue
them more that are bound vnto him, then those to whom hee is
beholding.
            When as pride goes before, shame and confusion followes at
the heeles.Pride is alwayes followed by Ruine and Shame.

            When hee changed his seruants, he excused this change, saying;
That Nature was pleased with variety.
            Hee said, That if hee had entred his Reigne otherwise then
with Feare and Seuerity, hee had serued for an example in the
last Chapter of BOCACE his Booke of vnfortunate Noblemen.
            And considering that secresie was the soule and spirit of all
designes, he said sometimes, I would burne my Hat if it knew what
were in my head.
               
                  Metellus said the like, that if hee knewe his shirt vnderstood his secerets, hee would burne it,
            
            Hee remembred to haue heard King Charles his father say, that
Truth was sicke, and hee added, I beleeue that since shee is dead,
and hath not found any Confessor.
            Mocking at one that had many bookes, and little learning, hee
said, that he was like vnto a crooke-backt man, who carries a great
bunch at his backe, and neuer sees it.
            Seeing a Gentleman which carried a goodly Chaine of Gold,
hee said vnto him that did accompany him; You must not touch it,
for it is holy, shewing that it came from the spoyle of Churches.
It is long since that this sacrilegious liberty hath beene in custome,
and that Princes, that would please GOD and Men, haue
detested it; but custome to euill hath more power ouer the willes
of men to entertaine them in it, then it giues horror and shame to
flye from it.
                  Caesar did bite Pompey to the quicke, for that hee had taken away the ornaments of Hercules Temple. Pecuniam omnem ex fano Herculis in opidum Gades intulit, and giuing himselfe the honour to haue caused it to bee restored, Referri in Templum iubet.
               
            
            He took delight in quick answers, which were made without study:

for if there be premeditation they loose their grace. On a time seing
the Bishop of Chartres mounted on a Mule with a golden bridle,
hee said vnto him, that in times past Bishops were contented with
an Asse and a plaine Halter. The Bishop of Charters answered
him, That it was at such times when as Kings were Sheepheards,
and kept Sheepe. The Annals of Aquitane, which report this, adde
that that the King began to laugh: for hee loued a speech which
proceeded from a sudden wit.
            Hee loued Astrologians, and this loue proceeded (as it were)
from a naturall and hereditary curiosity, hauing much troubled
the mindes of his fore-fathers. Charles the fifth was gouerned by
them,Credite of Astrologians. and gaue them meanes to teach Astrologie publickely
in the Vniuersity of Paris. Hee had for his Physition one called
Monsieur Garuis Cretin a great Astrologian.
                  CHARLES th
                     •
                   fifth caused many Bookes of Astrology to bee Translated into French, he built a Colledge for Astrologie and Physicke, and gaue them the Tithes of the Village of Caugie, and caused the foundation to bee confirmed by Pope VRBAN the fifth. He caused the Natiuity of King Charles the sixtth, to b
                     •
                  e cast by Monsieur Andrew of Suilly. The like curiosity
made Charles the 5th to loue and cherish familiarly Michael Tourne-Roue
a Carthusian, who was very skilfull in the practise of Elections:
Hee made that of the day when as the King went a hunting,
where as hee found the great Stagge which had a Coller
of Copper about the necke, wherein these words were written;
Hoc Caesar me donauit, Caesar gaue me this. The figure of it was set
vp in the palace of Paris.
            Hee was also much bound to the aduice which Iames of Angiers
gaue him of the bad Intention which two Augustine Monks
had to open his skull, who were beheaded at Paris.
                  In the booke of SIMON of Phares, which is in the Kings Library, wee reade this: IAMES of Angiers was in that time, who discouered the false intent which the two Augustines had, which did open King CHARLES his head, saying; They would cure him, beeing ignorant both in Physicke and Chyrurgery: They were suborned by PHILIP Duke of Bourgondy, (as was said) to worke this effect. The matter beeing discouered, the said Augustines were degraded, and lost their heads, as was reason. Hee also
made great account of Charles of Orgemont, who foretold him
that the Duke of Aniou his brother should bring nothing backe
from his voyage at Naples, but shame, want, and misery, the which
happened: for all the Knights which had followed him, returned
with white stickes in their hands,
                  Vpon this Prediction SIMON of Phares speakes thus: The French were forced to flye, and the Duke of Millan forgetting his Faith and Oath, did kill them that were taken, and suffered the Dogges to eate them, and therefore let this be an aduertisment to the Kings of France, and to the French, neuer to trust in a Lombards tongue. or dyed in Hospitals. He was also
aduertised of the issue of the voyage which Boucicant made to
Genoa, and of the treason of the Marques of Montferrat, and of
Count Francisque.
            
            CHARLES the seuenth had Astrologians all his life: Hee entertained
in his Court IOHN of Bregy, a Knight, who cast the
Natiuity of AME Duke of Sauoy, and of the Lady YOLAND
of France his wife; and Germaine of Tibonuille, who fore-told
the death of King Henry the fifth, and of Charles the sixth. He
receiued into Pension, and into his house IOHN of Buillion,
whom the English had kept prisoner at Chartres, for that hee
had fore-told that which hahpened vnto them at the siege of
Orleans.
            Hee gaue entertainement also to SIMON of Phares, borne

borne at Orleance, whose booke of excellent Astrologians is to
be seene in the Kings Library:
                  This Symon of Phareswrites of himselfe that hee did foretell, The great famine at Paris, and the great plague which followed vnder the raigne of Charles the 
                     •
                  . that the Lands were vntilled, and the woods, so 
                     •
                  full of wolues as they deuoured women and children, and that it was proclaimed that for euery Woolfe they could take they should haue two shillings, besides that which the Commons might giue. Maister Lewis of Langre a Spaniard,
a Physition and Astrologian at Lyon, told King Charles of
the victory he should get at Fromigny, in the yeare 1450. & of the
great plague which was at Lyon a yeare after, for the which hee
gaue him forty pounds a yeare, pension.
            In all the chiefe actions of the life of Lewis the eleuenth, wee
finde that Iohn Merende of Bourg in Bresse, did cast his Natiuity,
and speaking of his Aduentures vnto the thirtieth yeare,Predictions vpon the life of Lewis the eleuenth. hee aduertised
King Charles the seuenth of his rebellion, and how his gouernment
would be wonderfull to men,This man was much esteemed by Duke Amedeus the Pope, hee foretold the Schisme of the Church, and the warre betwixt France and England. 
               Manasses a lew of Valencia
continued these predictions vnto the battel of Montlehery:
Peter of Saint Valerien, a Chanon of Paris, and a great Astrologian,
was sent in the yeare 1435. into Scotland for the marriage
of the Lady Margaret; during his abode in Flanders, hee consulted
alwaies with Astrologians of future things, and these impostors,
more hurtfull to a Common-wealth then Players,
                  Sights entertaine the people and breed them vp

                whom
his predecessours had chased away, were alwaies in his eares. Hee
caused many iudgements to be made by Iohn Coleman his Astrologian,
who taught him to vnderstand the great Almanacke, and
vpon the great Coniunction of Saturne and Mars, which was the
eighth of Aprill, about ten of the clocke eighteene minutes, in
the yeare 1464: He spake plainely of the troubles of the League,
and so did in like manner Peter of Grauille, whom Lewis the 11.
caused to come out of Normandy: Conrade Hermgarter a Germaine
left the Duke of Bourgundies seruice for the Kings, who
gaue him great entertainements. But aboue all, hee made great
esteeme of Angelo Catho a Neapolitan, who came into France with
the Prince of Tarentum,
                  Iohn Spirink did also foretel the Duke of Bourgundy that if he went against the Suisses it would succede ill, the Duke answered, that the fury of his Sword should vanquish the course of heauen. and had foretold the Duke of Bourgundy
and the Duke of Guelders their misfortunes. The King
gaue him the Arch-bishopricke of Vienna, wherein hee could not
reside for the great crosses he receiued from them of Dauphiné,
but was forced to retire himselfe to Rome: His Chronicle doth
also speake of the death of Maister Arnold his Astrologian during
the plague, in the yeare 1466. the which hee had foreseene, and
which vnpeopled Paris of aboue 40000. persons.
            France had other kinds of men which did better deserue the fauour
and bounty of the King then these Deuiners. God is offended

Either they tell aduerse things or prosperous: If they fore-tell prosperous things and erre, thou art a wretch in vaine expectance? if they tell aduerse things and lye, thou wilt be a wretch in fearing without cause? They make

themselues miserable in the expectation of prosperity which neuer
happens: They are miserable also in the apprehension of aduersities

                King Charles the seuenth, father to Lewis, and
King Charles the eighth his sonne, had some care of the Vniuersity
of Paris: The first set downe an order for the decision of causes
referred to the Court of Parliament: The last declared what men
should enioy the priuiledges of the Vniuersitie, and how they
should be inrowled in the booke of Priuiledges: But wee do not
finde that Lewis hath done any thing either with it, or against it.
The President Thou, whose History Europe doth no lesse admire
for his eloquence and boldnesse, then Italy did Titus Liuius, and
Greece Thucidides, speakes of Iohannes Vulceus of Groningue,
and saith that he reformed the Vniuersity, during the raigne of this
King, and this reformation shewes that there was some disorder.
The negligence of men was not so much the cause as the violence
of times, full of troubles and confusion, which did not permit them
either to teach or to learne. These clouds of Ignorance were as
darke in other Nations:Barbarisme in in the time of Lewis.
                The misery of that age was so great as
who so should represent the potrraite of that Barbarisme, would
moue the minds of men both to pitty of so great ignorance, and to
feare that our negligence would bring vs soone into the like. The
sweetenesse of the Muses was but bitternesse, their flowers all withered,
and their light all confusion; the men of those times did
not onely contemne learning, but they did abhorre her beauty, and
said that it did not agree with the grauity and seuerity of other
Sciences.Barbarisme being banished the schooles whereas the taught good learning, it remained long among the Lawiers. King Francis the first hauing seene these words in a Decree, debotauit & debottat: commanded that al
                     •
                   the Actes of iustice and contracts should be made in Lattine. For this cause the purity of the Lattine Tongue was
banished out of the Schooles, and they were filled with vnknowne
Sophistries, which were strange and barbarous: The Schooles were
no more the Fountaine of the Muses, but Moates full of Frogges,
There were good wits, as all ages doth produce, as all Seas may
breed Pearles: But as there is a necessity to howle with Wolues:

they were forced to fit themselues to the common vse, being impossible
to wipe away the contumely which was done to the reading
of good bookes: It was a good Verse if it fell not twice or
thrice vpon the Cadence of the same Sillable: All Lyricke Poets
medled with time, as carelesse of elegancy as of reason.
            The Latine tongue was harboured in some Cloisters, and thence
the Prouerbe came, Not to speake Latine before Friers: as if they
should not handle any tooles before good worke-men, nor dance
before good dancers: But they that haue written of those times
shew that all the eloquence was nothing but a confused babling
which brought forth new words, as monsters bred of pride and ignorance:
So the greatest & most famous actions were all made vpon
the modell of Sermons, and they alwaies tooke some Text of
Scripture which they called the Theame of the Discourse:In those daie: they busied mens w
                     •
                  ts with vnprofitable & impertinent Etimologies: They said in Schooles that the Scipio's and the Censorins were names of dignity: That the Ethnickes came from Moūt Ethna, and that the Law▪

                        •
                     e, for that like a Sithe it did cut off Legacies. They
did often adde ridiculous and foolish Etymologies, and their inuentions
were about Letters and Syllables. The proofe heereof
may grow of that which hath beene obserued in diuers places of
this History, as of the discourse which the first President of Grenoble
made to Lewis the 11. Of the pleading which was in the
Court of Parliament before the King of Portugall: Of the Oration
made at the opening of the Estates of Tours: That which
was made vnto the Millannois vnder the raigne of Lewis the 12.
is an other marke of this great simplicity:The Millannois for a rebelliō made against King Lewis the 12. came in Procession to demād pardon of the Cardinal of Amboise, his Maiesties Lientenant, Mr. Michael Ris a Doctor of the Laws, Councellour in the great Councell and Parliament of Dijon, and in the Senate of Milan, made a great discourse vpon this occasion, the which he began in these termes. Misertus est Dominus super Niniuem ciuitatē quod poenitentiam egit in cinere & cilicio.
                In like manner the Oration
made by the Rector of the Vniuersity of Paris, to Queene
Mary, second wife to Lewis the 12.
            When they haue searcht into the causes of this great desolation,
they haue found that auarice hath contributed most; for when
as they found that great wealth was not gotten by the profession of
learning; that they which had consumed most in good bookes, had
wasted their estates vnprofitably, and contemned their fortunes:
that onely pleading got the graine and left but the straw for other
professions: Men studied no more to be learned but contented
themselues to be Doctors: The Law it selfe, which makes a great
part of polliticke knowledge, was, in a manner, abandoned, and
her excellencies dishonoured with an infinite number of ridiculous
glosses and vaine questions: Wherefore Pope Innocent the 3.
who laboured, more seriously then happely, to restore that Profession
to honour, did often complaine that auarice had made the
Liberall Sciences Mechanicke, and that many past impudently
from the first precepts of Grammer, to the study of the Lawes, not
staying neither at Phylosophy, nor any other good Art: Wherefore
throughout all the East good bookes were not knowne but to
some rare and eloquent spirit, and in the West the Latine tongue
was growne barbarous, the Syriac vnknowne, and the Greeke so
odious, as it was no ignorance in the most learned to skip a Greek
word and not to reade it.Ignorance is so shamelesse as shee glories of that shee vnderstands not. In those times when they met with a Greeke word, they were dispenced with, if they made no stay at it, and the Reader said: Graecum est non legitur.
               
            
            
               
The taking of Constantinople did wholly ruine learning in the
East, and was the cause to make it reuiue in the West, by the care
of Pope Nicholas the fifth, and of great Cosmo de Medicis, who gathered
together the sad Relickes of this Shipwracke: They caused
the good bookes of all the Greeke Authours to be sought out and
preserued, and did lodge and entertaine them that were capable to
make them speake Lattine. This misfortune made them to arriue
in Italy as into a Port of safety, against the tempest of Greece, or
rather as some precious moueable rescued out of a great fire, they
found a sweete retreate, and an honourable resting place in the
house of Medicis.
            
            Some time before Emanuel Chrisolara had beene sent by Iohn Paleologue,
to demand succours of Christian Princes against Bajazeth
the first, who threatned Greece with the seruitude which it
hath endured vnder the Empire of his descendants: Hauing
done his charge he staid at Venice, then at Florence and at Rome,
he read some lessons at Padua, past into Germany, and dyed during
the Councell of Constance. George Trapezonde, by extraction
from Trapizonde, but borne in Candy, and Theodore Gaza of
Thessalonica continued these first beginnings. Cosmo de Medicis
made choice of Iohn Argyropile,

to Peter de Medicis his soone, then he went to Rome, where
he did publickely interpret the Greeke Histories, and did so inspire
the loue of learning into the hearts of good spirits, as the Cardinals
and Noblemen of Rome did not dsidaine to go and heare his
Lessons.
            Out of the Schoole of Emanuel Chrisolara came Gregory Typhernas,
who came to Paris, and presenting himselfe to the Rector,
he said vnto him, That he was come to teach the Greeke, and demanded
to haue the recompence allowed by the Holy Decrees: The Rector was
somewhat amazed at the boldnesse of this stranger, and yet commended
his desire, and with the aduice of the Vniuersity staid him
and gaue him the entertainement he desired: Ierome of Sparta succeeded
him.
            The Shipwracke of Greece brought many other great personages
to the roade of Italy, Demetrius Chalcondyle,
                     Demetrius Chalcondyle an Anthenian, taught publickly at Florence after Argyropile: Hee went away through the practise and iealousy of Angelus Politianus, and retyred to Milan. Marcus Musurus

Laurence de Medicis employed to get leaue from Bajazeth

               er of good wits as a
carelesse Nurse to cherish them, is much fallen from her first glory:
Her Schooles, which were sometimes more famous then those of
Athens in Greece, are vnpeopled; the water of her Fountaines
which did water all the youth of Europe is troubled; there is no
Spring in the yeare for these goodly flowers, which are cherished
of some for the rarenesse, of others for the smell, and of all

for the assurance of fruites. The Northerne blasts of the last troubles,
haue (in a manner) withered them, and hardly will they recouer
their beauty, if the same Sunne which hath raised the Flower
de Luce doth not reuiue them. Hercules after so many glorious labours,
did not disdaine the name of Musagete:
               
                  Fuluius caused a Temple to be built in Circo Flaminio at Rome to Hercules Musagete, that is to say the conductor of the Muses, and Eumonius the Rector giues this reason: Quia mut

hope that any other will finish that which Henry the fourth shall
leaue vnperfect, he will not suffer that she which carries the glorious
name of his eldest daughter, and hath purchased it by her immortall
watches, and by the production of many great personages,
which haue worthily serued the Church and State, shall languish

nothing else for the tryumph of his glory,
                  Iames Dauid Cardinall du Perron High Almoner of France. nothing but that can
make his Bayes immortall: The Muses haue neede of Hercules valour,
and the labours of Hercules haue need of the recommendation
of the Muses. The generous thoughts which our Augustus

               Temperance wherein it consists. If it were not taken but for the moderation which
seasons all things, that great temper which he had in prosperities,
and his constancy in aduersities, had purchased him the palme of
this vertue, but if they take it for the rule and restrainte of voluptuousnesse,
and of other motions of the minde, it is not so apparent
in his heart as in that of Alexanders, Cyrus, and Scipioes: The two

that were true which many haue said, that King Charles the 8. was

that which they might preserue by conference. I haue alwaies
held it an honour to learne, and a happinesse to bee reprehended.
A man should hold himselfe more bound to bee
warned of a fault in his writings then of a blemish in his face:
Vpon this supposition I went to Monsieur du Haillan, for that in
the second booke of the estate of the affaires of France he reports
this opinion, and promiseth a more ample discourse in the History
of this King not yet printed:Many were of opinion that Charles the 8. was supposed, others held that hee was the Kings sonne but not by the Queene, and that the King to quench the troubles which had beene raysed by his brother, made this supposition, the which is more amply written in the History of the said King, and not yet printed. Bernard of Girard Signior of Haillan in his second booke of the estate of the affaires of France. He answered me that hee held it
from them who thought they knew it well, and that he hath written
many other things of like consequence vpon the beleefe of
Tradition.
            Princes will haue their loues excused, for that loue doth not alter
the generosity of a great courage, Caesar did sacrifice his heart
to Armes and Ladies:Wee cannot find a more perfect patterne of Ambition and Loue then Caesar. As for Ambition, his life is full of it: For Loue, he had the Maidenhead of Cleopatra, he made loue to Eunoë Queene of Mauritania, to Posthumia wise to Seruius Sulpitius, to Lollia of Gabinius, to Tertulla of Crassus, to Mutia of Pompey, and to Seruilia, Sister to Cato, and mother to Marcus Brutus: He changed wiues foure times. But I finde this Prince sometime in delights
which were not ordinary, nor scarce knowne to the Kings
of France his Predecessours: His Chronicle speakes of Bathes
prepared for him, for the Queene and Ladies. I was of opinion
that he had brought that custome from Flanders: when Phillip de
Commines speakes of the excesse and dissolutions which peace had
brought into the Low Countries, hee makes mention of Bathes.
The great and superfluous expences (saith he) of men and women in
apparell. The greatest and most prodigall bankets that I haue knowne
in any place: The Bathes, and other feastings with women, great and
disordered, and with little modesty.

Marcus Agrippa, to purchase the peoples fauour caused 170. Bathes to be built in Rome, to the end that euery Quarter should haue one, Antonin was the first that decreed they should pay nothing for Bathing, for before him they gaue the fourth part of an Assis. they
haue their beginning, increase, and continuance: That of Bathes
was the like. At Rome, in the beginning, they did wash nothing
but their Armes and legges, after labour and painefull toyle, for
that they would not haue their members vncleane, and their
pores stopt with sweate: They did wash the whole body at Faires,

and health was the end of Bathing, as a thing generally held holdsome,
since health is growne vnto voluptuousnesse, and they adde
vnto it vanity and needlesse pompe. The rarest Marbles of Affrick
and Alexandria were sought for, and the most industrious Caruers
and Architects were employed in these Bathes as for the building
of Temples.

men are miserable, in that they know not the price of
things but by the losse of them: They do not taste of rest but in labour,
nor of peace but after warre, nor health but in sickenesse;
When they are sicke they make vowes to health, when they are in
health they do what they can to be sicke. They sacrifice to health
and eate the meats of the sacrifice euen vntill they burst, so as drinking,
eating, sleeping, playing, watching, sicknesse itselfe, health,
and all the actions of mans life are so many steps to death:One demanded of Hypocrates a rule for his health, he answered him, Cibi, potus, somni, Venus, omnia

                  ires to fetch it, but Mahomet who was a yong Lad leapt out at the window, and brought the letter vnto the Emperour. This ready answer pleased the King, who drew this Boy out of the
Kitchin to make him serue in his Chamber, & frōthence raised him
to great wealth: Behold how fortune fauours euen thē which haue

no knowledge of it, nor seeke it not. Hee added to the pleasures
of solitarinesse those of rusticke Husbandry. I haue seene by the
Accompts of the Chamber of the Treasure, that in the yeare one
thousand foure hundred three score and seuenteene, he caused a
woman of Bethune, with two more with her, to come to Plessis,
hauing two horses and foure Kine, to make Butter and Cheese for
his owne mouth, and that for the voiage, implements, and prouision
of this woman and her Family, he paid seuen pounds.
            This popular facility did much auaile him to winne the hearts of
the Parisians,Popularity of Lewis the 11. whom the pretext of the Common-weale had
much shaken. The Signior of Haillan saith: That being come to
Pares hee went from street to streete, and from house to house, to dine
and sup with them, talking familiarly with euery one, to make himselfe
pleasing vnto the people, and to incense them against his enemies; That
the Parisians neuer held the better party, nor did any thing commendable,
but at this time, for they were for the King, and did support and releiue
him. His Chronicle obserues, for an example of his affection
to Paris, that he came in the yeare, one thousand foure hundred
three score and eleuen, with the Duke of Guienne his brother,
and there made great feasts, and kindled the Bonfire at the
Greue, on Saint Iohn Baptists Eue: His most confident seruants fate
commonly at his Table, and hee made them discourse of diuerse
subiects. He would not haue their hearts in the clouds whilst their
bodies were at the Table:

them that came from other Prouinces to vnderstand all things, and
to draw out the Quintessence. Among the profites of Commerce
the knowledge they haue of that is done among strangers should
be esteemed one of the chiefe, for by the going and comming of
Marchants Princes are aduertised of many things, whereof they
should otherwise be ignorant, and they that report them do not
conceiue of them after the same manner as they do that receiue
them. Great Vnderstandings draw profite from euery thing, and
can iudge of the resemblances of things which do nothing resemable,
the which is one of the highest points of humane wisedome.

            The King being very familiar with men of this sort, caused them
to eate at his Table to discourse more freely: The Kings good countenance,
added to the place, and good cheere, makes them speake
that are most staied: A Marchant seeing himselfe often in this honour,
disdained to see himselfe still called Sir Iohn, and besought
the King to make him an Esquire: The King gaue him letters

                He presented himselfe vnto the King, thinking
that by this new honour hee had beene raysed to the Epicycle
of Mars, and that hee should go equall with the chiefe Noble-men
in Court. The Asse is entertained with blowes when as

the Spaniell is cherished at the Table. But hee would not vouchsafe
to looke on him, and left him alwayes attending. The Merchants
would gladly haue left his letters to returne vnto his first
course; and not able to endure this change, hee complained vnto
the King, who said vnto him: When I made you sit at my table, I held
you as the first of your condition, and did no wrong vnto this Gentlemen to
honour you for such.The change of condition is not alwayes honorarable nor fortunate. It is better to be the head of a slye, then the tayle of a Lyon. Now that you would be a Gentleman, and that in
this quality you are preceded by many, who purchased it by the Swords of
their Ancestors, and by their owne merits, I should do them wrong in doing
you the like fauour. Go Mr Gentleman.
            
            Of all exercises he was most earnest at hunting;
                  Lewis 11. delighted in hunting. and indeed it is
the most royall and most necessary for a Prince, to inure him to
toyle,Hunting is the true exercise of Princes. The Roman Emperours beeing alwayes in warre, had no pleasures, and besides, they were forced to hunt very farre from Rome. The Kings of Macedonia, Persia & Parthia haue alwaies been great Hunters. to know the Countrey, and to entertaine, in time of peace,
a goodly table of warre; but he would not haue this exercise common,
although it doth rightly belong vnto the Nobility, when
they are dispenced withall from the seruice of the sword. Hee did
forbid hunting in the beginning of his reigne, and added to this
defence odious punishments. It was a hanging matter for a Gentleman
to flye idlenesse: they punished him as rigorously that had
slaine a wild beast, as a Man:To take the exercise of hunting from a Gentleman, is to declare him base. Besides it, he can not do any thing in time of peace, and to play the Gentleman for time that is not, is to do nothing. A Lacedemonian seing that the Ariopage had condemned an Athenian of Idlenesse, intreated his friendes that were about him, to shewe him the man that was condemned to liue a Gentleman. and thereof come so many tales of
the seuerity of this Prince, which haue dishonoured his life, and
which now beautifie this History as Toads, Serpents, and Monsters
are admired and pleasing vpon Marbles and Agathes.It was more pardonable, saith Claud Seyffel, to kill a man, then a Stagge, or a wilde Boare.
            
            Princes haue alwayes made choyce of a great number of seruants,
in some they haue had more confidence and credit, they
haue done them greater fauours, and aduanced them more then
the rest. And although these elections bee not alwayes grounded
vpon merit, and that honours conferred vpon vnworthy men
are the lesse esteemed, yet it were to clippe the wings of the Kings
Authority to restraine him from this liberty. Hee made of men as
an Auditor doth of Counters, placing some for hundreds, others
for thousands, some for ten, and some for vnits. He allowed many
petty Companions in his Cabinet, who could not remember
the condition of their fore-fathers without blushing, or disavowing
them.Honor meeting with an vnworthy subiect, hath lesse luster and esteeme. When as the people of Athens saw that Yperbol

                But for all that he did not leaue to haue about him, and
to imploy in great charges. Noble-men issued from houses which
were then illustrious, both by their owne vertues, and by those of
their fore-fathers. Of this number was Iohn of Daillon, Lord of
Lude,The Lord of Lude. and Imbert of Baterney, Lord of Bouchages. They came
in fauour with this Prince by diuers meanes, and maintained it in
like maner. The Lord of Lude had been bred vp with this Prince,
and the affection which begins so soone, doth not wither easily.
Philip de Commines addes this reason, that he knew well how to please
the King.

to take the coole aire, and demanding some refreshing in the
heate of the season, and the tediousnesse of the way, the Lord of
Baterney sent some things vnto him, and came himselfe to doe his
duty; hee brought with him Imbert of Baterney, being then but a

to come vnto him to Romans, for that hee had a desire to see that
Hauke flye againe. He went, and did so please this Prince, as he demanded
him of his father, and from that time he neuer abandoned
him vntill his death. He made him great in riches, and honor, as he
was in merit and vertue.

yeares prisoner in England, returned into France, and was much
beloued of king Lewis the eleuenth, for that he held nothing of the
sower & arrogant humors of his predecessors, & he continued in
the Kings seruice at such time as the Noble-men left him to follow
the Princes Armie. He reconciled the King, and the Duke of Brittanie,
and soone after died in Iuly, in the yeare 1471. without any
children: Iohn of Bourgondy, Earle of Neuers his Nephew, was his
heire.The accord betwixt the king and the Duke of Brittany was made at Saumur in the yeare 1469. and the difficulties were decided by the de

of Orleans, was the greatest and most fortunate Captaine of his
time: he alone of all the Noblemen of the league of the Common-weale,
pursued the fruits which France expected of such an enterprise.
He was chiefe and President of the Commissioners appointed
for the reformation of the disorders of the Realme, and died
before he could see the effects of that which hee had so earnestly
pursued in the yeare 1470.

as soone as he was entred into it, and remained more constant in
the assurance of his word, then the Duke of Nemours: his great
corage found nothing impossible: He was often wont to say, that he
which had force in hand, needed no other thing. He married Francis

Lord of Gamasches serued him worthily
and couragiously in the warre of the Common-weale, and was the
cause of the preseruation of Paris. He alwayes coasted the Duke of
Bourgondy his Army to keepe it from scattering to the hurt of the
Kings subiects; and that it should not make profit by the surprise of
any places in passing. Then he cast himselfe into Paris▪ and by his
presence fortified the courages which an accident (rather feared
then foreseene) had much deiected. The King gaue him the
gouernment with a troope of two hundred maisters, and made him

in the end, that there was no better lodging then at the kings armes.
His fortune was ruined in Brittany, and raised in France. Hee did
negotiate the enter-view of the King and Duke of Bourgondy at
Peronne, he was imployed in the Truce of nine yeares, 1475. and
was aduanced to the gouernment of Rousillon.

Generall throughout his whole Realme, and afterwards Lord
Steward of France. He was so fauoured, as the King gaue him often
the moity of his bed. This fauour lasted not long. The Chronicle
of the Kings library saith, That the King could not pardon any one of
whom he had suspition.

blow, hee lest him force and courage enough to stand vp, and to
protest before heauen and the people, that hee died an Innocent.
After that Philip de Commines had said, that he had serued the king
well in Paris in the warre of the Common-weale, he addes: In the
end he was ill rewarded, more by the pursuite of his enemies then by the
Kings fault, but neither the one nor the other can well excuse themselues.

Chabannes, Lord Steward of France, saw the ship of his fortune
cast vpon the shelfe in the beginning of this Princes Reigne. His
good fotune drew him out of the Bastille to go to the warre of the
Common-weale, in the end whereof hee was made Lord Steward
of France, hee had the chiefe charge of the Kings Army in Guyenne,
and was then much fauoured by this Prince, with whom hee
was so inward, as when hee meant to marry his second Daughter

to the Duke of Orleans, hee discouered his secret affections vnto
him by a letter which hee did write vnto him vpon that subiect,
wher of the Chronicle (in written hand of King Lewis the twelfth)
makes mention: hee sent him word, that whatsoeuer they said, hee
was resolued to giue his daughter to the yong Duke of Orleans,
but no man should bee troubled to nourish the Children that
should bee borne of that marriage.

fauours and honors hee had had of this Prince. His Predecessors,

Prince of Orange before Gy in the Franch-County, but hauing
beene repulst from the siege of Dole, hee was disgraced by Lewis
the eleuenth, who loued the seruices better then the seruants. Hee
was (saith Philip de Commines) a very fat man, who being reasonably
well content and rich, retired himselfe to his house.

to the seruice of the Princesse of Bourgondy; and caused the whole

him see, that a great Prince hath no small enemies; that a Hornet is

                  teuille. Lord of Torcy, gouerned his fortune amidst so
many rockes and shelues vnto a safe port. The King made him maister
of the Cross-bowes, and committed vnto him the guard of the
Cardinal of Balue in the Castell of Montbason. It was he that came
and aduertised the King of the danger in suffering such numbers of
English to enter into Amiens, during the Treaty of Piquigny.

                      should haue stood with these words, which are read in a Chronicle, M. S. of the Kings library: The Earle of Neuers being adiourned by the letters patents of the most high, and most excellent Prince, my redoubted Lord the Duke, sealed with the seale of his order of the Fleece, to appeare in person at this present Chapter, there to answere vpō his honor touching witchcraft and abusing the holy Sacraments of the Church, hath not appeared, but hath made default. And to auoid the sute and depriuation of the order to bee made against him, he hath sent back the Coller, and therefore hath been, and is declared out of the order, and not called in the offring. when as the Earle of Neuers was degraded
more vnworthily then the respect of his house made him to hope
from a Prince his neere kinsman. The Duke gaue him the gouernment
of the County of Boullein, & afterwards of Artois. He came
vnto the Kings seruice, and deliuered into his hands the Towne of
Arras after the Dukes death. It seemes that Philip de Comines would
not speake all he knew, nor call a Fig, a Fig. He knits it vp shortly in
these words: He could not mistake in submitting himselfe vnto the
Kings seruice, vnlesse he had taken a new oath to the yong Lady of Bourgondy,
and in yelding vp that vnto her which he held of hers. They haue
and will speake diuersly hereof, wherfore I referre my selfe to the truth.

he freed the king from the danger of Peronne; and that it was the
cause of the great fauour which he had purchased with the king. I
haue wondred why the king did not adde the honour of the Order
of S. Michael, and how it was possible that it should faile a man who
wanted not any thing, and who was so much fauoured, and so familiar
with the king, as he did often lye in his Bed, eate at his Table, sit
at his Councell, and carried his most secret designes to Princes

                  ALL well considered our onely
hope should be in God,In the end of the first booke. for in
him consists all our assurance
and all goodnesse, which cannot
bee found in any other
thing in the world: But wee do,
euery man, acknowledge it too
late, and after that wee haue
neede: yet it is better late then
neuer.
               Grace and good fortune
comes from God.Lib. 1. chap. 4.
               
               In all enterprises wee must
haue God of our side.Lib. 2. chap. 1.
               
               God hath alwaies loued the Realme of France.Lib. 4. chap. 1.
               
               To see things which God hath done in our time,Lib. 4. chap. 13. and doth daily,
shewes that he will leaue nothing vnpunished; And we may see
plainely that these strange workes come from him, for they are supernaturall,
and his sodaine punishments, and especially against
them that vse violence and cruelty: Who, commonly, are no
meane men, but great Personages, either by their owne absolute
power, or by the Princes authority.
               When God meanes to change the fortune of a Prince,Lib. 1. chap. 3. from
good to bad, or from prosperity to aduersity, he prepares him enemies
of no force, suffers his seruants to become treacherous, and
makes him distrustfull and iealous of them that are most faithfull.
Example of Charles Duke of Bourgundy.
               
               God giues the Prince as he meanes to punish Subiects,Lib. 5. chap. 9. and to
Princes Subiects, and disposeth of their affections towards them
as he meanes to raise or ruine them.
               
                  
God hath not created any thing in this world,Lib. 5. chap. 18. neither men nor
beasts, but he hath made him some thing opposite, to keepe him in
feare and humility.
               God speakes no more to men, neither are there any more Prophets
which speake by his Mouth; For his Faith is ample and
plaine to all those that will heare and vnderstand it, and no man
shall be excused for Ignorance, at least they which haue had hope
and time to liue, and which haue had their naturall wits.
               The misery of Princes is when as God is so offended as hee
will no longer endure them,Lib. 5. chap. 18. but will shew his force and his Diuine
Iustice, and then he doth first of all take away their iudgements,
which is a great wound for them it toucheth: He troubles
their house, and suffers them to fall into diuision and murmure.
The Prince fals into such indignation with God, as hee flies the
counsell and company of wise men, and doth aduance Vp-starts,
Indiscreete, Vnreasonable, Violent men, and Flatterers, who applaud
whatsoeuer he saith: If he must impose a peny, they say two:
If he threatens a man, they say he must be hanged; and in like manner
of all other things: And that aboue all things they cause themselues
to be feared; They carry themselues insolently and proudly,
hoping that they shall be respected and feared by this meanes, as if
Authority were their inheritance.
            
            
               Princes.
               THere is good and euill in Princes,In the Prologue. for they are men like vnto
vs, and to God onely belongs perfection.
               When as the vertues and good conditions of a Prince are greater
then his vices,In the same. he deserues great praise; for that such personages are
more inclined to all voluntary things then other men, as well for
their breeding and little correction they haue had in their youth,
as for that comming to the age of man, most men seeke to please
them, and to applaude their humours.
               No man should attribute any thing to himselfe,Lib. 1. chap. 4. especially a
great Prince, but should acknowledge that grace and good fortune
comes from God.
               Great Princes are much more suspitious then other men,Lib. 1. chap. 5. for the
doubts and aduertisements which are giuen them, and oftentimes
through flattery without any necessity.
               Princes and they which rule in great Estates should bee very
carefull not to suffer any faction to grow in their house, from
whence this fire flies throughout the whole Prouince: But this happens
not but by a Diuine instigation. For when as Princes or
Realmes, haue beene in great prosperity and wealth, and haue forgotten
from whence that Grace did come, God hath raysed them
enemies of whom no man doubted.
               God doth a great fauour vnto a Prince when he makes him capable
to winne men,Lib. 1. chap. 9. and it is a signe that he is not infected with the

odious vice and sinne of pride, which doth purchase hatred with
all men.
               Princes and great men that are proud and will not giue eare to
any,Lib. 1. chap. 10. are sooner deceiued then they that are affable and heare willingly.
               God shewes a great grace vnto a Prince,Lib. 1. chap. 10. when he knowes good
and euill, especially when the good precedes.
               Aduersity teacheth a Prince to be humble,Lib. 1. chap. 10. and to please them
that he hath need of. Example of Lewis the eleuenth, expelled from
his fathers Court in his youth.
               
               A Prince which hath entred into league with others,Lib. 2. chap. 12. should
dissemble many things which may breed diuision betwixt them:
and as he is the stronger, so should hee bee more wise. It is the
counsell which the Lord of Contay gaue vnto the Earle of
Charolois, who was discontented; for that the Dukes of Berry and
Britany held councels in his chamber and presence, diuided from
him.
               I neuer knew Prince that could discerne the difference of men,Lib. 2. chap. 12.
vntill he had beene in necessity and in action.
               Princes haue sometimes need of them whom they haue contemned:
Example in King Lewis the 11. Edward the 4. and the Earle of
Charolois.
               
               Princes impart their authority to them that are most pleasing
vnto them, both for the age which is most sortable vnto them, and
for that they are well conceipted of them: or sometimes they are
led by them who know and gouerne their delights. But they which
haue vnderstanding, returne soone when there is neede.
               I haue seene Princes of two humours, some so subtile and suspitious,Lib. 1. chap. 16.
as no man knew how to liue with them, and they did still imagine
that they were deceiued: the others trusted enough in their
seruants: but they were so grosse and vnderstood their owne affaires
so ill, as they could not discerne who did them good or euill. And
these are presently changed from loue to hatred, and from hatred
to loue. And although that of both sorts there are few found
good, nor any great assurance in them: yet I had rather liue vnder
the wise then vnder fooles. For there is more meanes to purchase
their fauour: but with the ignorant there is no meanes to be found,
for that there is nothing done with them, but with their seruants
whom many change often. Yet euery man must serue and obey
them in the Countries where they are, for they are bound vnto it.
               To pardon, to be bountifull, or to do any other grace, are things
belonging to the Office of Princes.
               A Prince, or any other man, that was neuer deceiued, cannot be
but a beast, nor haue knowledge of good and euill, nor what difference
there is.
               Men are not all of one complexion,Lib. 1. and therefore the Prince
for the lewdnesse of one or two, should not forbeare to doe pleasure
to many. For one alone, being the least of all those to whom

he hath done any good, may happily do such seruice as it shall recompence
all the villanies which the others haue committed. Example
in the Hostages of Leige, whom the Duke sent away free, contrary
to the opinion of the Lord of Contay, who concluded to put them to
death, some made the Liegeois grow obstinate in their reuolt, others
were the cause of their reduction, and the instruments of the wise negotiation
of the Lord of Imbercourt to draw in the Duke.
               
               One of the greatest signes of Iudgement that a Prince can shew
is to draw vnto him vertuous and honest men: For he shall be held
in the opinion of the world to be of the disposition and humour of
such as are neerest about him.
               God hath not ordained the Office of a King or Prince to be executed
by beasts; nor by them who through vaine glory say, I am
no Clarke, I refer all to my Councell, I trust in them, and so giuing
no other reason, go to their sports: If they had beene well bred in
their youth, they would haue other reasons, and bee desirous that
both their persons and vertues should be esteemed.
               God cannot send a greater plague vnto a Country, then a
Prince of weake vnderstanding: for from thence proceed all other
miseries; First growes diuision and warre, for he alwaies puts his
authority into an other mans hand, the which hee should be more
carefull to keepe then any other thing, and from this diuision proceeds
famine and pestilence, and all other mischiefes which depend
of warre.
               Princes hate them mortally that seeke to keepe them in
feare.
               
                  Wise Princes do alwaies in their Designes seeke some honest
and apparant coulour: Example in Lewis the eleuenth, who caused
the Estates to assemble at Tours, and there made his complaints
against the Duke of Bourgundy, to haue a Subiect to breake the peace.
               Of those bad Princes, and others, hauing authority in this
world, which vse it cruelly and tyrannously, not any, or few, haue
remained vnpunished: but it is not alwaies at a prefixed day, nor at
such time as they that suffer desire it.
               It is no blemish to Princes to be suspitious, and to haue an eye
ouer those that go and come: But it is a great shame to be deceiued,
and to loose by his owne errour; yet suspitions should haue a
meane; for to exceed is not good.
               
                  A weake and couetous Prince endureth any thing: Example in
the Emperour Fredericke, whom the Authour cals a man of a faint
courage, and who endured all for feare of spending.
               
                  There is no reason a Prince should thrust himselfe into danger
for a small matter,Lib. 1. chap. 1. if God hath not abandoned him: Example in the
Duke of Bourgundy, who vndertooke a war against the Suisses for a very
light occasion, and without hope of profite, considering the nature of the
people and country.
               Princes giue not honours and riches at their pleasures that demand
them.In the 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  Princes feare not to thrust a seruant into danger if neede require.
                  Lib. 3.
The Duke of Bourgundy had commanded Phillip de Commines
to go to Calice, which he durst not do without some assurance: The
Duke commanded him to passe on, although he should be taken, promising
to redeeme him.
               A Prince gouerned by other counsell then his owne doth in
the end returne to that which is most necessary for him:Lib. 3. chap. 10. 
                  Example
in the Duke of Brittany.
               
               A Prince should alwaies feare to put any thing in hazard.Lib. 6. chap. 2.
               
               There is not any man,Lib. 6. chap. 12. of what dignity soeuer, but doth suffer,
either in secret or in publicke, and especially they that cause others
to suffer.
               
                  The condition of two Princes, which haue beene enemies, is
therin miserable; that they cannot by any meanes assure themselues
one of an other. Example in Lewis the eleuenth, and Charles Duke
of Bourgundy: When they were together at Leige, there were not fifteene
daies past that they had made and sworne a Peace, and yet (saith the
Authour) there was no trust.
               
                  The old age of a Prince makes him patiently to endure many
things:
                  Lib. 1. chap. 2. Example of the Duke of Bourgundy, who dissembled that
which the Earle of Charolois his sonne did against the house of Croüy.

               Salique Law.
               VVIth wise and great deliberation,Lib. 6. chap. 3. and the Assistance of
Gods Grace, that Law and Ordonance was made in
France, that the daughters should not inherite the said Realme,
least it should fall into the hands of a forraigne Prince, for hardly
should the French euer haue endured it, neither do other Nations:
And in the end there is no great command whereas the Country
doth not remaine to them which are of the Country; the which

you may see by France, whereas the English haue had a great
command within these forty yeares, and at this day they haue nothing
left but Callice, and two little Castles, which cost them
much to keepe: The rest they lost with much more ease then they
conquered it, and they lost more in one day then they got in a
yeare. The like wee may say by the Realme of Naples, the
Iland of Sicile, and other Prouinces, which the French haue enioyed
many yeares, and at this day there is no signe nor memory
of them, but by the Sepulchres of their Predecessours. And although
they should endure a Prince of a Forraine Nation, with a
small traine well ordered, and himselfe wise, yet shall they hardly
do it with a great number of men: For if he brings with him a great
Traine, or he sends for them vpon any occasion of warre, they fall
out with the Subiects, as well for the diuersity of their humours
and conditions, as for their violence, and for that they are not beloued
in the Countrey as they that are borne there, and especially
when they seeke Offices, Dignities, and the Managing of
great affaires in the Country. A Prince that will shew himselfe
wise, when he goes into a Forraine Country, must reconcile all his
Townes, and if he bee endowed with this vertue (which onely
comes from the grace of God) it is to be esteemed before any other
thing: And if hee liue the age of a man hee shall haue great troubles
and affaires, and all they that shall liue vnder him, especially
when hee shall come to age, and his men, and seruants, shall haue
no hope of amendement.
            
            
               Enterueiw of Princes.
               IT is almost impossible that two great Lords shall euer agree,Lib. 1. chap. 14. for
the reports and suspitions which they haue howerly, & two great
Princes which desire to loue should neuer see one another, but
send honest and wise men one vnto another, who should entertaine
their friendships, and reconcile their errours.
               It is a great folly for two great Princes (which are in a manner
equall in power) to see one an other, vnlesse they were very yong,
at which time they haue no discourse but of pleasures: But when
as they beginne once to enuy one another, although there were no
danger for there persons (which is in a manner impossible) yet
there hatred and enuy encreaseth. Wherefore it were better they
should reconcile their quarrels by good and wise seruants.
            
            
               Gouernements.
               A Prince should haue a great care what Gouernours he sets in
a Country newly conquered, or ioyned to his State, to the
end the Subiects may be better intreated then they were before.

                        •
                     and of Hagembach, who was the cause that the
Duke of Bourgundy lost the Country which he held by engagement from
the Arch-Duke Sigismond.
            
            
               Councelles and Councellors.
               A Wise man cannot be bought at too deare a rate.Lib. 2. Chap. 1. It is very necessary
for a Prince to haue many of his Councell, for the wisest
erre very often, eyther for that they are passionate in matters
whereof they speake, through loue or hatred, or for that they will
oppose one against another, and sometimes by the indisposition
of persons, for we must not hold that for Councell which is done
after dinner. Some may say, that men committing any of these errors,
should not be of a Princes Councell. To whom I must answer
that we are all men, and he that would finde out such as should alwaies
speake wisely, and should neuer be moued nor distempered,
must seeke them in Heauen, for they are not to bee found among
men: but to recompence it, there may bee some one in Councell
which shall speake very wisely, and much better then he hath beene
accustomed, and so one helpes another.
               There are few things secret in this world,Lib. 2. Chap. 8. especiallie of those that
are spoken.
               About great Personages there are alwaies some Clarkes or
Lawyers, as it is fit and reasonable when they are good, but verie
dangerous when they are bad, they haue still the Law in their
mouthes, or some Historie, and the best that can be found, may be
turned to a bad sense: but wise men that haue read will neuer be abused,
neither will any be so hardy as to tell them lyes.
               It is a great treasor for a Prince to haue a wise man in his company,
and very safe to giue him credite, and that he may haue libertie
to speake the truth.
            
            
               Court of Parliament.
               IT is the custome of France to publish all Accords in the Court
of Parliament,Lib. 2. Cha. 14. else they should be of no force, yet the King may
alwaies doe much.
            
            
               Ambassadours.
               WHen as Ambassadours returne from Treaties and Negotiations,Lib. 1. Chap. 9.
they must be heard alone, or in little company, to the
end that if their discourse be to terrifie, they should giue such words
as they ought to them that are inquisitiue, for euery man desires to
heare newes of them that come from such Treaties, and many will
say: Such a one will not conceale any thing from me. But yet they will,
if they be as I say, and that they know they haue wise Maisters.
               It is not verie safe to haue many goings and commings of Ambassadors:Lib. 3. Chap. 8.
for many times they treat of things that are preiudiciall,

yet it is necessary both to send and receiue it.
               Ambassadours which come from true friends,Lib. 3. Chap. 8. and where there is
no cause of Ielousie, should be well entertained, and may see the
Prince often, according to the qualitie of the Princes person, for
if he be not wise nor honest, the lesse he is seene the better. If Ambassadors
come from Princes, which are not friends, they should be
receiued and intreated honourably, they must appoint trusty and
wise men to accompanie them, and dispatch them presently, for it
is a bad thing to keepe an enemy with him.
               Although warre were begunne,Lib. 3. Chap. 8. yet should they not breake off any
Treaties or Ouertures that are made of Peace, (for they know
not when they shall haue neede of it) but intertaine them all, and
heare all Messengers, doing the said things, and keeping good gard,
what men should goe vnto them, and who should bee sent both by
day and night, but as secretly as might be. And for one message
or Ambassador which they should send me, I would send them two:
And although they were weary, saying, that I should not send any
more, yet would I send when as I should haue meanes and opportunitie.
For you cannot send a better Spy, which should haue so
good meanes to see and vnderstand. And if they be two or three,
it is impossible to keepe so good gard ouer them, but the one or the
other will haue some speech, or learne some thing from some of
them: I meane holding honest tearmes, as they doe to Ambassadors.
And it is likely that a wise Prince will alwaies endeuor to haue
some friends with his aduerse party, and preuent it as hee can: for
in such affaires they cannot doe as they would; Some will say that
your enemy will grow more proud. I respect it not; for I shall
know more of his newes, and in the end shall reape both the profit
and honour. And although that others may doe the like with me,
yet will I not forbeare to send: And to this end will heare all practises,
and not breake any, but still find new matter. Moreouer, some
are not alwaies so iudicious as others, nor haue so great experience
in these affaires, neither haue they so great need. And in this case
the wisest gaine alwaies.
            
            
               Treasure of the Prince.
               KIng Charles 7. did neuer raise aboue one hundred and fourscore
thousand pounds sterling a yeare.Lib. 5. Cha. 18. And King Lewis his Sonne
did raise at the houre of his death, foure hundred, threescore and
ten thousand pounds starling, besides Artillerie and such other like
things: and without doubt it was a great pitty to see the pouerty of
the people. But our good Maister had one good thing in him, that
is, he laid vp nothing in his Treasure. He took all, and spent all, and
made great buildings for the fortification and defence of the towns
and places of his Realme, more then any of the Kinges which had
beene before him.
            
            
               
               Assemblies, Conferences, and Treaties.
               THe Assemblies and Conferences which are made from party to
partie are very dangerous,Lib. 1. Chap. 9. especiallie for him that is in danger
to fal. Most men haue naturally a desire to raise or saue themselues,
the which drawes them easily to the stronger. Some are so good
and so constant, as they haue none of these respects, but there are
few of them. And this danger is cheefly, when as they haue a Prince
which seekes to winne new. Example of the conference which was
made at the Mercers grange, which was since called the Market, for that
both parties did debauch one anothers men.
               
               Treaties of peace should be managed by the most faithfull Seruants
of Princes,Lib. 1, Chap. 9. and men of middle age, least their weaknesse cause
them to make some dishonest bargain, or to amaze their Maister at
their return more then is needfull; & they should be rather imployed
that haue receiued most fauours from him: But especially wise
men, for no man euer made his profit of a foole, and these treaties
should be rather handled a farre of then neere.
               
                  There was neuer so good a marriage but some dined ill.
                  Lib. 1. Chap. 4. Example
in the Treatie of Conflans where as some did what they would, & others
got not any thing.
               There are some good people which haue this glorie to think that
they will end matters whereas they vnderstand not any thing,Lib. 1. Chap. 16. for
sometimes their Maisters discouer not vnto them their most secret
intents. In the company of such, who, most commonly, goe but
for shew, and many times at their owne charge, there goes alwaies
some meane man which doth negotiate apart.
               Princes should haue a wise care to whom they commit their affaires,Lib. 1. Chap. 16.
and so should they also haue that are imploied for them, and
deale in such businesse. He that could excuse himselfe and not meddle
(vnlesse he saw that they themselues vnderstood it well, and had
an affection vnto the matter) should be very wise.
               It is an honor for a Prince to feare that which is to be feared, and
to foresee it.
               A Prince if he hath age should be verie warie not to make this excuse,
I did not thinke such a thing would haue happened, for it is not allowable.
               Princes feare not to thrust their Seruants into danger when they
haue neede.
               In Treaties Princes must imploy men that are pleasing, and such
as will passe ouer all things, and all wordes, to attaine vnto the end
of their Maisters desseignes.
            
            
               Allyances.
               BEtwixt the Kinges of France and the Emperors, there are great
oathes and confederacies not to attempt one against another.

The first Suisses that were seene in this Realme,Lib. 1. Chap. 6. and who haue giuen
credit to them that haue come after them, were at the Siege of
Paris, in the war of the common-weale, whereas they behaued themselues
most valiantly, and in all other places where they were imploied.
               The English are in a manner vnprofitable in the wars of France.
If the Duke of Bourgundy would haue made vse of them,Lib. 4. Chap. 5. it had bin
needfull that for a season hee should haue accompanied them, to
help, to direct and gouerne their Armie, according to the manner
of our warres. For there are none more ignorant nor more vntoward
when they first passe: But in a short space they become good
Souldiers, wise and valiant.
               There is but one high Chamberlaine in England:Lib. 6. Chap. 2. and for that
there is but one, it is a great office.

               The English haue a common saying,Lib. 3. Chap. 8. whereof they haue sometime
told me treating with them: That in battails which they haue
had with the French, they haue alwaies, or most commonly won:
But in all treaties with them they haue euer lost. And in my opinion
I haue knowne men in this Realme, as worthy to manage a great
Treatie, as any other in the World, and especially of the breeding
of our King.
               The Florentines did euery three months change their Lords who
had al the gouernment of the Cittie.Lib. 6. Chap 5.
               
               The English are not so subtile in Treaties and Accordes,Lib. 4. Chap. 9. as the
French: and whatsoeuer is saied they goe grossely to worke, but
they must haue patience and not debate matters cholerickly.
               The Italians take not Townes besieged so speedily as the French.Lib. 6. Chap. 5.
They know not so well how to force places and to defend them:
but to hold the fielde, and to settle a good order for their victuals,
and all other thinges necessary to hold the field, they vnderstand it
better then we do.
               I doe not thinke that I lie,Lib. 
                        •
                     . Chap. 2. to say that I beleeue, that since the first
battaile of Granson, vnto the death of the King our Maister, the
said Townes, and priuate men of the Suisses, haue gotten of our
King a Million of Florins of the Rhin, of the Townes I meane but
foure, Berne, Lucerne, Friburge, Zurich, and their Cantons, which
haue their Mountaines. Suisses is one, yet it is but a Village. I
haue seene one of this village, being an Ambassadour with others,
in a very meane habit, who notwithstanding gaue his aduice with
the rest. Soleuure and Ondreual are called the other Cantons.
               The English,Lib. 6. Chap. 2. as well Nobility, Commons, as Clergie, are inclined
to warre against this Realme, as well vnder colour of their quarrels
which they pretend, as for the hope of gaine; for that God
hath suffered their Predecessours to win many great battels within
this Realme, and to haue a long possession, both in Normandy and
in Guyenne, which they had held three hundred and fiftie yeares,

when as King Charles the seuenth won it first, as I haue said elsewhere,
at what time they carried great spoiles and riches into England,
as well of Princes and Noblemen of France, which had been
their Prisoners, and in great numbers, as of Townes and places
which they had taken in the said Realme, and hope still to doe the
like. But hardly should such an aduenture haue happened in the
time of the King our Maister: for he would neuer haue hazarded his
Realme, by putting himselfe, and all his Nobilitie, on foot to fight
with them, as they did at Agincourt, but would haue proceeded
more wisely if it had come to that point.
               The Earledome of Flanders is a smal matter,Lib. 6. Chap. 7. without the Country
of Artois; which lies betwixt France and them, and is as it were
a curbe vnto them.
               Offices and Estates are more desired in Paris then in any other
place of the World,Lib. 1. Chap. 6. for they that haue them make of them what
they can, and not what they ought: There are Offices without fees,
which are sold for aboue eight hundred Crowns, and others which
haue very small entertainment, are sold for more then their wages
amount vnto in fifteene yeares. Wherefore seldome doe any disappoint
themselues. And the Court of Parliament maintaines
this Article. It is reason, for it concernes them all. Among Counsellors
there are also some good and worthy men, and in like manner
there are some ill conditioned: So is it in all Estates.

that did so much abound in riches, moueables, and buildings, nor

It is God which made this great and sumptuous building to fall
suddenly; that powerfull house which hath fed and maintained so
many good men, and hath been so much honored both far off and
neere, by so many trophees and victories, as not any Neighbour in
those times hath receiued the like. And this felicity & grace of God
continued an hundred and twentie yeares, when as all their Neighbours
did suffer (as France, England and Spaine) and they haue all
come thither to require aide; as you haue seene by experience of
the King our Maister, who in his youth, and during the life of King
Charles the seuenth his Father, liued sixe yeares there, in the time of
the good Duke Philip, who receiued him louingly. From England
I haue seene King Edwards two Brethren there, the Duke of Clarence,
and the Duke of Glocester; who afterwards called himselfe
King Richard, and of King Henries partie (who was of the house of
Lancaster) I haue seene in a manner all that race there. I haue seen
this house honoured from all parts, and then suddenly fall, and to
be the most desolate and ruinous house both in Princes & Subiects
of all her Neighbours.

the fourth repasse the Sea: who said that hee would hazard all, rather

                     〈◊〉

(for beeing in a small number they are not of any force)

to loose their horses; or that they haue not any at 
                     〈◊〉

                     •
                  he Earle of

Charolois did quite contrarie to that which had been resolued.
               It is dangerous for any one to hazard his estate vpon a battell,Lib. 2. Chap. 2. if
he may auoide it. For although the number be small that he loose,
yet the hearts of his men are danted, and the change more then can
be imagined, as well in feare of their enemies, as in contempt of
of their Master and of their trustie seruants, and they fall into mutinies
and practises, demanding more boldly then they were wont,
and they grow angry if they be refused. One Crowne before would
haue satisfied them better then three wil now. And if he that hath lost
be wise, he will not at such a time hazard any thing with them that
haue fled: But onely stand vpon his gard, and seeke out something
easie to vanquish, whereas they may be Masters to put fresh courage
into them, and take away feare. Howsoeuer, a lost Battell hath
alwaies a great traine, and bad for the looser: True it is that Conquerors
should seeke it to shorten their worke, especially they
that haue good footmen, and better then their neighbours, as wee
may say at this day the English or Suisses. I speake not this to contemne
other Nations, but those haue had great victories, and
their men are not to hold the field long without imploiment, as
the French or Italians can doe, who are wiser, or more easie to
leade. Contrariwise he that gaines growes into greater reputation
and esteeme with his men then before. His obedience encreaseth among
his subiects. In this estimation they grant him whatsoeuer
he demands, and his men grow more couragious and hardie: Also
the said Princes do sometimes grow so glorious and proud, as they
miscarry afterwards, and hereof I speak vpon knowledge: But such
grace comes onely from God.
               Euery one should be fearefull to hazard a battell that is not forced:Lib. 2. Chap. 4.
But if there be no remedie, before he come to it, he must cast
all the doubts that can be thought on. For commonly they that
doe things fearefully make prouision for all euents, and gaine
oftener then they that proceed with pride: yet when God will haue
a hand in it nothing can preuaile.
               Euery man should doe what he may,Lib. 2 Chap. 3. and what he ought in a day
of Battell, and acknowledge that it is one of the accomplishments
of the worke of God, begun sometimes vpon small occasions, and
giuing victorie sometimes to the one, and sometimes to the other.
And this is so great a misterie, as Realmes and great Siegnories
are sometimes ruined, and others increase and begin to
raigne.
            
            
               Warre.
               IT is an easie matter to begin Warre betwixt two great Princes,
but hard to pacifie it, by reason of the accidents which happen:
For many exploits are done of either side to anoy his enemy, which
on the sudden cannot be recalled.
               
                  
It is a great folly in a Prince to submit himselfe to the power of
an other, especially when they are in warre.
               It is a great show of pride or folly for any one to hold himselfe
too strong,Lib. 2. Cha. 10 and yet Captaines doe it sometimes to be held valiant,
or for that they doe not well vnderstand the busines which they
haue in hand.
               Among other things that are fit to make conquest, if there bee
not a great iudgement all the rest is of no force, and I thinke that it
must come from the grace of God.
               He that hath the profit of the Warre hath the honor.
               There must bee no hast nor precipitation when they vndertake,Lib. 5. Chap. 28
and begin a warre: And I tell you that Kings and Princes are
much the stronger when they vndertake it with the consents of
the subiects, and are more feared of their enemies. When it is a
defensiue warre this cloud is seene comming a farre off, especially
if it be from strangers, and therein good subiects should not complaine
nor refuse any thing, and the accident cannot be so sudden
but they may call some men, such as shall bee named. It is not
done without cause, and therein they vse no fixion, nor entertaine
a pettie warre at pleasure, and without cause, to haue occasion to
leuy money.
               The greatest miseries come commonly from the stronger: For
the weaker seeke nothing but patience.
            
            
               Souldiours.
               I Hold that men at Armes entertained are well imployed vnder
the authoritie of a wise King or Prince,Lib. 3. Chap. 3. but when he is otherwise,
or that he leaues Infants, the vse, wherevnto their Gouernours imploy
them, is not alwaies profitable, neither for the King nor for his
subiects.
               Men at Armes lie continually vpon the Country, without paying
any thing, committing infinite insolencies and excesse, as
all others know: For which they are not content with an ordinarie
life, and with that which they finde in a labourers house, from
whom they are payed: But contrariwise they beat the poore men
and force them to fetch bread, wine and victuals from abroad:
And if he hath a faire Wife or a Daughter, hee shall doe well to
keepe her safely. Yet seeing there is pay, it were easie to reforme
it, so as the men at Armes were payed euery two monethes at the
farthest, and so they should haue no excuse to commit those insolencies
which they doe, vnder coulour of want of pay: For the money
is leuied and comes at the end of the yeare. I speake this for our
Realme, which is more opprest in this case then any other that I
know, and no man can help it but a wise King. Other neighbour
countries haue other punishments.
            
            
               
               Sieges.
               ALthough that sometimes sallies bee very necessarie, yet are
they dangerous for them that are in a place, for the losse of
Ten men is greater to them then a hundred to the enemie without,
their numbers not being equal: neither can they recouer more
when they will, and they may loose a Commander or a Leader,
which oftentimes is the cause that the rest of the souldiors demand
nothing more then to abandon the place.
               In sieges of places the losse of one man alone is the cause to preserue
his Master from a great inconuenience,Lib. 5. Chap. 3. although, he be not
of his house, nor of any great extraction, but onely hath iudgment
and vertue. Example in Cohin, an Englishman, who being slaine with
a Canon shot within Nancy, the Englishmen whom he commanded mutined
and caused the Towne to be yeelded.
               
               After that a Prince hath laid siege against a place,Lib. 5. Chap. 6. and planted
his Artilerie, if any come to enter and to relieue it against him they
are worthy of death, by the law of Armes. Yet it is not practised in
our Warres, which are more cruell then the wars of Italy or Spaine,
whereas they vse this custome.
               
               
                  Despaire of succors make men besieged to put all things in hazard.
Example by the furious sallie of them of Liege who had like to
haue taken or slaine the King, or the Duke of Bourgundy.
            
            
               Victorie.
               THey doe alwaies augment the number of the vanquished.Lib. 2 Chap. 2. I
haue seene in many places whereas for one man they said they
had slaine a hundred, to please them, and with such lies they doe
sometimes abuse their masters.
               Hee that gaines in warre growes in greater reputation with his
Souldiors then before.Lib. 2. Chap. 2. His obedience encreaseth. They grant
him what hee demands, and his men are more hardie and couragious.
            
            
               Changes.
               THe changes are great after the death of great and mighty
Princes,In the Prologue. where some loose, and others gaine.
               Great changes proceed not from fortune,Lib. 1. Chap. 12. which is nothing but
a Poeticall fiction. The Author speakes this vppon the Constables
ruine, and concludes in these tearmes. He should be very
ignorant that should beleeue that fortune, or any such like
thing, should cause so wise a man to be hated of these two Princes

at one instant who in their liues did neuer agree in any thing but in
this, and most of all of the King of England who had married
his Neece, and did wonderfully loue all his wiues kindred, and
especially those of this house of St Pol. It is likely and very
certaine that hee was depriued of the grace of GOD to haue
made himselfe an enemie to these three Princes, and not to haue
any one friend that durst lodge him one night, and there was no
other fortune that had any hand in it but God, and so it hath happened
and will happen to many others, who after great and long
prosperities fall into great aduersities.
               When as a great man hath lost all his owne, he soone wearies
them that support him. Example of Rene Duke of Lorraine, who
retired into France after the Duke of Bourgundie had taken his Country.
               
               
                  God giues extraordinarie willes vnto Princes when it pleaseth
him to change their fortunes.
                  Lib. 5. Chap. 5. Example of Charles Duke of Bourgundie
who grew obstinate at the second siege of Nancy, against the aduice
of his Councell.
            
            
               Prosperitie, Aduersitie.
               A Misfortune neuer comes alone.Lib. 3. Chap. 5.
               
               
                  Prosperitie makes people proud.
                  Lib. 4. Chap. 3. Example of them of
Arras.
               Princes are proud and seeke not the true remedies in their misfortunes,Lib. 5. Chap. 5.
whereof the first is to returne vnto God, and to consider
if they haue offended him in any thing, and to humble themselues
before him, and acknowledge their errors: For it is he that
iudges of such suites whereas no error can bee propounded. After
this, it will doe him great good to conferre with some priuate
friend, and boldly to discouer his griefes vnto him, for it
doth ease and comfort the heart, and the spirits recouer their
vertue, conferring thus with some one in priuate; or else he must
seeke another remedy by exercise and labour, for of necessitie, seeing
we be men, such griefes must passe with great passion, either in
publike or in priuate.
               In time of aduersitie euerie one murmures and contemnes
all the actions of the afflicted.Lib. 5. Chap 7. 
                  Example in the Duke of Bourgundy
after the losse of the battels of Granson and Morat.
               Wee must hold for certaine that the great prosperities of
Princes,Lib. 5. Chap. 6. or their great aduersities, proceed from the Diuine
prouidence.
               If men were alwaies wise,Lib. 1. Cha. 15. they should bee so temperate in
their speeches in time of prosperitie, as they should haue no
cause to change in time of aduersitie. The Flemings during the
life and prosperitie of their Duke, spake not to the King, nor of the

King with such reuerence as they haue done since.
               
               
                  Affliction troubles the minde and alters the complexion. This
was knowne in the Duke of Bourgundy after the Battell of Granson.
He was neuer so wise as he had been, his choller and naturall heat was
so great before as he dranke no wine, and after this they caused him to
drinke it pure.
            
            
               Diuision.
               ALl good things in this world are ouerthrowne by diuision,Lib. 2. Cha. 16. and
it is almost impossible that many great Noblemen of like estate
can long entertaine themselues together, if there bee not a
head aboue them, and if it were necessarie he should be wise and
well esteemed to draw obedience from them all.
               A wise Prince hauing the command of ten thousand men,Lib. 1. Chap. 16. and
meanes to entertaine them, is more to bee feared then ten hauing
either of them six thousand, all allyed and confederate
together, for that they haue so many things to decide among
them, as halfe the time is spent before any thing can bee
conceiued.
               The true signe of the ruine of a Countrey is when as they
that should hold together are deuided and abandon it.Lib. 2. Chap. 1. 
                  Example
in the Towne of Dinand, which left the alliance of them of
Liege.
               
               Factions are much to be feared in a Realme when as they happen,Lib. 3. Chap. 7.
and cause great ruines. Example of the diuisions of England
betwixt the houses of Lancaster and Yorke.
               
               When as a faction begins,Lib. 3, Chap. 8. although there be but two or three
Princes, or meaner men that deale in it, yet before the feast hath
continued two yeares all the neighbours are inuited.
               There was neuer any faction begun in the countrie but the
end was preiudiciall and hard to be quencht.Lib. 4. Chap. 9.
               
               Diuisions are the springs of Warre from whence grow mortalitie
and famine,Lib. 5. Cha. 18 and all these miseries proceed for want of
faith.
               Wee must confesse (considering the wickednes of men, and
especially of great men who know not, neither doe beleeue that
there is a God) that it is necessarie that euery Nobleman and
Prince should haue his contrarie to keep him in feare and humilitie,
else no man should bee able to liue vnder them or neere
them.
            
            
               Commotions and Seditions.
               IN tumults and Seditions the most wicked are most bold and
hardie.In the Prologue.
               
            
            
               
               Liberality.
               RIches and Honors are not giuen at their pleasures that demand
them.In the Apology.
               
               King Lewis the eleuenth gaue much to Churches.Lib. 5. Cha. 18. In some things
lesse had done better: 
                     •
                  or he tooke from the poore to giue to them
which had no neede. To conclude, there is no perfect measure in
this world.
            
            
               Iustice and Iniustice.
               THere are Princes which punish vnder a colour of Iustice, and
haue Instruments fit for their humours, who of a venialll sinne
make it mortall. If they haue no matter, they finde meanes to delay
the hearing of the parties and witnesses, to ruine them in expences,
expecting still if any one will complaine of him which is in durance,
and whom they hate. If this course will not serue to compasse
their intention, they haue others more suddaine; saying that
it were necessary to make him an example, making his case as they
thinke good.
               To others that hold of them and are somewhat stronger,
they proceede by way of fact, and say: Thou disobaiest or doest
contrary to the homage which thou owest me, and so by force they
take from him that which he hath, if they can, (at the least they doe
their best) and make him to liue miserably. He that is but their
Neighbour (if he be strong and resolute) they suffer him not to liue:
but if he be weake, he knowes not what course to take. They will
say vnto him, he hath supported their enemies, or they will send
their men at Armes to liue in his Country, or will buy quar
                     •
                  els, or
finde occasions to ruine him, or will maintaine his Neighbour against
him, and will lend them men. Of their Subiects, they will
disgrace such as haue serued their Predecessors well, to raise new
men.
            
            
               Punishment.
               TO see the things which God hath done in the World,Lib. 4. Chap. 13. and doth
daily, it seemes that he will leaue nothing vnpunished, and we
may see plainly that these strange workes come from him: for they
are beyond the workes of nature, and his punishments are so suddaine,
especially against them that vse violence and cruelty; who
commonly are no meane persons, but great, either in Signeurie, or
the Princes Authority.
            
            
               
               Iniuries, Offences, and Outrages.
               PRinces and they that are in great Authority, should feare to doe
or speake outragiously, and haue a care to whom they speake
them: For the greater they are, the more sencible and distastfull
are the outrages they doe; for it seemes that outrages will bee mor
                     •
                  
noted for the greatnesse and authoritie of the person that commits
them, and if he be their Maister or Lord, they will dispaire euer to
receiue honour or fauour from him, and more men serue for the
hope of future good, then for that which they haue receiued. Example
of the lye which the Constable gaue to the Lord of Imbercourt at the
conference of Roy.
               
            
            
               Prudence, Experience, and Occasion.
               I Haue seene few men that could flye time,Lib. 
                        •
                     . Chap. 3▪
                   and auoyd their misfortunes,
neither heere, nor in any place else: For the one hath
no experience, hauing not seene their neighbour Countries, which
is a great error in all men of worth, for it giues a great iudgement
& resolution to haue seene thinges by experience. Others haue to
great a loue to their Goods, Wiues, and Children. And these
reasons haue beene the causes of the ruine of many good men.
               Men which haue no experience,Lib. 1. Chap. 3. maintaine many ill grounded
arguments, and with sm
                     •
                  ll reason. Wherefore it is good to follow
the opinion of him which saith, That no man repents himselfe of speaking
little, but oftentimes for speaking to much.
               
            
            
               Secrecy.
               AS soone as Princes depart one from another,Lib. 11. Cha. 8. they secretly
whisper whatsoeuer hath beene obserued in them, and then
through indiscretion speake of it openly at dinner and supper, and
then it is reported of both sides, for few thinges are kept secret in
this world, especially of those which are spoken.
            
            
               Knowledge.
               A Prince,Lib. 5. Cha. 18. or man of any Estate whatsoeuer, if he haue force and
authoritie where he liues ouer others, if he bee learned and
hath seene or read, it will either amend him or impaire him: For
the bad impaire with much knowledge, and the good amend. Yet
it is credible, that knowledge doth rather amend him then impaire

him, were there nothing but the shame to know his owne euill, it
were sufficient to
                     •
                  keepe him from doing ill, at the least not to
wrong any man, whereof I haue seene many experiences among
great personages, whom knowledge hath drawne from many bad
desseignes, and also the feare of Gods punishment, whereof they
haue greater knowledge then ignorant men, who haue neither seen
nor read.
            
            
               History.
               IT is a great aduantage for Princes to haue read Histories in their
youth,Lib. 2. Chap. 6. where they may plainely read of such assemblies, and of the
great fraudes, deceipts and periuries, which some of the ancients
haue vsed one against another, hauing taken and slaine them that
haue relyed vpon such assurances. It is not said that all haue vsed it,
but the example of one is sufficient to make many wise, and to giue
them a will to stand vpon their gard: And in my opinion one of the
greatest means to make a man wise is to haue read ancient Histories
and to learne to gouerne himselfe wisely thereby, and by the example
of our predecessors. For our life is so short as it suffic
                     •
                  th not to
haue experience of so many thinges. Besides we are decayed in age
and the life of man is not so long as it was wont to be, nor their bodies
so strong,
               All the Bookes that are written were to no vse, if it were not to
reduce things past to memory, where we see more in one booke in
three monthes, then twenty men liuing successiuely one after another,
can see by the eye or learne by experience. Although that enemies
nor Princes be not alwaies alike (notwithstanding that the subiect
be) yet is it good to be informed of thinges past.
            
            
               Nourishment.
               ALl men that haue beene great,Lib. 1. Chap. 9. and done great matters, haue begun
very yong. And it cōsists in the education, or coms from the
grace of God. This is spoken by the Author vppon the good education
of Lewis the eleuenth, without the which it had beene impossible for
him to haue surmounted those great difficulties which he had in the beginning
of his raigne, and to blame that of the noblemen of his time, who
were not bred vp but to shew their folly in their speach and apparrell.
They haue no knowledge of any learning, and there is not a wise
man among them. They haue Gouernors to whom they talk of their
affaires, and not to themselues, and they dispose thereof, and there
are such Lords which haue not sixescore and ten pounds starling
yearely rent which take a glory in saying, speake vnto my officers,
thinking by these wordes to seeme great men. In like manner I haue
often seen such seruants make their profit of their maisters, giuing

them to vnderstand that they were beasts. And if happily any one
returnes and desires to know his owne, it is so late as it serues him to
small purpose.
               A Princes subiects haue cause to greeue, when they see his Children
ill bred vp, and in the hands of bad conditioned men.
            
            
               Nature.
               
                  A Naturall wit, perfectly good excells al other sciences, that may
bee learned in the world. Example of Lewis the eleuenth who
without any knowledge of learning had the reputation and the effects of
the wisest Prince of his age.
            
            
               Hope.
               ALL well considered our only hope must be in God,In the end of the first Book. for in him
lies all our assurance and all bounty, which cannot be found in
any worldly thing, But euery man knowes it too late, and after that
he hath need, yet it is better late then neuer.
            
            
               Age.

sonne patiently.
                  Lib. 1. Chap. 2. Example of Philip Duke of Bourgondy, who dissembled
the bad vsage of his sonne the Earle of Charolois to them of th

               Carelesnes and vigilancy.
               MAd and distracted Princes are not to bee blamed if they gouerne
their affairs ill:Lib. 6. Cha. 4. but they that haue their iudgments sound
and are well disposed of their persons, if they spend their whole time
