            These newe freſhecome Friars being ſprong vp of late,
            doe nowe within Andwarpe keepe their abidinge:
            Seducinge muche people to their damned eſtate,
            by their newe falſe founde doctrine the Goſpel deridinge.
            Sayinge and affirminge, which is no newe falſe tidinge,
            that all ſuche as doe the Popes doctrine diſpiſe:
            As damned ſoules to hell muſte be ridinge.
            For they doe condemne them with their newe found lie,
            Theſe be the children of the worlde counted wiſe:
            whoſe wiſedome is folly to God and his elect.
            But let Sathan worke all that he can deuiſe,
            God it is alone which the Goſpel doeth protect.
