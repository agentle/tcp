            To the Tune of the black Almayne.
            
               
                  A Stock of flowers, bedewed with ſhowers,
               In a Garden now there ſprings:
               With mirth and glee, vpon a Tree,
               A Byrd there ſits and ſings,
               So pleaſant is her voyce,
               It doth my hart reioyce:
               She ſets her tunes and noates ſo meete,
               That vnto me it ſeemes ſo ſweete:
               That all the Flowers that euer could be,
               Was neuer ſo ſwete as this to me,
               The lyke before I dyd neuer ſe.
            
            
               ¶The Bible it is, that Garden iwys,
               Which God preſerue alwayes:
               Lykewyſe Gods worde it is that Byrde,
               That now ſo much I prayſe.
               Alſo thoſe goodly Flowers,
               So well bedewed with ſhowers:
               I wyll now go about to gather,
               And put them in a Poſy together:
               I wyll not put them in no Cheſt,
               But bynd them vp as I thinke beſt,
               And kepe them alway next my breſt.
            
            
               ¶The fyrſt I fynd, to pleaſe my mind,
               A bell he had to name:
               Enoch alwayes, is worthy of prayſe,
               Like wyſe of worthy Fame.
               Looke you what Moſes wrytes,
               And in Geneſis there reſites:
               How God tooke hym the ſtory ſayth,
               That he ſhould neuer taſt of death:
               And alſo Noe that righteous man
               A curious worke dyd take in hand,
               To make the Arke we vnderſtand.
            
            
               ¶Good Abraham, that faithfull man,
               In God dyd truſt alway:
               He dyd not feare, nor once diſpayre.
               His onely ſon to ſlay.
               Iſacke was no weede,
               Nor Iacob in very deede:
               Ioſeph was a Flower of price,
               God dyd hym ſaue from cruell deuice
               Alſo Moſes eke we fynd,
               And Aaron lyke wyſe vp we bynd,
               Ioſua is not out of mynd.
            
            
               ¶The Iudges alſo, both leſſe and mo,
               They were of worthy Fame:
               To ſpeake of all, my tyme is ſmal,
               To rehearce them all by name.
               The Prophet Samuell,
               Our God dyd loue him well:
               Dauid was a Flower ſo ſweete,
               To make hym kyng God thought it meete
               For great Golias he hath ſlayne.
               And Sallomon after him dyd raygne
               Which vnto wyſedome dyd attayne.
            
            
               When Achab dyd floryſh, the Rauens did noriſh
               Elia a man of God,
               Kynge Ioſias, and Eſdras
               We finde and pacient Iob.
               They feared our God of might,
               And ſerued him day and night:
               No ioy nor payne could them procure,
               But alwayes by hym to endure:
               Eſay lyke wyſe and Ieremy,
               They preached alway earneſtly
               and dyd their duty faithfully,
            
            
               ¶And Daniell deſtroyed Bell,
               The Babilonians God:
               The Dragon alſo, he brought to wo,
               Without either ſword or Rod.
               To rehearce the prophets all,
               By their names them for to call:
               Although they be of worthy Fame,
               It is to long them for to name:
               We may not Toby as leaue behynd,
               Yet was he almoſt out of mind,
               But few ſuch flowers now can we fynd.
            
            
               ¶Full wel we know, no flowers can blow,
               But boyſterous ſtormes muſt fynd:
               For that is no Flower, that euery ſhowre,
               Doth driue away with wynd▪
               
               For all theſe goodly Flowers,
               Had many ſtormy ſhowers:
               Before that they could blow or bud,
               Or bring forth ſeede to doe any good:
               They dyd abyde both cold and blaſt,
               Yet allwayes dyd they ſtand ſtedfaſt,
               Tyll all the ſtormes were gone and paſt.
            
            
               ¶Now at this time, for our gracious queene,
               Let vs geue harty prayes:
               God may her defend, from enemies hand:
               at this time and alwayes.
               And ſend her proſperous raygne,
               With vs for to remayne,
               For to defend Gods word ſo pure,
               And euer with it for to endure:
               That ſhe may be to vs a bower,
               To kepe vs alway when it doth ſhowre,
               I pray God ſaue that Princly flower.
