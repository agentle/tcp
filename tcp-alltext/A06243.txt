And the ſame Statute alſo authorizeth the giuing of other directions, as vnto them for the preſent neceſſity, ſhall ſeeme good in their diſcretions. It is therefore vpon ſpeciall conſideration thought very expedient, for the preuenting and auoyding of the infection of Sickneſſe (if it ſhall pleaſe Almighty God) which is now dangerouſly diſperſed into many places within the Citie and Suburbs of the ſame: that theſe Officers following bee appointed, and theſe Orders hereafter preſcribed be duly obſerued.
