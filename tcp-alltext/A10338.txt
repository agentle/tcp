                     RIght Worshipfull, whom I reverence, and loue in the Lord Iesus; The gifts and graces of this humble, and holy, religious, and iudicious man of God, were so glorious and resplendent in the eies of al that could discerne the beautie, or prize the value of such things: that he needs not my candle to light his sunne, nor any pen or stile of mine to make new Impressions of honour and loue in the hearts of them that knewe him. Only I say, the Lord had powred the precious Spicknard of his Spirit vpon his head, filling his mind with spirituall vnderstanding in heavenly things, and the virtue and vigour thereof had lok'd down into his heart, giuing him both seeling and fruit of that hee vnderstood. Iacobs body was never embalmed with so sweet

Certainely I doe not well, this is a day of good tydings, this a message of

                        OBADIAH 1.
                        
                           1 The vision of OBADIAH. Thus saith the Lord God against Edom; we haue heard a rumor from the Lord & an Ambassadour is sent among the heathen: arise, and let vs arise vp against her in battel.
                           2 Behold, I haue made thee smal among the heathen: thou art vtterly despised.
                        
                     
                     
                        BEfore I come to the exposition of the Prophets words, I thinke it convenient to shew vnto you the cause, why leaving the epistle of Peter, which I had in hand, I haue taken vpon me to handle this Prophesie. Saint Peter having testified, that the Gospell of Christ, was the truth of GOD, preached to men for the salvation of their soules, exho

                        d follow that which was good, and in particular towards GOD,

and man, especially Subiects to honour their kings; servants to obey their Masters; wiues, husbands; children, parents. In all which, that their endeavours might not be hindered by enemies, he exhorteth them to patience and constancie: And finally beseecheth the Elders & Pa stors to feed the stocke of CHRIST committed to their charge, as the principall meanes to bring thē to their duety, and to establish them in grace vnto the ende. Now in expounding these things I came to the dutie of subiects, wherein I declared, that the Princes received the sword and supremacie, over all persons; & it followed that afterward I should shew, that it was also in all causes. But because, since that time it pleased GOD to call me to proue it else where, and to commit the same to writing, it seemeth not so necessary to handle that point in this place. As for the other points concerning the duties of servants, wiues, Parents, for that there are very few such come hither, least I shoulde preach to them that were absent, I thought that part might conveniently be omitted. Wherefore the last point remained which was concerning the enimies of the Church, whom for that the LORD will most certainely destroy, we must haue the greater patience to

                           ndure and continue in the stedfastnes of our profession. For which cause also he exhorteth the Pastors diligently to feed and tend vpon their slocks. Which matter being right necessary for vs to know, and for that I hoped this doctrine would pierce the better into our hearts, if we had the same handled out of some continued place: I chose this Prophesie of OBADIAH, where

this thing is handled orderly & iointly; namely in the 16 first verses the destructiō
                         of the enemies of the church & in the fiue last the salvation therof by the ministerie of the Pastors: whom in the last verse he calleth Saviours, for that GOD by their Ministery worketh the salvation of his people. And this also haue I the rather chosen, because I may vse Peter as an Interpreter of the Proph

                           t, whereby comparing them togither, the one may giue light to th'other; that so being built on the doctrine of the Apostles & Prophets we may grow vp into that building, whereof Iesus Christ is the chiefe corner stone.
                     
                     The Title, The vision of OBADIAH.
                     Whence we gather the commodity and excellencie hereof by the Matter, and Author.
                     
                     1 The matter is tearmed by the name of visiō
                         which is a doctrine Revealed from GOD, so called because GOD Revealed them so evidently, and delivered them for such certainety, as though they had presently seene before their eies the things which they foretold. And the Lord, not onely by visible sights, as he did to Ezechiel, Daniel, &c: at sometimes, but also very often by his word without visible signes, is said to haue delivered these visions, for so is he said to haue spoken to Abra ham in vision. I am thy great reward. The words which Esay saw, &c: & of this sort is this vision. That is, a doctrine Revealed from GOD, no

                     2 The Author is supposed of some to be that O BADIAH who was governour of King Achabs house who hid the Prophets of the Lord. But by the

circumstances, especially by that in the 11. verse, it seemeth 1. King 18. 3. not to be he, seeing mention is made of the taking of Ierusalem, which was 800 yeares after Achab. But whether it were the same, or another of that name, whether hee before in the spirit saw, or afterwards spake by experience: It sufficeth vs, that he was the Minister of the Lord, and servant as his name importeth, and that these prophecies came not by the will of man, but holy men of God spake, as they were moued by the

                        Lord comforting his people, with promise to execute his iudgement on such as had persecuted them, nameth Edom as the chiefe amongst them. Now where he saith, I haue made thee small among the heathen, Hee speaketh of a thing to come, as though it were already

past, to signifie the vndoubted certainetie thereof, and so it is expounded in the 10. verse, Shame shall cover thee. Now, because the meanes hee would vse, is warre raised against them by nations confederating together, the Prophet openeth it, as though it were in doing; GOD hauing revealed it to his servant: for here is an Ambassadour sent from one nation to another, to stirre them vp against Edom, and mention is here made of a full and perfect destruction.
                     
                     Here note three things.

                           1. Witnesses, O

                     One point, which wee are to marke for our instruction, is the ground, which the Prophet layeth for our faith, whereon the Church of God must rest, which is this. Thus saith the Lord. Which doctrine is first necessary for such, as are teachers in the Church, that the words, which they must teach, must bee wordes of the Lord, that as Peter commandeth, who so speaketh, may

He came thither, & did the message, V. 2. 3. 4 crying out against the altar, according vnto the word of the Lord. The king first threatned him, and after allured him to come and dine with him, and receiue a reward.

that when we haue once learned the will of GOD, we go not out of our way, wee leaue not this worde though Prophets, ancient Prophets, yea such as tell you Angels from heaven haue taught them, yet I saie Gal. 1. 8. that wee leaue not the word of the Lord to goe with them. Now many tell you of these things, Fathers, ancient Fathers, apparitions of Saints, Angels. Would to God, there were not many deceived by them: but we see that this was a prophet of the Lord, ancient in yeares, godly in religion, for he came not vp to worship at Bethel, faithful, for he beleeved the prophecie sent by God, & had a care to be buried by the Prophet; yet whē he said that an Angel had spokē to him, he lyed, wherby we see that prophets, old &c: may deceiue; for each man is a lyar. So that wee haue none assurance, but of them in whom the holy Ghost spake, & that were guided by him, and they are alone to be our foundation. Wherefore whōsoever the Lord sendeth to Bethel to preach his truth against sinne, and heresie, Eph 2 20. let him not relie on any Prophet, but on that word, which he hath received of the Lord: least, not that Lyō which stood still by the carkas, but that Lyon which goeth

by them may be enlightned, but in no case shadowed, for we are Ministers appointed to publish his word, & not the fanctes of mē. There is a promise to the preaching of his word, and a blessing to the hearers thereof. This haue we a commandement to teach. Then this ought to be as fire in our bowels, to enflame vs to teach, and in others, with reverence to heare and attend to it, and vnlesse we knowe this, wee haue not learned the very principles of Religion. But let vs, that are brought vp in his Church, bee content to bee fed with this food of Angels.
                     
                     The event is; That he should be made small: the fulfilling whereof, is mentioned by Malachy. I haue made Ch 1. 3. & 4. his mountaines wast, and his heritage a wildernes for dragons. For, though after Malachy, Idumeans dwelt there, yet since is that of the same Prophet fufilled: They shall build, but I will destroy. Now when wee see things so lōg before told of, in their due time fulfilled, this must be a ground, & stand for our weake faith concerning things to come, as the last and eternall iudgement: that, as we haue seene the particular iudgemēts fulfilled on Edom, Ierusalem, &c. wee assure our selues, that what hath passed from the mouth of the Lord, 
                        Numb. 23. 19 shall most certainely come to passe Gen. 41. 32.
                     
                     Now as the Apostle writeth, the things which were written before, were written for our learning, &c. For as Rom. 15 4. he saith in another place, the examples of the punishment of the Israelites, are for our vse, on whom the ends 
                        1. Cor. 10. 11. 6. 8.

                        of them. Even so these things wil serue vs for example: Rom 9 6. 10. for those are Israelites, that are of the faith of Israel, & the Edomites are all the enimies of the Church. Wherefore let vs assure our selues, that as certainely as GOD threatned destruction to Edom, so surely will he powre it on all our enimies. The Papists are the Idumeans, elder brethren. as they say; though they disdaine to be called our brethren, yet are they our brethren, as Edom was the Israelites. And they haue dealt with vs, even as the Idumeans dealt with the Israelites. When that Obad 10. we would haue entred into the land of promise, they haue withstood vs with all their might, and hauing, as they say, the keyes of knowledge would neither enter them. selues, nor suffer others that would. Againe, when the Luk. 11, 52. Church was afflicted by the king of Babylō, they were at hand to set the worke forward, and to cry, rase it, rase it, even to the foundations. Now let vs remember the Ps. 137 7. words of the Apostle, that God can recompense, to those 2. Th

But they also must be destroyed: or rather the errors must be destroyed, that they may bee raised, their heresies put to flight, that they may be recalled, and, as the Lord hath

promised to consume Antichrist, so shall these heresies

                     Concerning the witnesses, they are the Prophets, who received it from the Lord. Wherefore he saith, we haue heard, not naming himselfe alone, but others. With this we are to compare a place of Ieremy speaking Chap 49 14. of the same matter, saying, I haue heard. This Ieremy spake before the destruction of Ierusalem, OBADIAH after, both agreeing not only in the same matter, but even in the very words. Which consent confirming the message, is well worthy the noting. I neede not here to stand on that point to shew vnto you the consent of the Prophets, and Apostles togither, vsing the very same words; as of Amos and Iocl, Micha and Isaiah,

The Prophet speaking of our battell, which we are to fight vnder Ps 110 3. our captaine, saith, thy people shal be ready and willing in the day of battell, al the servants of God, shalbe in a readines, most willingly to sight the Lords battels. But alas! where is this readines? where is this willingnesse, which we are to shew, having to fight dayly against (not outward) but inward enemies? who hath put on that complete harnesse, which the Apostle ministreth vnto Eph. 6 11. 12 him, therewith to strine against spirituall wickednes even in high places?
                     
                     The ambassadours, who are to raise the souldiers to battell are the servants and ministers of the Lord. Now 2 Cor 5. 20. Rom. 10. 15.

Here, let them who are called to this function, remember to do his message, and to raise vp his people against his and their enimies.

These ambassadours were sent to the heathē, some to this nation & congregation, some to that, having particular people allotted, on whom they should call: others there were sent in generall, to every nation, as Mat. 28. 19. were the Apostles: and they, as they most faithfully in their owne persons exercised this function, so haue they exhorted vs to execute the same charge, committed to vs, with the same diligence; and hereto belongeth that exhortation of Peter vnto the Elders for the feeding and instructing of Gods slocke.

Yee see what I would say, or rather, what I would not say. Are there not many that haue beene sent to Niniveh, but would go to Tarsus? The ship of our common wealth hath beene troubled and tossed with rebellions and conspiracies: I may say truely, that a great cause there of hath beene, for that Ionah sent to Niniveh, would needs go to Tarsus. But would to God there had been in them that zeale of Ionah, to haue beene touched in conscience with the remorse of their sinne, and confessed the same, and haue desired to haue beene cast in

Hos. 4 6. the bottome of the sea never to rise vp againe, rather then that one of those little ones, of whom thousands are perished through them, should haue miscaried. Wherefore I beseech you in the name of Christ, & by that duty and loue, which you owe him, if there be any care in you, any feare of his name, that you woulde go to Niniveh whither you are sent; and though Tarsus be a famous Vniversity, yet seeing GOD hath sent you thither, that you would arise and go to Niniveh.

                     In the book of Genesis we read, that Abraham hard, that his brother was taken by his enimies: wherevpon

he brought forth of them, that were borne, and brought 
                        Gen. 14. 12. 13 14. 
                        vp in his house, 318 and pursued them, and that he and his servants divided themselues by night and smote them, & brought againe his brother Lot. Our brother Lot, nay many of our brethren are taken and caried away, but they are not yet so far gone, but that, if we make hast, they may be recovered. And if ever it behoved Abraham to arme his houshold, it is now time. Yee that are in the place of Abrahā, arme thē, that are brought vp in your houses, to the bringing backe of our brethren. Arme them and your selues with that spirit of Abraham, with that brotherly loue and care over others. I cānot say to every one of you as is said to him in the Poet,

                        THE Prophet, having shewed in the former verses, that GOD would bring to passe the destruction of Edom, by nations stirred vp against them, sending messengers from one to another, to rise vp against her in battel; doth in this place refute a reason, with the which they were prepared to come against this Judgement of GOD. For whereas the land of Edom was mount Seir, a countrey full of Rockes, their cities were strong, situated on hils, or amongst hils, seated vpon rocks & by nature mightily fortified, for which cause they imagined, that it was impossible to conquer them; this conceipt of theirs the Prophet doth

here open and reproue, saying, the pride of thy hart &c. Wherefore in few wordes hee saith thus much, GOD will destroy thee, notwit
                           •…
                        standing thy great strength; which hee hath confirmed by the infallible worde of GOD. Hererevnto they opposed the fond and vaine imagination of man: for they said, who shall bring me downe to the ground? Because I dwell in the Clefts of the rocks, and am strong on the high mountaines. This cō
                        ceipt is said to proceed from pride of heart; thereby being advertised, that notwithstanding their vaine conceipt of defensed places, as though by reason of them it were impossible they should bee subdued, yet they should find it false, as issuing not from the truth, but from the pride of heart. The truth also hereof, that GOD would assuredly bring them downe, is amplified by comparing their defences to the neast of an Eagle, 
                        Aristot. histor. animal. lib. 9. cap. 32. which is wont to be builded aloft in the top of high & craggie mountains, as Aristotle also writeth. And whē hee saith, that though their neast were made among the starres, by the hyperbole he signifieth, that nothing should hinder, but he will subdue them; The Lord telling Edom, that, though hee make his neast never so high, yet he will fetch him downe, and therefore will also destroy him, though he dwell in the Cleftes of the Rockes.

These things then are written for our learning, & comfort, that wee should bee neither puft vp with a vaine opinion of any gifts in vs whatsoever: neither yet discouraged with any feare, though the Idumeans dwell in the Cleftes of the rockes, and say in the pride of their heart, who shall bring vs downe to the ground? For though they exalt themselues, as the Eagle, and make their neast among the starres, yet thence will the Lord bring them downe. Pride goeth before destruction, and a high mind before a fal. Wel may the wicked for a while Prov. 16. 18. flourish as a greene bay tree, and draw forth their sword against the godly, but their sword shall enter into their owne bowels, and they shall be rased out, that men shall Ps. 37. 35 35. say, where is he? or with the Prophet, This is Pharaoh.

So sure thought they them selues, that, though there were none to defend it but blind and lame, yet were they safe enough: yet behold GOD brought them downe, and that which before was the strongest against David, became the strongest for him.

Now for that they hold, that it cannot faile in doctrine, they conclude, that the estate of the popedome must endure for ever, according to the words of that prophecie. I stand not to shew howe true the former parte is, that Rome should destroy the other kingdomes: but on that, that he saith it shalbee eternall.

                     But the maintainers of them say, that this cannot

be by reason of the flourishing estate of the Papacie in Rome, which hath so mighty friends, and hath beene of so long continuance. But let them remember (that Nineveh had beene a people of many generations) that the Edomites were of greater standing. For it is scarse 500. yeares passed, since the vsurped authority over kings and princes, and the whole church, began, but not 800. since the Bishop of Rome set himselfe against the Emperour, not 1000. since hee first claimed authoritie over the Bishops of Constantinople: which is a lesse time then Edom flourished; for we read, that there raigned 8. kings in Edom, before there was a king over the children of Israel, that is, before the governement of Moses. 
                        Gen. 36. 31. 32 &c. So then they flourished til the daies of this Prophet even no lesse then 1200. yeares, neither were they thē straight extinguished, for they lived to see the ruine of the second temple, as we finde in Iosephus.

But I come farre below in this comparison, for there is some proportion, betweene an houres worke, and the greatest summe of mony, for they be finite; but betweene the everlasting, endlesse, and infinite ioy of heaven, and mans workes, that is betweene finite, & infinite, there is no proportion. But how could it be, that any men should thus speake, if the spirit of Antichrist, had not thus puft them vp, to vtter such blasphemte in the pride of their hearts? But what shall I say? when the same men in their notes on the 8. Rom. grant, that if we looke to the time, the ioy of heaven is a great deale more, & here forsooth flee they to the grace of GOD: but, they must consider, that grace serveth them not, that they may claime it by desert: for whatsoever good the servants of GOD do, it is by grace;

                        selues, but the abundance thereof is sufficient for other men also. But is not this to build vp to Babel, & is Gen. 11 4. not this pride, like that of Pharaoh, who hoped by his owne strength to passe over there, where others had Exod. 14. 23. passed over by grace and favour? Is it not with Iezebel 
                        2. King. 9 30. to set a colour and paint on our foule faces? But the builders of Babel were confounded, Pharaoh drowned, & Iezebel after shee had painted her face was cast downe from the windowe, and had her braines dashed out. These men, that thinke it a beggarly thing to receaue the kingdome of heauen of almes, shall never haue it of debt, for those that say in the pride of their heart, &c.
                     
                     Lastly, here we haue to marke, that the Lord is said to be the author of this vengeance, and yet it was said before, that this should be brought to passe by nations stirred vp against Edom, and sending messengers from one to another, to provoke them to battell against the Idumeans: whereas in the 2 and 3 verses he saith, I will. where we are taught, that although it pleased GOD to vse men, as instruments, to bring his purposes to effect, yet would he haue all the glory to bee proper, and peculiar to himselfe. For though the instrument worke, yet, sith the whole efficacie commeth from him, therefore the whole glory ought to be giuen to him, and not to the instrument.
                     
                     In the 63 of Isaiah, the Prophet demandeth, who it is that commeth from Edom, and why his garments bee Esai 63. 1. 
                        redde? Whereby, answering to the question, hee sheweth

that it is Christ: and that his garments are red: because he alone had t

                        tioned V. 3. in this Prophet, or other meanes, as seemeth best to him; but for that the force and efficacie alone proceedeth from him. So that for this cause, he is said alone to worke. For Paul indeed planteth, and Apollo watereth, but neither he that planteth is any thing, neither

This rod is the publishing of the word, which the Prophet saith he will send out the rod of his power, that he may rule even among his enimies. The Priests must Psal. 110. 2. carie the arke. In the arke were the tables of the law: & 1 Kings 8 9. Heb 9 4. in the month of the Ministers ought the law of the Lord to be. The Priests feete were dipped in the waters of Iordan: the Ministers feete must enter first the vvater, and beautifull are the feete of them, that bring good tidings. The Priests blew with the Trumpets; the Minister must set the Trumpet to his mouth, and sound out a lowd both the law and the gospell; the law to bring downe the high wals, and the gospell to raise and builde vp.

                           e should they be brought downe, saith the Lord. Now, in these that follow to bee handled presently, the greatnes and grievousnesse of their destruction is opened: to wit, that they shall be spoiled and wasted, evē vnto the vttermost, insomuch that their things shalbee sought out, yea their hidden things and secret places shalbe searched. And this is amplified by 2. dissimilitudes: the one of theeues, the other of grape gatherers. Theeues, who rob by night, doe steale for neede commonly, and so they take no more then may suffice their neede: neither stay they lightly to search all things and places, for feare least they be taken. Grapegatherers among the Iewes, were accustomed to leaue some grapes behind them, according to the law: Thou shalt not gather the grapes of thy vineyard 
                        Lev. 19. 10. 
                        cleane, nor the grapes that fall downe; thou shalt leaue them for the poore and for the stranger. But the warriers sent by God against Edom, shall not deale with him as theeues, or as grapegatherers. They shall not be contented with that which is enough, as robbers by night are. They shall not leaue somewhat of his things behind them, as men doe grapes in the vineyard. They shall seaze on al, on more then enough; they shall seeke out the things of Esau, that is, Edom, they shall seeke thē 
                        out, and by seeking finding them; yea they shall search and Gen. 25. 30. rifle the corners, the dennes, the secret places, wherein the Idumaeans would hide themselues and theirs. By which meanes there should be such hauocke made of them, that the Prophet vttereth it with admiration,

and, as if he saw it done; saying first to Edom, How art thou destroyed! And then of him and his, How are the things of Esau sought out, his secret things are searched! Thus is foreshewed, that the desolation of Edom, or Esau, that is, of Esau's ofspring, the people of the Idumaeans, shall be great and grievous, as being wrought by warriours, who shall spare nought, either of feare, as theeues doe; or of compassion, as grapegatherers. If theeues had come vnto thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou destroyed?) would they not haue stollen that, which were enough for them? If grapegatherers had come vnto thee, would they not haue left some grapes? How are the things of Esau sought out, his secret things are searched?
                     
                     
                        Saint Peter advertising the Iewes and the Proselytes, that they should receaue the gift of the holy Ghost, if they Act. 2. 38. 
                        repented, and turned to Christ: for to you (saith he) is the promise made, and to your children, & to all them that shal be long hereafter, even to as many as the Lord our God shal call: the same in like sort may I say vnto you (fathers & brethren) touching this promise of bringing your enimies to vtter ruine and destruction. For, God said to Gen. 12. 3. 
                        Abraham, I will blesse them, that blesse thee, and I wil curse them, that curse thee: meaning, that hee would make a perfect league with him, and bee at peace with his friends, at warre with his enimies. But the league and covenant, which God made with Abraham, hee made with Abraham and his seed. And the seed of Abraham 
                        Gen. 17. 7. Gal. 3. 7. are all faithfull Christians. To vs all therefore is the promise made, that God will blesse our friends, and will curse our enimies. Moreover, his particular curse and

plague ensuing it, vpon the Idumeans, is a patterne of that, which shall fall on such as tread in their steps. For the punishment of the Iewes, who lusted after evill 
                        1. Cor. 10. 6. 
                        things, is threatned to the Gentiles, if they lust as the Iewes did: and if yee be partakers of the sinnes of Babylon, 
                        Rev. 18 4. yee shall receaue of her plagues. Now, among the eni mies of the faithfull Christians, others doe more resemble the Philistines, or Ammonites, or Moabites, or Amalekites, or Cananites, or Assyrians: there are none liker to the Idumeans, then are the Papists, as it hath beene shewed. The Idameans borne according to the flesh of the seed of Abraham: the Papists by ofspring come of Christian parents. The Idumeans circumcised as children of the covenant: the Papists baptised in the same that we be. The Idumeans serued not the God of their fathers according to the law: neither doe the Pa pists in spirit and truth after the Gospell. The Idumeans persecuted the Israelites to death, and vexed thē with all crueltie: the Papists haue butchered the godly with massacres, and made themselues drunken with the blood of Saints. Wherefore the spirit of the Lord assureth vs, that the Papists shall bee consumed in his wrath, when it shall burne suddenly: and as they haue followed the facts of the Idumeans, so they shall feele their punishments. I speake not herein of all, that are Papists: as neither did the Prophet of all Idumeans. For the remnant of Edom shall inherit with Israel, & Papists with vs: as many as shall seeke him, whose name is called

In whom shal be fulfilled the Apostles prophecie touching the man of sinne: the Lord shall consume them with the breath of his mouth. And so, that 2. Thess 2. 8. which is written of Edom by the Prophet, may be said by vs to the Romish Antichrist: If theeues had come vnto thee, if robbers by night (how art thou destroyed?) would they not haue stollen that which were enough for them? If Grapegatherers had come vnto thee, would they not haue left some grapes? How are the things of Antichrist sought out, his secret things are searched?
                     
                     Howbeit, as S. Paul, though he were assured, that al who sailed with him, should escape aliue, yet said, that Act. 27 24. V. 31. they could not escape, except the marriners abode in the ship: so, though it bee certaine that Antichrist and his members shall be consumed, yet cannot that bee, except they be set vpō by warriers For God doth worke by meanes ordinarily. And this is the meanes, that he hath ordained for the atchieuing of that conquest, as we saw before in the Ambassadours message, Arise, and let vs rise vp against her to battel. The warriours, whose Obad. 1. service the Lord doth vse thereto, are all his servants in a sort; his people most willing in the day of his armie: but specially Preachers and Ministers of his word. For his Psal. 110. 3. word is the rod of his mouth, the breath, the sword, whereby he doth destroy his enimies: & Ministers are souldiers, Esa. 11 4. 2 Thess 2 8. Rev 19. 15. Ag

with the affairs of this life, that he may please him, who hath chosen him to be a souldier. And God saith of thē by the Prophet Esay: I haue set watchmen vpon thy walls, O Ierusalem,

                        which all the day, & all the night continually shall not cease. The watchmen and warriours therefore of the Lord, the keepers of his Church, the conquerours of his enimies, the spoylers of the Idumaeans, the consumers of Antichrist, & Antichristian impes, are Ministers of his word, Pastors, & Teachers, who to please him, by whom they are chosen souldiers, should not be entangled with the affaires of this life; to discharge their dutie, should bee sent forth and kept on publike cost; to preserue their flocke, should watch day and night continually over it.

Nor only must they haue it, but haue it too in due season, as often as they need it: which is so often, that the holy Ghost (to shew the continuall necessitie thereof) doth will it to be given them in season & out of season.

At least, to remember the miserable end of Richard the Vsurper: who being made Protector of the King and Realme, got the realme himselfe, and robbed the King of it. That, if they deeme their patronage to be meerly civill, and the goods of Benefices to be as common mens, not sacred to the Lord: yet being made Protectors thereof, and of the Pastors, they follow not his fault, whose ende they detest. Though, the very truth is, (which I wish they weigh too,) that the Churches goods, allotted to the maintenance of Pastors & Teachers, are not profane but sacred: and therefore the sin

of them, who purloine them, is sacrilege, not theft: wherein God is spoiled, as himselfe pronounceth, Will a man spoile God, that yee do spoile me? And yee say, wherein

Wherefore let vs (beloved) of the Vniversity, get our country this blessing, as much as lyeth in vs, by providing, that Pastors, where we haue appropriations, may bee mainetained with their tithes, that there may be meate in the house of God. I meane not hereby, that wee shoulde giue away that by which our schooles and schollers be maintained.

and them who bring them vp; the children of the Prophets, and the Prophets themselues. That, if there bee enough in our Appropriations for the Pastors maintenance, beside that which wee haue for the nurserie of Pastors, as commonly there is: wee may with good conscience receiue our owne revenue.

                        Thy confederates haue driven thee. The Iudgement of the Lord executed by his law, vpon enticers to Idolatry, disobedient to magistrates, vnthankefull children, &c: is in sundry places of Deutronomy, knit vp with this sentēce, Deut 4. 10. & 13. 11. & 17. 13 
                        So shall all Israel heare and feare. Whereby is declared the end of punishments appointed by GOD, and executed in iustice vpon offenders, namely that the rest might heare, and feare, and learne not to offende in like māner, lest they incurre the like vengeance. The point then that we haue to learne is, to vnderstand by the ex ample of the Iustice of GOD executed vpon the Idumeans, that all their confederates should driue them to the borders, &c: that if any haue such hatred against the servants of GOD, as Edom had against Israel, then that this Iudgement is denounced against them. For the Lord hath determined, that who oppresseth his friends, must be deceived and plagued by their friends, and such as they reposed greatest confidence in. The Madianites, as it is in the history of the Iudges oppressed Israel very sore, so that for feare of them, the Israelites 
                        Chap 6. made them dens in the moūtains & caues: when Israel had sowen, they came vp and destroied the fruit of the earth, and left no food for Israel. Against thē the Lorde sent Gedeon; and to overthrow them he vsed not the hands of the Israelites: but after that Gedeon & the cō pany, that were with them had blowne their trumpets and broken their pitchers the Lord set every mans sword against his neighbour. Senacherib the king of Ashur came Chap 7. 2 King. 19. against Ierusalem and Ezechiah the king thereof with a mighty army, thinking to make thrall to him all the

people, and Rabsakeh with most arrogant & presumptuous words, defied the Lord, who (he said) could not deliver them. But the Lord first confounded his armie and by an Angel destroyed them, so that he was faine, with shame to flee home, where hee armed his two sonnes, Adramelech and Shareser against him, who, whē hee worshipped his God in the temple, slew him with the sword.
                     But the cruelty of Nero against the Christians farre exceeded that of the Madianites, and Senacherib: in so much that he sowed them in the Sulp. Severus

With whom there were so many thousandes murthered, by such as professed themselues their friendes. Whereby wee may perceiue, that this is no certaine signe of Idumeans, but that it is apparant, that even in the Church of God, there is falsehood in fellowship, & in trust treason.
                     The difference therefore in this point betwixt the wicked, and the godly, is 1 in the cause, 2 in the comfort.
                     
                     1 In respect of the cause; the wicked & vngodly are worthily so served, making their confederacie in world ly respects: but the godly vnworthily; so that David iustly protesteth, If this wickednesse bee in my hand, &c. yea, if I haue not deliuered him, that without any cause was mine enemie, &c.
                     
                     2 In respect of comfort; for that the wicked, when they be so intreated of their friends, haue no manner of succour, or ease, which they can betake themselues vnto: whereas the godly in this case fly to the Lord, whom they finde to bee a sure rocke, and certaine defence, when the helpe of man fayleth, and is set against them, as David being persecuted by Absolō, cryeth out how are my adversaries encreased? how many rise vp a 
                        Psal. 3. 
                        gainst me but thou Lord art a buckler for me, my glory, and the lifter vp of my head. Wherefore trusting in the

assured confidence, & invinciblenes of the Almightie, he feareth not, though ten thousand had set thēselues against him. This therefore bringeth a terrour to the wicked, when they be forsaken of their friends, & haue nothing to trust in, but their wickednesse: but a notable comfort is it to the godly, when continuing in their goodnesse, they haue the Lord alwaies to bee at their side. So the wicked dare look for no helpe of the Lord, but the godly are full of the consolation of the holy spirit. So that the wicked may say, if our friends be against vs, who shall be with vs? but the godly may say, Rom. 8. 31.

                            shall be against vs?
                     
                     Which consideration of the state of the godly, that such as professe themselues their friends, haue set thē
                        selues against them, may teach vs, how to answer that obiection of the Papists, who because many haue revoulted from vs to them, yea of our Ministers, would perswade the ignorant that our doctrine is naught. A worthy matter, no doubt! if some for 30 peeces of silver to be paid in their Seminaries, haue gone thither that they may betray Christ Iesus. And what say they herein against vs, which the Iewes might not haue said against our Saviour, that one of his Disciples, yea of his chiefe Disciples was set so against him, that he had betrayed him. Another reason they haue like vnto this, though not in all circumstances, yet in the maine ground; which iss the dissention amongst vs, and such as are of other Churches beyond the sea, concerning certaine ceremonies, wherein we differ from them. But seeing that the Lord knowes how to turne it to the

profiting of his Church, and when it pleaseth him, can reveale these things to vs: why should any make an argument hereof, against the truth of our doctrine? seeing we find, that God hath turned the like to his greater glory, as that dissention of Paul and Barnabas, & Paule and Peter.

I beseech GOD, that these men also reading this prophecy, that the friends of the Idumeans shal destroy them, may bee encouraged to doe it; that this may prevaile so much with them, as that did with Cyrus. For though they be your confederates, friends, brethren, parents, children, yet must you not bee affraid to wound them spiritually, for the wounds of a friend are sweet. We must destroy not their persons but their errors, and to be cruell herein is piety. And such cruelty as this is commanded by GOD; Cursed be he, that withholdeth his hand from this bloud. 
                        Ier. 48. 10.
                     
                     When Aaron had entised the Israelites to Idolatrie, and provoked them to the offending of GOD, by worshipping the golden calfe: Moses proclaimeth, who so pertaineth to the Lord, let him come to me, and all the 
                        Exod. 32. 26. 
                        sonnes of Levi gathered themselues—So they went from gate to gate through the host & slew every man his brother, every man his companion, and every man his neigh bour: and so they consecrated their hands vnto the Lord and drew a blessing vpon them. But alas! how farre are we from doing this same in the warfare of Christ, against our friends, kinsfolkes, and neighbours! Would to GOD many of vs were not caried away with that foolish pitie of Achab. When Benhadad had come vp 1 King 20 31, 32. &c. to fight against Israel, but was discomfited, & was faine to flee into a secret chamber to saue his life: It was told him, that the kings of Israel were mercifull kings. Wherfore he sent to him certaine men, who said, thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee let me liue. To whom Achab said, is he yet aliue? he is my brother. Yea, said they

thy brother Benhadad, &c: and so was hee content to make a covenant with him, and Achab confederated himselfe with Benhadad. But there was sent a man of God to Achab, who told him, for as much as he had let a man scape out of his hands, whom the Lord woulde haue slaine, his life, should be for his, & his people for his. There bee this day too many Achabs, who can aske, whether their brother Benhadad be aliue, and willinglie spare him, hoping, that he will one day remember them with the like curtesie; so long as he is aliue hee is their brother Benhadad, yea their brother Benhadad: but because they let them scape, whom the Lorde woulde haue to be slaine, their life shalbe in steed of theirs, and their people insteede of theirs. Yet O Lord spare thy people, and powre out thy wrath on them, that know thee not, and on such as haue not called vpō thy name: yea O Lord powre thy wrath vpon. Benhadad and let him not escape thine hand, &c.

Shall not I, &c: and vnderstanding frō the mount of Esau, that is mount Seir, on which Esau dwelt; and by Seir is meant the land of Idumeans, the part for the whole. Out of this land, saith he, he would destroy the wisemen and vnderstanding, and bring to nought the strength and power, and that partly by taking from them wisdome and vnderstanding, as Ieremy

Which thing is also vttered by Interrogation, to make it more effectuall by sinking deepe into their minds. And so first hauing removed their wisemen, their strongmen follow after, of whom he saith, & thy strong men: & to assure them of it, with piercing their hearts by conceiuing it, as though it were laid before their eies, he turneth his speech to them, when he saith thy strong men, O Teman, which was a part of that coū trey, inhabited by a nation which came of a Nephew of Esau of that name.

                     Great was the wickednesse of the old world, when as the sonnes of God seeing the daughters of men; that they

                        were faire, and following their lust, not their dutie, tooke them wiues of all that they liked. GOD was displeased with their sinnes, and gaue them a long time of repē
                        tance, even an hundred and twentie yeares. At which time they not repenting, he brought the flood of waters over them. When the Lord had promised to Abraham the land of Canaan, hee told him, that first his seed should be a soiourner in a land that was not theirs even 400. yeares, for that the sinne of the Amorites 
                        Gen. 15. 16. was not as then full, shewing plainely, that he had given them a daie of repentance, which being come, if they brought not forth worthie fruite thereof, they should be mowed downe. The wickednesse of Achab receiued such iudgement as it deserued, yet even for that shadow of repentance, the plague was cast of to his posteritie. In the daies of Iosiah, Israel was not plagued

are of like manner against the Tyrians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Moabites, &c. appointing to some certaine expresse yeares, as three, other lxx. some short, but not mentioned: a short time, but a time also is threatned by Iohn Baptist, when he said, Even now is the axe laid to the root of the tree.

                     That which we are to regard more specially is, that the times of iudgement appointed for the Amorites, Achab, Iewes, &c. are not only to be respected for thē
                        selues, but to bee considered as figures of that great iudgemēt, for which there is a time appointed, which is called a daie in Scripture for an excellencie: as the Apostle preached to the Athenians, that GOD had appointed a daie in which he will iudge the world in righteousnes by that man, which he hath appointed. And though Act. 17. 31. he seeme slack in comming, yet is he not, for he saith, till the number be accomplished. The Lord will come as a theefe in the night, and he shall sit on his throne of Maiestie, before whom the earth and heavens shall fly away, the earth and sea shall yeeld vp their dead, the bookes shall bee opened, and each man shall receaue his iudgement. Which point St Peter having handled exhorteth vs to consider 2. Epist. 3. 11. 
                        what manner of persons we should then bee, in holy conversation, and godlinesse, who should looke for, and hasten vnto the comming of this day of God. On which occasion I am also to desire you, that you would diligently consider, if God haue appointed a daie for temporall and eternall punishments, how patient each one of vs ought to be in all afflictions, how wise in all behaviour. Patient, that wee fre

                         that we stand in the feare of GOD, and offend not as wicked persons, for whom another day is appointed, the last and worst of all other. Wherefore we haue need of patience, &c: as we are exhorted therevnto by the Apostles: 
                        Heb 1 
                              〈◊〉
                           
                         that we be not discomforted, though we see the wicked prosper, & liue in all iollity, lest otherwise we fal into the sinne of murmuring, as did the Israelites, being ready to fall away from the profession of GOD, because the rod had rest vpon them for a while. And having seene so great workes wrought by Gods hand in Egypt, yet at the red sea they feared, least they shoulde haue beene swallowed vp of Pharaoh. But Moses biddeth them be still, and see the salvation of the Lord; for Ex. 14. 13. 14. that he knew there was a day appointed, when Pharaoh should be discomfited: which thing is not onely of the Israelites concerning Pharaoh king of Egypt, but also to the comfort of all true Israelites, and to the revenge of all, that are like Pharaoh. For though they shoot out their branches for a while, and flourish, as a green bay tree, yet so so one as you shal passe by thē, they shalbe so gone, that their place shall know them no more. What greater affliction abode the Iewes, then vnder Antiochus, yet frō the time, that the abhomination was set vp, as Daniel sheweth, it was lesse then 4 years. The Saints of God indeed are troubled with impatiēcy, and would gladly see their desire vpō the wicked that Gods name might be the more glorified in the salvation of

his Saints. which is set downe in the Revelation, where the soules vnder the Altar do cry, how long Lord, holie and true—but white long robes were given vnto them, & it was said, that they should rest for a little season, &c: let vs not thē discourage our selues with impatiēcie, let Rev. 6. 10. 11. vs not fret our selues, lest wee bee moved to evill, for the Saints confesse that God was holy & true, true in his promise, who will no doubt take revenge of his enimies, holy in grāting repētāce to sinners. Let vs cal to minde the end that fell vpon Pharaoh, Antiochus, &c. & other miscreants, and let vs wait the Lords leasure, remembring, that to the Saints were given white robes the signe of grace in this life, and of glory in the life to come.
                     Moreover, as wee hereby doe learne patience, that we sret not at the prosperitie of the wicked; so are we also to be wise, that wee offend not after the manner of the vngodly, through hope of escaping the iudgement 
                        Rom. 22. of GOD, hauing before our eies the daie, which the Prophet here speaketh of, and much more, that whereof this is a signe and figure, remēbring, that the slower our punishment is in comming, the heavier will it be when it commeth. When Amnon had defiled himselfe, & his Sister Thamar following his filthy lust, he streight was so displeased with her, that he could 2. Sam. 13. 14. 15. not so much as abide her sight, which is the first plague that GOD layeth on such lust. There followed after another, when hee was put to the sword: but the third most heavie, and grievous was behind, which was to 29. be cast with whoremongers into the lake that burneth.

                     Now these things are written to let vs knowe, that not only such as offend in lust, as Amnon, in disobedi ence, as Absolon, in coveteousnesse, as the richman, in impietie, as Iulian, shall bee punished even as they were: but that it is vndoubtedly true, which Solomon saith, that GOD wil bring into iudgement, every work with every secret thing, be it good or evil.

Which though I haue sufficiently declared by examples of the Scriptures, yet as the Apostle vsed the sentence of the Poet

Menander, after other sound proofes, so for the youth, that would heare what a Poet saith, I will alleage the saying of the prince of Poets. When Turnus had taken the spoile of Pallas he receaued this threatning;

which how truely it fell out, is in another place declared, when being striken to the heart hee heard these words,

                           —Pallas te hoc vulnere, Pallas Aeneid. lib. 12. in sine.
                           
                           Immolat, & poenam scelerato ex sanguine sumit.
                        
                     
                     We are to deale with Pallas, (not Pallas Pallantis, but Pallas Pallados) that is, with the wisdome of the high est, we our selues are his, both body and soule, he hath redeemed vs, and made vs his owne. If then wee make our selues thrall to sinne, and wickednesse, we spoile & rob him, and then let vs assure our selues, the time will come, when we shall wish, that we had forgone these spoiles: when it shall be said, goe yee cursed into hell fire.
                     
                     Let vs learne then to remember that daie, and out of this place, that God hath appointed a time, wherein he will avenge himselfe of his enimies; and not onely that, but which is another point, the meanes by which it shall be wrought, which is, by taking away their wise men, & bereaving them of strong men, that being thus bereaved of such as might stand them insteed, they may receaue the vengeance prepared for them. How GOD doth deale with nations in these matters, the histories shew, and the Prophet Isaiah plainely, when hee

saith, he will take away the wise-eloquent-artificer. Meaning, Is. 3. 1, 2, 3 that howsoever they perswaded themselues, that by those meanes and enimies they could not be destroi ed, being furnished in such manner against all manner assaults, yet GOD would doe it by taking awaie whatsoever might any way stand them insteed. It was not to be thought, that Babylon hauing in it such strength and wisdome could bee so taken, as it was by Cyrus: but we read, that at such time they gaue themselues to drunkennesse and ryot. Wherefore let vs not put our confidence in flesh and blood, perswading our selues, that because our nation is mightie in strength of people, our prince wise, our coūsellers provident, our munition great, victuals sufficient, &c. that therefore we are sure, and out of all danger; for GOD can take away our wise and strong men, and though hee leaue vs the men, yet he can take all wisdome and strength frō them, & whatsoever we bring home seeme it never so great, yet can the Lord blowe vpon it, as the Prophet speaketh, and it shall fall away. 
                        Hagg. 1. 9.
                     
                     Here then is good comfort for vs, if we serue & loue the Lord: for from whome will the Lord take vnderstanding, not from David, but from Absolon, not from Israelites, but from Edomites, not from Ezechiah, but Senacherib: or if he take vnderstanding from Israel, David, Ezekiah, yet not from David, to destroy him, not from Ezechiah, when he calls vpon him, and if he fayled the Iewes, yet the true Israelites shall be strengthned from aboue: though David be troubled, yet shall hee not want his wise Cushai, and strong Ioab: and although 2. Sam. 17. 8. 9.
                        
the counsell of men faile, and strength bee nothing, the Isa. 37. 36. 
                        Lord will send an Angel to slay the Assyrians: but as for Edom let his strength be never so great, his wisemen never so many, they shall bee quite destroyed. Though Absolon haue with him Achitophel, yet GOD can make his counsell foolish; though Senacherib his armies bee strong, yet may hee loose them all, and himselfe also bee murthered by his sonnes in the temple of his Gods. And as the Scripture teacheth vs this of Absolon, Senacherib, Idumeans, so must we thinke it to be verified against al that deale as they did. Wherein not to call you to cō

                        OVR Saviour to kindle the minds of his Disciples with a desire to goe on towards heaven and not to looke backe to the intisemēts of the world, willeth them to remember Lots wife. Whereby hee teacheth vs, that in the stories of Luk. 17. 32. the Scriptures, we are not only to note the event, as namely that shee was turned into a pillar of salt, but the causes also, as for that shee being delivered from Sodome, yet contrary to GODS commā
                           dement, looked backe againe to it. The which thing the Prophet setteth here before vs in the destruction of the Idumeans: for having hitherto declared the event, which should fall on them, namely that they should

be brought downe and destroyed by such meanes, as GOD had appointed, notwithstanding all their wisdome, and strength: hee in this place sheweth the cause hereof, which was their crueltie against their brethren. For thy 
                        Gen. 25 25. 30 
                        crueltie against thy brother]—The nations of the Iewes and Idumeans came by descent from Abraham & Isaac for which cause they are called brethren, & as the proper name of Edom, is vsed to signifie his ofspring, so are the Iewes noted by the name of Iacob brother of Edom: wherefore denouncing here vtter destruction to the Idumeans, for their hard dealing towardes the Iewes, he saith, for thy crueltie against thy brother.
                     
                     The crueltie shewed was, that when strangers and aliens even the Chaldeans tooke Ierusalem and spoiled it, dividing the prey by lot, after the manner of souldiers, and carying away their substance, they stood on the other side, not only not helping thē in this their great necessitie, but even furthering, what they could, their destruction. For when Nebuchadnezzar (as it is recorded in the 2 of the Chronicles, the last chap.) caried away 2. Chr. 36. 17. 18. 19. the treasure of Ierusalem, burnt the temple, pulled downe the wals, made havocke of the people: the Idumeans stood by crying, rase it even to the foundations. 
                        Psal. 137. 7. Neither only exhorted they the Chaldeans to this crueltie, but put their hands also therevnto, and did even as they, which appeareth in the 12, 13, and 14 verses, by the rehearsall of the particulars. But at this time it shall be enough to obserue in generall the crueltie of the Idumeans against the Iewes in these two verses, for thy crueltie against thy brother Iacob.

Whereby we are taught to withhold both our hands and hearts from all kind of cruelty, whether it be wrought by force or fraud, neither to haue any by deedes, nor by affection, and that we are not to suffer any to be harmed, whom wee may rescue and deliver. Which is a lesson for vs to be learned and practised towards all men.

And so we see the Samaritane finding the wounded per Luk. 10. 30. 33 son (though likely a Iew, who were because of their religion so great enimies, that they would neither eate nor talke, nor haue any familiarity one with another) yet moved with natural affectiō, when he saw him he had compassion on him, and went to him, bound vp his wounds, powred in oile and wine, put him on his own beast, brought him to an Inne and made provision for him. Which duty, that it bindeth all by the generall law, which is, loue thy neighbour as thy selfe, our Saviour sheweth, when herevpon he willeth the Scribe to whom he telleth this hi

                        story to go his waies and doe likewise. Wherefore seeing by the law of nature, and reason, and the bond of humanity, we are to loue all men, it is manifest, that then we are to abhorre, and refraine from all iniuries whatsoever.
                     But if neither the law of GOD, reason nor nature can moue vs herevnto, let vs consider the punishmēt which is threatned, and hath light on them that haue not fulfilled this law. For albeit the punishment, which is here laid downe, is not threatned to each sort of mē that shew cruelty to another whatsoever, yet in the holy Scriptures there are some plagues denounced against every one whatsoever. The cruelty of the olde world was chiefly shewed vpon the brood of Cain, yet Gen. 6. 13. the Lord said to Noah, that the earth was filled with cru elty, wherfore he would destroy it. The Sichemites were aliens to Israel, yea they vnlawfully possessed that, which belonged to Iacob and his sonnes: yet because Simeon and Levi murthered them in so cruell manner,

So greatly doth the Lord detest tyrannie and cruelty, though it be shewed to the broode of Cain, toward vncircumcised Sichemites, or profane Gibeonites, yea on such whom he hath in his iudgmēt appointed to destruction, though not by that meanes.
                     Whosoever he shalbe therefore with whom thou shalt haue to deale, I say not if he be a Papist, but a Iew, but be he a Turke, or Atheist, or whatsoever infidell, remember to vse him as a man, even because hee is a man. Man cannot be GOD to man; it was an higher title then ought to haue beene given either of Cicero to Lentulus, or Virgil to Augustus: but if any man play the part of Lycaon and become a wolfe, then shall not Eclog. 1. the punishment of Lycaon be removed from him.

                     As God is the creator of all, so is he also the Saviour of all concerning the blessings of this life. But as he is called the Saviour of all, but chiefly of the elect, so detesteth 1. Tim. 4. 10. he all cruelty that is done to any but especiallie that, which is shewed towards his people. Which is cleere by this, which is here said, that because of his cruelty towards Iacob, &c. Such are all his chosen servants, as Psal. 135 4. the Prophet in the Psalme saith, that the Lord hath chosen Iacob for him selfe, and Israel his chosen treasure. By the name then of Iacob are all the chosen represented, for all beleevers are of the seed of Abraham, the children Rom 9 4 7. 8. of Iacob, they that are his chosen. Of whom hee hath such care, that he rebuketh even kings for their sakes. Abimelech when as vnaware he would haue takē

Pharaoh oppresseth them, Exod. 14. 27. the Lord delivereth them, and drowneth him. For GOD remembreth for ever the covenant which hee made with Abraham, and the oath which he sware vnto Iacob.

                     Which as it is great, by whomsoever it be committed, so is it of necessity much more, if it be committed by him, that is brother to Iacob. Wherfore the Prophet saith, for thy cruelty to thy brother: the indignity whereof is amplified in the words following, where speaking of them, that spoiled and ransacked their city and slew them, he saith, and thou also wast as one of them. For although we be bound to abstaine from all inhumanity, yet are we more bound to refraine from it, towards such as are of the same country, city, society, kindred, &c: and though we be to loue all men, yet are we not to loue all men alike. For our Saviour himselfe, though he loved all those, whom the Father had giuen him: yet certaine it is, that he loued Iohn more entirely then anie of the rest, so that he is noted by that title the Disciple 
                        Ioh. 21. 20. 
                        whom Iesus loved. So that here by the name of brother, added by our Prophet we may gather the sin of Edom to be the greater, because he dealt thus with him, that was his kinsman according to the flesh. For the bondes of Nature remaine stil, notwithstanding religiō which commeth by grace. The heathen entreating of the duties which men owe one to another, maketh the first degree to containe all men because they bee men. The Cic. lib. 1. Offic. nexte such as are of one people, language, citie, kindred,
                        
the nearest of all, man, and wife, children, &c: which doctrine is a remnant of that light, wherewith Adam in his perfect knowledge was endowed. For even so GOD requireth greater curtesies to be shewed by the Israelites, to the Idumeans, then to other straungers, and Moses giveth the reason, because he is thy brother: and yet greater of the Iewes one to another; greater also of such as are of the same kinred, as S. Paule teacheth, If any haue Nephews or kinsmē, &c. Whereby he sheweth, that he is first to provide for them, & againe, if there be any man that provideth not for his owne, and namely for them of his houshold, he denieth the faith, and is 
                        1. Tim 5. 8. 
                        worse then an Infidell. He hath denied the faith, for faith dissolveth not these duties, which children owe to their parents, parents to their children, &c: He is worse then an infidell, because amongst them the fathers cast not of their children, the children do their best to help their parents in their need. Let vs learne therefore to be wise in performing the duty we owe to all men according to the degrees by God prescribed; considering the Prophet here sheweth, that the Idumeans shoulde haue beene more curteous & gentle to Iewes, because they were brethren.

Oh Lord! how much worse are the Popish Romans, then the old Romans! they would not receiue a man that offered to doe such a mischiefe, these pricke men forward, and seeke after with great rewards such as will attempt it, they discovered it to their enimies, and warned them to looke to themselues, these hastē the matter, by what meanes they can, they thought it altogether vnlawfull, and detested it as abhominable, these commend it as lawfull, and defend it to be meritorious. When Pyrrhus for a recompense sent them backe some of their souldiers which they had taken

they would not receiue thē as a reward, for that which they thought humanitie required, but sent him backe as many prisoners of theirs; these labour by all means to keepe the matter close, and thinke it happy for him that can doe it: and may we not then say that vndoubtedly Fabritius shall rise at the last day in iudgement against them. The blood of Abel cryeth for vengeance against all these, who thirst after the blood both of Prophets, people, and of prince. Behold O Lord thy sanctuarie with the eies of mercy and compassion, infatuate the counsell of Aehitophel, disappoint the practises of the blood thirstie and cruell men, that we being safe vnder the shadow of thy wings against all the crueltie of thy enimies, may see thy iudgements vpon the cruell Idumeans, and glorifie thy name therefore.

Wherefore in these points consisted the crueltie of Edom in wishing, speaking, and doing evill against Israel.
                     
                     Welwillers cannot looke on our miseries, or abide to see them, for griefe and sorrow. As we read of Agar the mother of Ismael, that, whē her sonne was like to die for want of water, shee cast the child vnder the tree, and went and sate over against him a far off, for she said, I will not see the death of the child. But here the evill wil, that the Idumeans bore, appeareth, and the Gen. 21. 15. 16 harme they wished them, in that they reioiced to looke vpon the affliction of their brethren.
                     
                     Neither could they keepe this evill will within thē, but they vttered it in their speech, speaking proudly a

                     Besides here they staied not, but to their evill will & naughtie words, they added naughtie deeds, for they entred into the gate, laid hands on their substance; and as though it had beene a small thing to rob them, they proceeded further, and tooke away their liues, by killing some by present death, for whom they waited in the breaches, others by lingring death, whom they betraied, that so they might die in torments & captivity. And all these albeit very grievous in themselues, yet are more increased by the circumstances.

                     2 The circumstance also of the time encreaseth the cruelty, in the day he was made a stranger, in the day of affliction. Whereby is declared, what marveilous savage hearts they bore; for then even enimies are moved to pity. Wherefore to shew the grievousnes in respect hereof, this clause is repeated in each branch.
                     And when it is also saide that they stoode in the breach & betrayed the remnant, not sparing such as had escaped,

we see that on all sides their cruelty is amplified.
                     Wherefore they are iustly reproved, when they are admonished not to haue done that which they did. By which reproofe of Edom, we are admonished to haue two things, if we will neither be idle nor vnfruitfull in the knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ, namely

                           1 Patience.
                           2 Brotherly loue
                        
in that they

                           did.
                           should haue done.
                        
                     
                     1 It is a heard and heavy message, that the children of GOD must suffer so great misery & cruelty, & to beare it also: a great griefe it is, that our enemies should looke on our affliction, and reioice; greater to enter into our gates and take away our goods; greatest of all to take away our life: yet is it more then this, to kill vs after wee haue escaped; especially to suffer all this of our brethren. Yet is there no remedy, the godly in all this must be patient and suffer all these things, and that not onely of strangers, but also of our brethren.
                     
                     
                        The gate that leadeth to life is narrow and straite. Wee are to sit downe and cast accompts, for we are to build a costly worke. We are borne as the sonnes of Iacob vnder the bondage of Pharaoh, so vnder the thraldome of Sathan that spirituall Pharaoh. Christ is our Moses by whō through Baptisme, as through the red sea, we are led to the land of promise: but before we come thither, wee are to passe through the wildernesse where is want of meate and drinke, and other necessaries, besides wild beasts & noysome serpents, &c: Yet this must we passe through, before we can come to Canaan, that is heavē. Which floweth, not as did that with milke and hony, but

with such ioy and comfort, as tongue cannot vtter, neither haue at any time entred into the hart of man.
                     Now seeing vnlesse we passe through the wildernes we cannot enter into Canaan: wee must be content to beare whatsoever affliction is therein. But if we murmure and rebell, he hath sworne in his wrath, that we shall not enter into his rest. So hard a thing is it, nay so impossible, to enter heaven, but through many tribulations.
                     
                        If any man will come after me, saith our Saviour, let him take vp his crosse dayly, and follow me. The death of the crosse was not only most grievous, but most shame full also, and so much the more, for that such as were to bee handled most despitefully were put to cary their crosse themselues; for they had favour shewed thē, who had others to helpe: yet were not this worst, if they were to do it but once, or to die but once, but whē we are commanded to do it dayly, it is a sore matter: yet must those that will follow Christ be content to doe it, to beare all affliction even most grievous and shamefull, even the crosse. For Christian mens life is death, and that daily: that they may say with the Church, for thy sake are we killed dayly, not the whole day onely, but every day. Christ Iesus the sonne of GOD, who thought it not robbery to be like vnto God, was content for our sake to endure all miseries, even the death of the crosse, with all the indignities, that Edom put Iuda vnto. For they in the day of his affliction stood staring & looking vpon him, they reioiced against him, those goods hee had they tooke and divided amongst them: Lastly they put him to a most villanous death, as himselfe had before shewed

by David a figure of him. I am become a stranger to my brethren, an alien to my mothers childrē. They stood staring and looking on me, they gaue me gall, &c: all that looke on me haue me in derision, &c: dogges haue compassed me a bout, &c: they part my garments amongst thē, and cast lots on my vesture, they pierced my hands and feete, &c: For albeit, that some of these things were performed against our Saviour by the heathen: yet were both Pilate & the souldiers but ministers of the Iewes his brethren, who were they, that sought for him, betraied him, delivered, accused him of treason, and that cried out against him, cru

                     This example of Christ who was thus cruelly entrea ted and put to death in such pitifull sort by his brethren, is set forth for a patterne to vs, to learne by like patience to suffer the like cruelty. Because indeed that we are prepared and ordained for the like: As Peter declareth, here vnto are yee called: for Christ also suffrea for vs, leaving vs an example, that we should follow his steppes. And Paule 
                        1. Pet. 2. 21. saith that we are herevnto predestinate, to be made like vn to the Image of the sonne of God: and if we will raigne with him, we must also suffer with him.

1 Reioice. This ioy at others harmes ought to bee farre from vs, being a token of hatred and envy. For if we goe to the root as it is delivered elsewhere, it is evident, Ezec. 35. that it proceedeth from an evill mind. For whō men hate, him wish they evill vnto, and would gladly see it 
                        Cic. Offic. lib. 2. Quem qui

                        fall on him. Wherefore it proceedeth from the heart, as even the outward gesture also: which our Saviour declareth, when he saith, that out of the heart proceed evill thoughts, &c. and an evill eye, meaning the effects of an evill eye and envious. For many there are that see well, and yet haue evill eies. Namely such as delight at the harme of their brother, and sorrow at his good. Wherefore we must beware of both effects namely, that we neither behold the prosperitie of others with griefe, nor their adversitie with ioy.
                     And for the former, we must be so much the more diligent in avoiding it, because a good mind is sometimes subiect vnto it. When a young man told Ioshuah, that Eldad, and Modad, prophecied in the host, hee Num. 11. 27 willed Moses to forbid them. But Moses rebuked him; enviest thou, saith hee, for my sake? yea would to God that all the Lords people were Prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit vpon them.
                     
                     But as for the latter, which is to reioice at the adversitie of others, it is not so incident to the heart, which is sprinckled with any drop of grace; because that evē naturally, we pitie such as be in miserie. Howbeit, if there be any such among vs, let him remember what the wise man saith; That he who reioiceth at the harme of another, shal not himselfe escape vnpunished. The

summe is this, that we look to our heart the fountaine of these affections, and purifie it. The heart, as the Philosophers saie, in naturall generation is first framed, and in spiritual regeneration it is first formed. Wherefore we are first to looke that it be pure. For what the heart conceiveth, that the tongue vttereth, and what the tongue speaketh, the hand practiseth.
                     
                     2 The second thing is, that we speak not against our brethren,
Neither


                           exhorting the enimies.
                           
                           scoffing and deriding our brethren, as Ezec. 25 35. the Idumeans.
                           
                        

To exhort men to do evill, I hope we may learne how deere it will cost vs by the example of the Iewes; who exhorting the Romanes to slay our Saviour, and being admonished of the great wickednesse, answered, his bloud be vpon vs & on our children, & so it was indeed. But how sore it was vpon them the noble history of Ierusalems destruction, which followed within the cō
                        passe Vid. Egesip. lib. 4 &c. of their childrens life, doth sufficiently declare, of whom were slaine 1100000.
                     For taunting, as not onely doers but abetters are culpable in faults, so these scoffers as well as the doers of evill; and so much the more, because they scoffe the Lord himselfe, as when they said, The land wherein the Lord is. How heavy the hand of the Lord was on Rabsakeh for this blasphemy, we haue an evident example. I will not go so farre in this assembly as to speake of such grosse blasphemy; but if there any among vs, which are not afraid to abuse the words of Scripture
                        
in scoffe, as did those wicked Iewes which had in their mouth. The burthen of the Lord, &c. Let them consider the punishment threatned against such scorners and be afraid thereof. A shame it is, if the counsell of Trent condemne such wickednesse, for vs to vse it. Wherefore if any prophane cogitations concerning GODS word rise in our mindes, let vs betime quel these Impes of Babylon, dishing them against the stones, that they go no further.
                     3 The third thing is, that we take from them as not their life, so neither their living, whereby their life is maintained. For although wee go not so farre, as to come to sacking, yet if we lay hands vpon the goods of Iudah, whether publique, or private. we play the part of Edom: I am loath to speak that which I should heare touch. Doe not they commit this wickednesse, which take mony for that which was provided to main taine the poore, either in the Vniversity publikely or privately in any colledge: which sell the poore for shoes, or come not so low as those beggarly iudges, but make their owne advantage by what meanes soever.

                        and he said an hundred measures of oile, and he said take thy writings, set down quickly & write fifty, &c. The Steward cācelled not the obligations but made thē a new, & so made him friends of his masters goods. I would to GOD this practise were not too common among vs by pub lique goods to make vs private friends in our owne suits, &c. The Lord commended the wisedome of this vnthristy Steward, he commended his policy, not his hone stie. And if hee were among vs and were to speake of Stewards, he would commende the policie of our Stewards no losse then that of the wise steward. The Pharisees gaue 30. pence, which were indeede 30. sicles, about in value two shillings a piece, which they tooke out of the publique treasury vnto Iudas to betray our Saviour, when Iudas had returned them, they woulde not put them againe into the treasurie because it was the price of bloud, but bought therewith a potters field, to burie strangers in. The Pharisees gaue 30. pieces of siluer, if it had beene 30. pieces of gold, or thrise 30. it had bin fitter for my purpose.
                     For the sinne is such of them that haue given much more out of the publique treasury, to compasse such things, as when they haue them, they may betray the soules of Christians. And whether this practise be rise among vs, I leaue to their consideration, who wiselie consider the dealing of the world. But let such men as

be faulty herein, consider the end of the givers and takers, whereof the one strangled himselfe, the other were overthrowne in the destruction threatned against them. And for the money, what end it had, we see: I speake not because it buried strangers, but it served to no purpose, but to burie carkases: and so shall this mony serue to none other end but to bury, not the carkases but the soules of such in hel fire, which staine their hands with it.
                     4 The fourth thing is to abstaine from murther. I wil not propose vnto you so high a degree of this sin: But exhorte such as to whom it appertaineth to beware, that they murther not the soules whereof they haue charge. The surest death and most pitifull is the famine of the soule, and the want of the preaching of the word is famine. And reason in the mouth of the Poet hath taught vs, that it is a most miserable thing to die with hunger. Wherefore in this case it belongeth to Maisters, who haue charge & care of servants, Pastors of flockes, Magistrates of people, to see that they be not negligent in their duty, and that their hande be not deepe in this iniquity, and that they be not defiled with the bloud of soules, which Christ hath redeemed with his precious bloud. Oh that they would at length consider wisely of it! And here should I speake to the Magistrate of the city, if hee were present, in that matter, which hath beene often moved vnto him, for the provision for such as might minister the word vnto them, which in the Apostles iudgement is necessary: No man at any time goeth to warre on his own

charges. And if this city can be content to set out souldiers for the prince, will they not be perswaded to furnish souldiers against Sathan, the enimy of their souls, against whom they are continually to striue? The example of Cambridge, hath beene proposed vnto them: but if they were not worse then them of Achaia and the Barbarians of Macedonia, they would bee moved to do somewhat herein; these were content to sende reliefe to the Saints at Ierusalem, but they will not succour such as are amongst them, which are not troubled with bodily but spirituall hunger.

Neither are we alwaies moved therwith all, especially if we know or bee perswaded that, that which is threatned be farre of. For it befalleth very often, that the pleasant lust and pleasure of sinne for a season, overweyeth the feare, which wee should conceiue of the punishment which is yet to come, according to that of the wise man. Because sentence against an evill worke is not executed speedily, therefore the heart

                        of the children of men is fully set in them to doe evill. The Prophet waying this, thought it a small thing to

teach vs, by the wickednesse of the Idumeans, that we should fall after the same maner of sinne, & therefore putteth vs also in mind of the punishment which was to light on the vngodly. Which also hee doth the rather to comfort the godly; for so grievous are the calamities, which for the present time, the best are both to see and feele, that vnlesse they went into the sanctuarie of the LORD to see the end of these men, whom GOD hath set in slipperie places, it must needes fal out, that their seet should slip, and their goings slide. Wherefore Psal. 73. to raise vp the spirite which striueth against the flesh, and to beate downe the flesh which fighteth against the spirit, the Lord saith by the Prohhet, for the daie, &c.
                     
                     By the daie of the Lord, is meant the time of the Lords iudgement, that is, the time which hee hath appointed to execute iudgement. By the heathen are meant the nations set against the Iewes. As were the Philistins, Tyrians, Medes, Babylonians, &c. and such as were mentioned Ieremie. 25. where the matter, which is here handled generally, is more fully in particular opened. And as Edom is amongst them there counted, so here, hauing in the former verse opened the threat against a lenimies, in the verse following is He namely mentioned. Howbeit least the Iewes should in the meane season be discouraged & broken, with the manifold miseries which they abode, hee sheweth that their enimies should suffer farre greater, and this also to their greater comfort is vttered in GODS person, On my mountaine.
                     
                     
                        
                        Afflictions by a Metaphor are here called a drinking of strong drinke, as of wine, because that as mē by taking more thē enough, become drunke, so that their heads wax giddy, their bodies distempred, &c. & some so disquieted, that they die of it. So men by suffering afflictions become astonished, their bodies disordered, &c.
                     The meaning then is this, that though they endured for a while many and sundry miseries, yet should their enimies feele far greater: for it is said of the godly, that they should drinke on his holy mountaine. But the heathen continually: implying that they should abide this punishment for a time, but the enimies forever. Againe, that they should drinke, but the other, should drinke and swallow vp, and bee as though they had not beene. Which difference is yet more fully declared by Ieremie, Take a cup—stagger—wax mad, vomit—yet Ier. 25. 2. 15. of the Iewes which were carried captiue to Babylon he saith, that after 70 yeares they should be delivered.
                     Wee are to note that sundry temporall things in the old Testament, are shadowes of things eternall. Noah his arke which was borne vp by the waters, signified the Church, borne vp and saved by that which baptisme representeth; the punishment of Sodome figured the eternall fire. The land of Canaan whereinto Io shua brought the Israelites, was a signe of the kingdome of heaven, wherevnto wee are brought through the wildernesse of this life by Iesus Christ. So this chastisement for the time of his children, and continuall drinking of the vngodly, are figures of the short correction,

which GOD will lay on his children, and the most dreadfull and eternall punishment, which shall fall on the head of the vngodly.
                     For the mountaine signifieth the Church; the Iewes, the godly; their drinking, afflictions. The heathen all vngodly; their continual drinking, their eternall punishment; their swallowing, &c: their torments most grievous. Which though we see partly, accōplished in this life, yet shall it more be seene in the life to come. For whē the godly haue a little suffred here, they shall haue all teares wiped from their eies, and the vngodly shal drinke and swallow, &c: that is, suffer endlesse and vnspeakeable torments.
                     Here out are there many things to be observed.
                     
                        1 Cause of these punishments. For respecting the sinnes in the former verses.

                        5 Grievousnes of the punishment, continually.
                        
                        6 By way of the Metaphor of drinking, the filthinesse of drunkennes.
                     
                     1 The iniquities, which the Idumeans wrought against the Iewes were they, that provoked this dreadfull vengeance. And because the heathen were like vnto them, they are to be punished also in the like manner. The sinnes of the Idumeans consisted as hath been before declared in reioycing at the affliction of their brethren, in speaking evill against them, in spoiling them of

their goods and substance, and in killing of their bodies. Wherefore, as hath beene said, if we offend in the like if in greater, we must looke to receiue the like reward.
                     So that if our hearts bee open to all manner of vngodly thoughts, and wicked lusts, our tongues prepared to vnrighteous speech, out hands set to rob, whether it bee the goods of priuate or publike persons, if wee kill not the bodies but the soules of men, let vs learne this lesson, and dread this severe punishment. For the wrath of God for such things commeth on the children of vnbeliefe. For such things, saith the Apostle, not onely for the same. Enoch prophesied of such, saying behold the Lorde commeth with thousands of his Saints, 
                        Iud. 14. &c. 
                        to giue iudgement against all men, and to rebuke all the vngodly among them of all their wicked deedes, which they haue vngodly committed, and of all of their cruel speakings which wicked sinners haue spoken against him. The Lord will come to iudge the wicked for their deedes, for their cruell speaking, and for their thoughts the fountaine and spring thereof. This was prophecied by Enoch before the floud and then performed: Iude applyeth it as spoken against all the wicked. Paul vseth this 1. Cor. 16 22. execration, If any loue not the Lord Iesus, let him be accursed Maran—atha. The Syriake words signifie, the Lord commeth, and are the first words of that prophecie of Enoch, adenouncing of that severe punishment, which shall come on the head of al sinners, as certainly, as the Lord shall come to iudgement. Here that we deceiue not our selues in iudging of this loue to Christ
                        
our Saviour hath set downe a ready note to discerne it by. If yee loue me, keepe my commandements. I come not to the particular note of Pastours, which our Saviour hath laid down to be this, If thou loue me feed my sheep. if thou loue me feed &c. so earnest, so tender, so careful a charge noted in this repetition, would be deeply considered of them that are in that place, if there bee any loue in them: if there be not, thē I pronounce not this curse against Non residents, but Saint Paul doth; If any man loue not the Lord Iesus (as these do not, which feed not the lambes and sheepe of Christ) let them bee accursed Maran
                              •…
                           atha. Here also all hypocriticall Christians, are warned to consider their waies: which content themselues with an outward profession, and thinke themselues safe while they remaine in the visible Church. But our Saviour sheweth, that hee is the vine, wee the branches, his father the husbandman, so that each branch though he be in the outward barke fastned to the vine yet if he bring not forth fruit, hee is cut off, and cast into the fire. It profitteth him nothing to haue beene in the vine, if he be fruitlesse. But if these speeches of Enoch, Iude, Paul, and our Saviour doe the lesse touch vs, because they be farre of, and so wee pamper our selues, esteeming the pleasures of sinne for a season, greater treasures then the kingdome of heaven: let vs consider the next point.
                     2 That is, neere. When Ionah sent to the Ninivites cryed in their streets, yet 40 daies and Niniveh shall bee aestroyed, the people of Niniveh beleeved God, proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth from the greatest of them vnto

the least. I haue not the function of Ionah, but the commission of Iohn Baptist, to tell you that even now the axe is laid to the root of the tree, and every tree that bringeth 
                        Mat. 4. 
                        not forth good fruit, is cut downe and cast into the fire. How neere or farre of, it is to every one can I not tell, yet I am certaine, that seeing the axe is even now laid to the root, that it is not long to any. Wherefore while it is yet called to daie, let vs not harden our hearts; while it is light, let vs walke in the light; while it is daie, let vs worke; the night commeth where in we shall not worke, & before Heb 3. that day come, which shall make an ende of all daies. For it is assuredly pronounced to be neere vpon all the wicked.
                     
                     This is spoken not only of the particular iudgment of each man, but also of that daie, so called by an excellencie, the day of iudgement, which GOD hath appointed herein to iudge the world by Christ, as Paule taught the Thessalonians, which before GOD with whom a thousand yeares are but as one day, is no doubt neere: though as men count far and neere, I knowe not whether it be far or neere. It is not for vs to knowe the times and seasons, which the Father hath placed in his own power. He speaketh not only of the certaine houre, but of the times in generall, so that there is cōdemned the rash presumption of those which take vpon them to deliver the yeare and season of the Lords comming to iudgement. As that fond Prophecie of Eliah, not the Prophet, but a Ribbin of the Iewes, who hath written, 
                           
                              〈1 line〉
                           
                         that the world should endure but 6000. yeares, which is a Talmudicall dreame, worthy that sincke of the Iewish

filthinesse, which yet neither the Iewes from whom it came do beleeue, for thē must they beleeue that their Messias is come, which they deny. The world hauing cōtinued 5530 yeares. So much the more blame worthy are some Christian Chronicles, which haue alleaged this dreame, as a thing of some weight, and that is worse, haue fathered it vpon Eliah. Wherefore whether that great day bee farre or neere off, I knowe not; neither will I deny, that it is neere, for it may be neerer then any imagine. For it shall come as a theefe in the night. And although mockers & scorners do laugh at it, yet shall they once no doubt feele it.
                     The particular iudgement of the wicked, as it was then said to be neere, so may we say that of al such it is so now. For though there were no more but the generall administration of things on the earth, wee are thereby sufficiently taught, that man which is borne of a woma, hath but a short time to liue, &c. which if it may be truely affirmed of all men, then how much more of the wicked, which shal not liue out halfe their days. Who thought that Sena cherib in all his power should haue beene murthered of his owne children in the temple of his owne Gods? who would haue beleeved that Baltasar in the middest of his banquet should haue receiued his sentence of destruction, and so suddainely to be slaine by the conspiracie of his subiects. The rich man whose land was very fruitfull, even then when he bad his soule take her rest, had her taken from him. There is none of vs hath greater Charter of his life then Senacherib, Baltasar, or the Rich man. Sith that each particular

mans iudgement cannot bee farre of, and may be very neere; for the old cannot liue long, the young may die very quickly. Let vs remember to abstaine frō such sinnes, which then shall be revealed to the confusion of those, that haue committed them. Let vs not flatter our selues with long daies, hoping the punishment shall be deferred, least that befal vs, which is reported of the young man, in the 7. of the Proverbs, whom the har

                         with her craft caused to yeeld, telling him, that her husband was not at home, but was gone a farre iourney: so he was entised with her flattering lips, & followed her straight waies, as an oxe that goeth to the slaughter, and as one fettered to the instruction of fooles, till a dart strooke through his liver.
                     
                     
                        Christ is a prince, which indeed is gone into a farre countrey, yet he looketh, that his talents, which he hath left behind him, be imployed till he come. And hee is not gon so farre, but that he will come on the sodaine againe, & happy is that servant whom, when he commeth, he shall find doing his dutie.
                     
                     3 The Equitie, which the Lord wil vse in this iudgement, is declared, when it is said, as thou hast done, it shal be done to thee: thy reward shall returne vpon thy head.

But what speake I of severall men, seeing this equitie of Gods iudgement shineth most cleere 1. Reg 2 31 in Empyres and kingdomes? The Assyrians, Macedonians, Babylonians, &c. who as they had spoiled many nations, so were they thēselues also spoiled: but most notable in Rome who in few yeares was so often sacked & spoyled by the Gothes, Vandals, &c. In our daies we haue seene, that Abbaies and Monkeries, which had made havocke of Churches, and their patrimonie, how that GOD had taken vengeance of them & spoiled them also.
                     Now seeing the iudgement is one, where sinne is one, let such take heed as possesse the goods of the Church by their punishment, least that these goods so gotten, as a canker consume the rest. Woe to thee, saith the Prophet, that spoilest and was not sp

                     But here we must beware that wee condemne not GODS punishment, if the punishment seeme greater

thē the offences in that they are to bee punished continually, which haue sinned but for a time, for the circumstances besides encrease the greatnes of the fault. I will stand but on one, which is the person against whom the offence is committed. It is of Babylon: giue her double according to her sinne. How agreeth this? Double punishment: and yet according to the sinne. Rev. 18. Forsooth because an offence against the godly is two fold greater, then that against another. Semei cursed David: it had not beene death towards another, but because it was against the Lords annointed, he was iust ly slaine by Solomon. Now if the punishment of traiterous words against a temporall Prince rightfully deserue a temporall death, doe not traiterous words against an eternall king deserue eternall punishment? Wherefore seeing they haue offended the Maiestie of him that is infinite, it is reason that their punishment should be in time infinite, that so some waie the proportion may be answered.
                     The foundations of those parts of doctrine and instruction, which hitherto haue beene opened, are yet advanced higher in the 16 verse, by these two points.
                     
                        1 That the godly are afflicted in this life for a while in measure.
                        2 That the punishment of the wicked is without measure or end.
                     
                     But before I enter into the declaration hereof, I will note the harme which proceedeth of excessiue drinking, which the Prophet setteth here before our eies, when hee calleth afflictions and punishments, by

the name of drincking: for thereby are we taught that as men oppressed with griefe haue their hearts troubled, their bodies distempered, their spirits lāguishing their life shortned, &c. so the excesse of drinking weakeneth also the body, endangereth the soule, draweth on many diseases, &c. Yea many goe so farre, that they even quaffe vp their death with it. As it is reported, that Alexander proposing a reward to him that could drinke most, there were 21 presently killed thereby, &

                         he which got the victory died within three days after. And although I haue lesse cause to feare this vice in Christian men, much lesse in Englishmen, least of all in Oxford, yet the great plentie of wine sellers lately encreased, causeth me to dread, lest by degrees we come vnto it. Wherefore let vs consider in this Metaphor of drinking and swallowing vp, that not only the great afflictions of this present life are signified, but also the dreadfull and endlesse torments of the life to come. Which yet is not so meant, as though the very drinking were condemned. For wine was created of GOD to cheere the heart of man, not of the evill man alone, but of the good likewise, as GOD hath made his sunne to shine not only on the good but on the bad also. And although in the law, the high Priest were forbid to drink wine, when he entred into the tabernacle of the cōgregation, that hee might put a difference betweene the holy and the vnholy, the cleane and the vncleane, &c. yet in the Lev. 10. 9. 
                        New testament, where the ceremonies being abolished, the things only remaine, hereby sobrietie and temperance is commanded vs. Wherefore Paul counselled

                        Timothy to refraine from drinking water, & to vse a little wine for his stomacke: wherefore the moderate 1. Tim 5 23 vse of wine is lawfull, but to vse it immoderately brin geth drunkennesse. Wherefore Paul willeth vs not to be drunke with wine, wherein is excesse. The word which Eph 5. 18. the Apostle there vseth is more forcible expressing the desperate estate of drunkennesse, whom

But it is not possible. For as M

                     It is written of Xerxes, that when he beheld frō the Herodot. lib. 8. top of a high mountaine his great and mightie host, how he wept in recordation of their mortality, for that of a huge number, within the cōpasse of a few yeares, there should not be one left aliue. We may behold in spirit a great army, of Christian souldiers, throughout all Christendome, whom when you remember, you do I hope, my selfe know that I reioice, to remēber, that within these few yeares, they shall all be delivered frō 
                        Babylon, that is, from all adversity and misery of this present life, & be brought to that heavenly Ierusalem where we shall rest in all ioic and safety.
                     
                        
It is when you shal haue drunke. The godly then as we haue said must needs drinke, and that more is, they must drinke before the heathen. For Iudgement must be gin at the house of God, as Peter teacheth; after that the Lord hath punished his people, then will he visite the prowde heart of the king of Babel. When Ierusalem must be destroied, it must begin at the Sanctuary. See Ezec. 9. 6. how the Apostles in the Acts are first persecuted and afflicted, when as yet the bitter potion was not given to the Iewes, namely the sacking of Ierusalem and destruction Vid Sever. lib. 2. & G

Both which the Apostle hath declared: our light affliction which is but for a moment. And in another place, there hath no temptation

                     On the other side the punishment of the vngodly is continuall, as is here declared, for it is said they shall drinke continually and swallow vp and bee as though they had not beene. In the hand of the Lord saith the Prophet, is Psal. 75 9.

Wherefore let vs learne this for our instruction and comfort, that wee follow not the wicked to sin for fear of their plagues, but continue in the obedience of the Lord, that wee may be sure of that stay and comfort, which is here promised to the faithfull. Howbeit if there were no more comfort but this, that our enimies should bee punished more then we, it were not enough to countervaile the heavinesse of the crosse, which in the mean while the godly must beare.

                           17 But vpon mount Sion shalbe deliverance, and it shall be holy, and the house of Iacob shall possesse their possessions.
                           18 And the house of Iacob shalbe a fire, and the house of Ioseph a flame, and the house of Esau stubble, & they shall kindle in them, and devour them, and there shalbe no remnant of the house of Esau: for the Lord hath spoken it.
                        
                     
                     
                        THE first sense and meaning of these words is, that the Ievves, which should be carried captiue to Babylon, should returne again to their owne land, and destroie the Idumeans. By mount Sion the fortresse of Ierusalem, the beauty of Iewrie, is meant all the land of Iudea, and there by all the people. By these wordes then but vpon mount Sion, &c. The Prophet meant, that the Iewes should be delivered out of captivitie, clensed frō their sinnes become holy & righteous, reposs

                     As it hath beene said before, that the temporal things in the old Testament, are figures vnto vs of things spirituall: so is there in these words, another further mea ning then that which I haue opened; namely, that the Church of GOD shall at length bee delivered from bondage, and clensed from sinne, ēdued with holines, and so recover that everlasting inheritance, which they were deprived of, and that they shall adiudge the wicked & vngodly all their enimies, vnto eternal fire, whereby they shall all be consumed. And in this sense is that liuely doctrine fully verified, which in the other is not so fully. Wherein as in a picture slenderly shadowing the lineaments, some part only is obscurely expressed. For although the Iewes after their returne conquered the Edomites, yet were they not consumed 1. Mach. 5 3. as that none of them remained. For Iosephus writeth that some leved even at the sacking of Ierusalem to Lib. 4. cap. vl. 
                        
                           •…
                        indle and set on fire the Iewes. Wherefore the especiall meaning of this place is, that the Church of GOD shall be delivered from the captivitie, wherein it is held, endued with holines, inherite heaven, whence they were exiled their inheritance, and consume till none of them be left, because the Lord hath said it.
                     
                     The Church of God therefore, that is, all the godly
                        
shall be delivered, the enimies from whom, their sins, the chaines and bands, from which they shall bee loosed, are the paines and torments due vnto sinne. These cords are loosed, when wee beleeue and embrace the Gospell, wherein Christ Iesus is preached vnto vs, who saveth vs from our sinnes, and from the consequents of our sinnes: and as they who were caried away captiues, returned to their possessions, who were content to receiue the proclamation of Cyrus; so all such as vpon the proclamation of Christs Gospell, receiue and embrace the same, are most sure to be delivered. This deliverance is to returne back from Babylon to Ierusalem, that is, from the captivitie and slaverie of this world, to the kingdome of heaven.
                     In those, which are thus to be delivered there is required holines of life. For so also it is said in the gospell, that we are delivered from our sinnes to serue God in holinesse, &c. and it shall be well, saith the Prophet, but to whom? to the iust and holy, not the wicked & prophane: to such as are careful to performe their duty towards GOD and man, to such as sanctifie the Lord in their soule and bodie. There is a book of remembrance written 
                        Mal. 3. 16. 
                        before the LORD, but it is for them that feared him, & thought vpon the Lord there is life for them that seek immortalitie, and glorie &c. Let vs then assure our selues, that if we meane to attaine deliverance, and the fruit thereof, the repossessing of our inheritance, wee must be holy and iust, yer we bee delivered from the hands, &c. For although it may be, that some of them were not holy at such time as they were dispossessed,

yet needs must they be holy, before they can possesse them againe. Such were some of you saith Paul, but yee are washed; let this then be especially noted of vs, that none can receiue the crowne, but such as fight. The possessions 1. Cor. 6 9, 10 & 11. are the kingdome of heaven, w

And as the godly are delivered, so is there another benefit promised thē, namely that for their sakes the wicked shalbe consumed. For it is said, the house of Iacob shalbe fire. Where first we may note; the Emphaticall speach, whē he saith, the house of Iacob shalbe a fire, when he meaneth, that it shalbe like the name of the thing, as it is vsuall, being put for that, which is Resembled to it. Which indeed were not worthy the noting, but for the fanaticall Imagination of Transubstā

But so might we hence also gather that the house of Iacob, was fire indeed, &c. For all mysticall speeches bee not like to that of our Saviour, yet this is common to them, that the names of the signes are given to the thing signified, & so Christ is called Vid. August. e

                     It is said that the godly shall cōsume thē, &c. Which is also meant when it is said that Christ shall Receiue his chosen to iudge the world, which is not only ment of the Apostles, but of all the Saints. As S. Paul saith, know yee not that the Saints shall iudge the Angels, the wicked Angels. God indeed is he who iudgeth, but because he worketh it for his chosen sake, they are said to do it. As it is said that whatsoever is done to one of the little ones, is done to him, and whosoever Receiveth the Apostles Receiveth him, because this is done for his sake. So that it is attributed to the godly, which GOD doth for their cause. As it is in the commandement, honor thy Father &c: that thy daies may be long. The words are, that they may prolong thy daies. That is, thy parēts, not as though they could do it, but for that the parents pray to GOD, for the prosperity of their obedient children, which they therefore are said to work, because God for their sake doth it: In the 16 of Luke, we are commanded to make vs friends of the vnrighteous mammon, that when we haue need, they may Receiue vs into their habitations: not as if the poore and needy whom we helpe, should do it, but for that GOD for their sakes doth it. Even so is it here said, that the people of GOD should consume their enimies, because God would do it for Heb. 12. 29. their sakes, which is gathered by the Apostle, that our God is a consuming fire.
                     
                     The last point which is the seale of all is this, the

Lord hath spoken it. This is the onely ankerhold indeed in all tempests. For if we would leane on the words of man, let vs remember they are lyers. Flesh and bloud is not sufficient to assure and strengthen vs; but onelie the word of the Lord, who performeth all that he saith, who is not as man to lie, nor as mortall man that he should repent, shall he speake, and not performe? For so certainely Numb. 23. 19. as he cannot deny himselfe, so certainely wil he performe, what he saith. Which his name

In like manner let vs remember, that hee hath appeared vnto vs in his name Almighty, in the workes of his creation and regeneration, but in his good time he will appeare to vs in his name Iehovah, and most certainely perfourme all his promises.

                        OF these three verses, the two former are diverslie translated & expounded by reason of the diverse significations of the words. And the difficulty seemeth to bee such in my eies, that I dare not take on mee particularly to avouch the meaning of the Prophet in each word, but submitting my selfe to your iudgements, & to any, that shal yeeld reason of any other exposition. I will impart vnto you, that which in my opinion see meth most likely. Which is that, which agreeth with

the circumstances of the text, and generall drift of the Prophet. Which is evident by that which hath beene set downe already, and that which is afterwards added in the last verse. So that wee shall not greatly erre, if in in this or that particular word we hit not on the particular meaning of the Prophet, so long as we keep the generall doctrine without errour.
                     It hath beene said before, that the seed of Iacob. should possesse their ancient inheritance, and destroie their enimies. These points are here againe handled, but so that it is promised they should not onely repossesse their ancient right but also much more by extending the bonds and limits of their possessions every way.
                     The land of promise is so situated, that it hath on the South the land of the Idumeans, called here the mount of Esau; on the West a low plain, which was the country of the Philistines; on the North lay Ephraim and Samaria, and on the East, Gilead, &c. as Iosua the Ios. 13. best Geographer hath taught vs. The meaning is then that looke how farre the borders of their dominions in former times extended, so much should they repos sesse, yea that they should stretch out farther on every side, and possesse much more. Samaria is here mentioned, with certaine shiers as it were on the north, because of the difficultie which seemed to be in winning them, for that the king of Assyria hauing taken Samaria and led away the people captiue, had peopled that citie and the countrie about with many strangers. And for the like cause it may seeme that Beniamin is here named, for that being little and seated among

many enimies, they were in greatest danger to be dispossessed, &c. had they not receaued this pro mise, that evē their borders by the seed of Iacob should be inhabited. Now whereas they were divided into two people Israel and Iudah: the Israelites were caried away captiues by Salmanasar, and Iudah by Nabuchadnezzar. Wherefore in the words following, the promise is made vnto both, laying downe the borders of both the kingdomes, &c. This being laid downe followeth the other point of the destruction of the enimies. Saviours shall come vp to mount Sion to iudge the mount of Esau. Where by the name of (Saviour) the rules and governours are meant: for to iudge, is to rule and execute iudgement in right of the oppressed, as it is commonly vsed in the booke of Iudges. And this they shall doe by comming vp to Sion, the strongest fort in Iewrie. Finally the kingdome (it is said) shall be the LORDS: to note the happy state of the faithfull, having such a one for the governour, so mightie and therefore able, so mercifull, and therefore willing to keep them safe from all evill, and to participate with them all good things.
                     The performance of al this was in part represented by the bodily restitution of Iudah and Beniamin, when by proclamation of Cyrus, Zerubabel, Ioshua, &c. came and built Ierusalem; and continued by Iudas Macabeas, who iudged the Edomites, and so are these called Saviours, where notwithstanding GOD doth this by them his lieutenants, as he also said to Samuel, they haue not refused thee, but me. But this fully performed and perfected,

in the deliverance of our soules, by Christ who himselfe preached to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel, and then by his Apostles, sent from mount Sion into all the world, and so were Idumea & Palestina, &c. subiected, when all were ioined to make one flock. As also the kingdome is Christs, king of all kings & Lord of all Lords, of whom the Angel said that he should raigne for ever. And out of controversie, the Prophet meant not so much the former bodily as the latter spirituall deliverance, and restitution; even as the event plainly shewed. For although that the men of Iuda returned, vnder Nehemiah, &c. yet the people of Israel were never so restored; so that assuredly wee are to thinke that by corporall benefits, spirituall blessings are signified. By the Iewes and the Israelites, the spirituall seed of Abra ham; by repossession of Canaan, the possession of the graces of the holy Ghost. A misterie touched before, and to be had in remembrāce for the better vnderstanding of Moses and the Prophets; For it pleased GOD by liuely figures to foster the expectation, which his people had of Christ. Ioseph and Sampson, the one a Nazarite of his brethren, the other for his brethren, figures of Christ, who should come out of Nazareth, as the Evā
                           gelists shew, sold by his brethren as Ioseph, slaine for their salvation, as Sampson. Blood on the posts. Angell must not touch those that are marked with Christs blood. The high Priest with all his ornaments, figures of his redemption, as the Apostle to the Hebrews sheweth. Serpent exalted. Christ raised on the crosse. the sting of the Serpent, & dragon in the Reve. shall not hurt vs,

looking on him that saueth vs from all our sinnes. For as Moses brought the Israelites to the border of Canaan, and sight of it, but none except Iosua could bring them into possession of it: so the law may shew vs, the blessings and promises of GOD, but Christ by his gospell maketh vs enioy them. So Davids stone refused. Ionah in the belly of the whale, & his torments, Christs death and resurrection. And even so these things here handled are by the Apostles expounded of Israel and Iudah according to the faith. That place of Isaiah 9. Zabulon and Nepthalie, Mat. 4. when the light of the truth shone amōgst them. That which is in the last of Amos, Iames, 5. Acts, 9. applied not only to Israel, according to the flesh, but according to the spirit also. In the place where it was saide yee are my people, fulfil led in Christians, when they are called the sonnes of GOD. As Iames, Paul, Matthew expoūded those, so we these. Namely that both the Iews & Gentiles chosen to be the people of GOD, shal repossesse that, which was signified by the land of Canaan, of which wee were deprived by our owne sinnes. Which opinion is diligently to be marked against the franticke dreames of Iewish Rabbines, who dreaming their men that now liue, to bee they who should bee thus set in possession, doe not expound that which here is said of such as were led captiue, of them that Salmanasar and Nebuchadnezzar,

                     Against which peevish exposition we need not say much: onely we may note, that it cannot stand with the circumstances of the text. For when it is said this host, it is evident that hee spoke of his owne time, that is, of such as presently were here caried into captivity. 2. Zarephath is elsewhere in Scripture, 1. King. 17. Gen. 10. set downe for the border of—as for that which they allege out of a tradition, that with thē the names signifie these countries—so deserue they to be blinded that beleeue such dreames. For they say that when Iosua expelled the Cananites, many of them fled into Germanie, whereas in the 1. 2. 3. of Iudges, it is said of such as were not slaine, that they remained in this and that tribe. 3. Where here the Prophet speaketh of Iudah and Ierusalem, as of two distinct parts, it is manifest that Titus only led away them of Ierusalem. For the Israelites after their captivitie by Salmanasar were never restored. 4. Where they adde that Zepharad being a proper name commeth neer to the name wherewith they call Spaine, it is plaine that although the Chaldee Paraphrast expoundeth it as a proper name, yet is not the name of Spaine, and it might be the name of some place then knowne, that now is not. But the Hebrew word may be taken for a common name, signifying as much as a bond or limite of dominion, being made of

two words, which haue that signification. But these be like the dreames of their Ancestours, of the sitting at the right and left hand in the kingdome, and of the Chiliasts, and Mahomet, whose blisse they say shall be to Vid. Iust. dial.

Iohn saw scaled, not onely of the twelue tribes, 
                        Rev. 7. but of all tongues. A point to reioice in. as 13. Acts, the Gentiles were glad and glorified the word of the Lord. By Act. 13. 48. this meanes the true Israelites are admitted to partake of the twelue tribes, and of those trees that grow on both

                     The meanes by which all this shall bee accomplished is lastly set downe by Saviours comming vp to Sion. This in figure was performed, when Zerubbabel 
                        Christ a Saviour. with the rest came vp from Babylon to build Ierusalem, these which restored that citie and temple are called Saviours, as in truth such as restore vs to our ancient inheritance, &c Properly indeed none, but GOD can be called a Saviour, as in Isaiah and Hosea, I even I 
                        Mē Saviours. 
                        & there is no Saviour besides me: but hee is so called as a principallagent, men as ministeriall instruments. So the name of Iesus proper to our Saviour, because hee should saue his people. Otherwise Paul exhorteth Timothie—for so shalt thou saue thy selfe and them that heare thee: so all the ministers of the gospel: yea all Christians after a sort are called Saviours; as Iames, 5. If any erre

from the truth, & another convert him, let the same know that he shall saue a soule from death, and cover a multitude of sinnes. Which is vnderstood of every one, that by admonishing another keepeth him, or withdraweth him from sinne. Some saue with feare, pulling them out the fire of Iude. Which is the dutie of every Christian man, For that is a question worthy of Cain, am

                            the keeper of my brother? There should bee such a care in vs towards our brethren as was in Ioseph, who not onely dealt with his father for them, but counselled thē not to fall out by the way. Would to GOD we had many Iosephs, and few Cains, who when they haue murthered their brethren, demand whether they are their keepers. Now if this bee required of all, how much more of Ministers, into whose mouth the word of salvatiō is put. For which cause Timothie is expresly warned to continue in exhortation, &c. for so hee should saue himselfe 1. Tim. 4, 16. and his hearers... if he doe not exhort, &c. and continue therein, he is no saviour but a destroyer. The condition of his owne salvation is this, if thou doe thus thou shalt saue thy selfe, else not. Let thē then which are in that place, which Timothie was in, consider to what they are called, even to teach and exhort, & that not only all in generall, but every particular wicked man. As GOD giveth in commandement to his Prophet. If thou tell the wicked man, if not, his blood shall be required at thy hand. What then shall become of such watchmen, as either cannot or doe not warne, of the vnlearned that can only read, and not teach, of dumbe dogges, that cannot barke, non residents, who teach not

at all, & though they preach their Quarter sermons yet are not such as performe the commandement of Paul to cōtinue. But such Shepheards shal haue their portiō with goats, and not with the sheepe. Both the blind, and the blind guid shall fall into the ditch.
                     
                     They also who are to bee taught are here to leatne their duty. For if none can be saved, but such as cal vpon the name of the Lord, and none can cal on him that beleeue not, and none can beleeue vnlesse they heare. it is evident, that if we will bee saved wee must heare. 2. Kin. g 4. The Sunamite telleth her husband, that shee would go to the mā of GOD, he asketh her what she wil doe, seeing it was neither the sabaoth, nor new moone. Whereby we gather that it was the vse of this good womā, at such time to resort to Carmel where the Prophets did then vse, to instruct the people in faith & religion. There be few women amongst vs like this Sunamite, she went certaine miles, these wil not walk a few paces, to heare the same doctrine which shee learned. As for the men of this Citie, neither will they take the paines to come; I would they did provide that the mā of GOD might come to thē: or that there were in thē that loue to Gods Ministers which was in this woman who provided for Elizeus, a chamber, a bed, &c. that whē

                        he came that way, he might come in and abide there. It was said that this matter was in good forwardnesse, but is hindred, if so be it be, I must say as Paul, O yee foolish Galathians who hath bewitched you that having begun in the 
                        Gal. 3. 1. 3. Mat 8. 34.

request Christ to depart from your coasts.
                     
                     Wee should here speake of the second effect of GODS word, whereby it is a savour of death in them that perish, whē it is said, they shal iudge Esau. But of this hath beene spoken heretofore. It remaineth then to say somewhat of the last point, which is of Gods kingdome, whereof I need not speake, because wee are taught dayly in our petition to say, thy kingdome come. Only consider what a happines it is to be of that kingdome. If the Queen of Saba thought Solomons servants happy, that had him to rule them: how much more they which haue a greater then Solomon, Christ Iesus, the Lord of Lords, and king of kings! Wherefore we are willingly to submit ourselues to his commandements. GOD forbid any of vs should say, why should this man raigne over vs? No greater selicitie then to bee vnder his gracious, peaceable, and righteous governement. For if wee feele some tast of comfort in the government of Q. Elizabeth, what and how great shall wee enioy vnder him? Which the Lord in goodnes make vs partakers of.

                     fortresse, his rocke, his blessed strength and fortresse, because his life, his safety, his welfare is maintained by the might and mercy of the living God. As in the beginning he testified also: The Lord is my rocke, and my

                     fortresse, and my deliverer, my God, my strength in whom I will trust, my shield, and the horne of my salvation, my refuge. And this is the benefit of God vnto David. The thankfulnesse of David vnto God followeth: Therefore let the God of my salvation be exalted. Wherein, by the way, the cause of his thankfulnesse, to wit, the benefit, is repeated. For though in our tongue the name of salvation is by commō vse referred to the blissefull state of life eternal in the kingdome of heavē, wherto the scripture phrase doth likewise oft referre it: yet is it amplified in the Heb.

To the performance of the which dutie, that he may giue a sharper edge & hotter zeale to himselfe and others; he amplifieth and openeth more particularly both the cause of the duty and the dutie it selfe, in the verses following. Touching the cause of the dutie, he saith, The mighty God, that

                     ger Heb. the man of violences 2. Sam. 22 49. of his life, from the cruel, violent, the most violent man. Touching his duty wherevpon, he addeth, Therefore will I confesse thee, o Lord, among the Gentiles; and I will sing vnto thy name: hee giueth great deliverances to his king, and sheweth mercy to his anointed; to David & to his seed for ever. To confesse the Lord, is to acknowledge him to bee the author and giver of whatsoever good

we haue: to sing vnto his name, is with ioyfull melodie of voice to acknowledge it. But these things doth David vow that he will do: and therein will testifie, even before the Gentiles, that the Lord, who made him king and anointed him, doth giue him great deliverances, and sheweth him mercy, nor only him, but his too, his seed, his posteritie and progenie for ever. The very literal sense of the which words doth import an excellent thankfulnesse in David, that would yeeld such tokens thereof, among the Gentiles, the heathens, whom hee had subdued: a more excellent goodnesse and graciousnes in Psal.: 8. 43. God, who raised him to royall state, and mightily preserved him in it, and rid him out of many dangers, and shewed mercy still to him, yea to his of spring also that should raigne after him. But all this is base in respect of that which the holy Ghost in a spirituall meaning doth hereby signifie & betoken. For David was anointed king of the Iewes, made conquerour of the Gentiles, cast into perils, troubles, paines of death, & by speciall grace againe delivered from them, to the intent hee might be a figure (as we tearme it) an image and picture, an historicall picture, and a living image, that should resemble and represent the person of another Ezek. 34. 23. & 37. 24.

Which mystery Act. 2. 30. himselfe knowing as a Prophet, did write (by inspiration from God) sundry things, whereof the full & perfit accomplishment appeareth in Christ & his kingdome, as Mat. 27. 35.

of a type and figure in David and his state. So the great deliverances and salvations temporall, given and assured to David, and to his seed for ever after a sort, that is for long continuance of many yeares succession, did prefigure greater spiritual deliverāces, & salvatiōs simply & absolutely eternal, which should be likewise givē to Christ & to his Esai, 53, 10.

Rev. 21. 4. the ioies of life, of everlasting solace, of endlesse rest, assured. Which most excellent mercies, deliverances, salvations, as the Prophets commonly in the ende of their prophecies do commende to men by figuratiue speeches of Israël, of Iuda, of Sion, of Ierusalem, and blessings incident thereto: so in this conclusion of his song of thankes doth David ascende to them by the other, to shewe himselfe gratefull vnto God for them. A proofe whereof we haue in the last words that he concludeth with. For therein he seemeth to respect the promise, that 2. Sam. 7. 12. 
                     the Lord would set vp his seed after him, and stablish the throne of his kingdome for ever. Which the Angel Gabriel, sent to the Virgin Mary, expoundeth of Christ, telling her that Luk. 1. 32. 
                     God shall giue vnto him the throne of his Father David,

and he shall raigne over the house of Iacob for ever, and of his kingdome shall be no end. And a farther proofe in the former clause touching his confessing of God among the Gentiles: considering that S. Paul? declareth the goodnes of Christ in Rom. 15. 9. 
                     receiving the Gentiles to his glory to be meant thereby. As if the holy Prophet had said, that he would vse a new and vnaccustomed thankefulnesse to God for his passing singular and vnspeakable benefits: neither would confesse him among the Iewes onely, as then the faithfull did according to their order of praying in the Temple; but among the Gentiles also in time to come, whē they being called to the church of Christ should be made acquainted with his Psalms & Hymnes and learne to praise the Lord with him. So that I may say the same of these words, that on like occasion our Saviour did of other, Luk. 4. 21. 
                     This day is this scripture fulfilled in your eares. Howbeit not onely these wordes of this Scripture are fulfilled this day: but the other too, that lay forth the favour of God vnto his childrē in saving his anointed. For what more commodity did the Iewes receiue by King Davids meanes, then we by our sove raigne Lady Queene Elisabeths?

An Act that I haue heard men of iudgement say, and I am persivaded that they said truely (God grant the care of Heads and industrie of Students doe bring it to effect!) may proue as beneficiall for the increase of learning, as might the erecting at least of two Colleges.

That we cannot chuse but acknowledge Gods favour to haue beene as singularly extended vnto vs in preserving her, as it was to them in preserving him. For although her Maiestie hath not beene assaulted by so many forraine enimies as David: yet by more domesticall. Wherein her deliverances are to bee esteemed so much the more precious, by how much it is easier to beware of open foes, then of secret; of vipers that are farther of, then in our bosomes; of 2 Sam. 2. 22.

The Lord hath indued her Maiesties person with most rare prudence; her state with Coūsailers very wise & faithfull; her Realme with many thousands of dutiful loving subiects. Nor is it to be doubted out that sundry circumspect eies & loiall hands of these haue bin occupied in finding out & bringing to light the conspiracy.

But whether they doe vse this benefit of God to their good, or no: let vs, my deere brethren, let vs & our houses (as Ios 24. 15 
                     Iosua said) serue the Lord. And that not by acknowledging only Gods goodnesse in this and all his benefits, the foremost steppe to thankfulnesse: but the next also, I meane, by confessing of him among the Gentiles, and singing to his name with yeelding him all glory for it. For the Heathens thēselues, in that smal knowledge of God which sin left thē, did acknow

ledge him to be the worker & autor of the cōmodities that they had. In the Greeke Poets

                      king subdued divers nations, took their holds, spoiled their cities, seazed on their wealth, Hab. 1 11 ascribing that his power & force to his God. But Rō. 1. 21. they did not glorifie God as they ought, neither were thankfull. They robbed him of his honour and gaue it vnto 1. Cor. 8 5 
                     many Gods, 
                     Dan. 5. 4. their owne Idols, & Rō. 1. 23. 
                     Images of mortal creatures. Yea part of the lawrel they kept to thēselues: Hab. 1. 16 
                     sacrificing to their nets, & burning incense to their yarne, because by thē their portion was fat & their meate plenteous. The time of this ignorance is overpast, brethrē, & the daies are come wherof it was Esa. 11. 9. prophecied, that the earth should be ful of the knowledge of the Lord, as waters cover the sea. How much the more excuselesse shall our fowle ingratitude & vngodlines be: if we be no thankfuller to him then the Heathens, thē the Greeks, the Romans, the Caldaeans were. Chiefly sith beside the temporall benefit of the preservation of our Prince and vs, wee haue received graces more excellent & precious to endure for ever: name ly, the enioying of his Sonne Christ Iesus, 
                     1. Cor. 1, 30. our wisdome, our righteousnes, our sanctificatiō, our redēptiō; the Spirit of adoption, 
                     Rō. 8. 15. 
                     whereby we haue boldnes to cry Abba father; the peace of conscience, tranquillity of mind, contentednes of heart; the inheritāce immortal, vndefiled, & that withereth not; the cōfort, the protectiō, the assurāce of his loue: in a word so many blessings both of this life, & of the life to come, as never any natiō vnder heavē greater. Wherfore I beseech you by the mercies of God, who spared not his own Son

for our sakes, but gaue him to the death, the vile death of the crosse, that we might liue through him: let vs confesse him sincerely & faithfully, Tit. 1. 16. not only in words, but in deeds; & confesse him among the Gentiles, evē those which are strā
                     gers & aliēs frō the faith, that we may win thē to the Lord. Let 1. Pet. 2. 12. our cōversatiō be honest amōg thē: that by our good works, which they shall see, they may glorifie God in the day of the visitatiō. Let vs cast away profane songs of wantonnes, of lightnes, of vanity; & sing vnto his name: vsing both our voice & speech in al respects Eph. 5. 3. 
                     as it becōmeth Saints. To be short, let vs shew, let vs striue to shew by al parts of duty a thankfull acceptance of the great saluatiōs, that he hath wrought for vs, & zealous remēbrance of the end wherto: Luk 1. 75 
                     that we being deliuered out of the hand of our enimies, should serue him without feare, in holinesse & righteousnes before him all the daies of our life. The godly Prince & Prophet, whose vertuous example as in al the rest, so in this specially should be a spurre vnto vs, calling into mind how God had delivered his soule frō death, his eies frō teares, & his feet from falling, brake out into these words: Ps. 116 12 
                     What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I will take &c. Neither said he more therein, thē he performed. For when 1. Chro. 16. 2. he had offered sacrifices of thanksgiuing, he made a holy banket therewith vnto the people, in remēbrance of the manifold safeties & deliuerances, that hee had received. He praised the Lord, & called vpon his name: his Psalmes doe witnesse it to this day. Ps 57. 2 He promised that he would iudge righteously: 
                     2. Sā 8. 15 he did it. Ps 132. 2 He vowed to bring the arke into a place of rest: 
                     2. Sā. 6 16 he brought it. How great cause we haue, fathers, & brethrē, to say as he said. What shal we render so the Lord? your selues do wel know. How small care wee shew of doing as he did, in praising God, & paying our vowes

before his people: the world doth see. Our slacknes in frequē
                     ting of sermons, of praiers, of celebrating the Lord supper, & taking the cup of the salvatiō of salvations, I wish it were amended rather then reproved. We haue made vowes and promises to God, al, of perpetual holines in baptisme: some of special duties, in their several callings. And is it to be hoped that every one of vs, though not with Davids zeale, yet with some measure of it, will pay them to the Lord? Sure the greater hope thereof is to be had, if that, which hath been moved of order to be takē for ordinary sermons & preaching of the word on our Sabbath-daies in the afternoone, not the forenoone only, may be effected by the godly forwardnes of thē who should say, Heb. 6. 3 
                     And this will we doe if God permit. The father of mercies & God of al cōfort, who hath raised vnto vs a most glorious light, & placed a most gracious Princesse in the throne of government among vs, sanctifie vs throughout with his holy spirit: that we may offer vp the sacrifices of righteousnes, the fruits of our lips, of our harts, of our hands, to the glory of his name for all his benefits powred on vs And
