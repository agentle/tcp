            THe true / auncyent / and holy hystoryes reherse & shewe that the deuout hous & holy relygion of ye knyghtes hospytallers of saynt Iohan baptyst of Ierusalem toke begynnynge after that Alexandre the grete kynge of Macedony had conquered the yndes  /  and that the trouthe of his dethe was knowen in Babylon /  the worthy and valy aunt knyghtes Machabees by theyr vertuous power put out of Ierusalem the paynyms and people of straūge generacyons: and set the Iewes beynge dyligent in the seruyce of god in to theyr fredome and lybertees. And syth that tyme the sayd paynyms made grete warre agaynst them of Ierusalem. But fynably whan the right noble knyght / champyon of knowlege dyuyne / and vyctoryous tryumphatour Iudas Machabeus (that worshypped one god) gloryously had delyuered the sayd holy cyte fro the tyranny of the sayd enmyes. yet agayne he apparayled his army agaynst y• infydeles: & ordeyned with all thynges necessary in the sayd cyte wt grete courage assayled / fought / and dyscomfyted them. In the whiche batayle many of the people of Israhell were slayne / hurte / and maymed. ¶whan he was retorned into Ierusalem he consydered that it was deuout and merytorious to pray for them yt were slayne in batayle / dyde ordeyne and instytued that in holy places contynuall prayers sholde be made for them that so deyed / & also sustenaunce to be gyuen to them that were seke and impotent.
            ¶A certayne tyme after this instytucion the deuout prophete & noble knyght of the people of Israhell Iohānes Hicarnus founded an hospytall that was named Xenodoche of suche money & treasour as had be taken and founde in the tombe of kynge Dauyd / with ye whiche he had delyuered the holy cyte of Ierusalem fro the syege yt was layde to it by kynge Anthyochus named Epyphanes persecutour of the name of god / that dystroyed the temple of Salomon / the whiche after was reedyfyed by the Machabees. In ye whiche hospytall as folower of Iudas Machabeus he ordeyned cōtynuall prayers to be sayd / & the impotētes / weyke people / pylgrymes / and seke person

made hymselfe poore. Therfore we ought deuoutly to consydre that oftymes wt his bodyly presence he vysited ye sayd hospytall / there doynge many holy werkes and myracles by his dyuyne goodnesse. & that in the sayd place the holy apostles and dyscyples of Ihesu cryst haue doone many werkes of mercy to the people. Certaynly it is not to be doubted seynge that our lorde and sauyour before his passyon dyde magnyfy and gloryfy many vnworthy places in the cyte of Ierusalem by his holy werkes: but that also of his grace he hath illumyned and ennoblysshed the sayd hospytall of Ierusalem beynge a holy place / conforte / and socour of poore and seke people. ¶After the passyon of our sauyour Ihesu cryst by occasyon of synnes and iniquytees of the people of Iewes the sayd holy cyte of Ierusalem hath suffred grete desolacyons and ruynes in the tyme of Tytus and Uaspasyan Emperours of Rome that ryght vyctoriously toke vengeaunce for the cruell bloodshed of our sauyour Ihesu cryst. And by dyuers yl maners of the cursed paynyms the sayd holy cyte hath ben polluted and spoyled / and by many nacyons ouercome & dystroyed. By these sayd dystruccyons and vyolacyons the temple of Salomon restored by the knyghtes Machabees / and the sayd hospytall foūded by Iohan Hycarnus with other holy places haue ben desolated / vylypended and wasted / in suche wyse that the relygious obseruaunce of the knyghthode and hospytalyte by certayne space was delayde & left. But afterwarde the sayd Cyte and temple was restored agayne by Adryan elius emperour of Rome. ¶For this cause the sayd Realme of Ierusalem beynge destytute and bereued of all fayrnesse and ornamentes / hauynge in it reygnynge people of dyuers generacyons & sectes / the crysten people of all the worlde as well of one countree as of another went thyder in grete peryll to vysyte the holy sepulcre /  & other holy places. In the whiche cyte yt crysten people Latyns subgecte to the chyrche of Rome had no maner of socour nor habytacion /  and therfore they suffred grete outrages / perylles / hurtes / necessytees / pouerte of vytayle and bodyly subgeccyons / beten / domaged /  wounded / sclaundred / iniuryed / and euyll entreated of the mysbeleuers there dwellynge, in suche wyseth at many deyed in the wayes and stretes as beestes. not without spyte of the holy faythe. For there was no man that conforted them / for the cruelnesse of the inhabytauntes. ¶These causes seen by a deuout & vertuous man of holy lyuynge (moued & induced of the holy goost) named Guerarde a blyssed pylgrime louȳge god /  and desyrynge the helthe of his soule  / whiche was comen thyder on pylgrymage / consyderynge the submyssyon / perylles and domages of the deuout persones that came thyder purposed to make and edyfy a newe hospytal / to be ye refuge / socour /

In the whiche truly all ye werkes of mercy were dylygently done /  the poore people susteyned and ordred / the seke healed / the holy sacramentes mynystred / the pylgrymes and desolate defended from enmyes of the faythe / and receyued conforted / and holpen / thē prysoners redemed / & al hospytalyte was celebrate and vsed. For ye whiche holy werkes the sayd hospytall in shorte tyme was augmented and replenysshed with possessions and lordeshyppes. And thus by dyligence and labour of Guerarde the cō

And the holy fader pope Lucius the seconde defended that none sholde presume vyolently for ocupy the gouernynge and mynystracyon of the sayd hospytall / but that by them that were admytted in the seruyce of ye sayd holy ordre one sholde be chosen that sholde rule ouer them.

Of the whiche entrepryse Godfrey of Boleyne was vyctoryous capytayne. ¶Folowynge the maners of the sayd mayster many of his successours and adherentes haue doone many grete and worthy feates as it is euydently conteyned in the hystoryes of the gestes of Rodes. the whiche at this tyme is not of necessyte to reherse. For it is not our purpose to wryte hystoryes. it is suffycient to haue shewed the begynnynge & foundacyon of the sayd ordre.

The fyrst yt moūted to the bracke of Spayne was Lagat des genissayres a valyaunt man & of grete courage wt his cōpany / & bare .lx. or .lxx. baners & sygnes / & pyght them in ye erthe of the bracke / & than saught wt our men / & moūted on our repayres makynge other maner of fray & more rygorous than ye other that were passed / and ye sayd medlynge lasted about .vi. houres. And forthwt as the assaut was gyuen a grete sorte of turkes entred in to ye bulwarke of

Spayne and set vp .viii. or .ix. sygnes or baners vpon it  /  & droue our men out 
                     •
                   I can not tell how  / vnwares or otherwyse. And they were lordes of it .iii. houres & more. Howbeit there was of our men beneth in the myne of the sayd bulwarke. the whiche bulwarke so loste gaue vs euyll hope. But incontynent the lorde grete mayster beyng at the defence of ye poste of Englonde hauinge knowlege of the sayd iosse and that there was grete fyghtinge & resystence on bothe sydes at ye bracke of Spayne marched thyder wt the baner of the crucyfyx / leuȳ

And ye lorde mounted on the wall of spayne where as than began a grete medlinge /  & euery man layde his handes to worke / as well to put the enmyes out of the bracke as to recouer the bulwarke that was loste. And the sayd lorde sent a company of men in to the bulwarke by the gate of the myne / or by the barbycan the whiche entred at the sayd gate & went vp where they founde but fewe turkes. For the artyllery of the poste of Englonde ryght agaynst ye bulwarke of Spayne had so well met & scattered them yt within a whyle our men had slayne all them ye were lefte. And thus the sayd bulwarke was goten and recouered agayne / and with all dylygence were made newe repayres & strengthes to the sayd place And in lykewise the enmyes were put fro the bracke and fewe o
                     •
                   thē scaped / and all theyr baners and sygnes were left with vs. Surely it may be sayd that after the grace of god (the trauerses of Spayne & Auuergne / and the small artyllery set on the houses right agaynst ye sayd brackes as it is sayd / with the comynge and presēce of the lorde grete mayster) hath gyuen vs this iourney.
               ¶To the regarde of the murdre of people done by the artyllery of ye bulwarke of Englande and Spayne / the quantite was suche that a man coude not perceyue nor se ony grounde of the dyches. And ye s

                  enche of the mastyfes caryons was so greuons that we myght not suffre it .vii. or .viii. dayes after. And at the laste they that myght saue themselfe dyde so / and withdrewe them to the trenches  /  And the reuerent lorde grete mayster abode vyctoryous of the sayd place  /  and in lykewyse of the other thre assautes / ye whiche were but lytell le

But in cōclusyon the enmyes beaten on al sydes / and in so many sortes with artyllery were put backe and vaynquysshed that there dyed that day at all the .iiii. places .xv. or .xvi.M. And the slaughter was soo grete at the playne of Italy of the cursed enmyes that ye see was made reed with theyr blode. And on our syde also dyed to the nombre of a .C. men or moo. And of men of dygnyte in the towne hauynge charge dyed syr Fraū

was chyef capytayne of the grete shyppe of Rodes  / and he was slayne at the playne of Italy  / wounded with .ii. strokes of hacbusshes /  it was grete domage of his dethe for he was a worthy man /  parfyte / and full of vertues. There dyed also messire Nastasy de sancta Camell afore named hauynge a .C. men vnder him of ye lorde grete maysters socours. There dyed also dyuers other worthy men that daye /  & many were maymed. Amonge all other that lost ony membre messyre Iohn̄ de le touz called Pradynes  / beynge at the sayd bulwarke with a stroke of artyllery had his a

In lykewyse the same day was hurte syr wyllyam weston abouesayd capytayne of the poste of Englonde / & had one of his fyngers stryken away with a hacbusshe. whiche knyght behaued hym ryght worthely at all the assautes. Of the turkes parte of grete men were two pryncypall capytaynes slayne vnder Lagat des genissaires  / and another capytayne that was come out of Surrey to the campe certayne dayes before with .vi.C. Mamelukes / and .ii. or .iii.M. Moores. And of them that were hurte of grete men le Beglarby de la Notilia had a stroke with an arowe as he was in the trenche of Prouaūce. And many other were wounded whose names be not rehersed here bycause of shortnesse.
            
            
               ¶How the grete turke for angre that he coude not gete the towne wolde haue put his chyef capytayne to dethe / & how they made .xi. mynes vnder the bulwarke of Englonde.

And sent for Monstofa bacha with whome he was angry / & chydde hym bytterly  / saynge that he had caused hym to come thyder / & had made hym to beleue that he sholtake the towne in .xv. dayes or a moneth at the ferdest. & he had ben there all redy .iii. monethes wt his army & yet had they done nothynge. And after these wordes he was purposed to cause hym suffre dethe in the campe. But the other bachas shewed hym yt he ought not to do Iustyce in the londe of his enmyes / for it sholde consort

                  hem & gyue them courage / wherby he dyde moderate his angre & lett him for yt tyme / & thought to sende hym to Cayre lest ye people there wolde rebell / by occasyon of the capytayne of Cayre whiche dyed a fewe dayes before. Howbeit he departed not so sodaynly / & or he went he thought to assay yf he myght do some thynge for to please the turke  /  as well for his honour as for to saue his persone. & made meruayloꝰ dylygence to make mynes at the bulwarke of Englonde for to ouerthrowe it. And by accōpt was made .xi. mynes as wel to ye sayd bulwarke as elles where / besyde them spoken of afore /  & that they had fyred But the moost parte of ye sayd mynes came to no profe though they put fyre in them / & many were met wt countremynes / & broken by our men by the good dylygēce & solycitude of syr Gabryell du chef stuarde of the hous to the lorde grete mayster / whiche had the charge of the sayd countremynes at the same bulwarke. In ye whiche besynesse he behaued hym well & worthely / and spared not his goodes to cause the people worke & trauayle / but spent therof largely.
            
            
               ¶How the turkes were mynded to haue gone theyr way / & of the traytours wtin the towne / & of many grete assantes.
               THe turkes seynge yt by mynynge they were nothynge forthered / nor myght not come to theyr intencyons  /  and hauynge but small store of powdres were in delyberacyon & mynde to haue reysed the syege and gone theyr way. And in dede some of them made to bere theyr caryages towarde the shyppes. and also certayne nombre of people went out of ye trē

And in the meane season the fals traytoures that were in the towne wrote lettres to the campe gyuynge theym knowlege of all that was sayd & done amonge vs. And also an Albanyti fledde to the enmyes campe & warned them not to go / for ye gonshot was nygh wasted / & that the moost parte of the knyghtes and people sholde be theyrs shortly. ¶In lykewyse than wrote ye abouesayd chaunceler syr Andrew de Merall / whose treason as than was not knowen. But whan it cometh to the effecte of his treason I shal shewe the knowlege that he gaue to the enmyes at dyuers tymes. ¶whan the bachas & capytaynes of the hoost vnderstode the sayd warnynges they all purposed for to tary / & caused those tydynges of the towne to be knowen ouer al the army. And began agayne to shote artyllery faster than euer they dyde / for newe shot was comen in to the campe. Than Monstofa bacha beynge in dyspayre yt he coude do no thynge by mynes / by gonshot / nor by assautes he beynge redy to departe for to go in to Surrey by the grete turkes cōmaundemē

                   before his departynge he thought ones agayne to assaye his aduenture / and made .iii. assautes .iii. dayes togyder. The fyrst was on a saterday the .iiii. day of Octobre an houre before night. The other on sonday in the mornynge. & the thyrde on monday after dyner. And ye sayd .iii. assautes were made to ye bulwerke of Englāde. And it was assayled but wt stones and bagges full of artyfyce tyre. And at these iii. assautes many of our men were hurt with the sayd fyre / & with ye stones that came as thycke as rayne or hayle. But fynally ye enmyes gate

These wordes sayd in greke by some of the enmyes were herde of our men as they went downe fro ye bulwarke. And bycause (as it is sayd) that the enmyes at the assautes yt were made came vp by ye e

And in effect wenynge that it were well & behouefull to be done / by grete dylygence nyght & daye by mynes they voyded ye barbycan / & the moost parte of the erthe that lay in the dyche was brought in to the towne the whiche was hurtfull afterwarde & was cause yt the enmyes gate the fote of the walle. Notwtstandynge they had it but scarcely. But this clensynge forthered the tyme & caused them to gete it sooner than they sholde haue done yf the erth had lyen styll. But theyr fynal intent was to reyse the defence of the bulwarkes / & than

passe at theyr pleasure & entre in to the barbycan as they haue done. For ye enmyes seynge yt the sayd barbycan was clensed they thought to gete in to it by trenches / and so they dyde. Howbeit they were certayne days letted by our hand gonne shot. The enmyes seynge that they might not come nere it they couered theyr trenches wt tables to saue themselfe. And than they made a myne wherby they might go to the barbycan. So by these two meanes after yt they were repayred wt erthe and with a certayne walle yt they made for to eschewe ye shotte of the bulwarkes of Auuergne and Spayne. And in ye myne they foūde but two gonners / whiche they slewe by force of men. By this maner they beynge couered on all partes / & without ony daunger passed thorow & lepte in to the barbycan / and gate the fote of the walle. whiche was the .xvii. day of Octobre / an vnhappy daye for ye poore towne / and occasyon of the ruyne therof  /  & wynnynge yt they had. ¶At this poynt they slept not / but lyghtly and wt grete dylygē
                  ce they began

                  an with gynnes of fyre & barylles of powdre wherwt we slewe many of them / but it auayled nothynge. For the quantyte & multytude of people yt trauayled there was so grete that they cared not for losse of them. And yf we had had men ynowe wtin the towne there might haue ben remedy to haue reysed them fro thens. But cōsyderynge yt our force & total hope was in people / wherby we left to do many thȳ
                  ges yt myght haue ben doone & that sholde haue ben good than / and other times also for faute of men of warre. At the last it was pondred by syr Gabryell martiningo that there was no remedy but to hewe the walle for to mete them & beate them with ordynaunce and with gyunes of fyre to brenne & vndo them. Than our men began to hewe ye walle / & made some holes to shote at the enmyes that slept not / but dyde as we dyde / to shote at vs / & in dede they slewe and hurt many of our men. Than syr Gabryell martiningo ordeyned to make repayres wtin the towne at ye frōte where they dyde cut the walle / to thende that after the walles were cut ye enmyes sholde knowe wt whome to mete. The trauerses were made on eche side wt good artyllery grete and small. And the sayd trauerses & repayres were of the length yt the enmyes had cut the walle. & began at the massyf of Spayne made by the reuerent lorde grete mayster Mery damboyse / & ended at ye chyrche of saynt Saluador. The whiche trauerses & repayres ye vulgar people call la Mandra / that is to say / the felde. ¶The meane tyme yt the repayres and trauerses were made with all dylygence syr Gabryell Martinīgo neuer ceased goynge to euery place to pouruey for all thinges. And he beynge on ye bulwarke of Spayne to ordeyne

all thynge that was nedefull there came a stroke of a handgonne fro the trenches yt smote out his eye / & put hȳ in daunger of his lyfe / but thanked be god he retorned to helthe within a moneth & a halfe. His hurte came euyll to passe for the nede that we had of hym that tyme in all thynges / & specyally to the repayres of the brackes. Neuertheles the lorde pryour of saynt Gyles (not ignoruant in all suche thynges) with other men experte in warre intended to ye sayd repayres & trauerses / there & elles where. The enmyes on the other syde nyght and day without rest (for ye grete nombre of labourers that they had hourely and newe redyly) hewed and vndermyned the sayd walle. ¶And the .xx. day of Octobre they put fyre in the vndermynes wenynge to haue cast downe the walle / but they coude not. Than they wolde haue pulled it downe with grete ropes and ancres. But the artyllery of the bulwarke of Auuergne brake theyr ropes & sent thē away lyghtly. ¶At the last they made a myne vnder the sayd wall and bracke. And the .vi. day of the same moneth they dyde put fyre to the same myne / wenynge to haue ouerthrowen the walle / which it dyde not but reysed it and made it to fall almoost streyght vpryght /  which was more dysauauntage to the enmyes than profyte. Than they shot artyllery at it which in fewe dayes was beaten downe / & they had openyuge and way to come in to the towne. Neuerthelesse it was not necessary for them as than to entre. For ye artyllery of our repayres bette them in the fore parce / & the artyllery lyenge at the .ii mylles at the poste of Quosquino / and in that of England / where as was a baselyke that bet ryght vpon the bracke wt other pieces. And therfore the enmyes sought other meanes / & began to reyse the erth betwene our two walles / drawynge towarde Englonde on the one syde / & towarde Auuergne on the other syde / & wolde haue cutte the walle ferder than our trauerses were for to come in vnbeaten of our artyllery. Than were the repayres enlarged & made more with the walle yt was cut / of the heyght of .xii. or .xvi. fote in brede. And so the enmyes myght go no ferder forwarde  /  but shotte grete artyllery agayust our repayres for to breke and cast them downe. And also they made trenches for to come ryght to the bracke / and vnto the repayres. And certaynly we loked daye by day and houre by houre for to haue some assaute. The reuerent lorde grete mayster the whiche as it is sayd had lefte the bulwarke of Englonde the day that the grete assaute was made  /  and syth that tyme heimoeued not fro thens as they hewed the walle / and there as the bracke was / bycause yt they were the moost daungerous and the moost vnquyete places. And cō

               BY the wyll of our lorde the enmyes alway in feare & drede wolde gyue none assaut / but cōtynually shot agaynst our repayres /  & made trenches for to passe forwarde in to the towne. By the whiche trenches they shot infynitly with hacbusshes & handgonnes / and slewe many of our folke / & specyally of them yt wrought & made the repayres yt were broken &

For dayly they were doynge eyther wt assaut or scarmysshe / & moost at ye playne of Italy. Howbeit by the helpe of our lorde wt the good condutynge of the capytayne of socours of the same place the pryour of Nauarre yt was prompt and intent yf / & coude well encourage his men the enmyes had alway the worst / and were dryuen fro ye sayd playne / and fro the bracke of Prouaunce.

And dyuers other thynges the seruaunt sayd of his mayster / of ye whiche I haue spoken parte afore at the begynnynge / & of the warnynge yt he gaue to the grete Turke for to come. ¶But to retorne to the playne of Italy.

And by trenches the enmyes were come ioyninge to ye bracke / and neuer ceased to grate ye erthe & scrape the erthe to cause the repayres & trauerses to fall / And at ye laste the moost parte fell downe / and our men were constrayned to leue the sayd playne / sauf a cantell yt was towarde yt see / as it were the thyrde parte therof. Certayne days afore the enmyes came to the fote of the playne / and dyde cut it / & reysed the erthe / & at the laste they passed thorow vnto the towne walle. & anone began to hewe & cut as they dyde at yt of Spayne.

And there was slayne many good men. And at the last for defaute of more helpe / and of gonshotte it was lefte and gyuē vp of our men /  and so loste. That done the enmyes came thyder as in other places. And this is the thyrde place that they came nere to the fote of y• wall. And who that well consydered in what estate that the poore towne was in that tyme seynge theyr enmyes haue soo grete auauntage /  myght well say and iudge that at lengthe it shulde be takē and a lost towne.
            
            
               ¶How a Geneuey came to the gate of the towne for to speke for a treaty / and delyueraunce of the same.

                  
               
               AFter yt the sayd Iourney was wonne /  a fewe dayes after a chrysten man that was in the campe /  the whiche by his speche was a Geneueys or Cyotis came to the gate of Auuergne  /  and demaunded to speke  /  and after that he was questyoned what he wolde haue /  he sayd that he had meruayle of vs why we wolde not yelde vs  /  seynge the pyteous degre yt the towne was in. And he as a chrysten man coūseyled vs to yelde vs with some agremēt. And that yf we wolde loke therto /  yy some shulde be foūde expedyent to do somwhat for our saufgarde. And it is to beleue that he sayd not suche wordes nor spake so ferforthe in the mater without commyssyon of some of the chyef of the campe  /  or of ye grete Turke hymselfe. To ye whiche Cyotis was answered that he shulde go away with an euyll happe / & that it neded not to speke of a poyntment. And that thoughe the enmyes had grete auauntage  /  yt there was yet ynoughe wherwith to receyue and feest them  /  yf they made ony assaute. These wordes herd he went away. And two dayes after he came agayne and demaunded to speke with a marchaunt Geneueys of the towne named Mathewe de Ura /  and he was answered yt he whiche he demaunded was seke  /  and myght not come  /  but that he shulde delyuer the letter & it shulde be gyuē to hym. The sayd Cyotis sayd nay  / and that he wolde gyue it hymselfe & speke with hym. And sayd yt he had also a letter of ye grete lorde  /  for the lorde mayster. Upon this he was boden to go his way  /  & to further hym to go / they shotte after hȳ a pyece of artylery. The nexte day after Ballātis Albanyty that was fled through ye bracke of Spayne to ye campe came fro the sayd Geneueys proposynge suche wordes or lyke as the other

had sayd / sayenge lykewyse that the grete lorde had sent a letter to ye lorde mayster. To whome no wordes were spoken nor answere made /  for the lorde grete mayster as wyse and prudent consyderynge that a towne that wyll here entreatynges is halfe lost / made to defende vpon the peyne of dethe syth that Cyotis had spoken those two tymes that none shuld be so hardy to speke nor answere to them of ye campe /  without his knowlege and commaundement /  but seynge they were suche embassadoures  /  they reported the wordes of the sayde Albanyty  / or euer ye sayd lorde had knowlege of the wordes of Cyotis. The whiche wordes spredde throughe ye towne put many folke ī thought /  and wolde haue vndone y• that Cyotis sayd. The whiche is no meruayle there as is moche people / for with good wyll & most often they regarded more soner to saue the lyfe of them & theyr chyldrē thā they do to the honour of the resydue. Howbeit not one durst speke a worde openly of that besynesse /  but all secretly. And some came and spake to certayne lordes of ye grete crosse for to speke to ye lorde grete mayster. And in effecte some lordes spake therof to hym / enhortynge hym that it shulde be good to thynke theron / seynge that ye towne went to losse. To whome the sayd lorde shewed many thynges for his honour and the reylgyon. And yt no suche thynges ought to be done nor thought /  for ony thynge in the worlde  /  but rather he and they to dye. The lordes herynge this answere wente theyr wayes  /  and than retourned agayne to the sayd lorde  /  aduysynge hym more to thynke well on all thynges & to the saluacyon of his towne & of his relygyon. And they sayd moreouer yt they doubted yt the people wold rather haue apoyntment than to dye / and theyr wyues and chyldren. The lorde seynge yt suche wordes were as thynges enforced (as who shulde say) yf thou do it not / we shall do it as wyse men and prudent  /  wyllynge to make remedyes of nedefull thynges by coūsell made to cal the lordes of his coūsell for to haue aduyse in these doynges and other. And whā they were assembled /  the lorde proposed the wordes that were to hym denounced / & sayd. With these termes & wordes came two or thre marchauntes & cytezyns of ye towne that knocked at the dore of ye counsell & presented a supplycacyon to ye grete mayster / & lordes of ye counsell /  wherby they requyred and besought mekely ye 
                  
                     •
                  ayd reuerende lorde haue respyte to them and theyr poore housholdes  /  and to make some apoyntment with the grete Turke / seynge that the sayd mater was all redy forwarde in purpose that he wolde do it. And that it wolde please hym to consyder the pyteous & sorowfull estate that the towne was in. And that there was no remedy to saue it. And at the lest way yf the lorde wolde not make a poyntmente to gyue them leue (of his goodnes) to haue theyr wyues & theyr chyldrē out of ye Rodes to saue

them for they wolde not that they were slayne nor made slaues to the enmyes. And the cōclusyon was that yf the sayd lorde wolde not puruey therfore / they wolde puruey for it themselfe. And there was wryten in the sayd request the names of eyghte or ten of the rychest of the towne (whiche wordes of the sayd supplycacyon herde) the sayd lorde and his counsell were abasshed and euyll content as reason wolde / seynge that it was but a course game /  and thought on many thynges to make answere to ye sayd cytezyns / for to content and appease them And also to se yf they shulde intende to the apoyntment  /  as they requyred  /  and after as the Geneuoy hadde reported. And the better to make the sayd answere / and to knowe more playnly in what degre ye towne was in all thynges. That is to wyte / fyrst of powders / & than of men of warre / and of the katteryes. Also were interroged and questyoned the lorde of saynt Gyles Pre Iohan whiche had the charge of the powders  /  and than the capytayne syr Gabryell Martynyngo for beynge ouer theyr men of warre (as it is sayd) as to hym yt knewe the truthe yf the towne myght holde or not  /  or there were expedyent to saue it. The sayd lorde of saynt Gyles arose sayenge & affyrmynge vpon his honour and his conscyence that almost all the slaues and labourers were deed and hurte. And yt scantly there was folke 
                     •
                  nowe to remoeue a pyece of artilery fro one place to an other /  & that it was vnpossyble without folke ony more to make or set vp the repayres the whiche euery day were broken and crusshed by the grete  /  furyous  /  and cōtynuall shotte of the enmyes artylery. As for powders ye sayde lorde sayde  /  that all that was for store in the towne was spent longe agone. And of that  /  that was newly brought was not to serue & furnysshe two assautes. And he seynge the grete auauntage of the enmyes beȳge so ferre within the towne without power to put or chase them awaye for defaute of men was of the opynyon that the towne wolde be loste / and that there was no meanes to saue it. The wordes of the sayde lorde fynysshed  /  the capytayne Gabryell Martynyngo for his dyscharge sayd and declared to the reuerende lorde and them of the counsell  /  that seynge and consyderynge the grete betynges of shotte that the towne hadde suffered  /  and after seynge the entrynge that the enmyes had so large  /  and that they were within the towne by theyr trenches bothe endelonge and ouerthwarte. Seynge alsoo that in two other places they were at the fote of the wall  /  and that ye moste parte of our knyghtes and mē of warre and other were slayne and hurte / and the powders wasted  /  & that it was vnpossyble for thē to resyste theyr enmyes ony more  /  that withoute doubte the towne was lost yf there came no socoures for to helpe and resyste the syege. The whiche opynyons and reasones of these two worthy men and

expert in suche feates vnderstanden & pōdred by the lorde grete mayster and the lordes of the councell / they were moost parte aduysed for to accept and take treaty yf it were offred / for the saufgarde of the comyn people / and of the holy relykes of the chyrche  /  as parte of ye holy crosse / the holy thorne / the hande of saynt Iohan and parte of his heed / and dyuers other holy relykes. Hobeit the lorde grete mayster to whome the besynesse belonged very nere / and that toke it most heuyly 
                     •
                  and was more sorowful than ony of the other as reason requyred was alway stedfast in his fyrst purpose / rather wyllynge to dye than to consent to suche a thynge  /  and sayd agayne to the lordes of ye councell. Aduyse you and thynke well on euery thinge / and of ye ende that may happen / and he preposed to theym .ii. poyntes. That is to wyte. whyder is it better for vs to dye all / or to saue the people & the holy relykes. The whiche .ii. poyntes and doubtes were longe time dysputed / and there was dyuers opynyons. Neuerthelesse at ye last they sayd all yt howbeit that it were well and saufly done to dye for the faythe and moost of honour for vs. Notwithstandynge seen and consydered yt there is no remedy to resyste agaynst our enmyes  / nor meanes to saue the towne. And on the other parte that ye grete Turke wolde not oppresse vs to forsake our faythe / but onely wolde haue the towne / it were moche better than and soūdynge to greter welth to saue all the iewelles abouesayd that sholde be defoyled and lost yf they came in the handes of the enmyes of the faythe. And also to kepe so moche small people as women and chyldren yt they wolde tourment and cut some in pyeces / other take and parforced to cause them to forsake theyr faythe / with innumerable vyolences and shamefull synnes that sholde be commytted and doone yf the towne were put to blode as was doone at Modon / and lately at Bellegrado. wherby they dyde conclude that it were better and more agreable to god for to take the treaty yf it were proffered than for to dye as people desperate and without hope.
            
            
               ¶How the grete turke sent two of his men to the towne to haue it by entreatynge. And how the lorde grete mayster sent two knyghtes to hym to knowe his assuraunce.

                  
               
               VPon these termynacyons & wordes the dyuynite yt saueth them trustynge in hym / and yt wolde not that so many euylles & crueltees sholde come to ye poore cyte & inhabytauntes of it. And also yt the grete turke arise not in ouer grete pryde & vaynglory  / put him in wyll to seke to haue ye sayd towne by treaty whiche he ought not to haue done for his honour / nor by reason / for ye towne in a maner was his. And in lykewyse he ought not to haue leten vs go as he dyde / seynge yt we were his mortall enmyes euer / & shall be styll in the tyme comynge / consyderinge the grete slaughter of his people yt we haue made in this syege. Howbeit ye eternall goodnesse hath blynded hym / & hath pleased that these thynges sholde be thus  / for some cause vnknowen of vs. And for conclusyon y• grete turke sent to haue a comunycacion & spekynge togyder / in folowynge ye wordes of the Geneuey aforesayd. Than was a signe set vpon ye chirche des le Monistres wtout the towne. to the whiche was made answere with another at the mylles of Quosquino. And forthwith came .ii. turkes for to speke wt them of the towne. Than the lorde grete mayster sent the pryour of saynt Gyles pre Iohn̄ / and ye capytayne Gabryell martiningo to knowe ye cause of theyr comynge. And whā they came to them without holdynge of longe purpose the two turkes delyuered them a lettre for to bere to the lorde grete mayster fro the grete turke / and than retourned surely in to theyr tentes. whan

the two lordes had receyued it they bare and presented it to the reuerent lorde grete mayster whiche caused it to be redde. By the which the grete turke demauned of the lorde grete mayster to yelde ye towne to hym / and in so doynge he was content to lete hym goo & all his knyghtes / & all the other people of what condycyon so euer they were / wt all theyr goodes and iewels sauf  / without to haue feare of ony harme or dyspleasure of his folkes. And also he sware and promysed on his fayth so to doo. The sayd lettre was sealed with his sygnet yt he vseth / that is as it were gylted. And he sayd afterwarde yt yf the lorde grete mayster wolde not accepte the sayd treaty / that none of ye cyte of what estate so euer he were sholde thynke to escape  /  but that they all vnto the cattes sholde passe by the edge of the swerde / & that they sholde sēde hym an answere forthwith / eyther ye / or nay. After the syght of the contentes of the sayd lettre of so grete weyght / & the tyme so shorte for to gyue so grete an answere & with demaunde / the sayd lorde grete mayster and al the lordes of the councell were in grete thought. howbeit they were delybered to gyue answere. Seyng the ordynaunce of the towne so yll yt it coude be no wors. Herynge y• reporte and oppynyons a day or two before of the .ii. lordes ordeyned vpon ye effectes of the towne / sayenge yt the towne was lost without remedy. Consyderynge also yt the pryncypalles of the towne wolde haue appoyntement. And in lykewyse at the other councell all ye lordes had all redy wylled and declared yt it were better to saue ye towfor respect of the poore people / than to put it all hole to the furour of ye enmyes. where vpon they agreed and concluded to take the foresayd treaty. After the conclusyon taken
                     •
                   answere was made redyly for a good respecte. That it to wyte to take the Turke at his worde to the ende yt he sholde not repent hym of it nor chaunge his oppynion. For euery houre his people wanne and entred ferder and ferder in to the towne. And for to go vnto the grete Turke was ordeyned these two knyghtes / syr Passyn afore named /  and he bare the token of ye whyte crosse. And another of the towne named Robert de Perrutis iuge ordynary. ¶whan these two ambassadours had made them redy they went oute at the gate of Quosquino and went to the tent of Acmek bacha capytayne generall. And bycause it was late / and yt they myght not go that day to the grete Turke / on the next day in ye mornynge the foresayd capytayne Acmek ledde and conueyed our sayd ambassadours to the grete Turkes pauyllyon / that they myght haue knowlege more playnly  / and for to here his wyll as touchynge ye wordes the whiche were reported to ye reuerent lorde grete mayster and after the cōtentes of his lettre and wrytynges. ¶whan ye sayd two ambassadours were departed out of the towne there dide entre

two men of auctoryte of the campe. One was neuew or kynnesman of the sayd Acmek. the other was the grete turkes trucheman / whiche the lorde mayster caused to be well receyued / & they were lodged nygh the sayd gate of Quosquino. And than trewes was taken for iii. dayes. and the enmyes came to our repayres and spake with our folke and dranke one with another.
            
            
               ¶How the ambassadours of Rodes spake with the grete turke / and what answere they had.

               
               WHan our ambassadours had made reuerence to ye grete Turke / they sayd that ye lorde grete mayster of Rodes had sent thē to his imperyall mageste to knowe what he maunded / & demaunded as to haue spekynge togyder / & how the grete mayster had receyued his lettre. The grete Turke made to answere them by his trucheman / yt of demaundynge to speke togyder / nor wrytynge of lettre to ye grete mayster he knewe nothynge. Howbeit syth the grete mayster had sent to hym for to knowe his wyll / he bade say to them that the grete mayster sholde yelde hym ye towne. And in so doynge he promysed by his faythe for to lete hym go with all his knyghtes / & all other yt wolde go with theyr goodes / without to haue ony dyspleasure of his people of the campe. And yf he accepted not y• sayd treaty to notyfy hym that he wolde neuer departe fro before Rodes tyll he had taken it / &

that all his myght of Turk y• sholde dye there but yf he had it / and yt there sholde neyther grete nor lytell escape / but vnto the cattes they sholde be all put in pyeces. And sayd yt within .iii. dayes they sholde gyue hym an answere. For he wolde not that his people sholde lese tyme. And yt durynge the sayd trewes they shold make no repayres nor defences wtin the towne. ¶whan the grete lorde had ended his wordes our ambassadours toke theyr leue of hym / and retorned to ye towne / & there was gyuen to eche of them a ryche garment of braū
                  ched veluet with clothe of golde of ye turkysshe facyon. Than Acmek bacha toke syr Pessyn / & ledde hym to his pauyllyon / and intreatynge hym ryght well caused hym to abyde al yt day and nyght. And in eatynge & drynkynge they had many purposes of thynges done at the syege / questyonynge eche other. And amonge all other thynges our ābassadour demaunded of Acmek / & prayed hym to tel for trouth how many men dyed of the cāpe syth ye syege was layde. The sayd bacha sware vpon his faythe and certyfyed yt there was deed of the campe of vyolent dethe / that is to say of gonshot and other wayes. lxiiii.M. men or mo / besyde them that dyed of sekenesse whiche were about .xl. or .l. thousande.
            
            
               ¶How one of the ambassadours made āswere of his message And how the comyns wolde not agre to yelde the towne.
               REtorne we now to our purpose & to the answere yt our ambassadours brought to ye lorde grete mayster. The sayd Robert Perruse made the answere & tolde what the grete turke had sayd / certyfyēge yt he wolde haue an answere lyghtly eyther ye or nay. The whiche answere after the demaū
                  de of the grete turke hath ben purposed and concluded by ye hole councell and his offre & treaty accepted / howbeit the sayd ambassadours had it not to do so soone nor the fyrst tyme that they went for good reasons / but yet they wolde not dyfferre it for feare that he sholde repēt hym. And vpon these termynacyōs yt they wolde haue sent the sayd Peruse to bere the answere came some of the comyn people of ye towne to the lorde grete mayster yt was with the lordes of the councell /  and sayd yt they were aduertysed of the apoyntemēt that he had made with the grete turke / and yt he wolde yelde the towne wt couenaū
                  tes by hym taken / whiche they semed ought not to be done wout callinge of them. And bycause they were not called to it they sayd yt they wolde not agre therto. And yt it were better for them to dye / for y• grete turke by some way wolde put them all to dethe / as was doone in Bellegrado in Hungry.
            
            
               
               ¶How the lorde grete mayster sent two ambassadours for the comyns to the grete Turke.
               WHan the reuerent lorde grete mayster had herde theyr wordes he sayd gracyously to them yt as touchinge to haue accept the grete turkes offre it was of force so to do in the degre yt the towne was. and the causes wherfore he had doone it the councell had seen & dyscussed / & yt it was a thynge that myght not  /  nor ought not to be sayd nor publysshed in comyn for reportynge of it to ye enmyes by traytours / but be kept styll & secrete. And moreouer yt it was concluded to make an answere shortly / for to take the grete turke at his worde lest he repē
                  ted him. For yf they had ben called or ye answere had be gyuen it had ben ouer longe besynesse / & in the meane tyme the turke myght haue chaunged his mynde / & that ye he had doone and concluded with the grete turke the lordes of the councell had wel regarded & consydered in all thynges  / & for theyr prouffyte and auauntage as moche or more as for yt of the relygion. And yt they wolde sende to the grete Turke agayne other ambassadours the better to knowe his wyll and to be surer of his promysse. Than ye lorde grete mayster ordeyned .ii. other ambassadours for to go to ye grete turke / whiche where .ii. Spanyardes / ye one named syr Raymon market / & the other messire Loup  /  at whose yssuenge entred syr Passyn ye fyrst ambassadour / & the other .ii went to ye tent of Acmek bacha for to lede them to ye grete turke. And whan they were wtin the turkes pauyllyon / & had done hym reuerē
                  ce as apperteyned our ambassadours sayd yt the grete mayster had herde & seen his demaunde to yelde ye towne. And for yt it is a thynge of grete weyght and yt he had to do & say wt many men of dyuers nacyons / & bycause the tyme of answere was so shorte he myght not do yt / yt he demaunded so soone. Howbeit he wolde speke wt his people / & than he wolde gyue hym an answere.
            
            
               ¶How the turke began the assaut / and how the comyns agreed to yelde the towne.
               WHan the grete turke herde the answere of our ambassadours / he sayd nothinge but cōmaunded his bachas yt they sholde begyn the batayle agayne to the towne /  yt whiche was doone. And than the trewes was broken and the shot of the enmyes was sharper than it was afore. And on the other syde nothynge or veray lytell for faute of powdre. For that / that there was left / was kept for some grete assaute or

nede. Howbeit the sayd Acmek Bacha kepte one of the embassadours and messyre Loup onely entred. The grete mayster seynge the warre begonne  /  and the shotte thycker than it was afore  /  and the enmyes entre hourely by theyr trenches ferder into the towne  /  made to call them that tofore had sayd to hym that they wolde not ye towne sholde be yelded / but had leuer for to deye. And therfore the sayd lorde sayd that he was content for to deye with them  /  and that they shulde dyspose them to defende themselfe well  /  or to do theyr deuour better thā they had done in tyme past. And to the ende yt eche one of them shulde haue knowlege of his wyll (for as than he spake but to foure or fyue of them that gaynsayd hym). He made a cry thrughe all the towne yt all they that were holden to be at the postes or gates shulde gyue attendaunce / and not to come away daye nor nyght on payne of dethe. For afore the Rodyens came but lytell there. And that the othet that were not of ye postes / or that were of his socours / shulde go to ye bracke of Spayne where the sayd lorde was contynually  /  & not to go away day nor nyght on the aboue sayd payne. The sayd crye made eche one were obedyente for a daye or twayne  /  howbeit a yonge Rodyen lefte his poste and wente to his house / whiche on ye nexte day was hanged for brekynge of the lordes commaundement. Not withstādynge that by lytell and lytell the people anoyed them and theyr hertes fayled / & lefte the postes and brackes  /  in suche wyse that the enmyes myght come in without to fynde grete resystence  /  but of a fewe that ye lorde mayster caused to abyde there (yt is to wyte) knyghtes of his socours And in the nyght made to serche mo people for to kepe the watche at the sayd bracke / and payed to them asmoche as they wolde. The sayd lorde seynge hym thus abandoned and lefte of his people /  he made to aske them agayne wherfore they dyd not theyr deuour  /  & why they came not to deye / as they sayde before. whiche made answere yt they sawe and knewe well that the towne was lost for certayne reasones yt was tolde thē / by occasyon wherof they had gaynsayde ye ordynaunce of the sayd lorde / & sayd that they had be wronge enformed of dyuers thynges. And on the other syde that they fered that ye Turke wolde not holde his worde. But syth they sawe that there was none other remedy but to abyde the aduenture & fortune /  they sayde that they put all to the sayd lorde to do that he semed good  /  and y• he wolde se what were best for them. And requyred the lorde to do them somoche grace as to let them chose one or two amonge thē for to go to ye grete Turke with his ambassadours for to haue surety of hym. The whiche was graunted  /  and two ordynary ambassadours were chosen for them /  one Nycholas Uergoty / and the other Piero of saynt Cretyce /  and ye foresayd Passyn shulde returne with them for to make the sayde answere.

Than the grete mayster or they departed (prolongynge the tyme as in moche as he myght) aduysed to sende a letter to the grete Turke / the whiche his grauntfader had wryten or caused to be wryten. In the whiche letter he gaue his malediction or curse to his chyldren & successours / yf they interprysed to besyege Rodes. The sayde Robert Perruce bare the sayde letter. And as he was acustomed /  he went to Acmek Bacha for to cause hym to haue audyence / & presente the sayd letter. And Bacha sayd he wolde se ye letter. For it is ye guyse in the grete Turkes courte that none may speke to hym nor gyue hȳ letter / but he be aduertysed fyrst / what shall be sayd or what shall be wryten. whan ye Bachas had sene the wordes wryten in the sayd letter /  he brake it and kest it on the grounde / & dyd trede vpon it /  saynge many iniuryous and velanous wordes to the sayd Iuge. And badde hym to retourne fast to his grete mayster /  and bydde hym to thynke on his besynesse / and to make answere to the grete lorde (as he hadde sent & commaūded) or els it shulde not be longe or he sawe his dolorous and wofull ende. And that same day were taken two men of oures that bare erthe towarde the bulwarke of Englande. Of whome the sayd Acmek caused an offycer to cutte of theyr noses / fyngers & eeres and gaue them a letter to bere to ye lorde grete mayster. wherin was grete wordes and thretenynges. After the sayd Perruce was returned / messyre Passyn was sent agayne to the sayd Bacha  /  for to wyte of hym yf the grete Turke wolde be content with ony somme of money for his costes and expences / that he had made for his army. The whiche answered that suche wordes nor offres of syluer was not to be sayd nor presented to the grete lorde  /  on payne of lyfe  /  and that he set more by honour than by syluer. And therfore he bade hym returne and say to the grete mayster that he make answere to the grete lorde after his demaunde to yelde or not yelde the towne. The sayd Passyn made relacyon of ye wordes of Bacha to ye grete mayster. The whiche for the grete sorowe that he had (dyfferred alwayes) sawe hymselfe in suche pyteous estate. Notwithstandynge the sayd lorde puttynge all to the wyll of our lorde / and consyderynge that there was no remedy to do otherwyse / nor to resyst ony more his enmyes / and beyng cō
                  strayned on all sydes to make the apoyntment / with grete heuynes /  inestymable dolours and bewaylȳges  /  at the laste gaue his voyce to yelde the towne (with the treatys or offres to hym presented) which was the .xx. day of December / the yere of our lorde a thousande fyue hundreth and two and twenty.
            
            
               ¶An abiection to suche as wyll make questyon for the losse & delyueraūce of the cytee of Rodes.
               
                  ANd yf by ony it were obiect wherfore the sayd lorde grete mayster hathe yelded ye towne to the grete Turke / demaū
                  dynge it wt treaty & couenaūtes / whiche was a sygne that he feared & wolde no more fyght / but go his way. To this I answere. Notwithstandynge y• the grete Turke was aduertysed by some treatours / & by other y• fledde to ye campe / that y• powders almoost fayled / & that there was but fewe mē of warre wtin the towne / yet he beleued not nor gaue credence of all yt was reported to hym / but thought verely yt we had ynough for a grete whyle. And consydered y• he must tary tyll they were wasted & spent  /  wherto behoued tyme. And seynge all his estate entred in straunge places /  and in landes of his enmyes / & had ben there all redy .vi. monethes (& not without grete daunger of his owne persone). Thynkynge on ye other syde / yt takynge ye towne by assaute he shulde lose many of his folke. And yet whan he had ouercome & wonne the towne  /  they shulde fall eche vpon other in departynge of the buty or pyllage  /  doubtynge fynably the hasarde of warre. For these reasones and other yt may be alleged / the grete Turke had moche leuer to haue ye towne by composytion & treaty than otherwyse. And it suffysed hym to dryue his olde enmyes out of ye countrees of leuant / & set y• subiectes of his coūtrees in rest and surety. And we of the towne yt knewe our weykenesse  /  and that we myght no more / it semed better to saue somoche small people than we and they to fall in the woodnes of our enmyes / for otherwyse coude we not haue done / but tempte god and deyed as in dyspayre.

               BUt to returne to our pryncypall. After that the reuerende grete mayster had gyuen his voyce to the yeldynge of the towne / he sent the sayde Passyn agayne for to bere it to the grete Turke. And with hym went the two men that were chosen of the comyns. And they wente all thre togyder to ye tent of Acmek Bacha. To whome the sayde Passyn fyrs
                     •
                  e made this pyteous answere and conclusyon to yelde the towne. Notwithstandynge he sayd the people had ordeyned two men amonge them for to go to the grete Turke /  to speke of theyr partyculer doynges  /  and to haue some suerty of theyr persones / wyues / and chyldren / to the ende that it were not done to them  /  as of those of Bellegrado. The sayde Acmek ledde the thre ambassadours towarde the grete Turke. And whan they were entred in the pauylyon  /  the sayde messyre Passyn made the report of his ambassade to the sayde lorde / & sayde that the

grete mayster yelded hym the towne vnder the promes made of his imperyall mageste with ye treaty promysed. Of the whiche promyse he helde hym sure and certayne  /  and that he wolde not do it at lesse. Howbeit the people had requyred hym to gyue them lycence to go to his maieste / for to aske some request of hym. Than the two cytezyns besought ye grete Turke that he wolde for surety remoeue his campe fro the towne / to the ende that they shulde haue no lettynge nor hurte of theyr bodyes nor goodes / and that they that wolde go shulde go /  & that they that wolde abyde styll myght be well treated. The grete Turke made it to be to sayd by his truchemā to messyre Passyn that he accepted the towne /  and promysed agayne vpon his fayth and on his honour to the lorde grete mayster that he wolde kepe hym that he had promysed / and sent to hym by the same Passyn that he shulde not doubte of the contrary. And yf he had not shyppes ynow for to cary his people & theyr goodes that he wolde let them haue of his /  and that he wolde cause to delyuer the artylery that was wont to be in ye shyppes of relygyon. And as touchynge to the request of the people /  he sayd that he wolde remoeue the campe. And that they that wolde abyde / let them abyde and they shulde be well treated /  & shulde paye no try bute in fyue yeres / and theyr chyldren shulde not be touched / & who that wolde go within the sayd space of fyue yeres / let them go in good tyme. These wordes ended our ambassadours toke leue of hym And whan they were yssued  /  they spake agayne with ye sayd Acmek Bacha for to haue a letter of the contentes of the promyse of the sayde lorde. And by his commaundement the sayd letter was made / wherby he promysed to lette go the grete mayster with all his knyghtes /  straūgers and men of the towne that wolde go with theyr goodes wt
                  out to haue dyspleasure of ony of his people of the campe  /  or by the wayes. whan ye letter was made it was delyuered to messyre Passyn. And as towchynge to withdrawe the campe the sayd Bacha promysed agayne that he wolde do it / syth the grete lorde wolde so. Howbeit he remoeued but fro the trenches /  and some of his people wente a lytell way of. And the sayd Bacha demaunded in the Turkes behalfe that they shulde sende to hym in hostage foure & twenty knyghtes / wherof two shulde be of the grete crosse  /  and two and twenty cytezyns. And the sayd lorde shulde sende onely a cap

                  tayne with thre or foure hundreth Genyssaires for to kepe the towne whan ye campe were withdrawen. And so it was doone  /  and besyde this he gaue a xxi. dayes of respyte to the lorde grete mayster  / to prepare hym and departe out of Rodes. And in conclusyon 
                     〈◊〉
                   this done / our ambassadours returned and made the reporte to the reuerēde grete mayster of all that he had done and practysed with the grete Turke & the sayd

bacha / & gaue hym ye lettre for to go surely. Than ye grete mayster wt his tounceyll ordeyned ye .xxiiii. persones / & other of ye towne. whan they were redy they went to ye campe / where they were wel intreated .iiii. dayes. Durynge this tyme Ferra bacha passed ye mayne londe to the campe wt .xxiiii. or .xxv.M genyssaires / whiche by ye cōmaū
                  dement of ye grete Turke was gone vpon ye bordres of the coūtrees of Sophy. For the turke seynge ye people of ye campe dyscourage & wolde no more go to ye assautes sent to ye sayd bachas to come to Rodes wt his people / whiche wtstode sore wt theyr bodyes as fresshe men. And it was worke of god & euident myracle yt they came after yt the appoyntement was made. For yf they had comen afore it is to suppose yt ye dede had gone otherwyse / & there had ben many strokes gyuen / but I beleue yt the ende sholde haue ben piteous for vs / but god wold not yt the turke shol

And on ye other parte it may be sayd & meruayled how it is possyble alway to haue ouercome our enmyes in all assautes & scarmysshes / & at the ende to lese ye towne / preferrynge the wyll of god yt so hath pleased for some cause to vs vnknowen. It is to beleue ye lacke of men & gonshot / & the enmyes soo ferre wtin the towne / & redy to entre at other places with ye treasons hath caused ye towne to be lost. Two or .iii. dayes after the comynge of the sayd bacha his genissayres & other of the campe entred in to y• towne whiche was on Crystmas day / wtin y• tyme gyuen to vs / & than the turkes worde was broken  /  yf it were his wyll or not I can not tell. Neuerthelesse there was noo swerde drawen /  & in yt promysse was kept. But they made pyllage / & entred by force in to ye houses of ye castell / & toke all yt they myght and wolde. After yt they had ransaked ye houses they entred in to the chyrches / & pylled all yt they foūde  /  and brake ye ymages. And there was no crucyfyx / nor fygure of our lady nor of other sayntes yt abode hole. Than wt a grete inhumanyte they went in to ye hospytall of poore & seke fo

                  e called ye fermory / & toke all the syluer vessel yt seke folke were serued wt / & reysed them out of theyr beddes & droue them awaye / some wt grete strokes of staues / & some were cast doune fro ye galeryes. whan these hoūdes had done ye acte they went to ye chyrche of saynt Iohn̄ & toke doune tōbes of the grete maysters / & sought yf there were ony treasour wt them / & they forced certayne women & maydens. And all they yt were cristned & had ben turkes afore / were they men / women or chyldren / & chyldren that ye sayd men had made crysten they led in to turky / whiche is greter importaūce than ony of the other. The morowe after Crystmas daye ye reuerent lorde grete mayster went to the grete turkes pauyllyon for

to vysyte hym / & to be better assured of his promysse. the whiche lorde he made to be well and gracyously receyued. And caused to say to hym by his trucheman that the case so happened to hȳ was a thynge vsuall and comyn / as to lese townes and lordshippes / and that he sholde not take ouer moche thonght for it. And as for his promysse he bade that he sholde not doubt in ony thynge. And that he sholde not feare ony dyspleasure to his persone  /  and that he sholde go with his people without feare. With these wordes ye sayd lorde thanked hym and toke his leue and departed.
