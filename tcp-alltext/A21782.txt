            TO THE TRVLY HONORABLE AND RIGHT WORTHY KNIGHT SIR THOMAS SMITH, Gouernour of the East-India, Muscouia, Northwest Passages, SOMMER Ilands Companies, and Treasurer for the first Colonie in Virginia: AVGVSTINE SPAVLDING wisheth all happinesse, and encrease of honour.
            
               HOnourable Sir, the world hath iust occasion to take knowledge of your continuall trauels, cares and endeuours for the good of those sundry Companies, wherof by publike assent you haue been chosen Gouernour. Your erecting of the Lecture of Nauigation at your owne expences, for the better instruction of our Mariners in that most needfull art: your setting downe of better orders in dispatching forth of our East-Indian fleetes: your employment with extraordinarie entertainment of skilfull Mathematicians and Geographers in the South and North parts of the world: This your prouidence and liberalitie is like, in time to come, to worke many speciall good effects. Lastly, you haue caused these Dialogues of the languages of the Isle of Madagascar and of the Malaian
               
tongues, presented vnto you by Master Richard Hackluyt, a singular furtherer of all new discoueries and honest trades, to be set forth in our English tongue: because of the speciall vse and benefit which your Factors and seruants, residing in all the Southeast Islands of the world, may reape thereby. And that nothing might be omitted on your behalfe, it hath pleased you further to aske mine opinion, and to enioyne me to take speciall care for the correction of such errors as were committed in the first edition, because of my eleuen or twelue yeeres employment in those Countries, as seruant and Factor for your Worship and the Companie: which your commandement I haue performed in the best sort I can. If this my small seruice be accepted in good part, I hope hereafter to giue your Worship a true relation, as leasure and opportunitie shall permit, of the chiefe things, which I haue obserued and performed in the time of my continuance in your seruice, in those remote parts of the world. And in the meane season I shall not cease to pray to the Almightie for the long prosperitie of your selfe, and all the Worshipfull and worthie Companie.
            
               Your seruant alwaies to be commanded, Augustine Spaulding.
               
            
         
      
      
         
            
            DIALOGVES IN THE ENGLISH AND MAlaian Languages.
            
               English. A DIALOGVE OF THE COMMING of a certaine ship, to wit, how the Master thereof appeared before the King and what was done there besides, written after the Indian manner, with seuen persons, whose names are, Dauid, Abraham, a Messenger, the Porter, the King, a Woman, and the Master of the ship.
               
                  D.
                  GOd saue you Abraham.
               
               
                  A.
                  And you Dauid.
               
               
                  D.
                  Whence come you so earlie?
               
               
                  A.
                  Out of the market place.
               
               
                  D.
                  What newes? haue you heard nothing of the comming of any ship?
               
               
                  A.
                  I heard the thundering of Ordnance, which is a signe of ships comming.
               
               
                  D.
                  And I heard that a shippe was come from Guiserat.
               
               
                  
                  A.
                  But what Marchandizes doth she bring?
               
               
                  D.
                  She is laden with rice, almonds, and raysons, she bringeth also many cloathes of all sortes, and very much bombace.
               
               
                  A.
                  Is this so? surely this news is very much desired.
               
               
                  D.
                  I heard it so affirmed for a truth.
               
               
                  A.
                  If therefore God assent, cloathes and other Merchandizes will be easilie gotten.
               
               
                  D.
                  Yea (God willing) this will be profitable for many poore men, who goe ill apparrelled, seeing cloathes haue been a long time of great price.
               
               
                  A.
                  This is true, because rice also, aswell winnowed, as not winnowed, and other meates, as flesh, fish, and other victuals.
               
               
                  D.
                  We now hope better, for it is time, that the shippes come from Bengala, Noselipatan, and other places, all which bring cloathes, and winnowed rice.
               
               
                  A.
                  What is he who commeth thence, carried vpon a mightie Elephant, and guarded with so many men accompanying him?
               
               
                  D.
                  That is Sabandar with the Secretarie.
               
               
                  A.
                  I see also strange men sitting vpon him, who are they I pray you?
               
               
                  D.
                  It is the Guiserat Captaine who came lately with his shippe,

and is now to bee brought vnto the King.
               
               
                  A.
                  What meaneth it, I pray you, that a certaine Elephant goeth couered with red cloath, before which drumsters and trumpeters goe?
               
               
                  D.
                  The Elephant which you see, and the man who sitteth in the little house set vpon him, are a token, that they bring their Kings letters vnto our King.
               
               
                  A.
                  But who hath those letters?
               
               
                  D.
                  That man who sitteth vpon the Elephant.
               
               
                  A.
                  Who is it that sitteth vpon him?
               
               
                  D.
                  It is one of the Kings Nobility, chosen by him for this purpose.
               
               
                  A.
                  But to what end are these things?
               
               
                  D.
                  For the honor of the King from whence the letters are brought.
               
               
                  A.
                  But what is it, that I see so many men and young striplings follow him, euery one whereof carrieth somewhat in his hands fairely couered with a coloured cloath?
               
               
                  D.
                  They are presents, which the master must giue vnto the King.
               
               
                  A.
                  Doth hee present them in stead of a tribute for his goods, or is hee compelled to pay more in stead of custome?
               
               
                  
                  D.
                  No. seuen for an hundred are paid in stead of custome.
               
               
                  A.
                  What honour doth the King giue these men againe?
               
               
                  D.
                  When they are come in, hee honourablie entertaineth them.
               
               
                  A.
                  What therefore is done?
               
               
                  D.
                  They eate and drink, and al kind of delicates and fruits are set before them, they play, dance, and al manner of pleasures are exercised, they sound the Trumpets, Cornets and other Pipes, and strike vp the Drummes: And further, the King causeth a garment, made after the manner of that place, to be brought, and giueth it to the Master.
               
               
                  A.
                  Is this the manner of this Countrie?
               
               
                  D.
                  I, this is the manner with this King, and hath bin also with others.
               
               
                  A.
                  Doth the King any more?
               
               
                  D.
                  No: for when these things are done, the King causeth them to be brought home againe with the Elephant.
               
               
                  A.
                  I would desire to see al these things.
               
               
                  D.
                  Goe too therefore let vs follow them.
               
               
                  A.
                  Are they not already entered? we haue staied heere a long time.
               
               
                  D.
                  They are not, for they cannot enter into the gate, vnlesse a

ken be first giuen from the King.
               
               
                  A.
                  Come therefore, Is it so? let vs goe quickly.
               
               
                  D.
                  Doe you see? They all stand yet at the gates.
               
               
                  A.
                  It is true, but who is hee that commeth forth, holding a gilded knife in his hand?
               
               
                  D.
                  Hee is the Kings messenger.
               
               
                  A.
                  Whither must he go with the knife?
               
               
                  D.
                  He commeth to bring in the Captaine.
               
               
                  A.
                  How is that knife called? is it not called by another name?
               
               
                  D.
                  Yes, for it is called Si'ap, which is as much as if you would say, a token from the King.
               
               
                  A.
                  Vnto whom hath hee any commandement?
               
               
                  D.
                  Vnto the Master of the gates.
               
               
                  A.
                  I see that he deliuereth the Si'ap to him.
               
               
                  D.
                  It is true, but come, let vs heare what he will say.
               
               The Messenger, who carrieth the Si'ap, speaketh vnto the Porter.
               
                  M.
                  Ho, where are you Porter?
               
               
                  P.
                  I am here, what will you with me?
               
               
                  M.
                  Receiue a commandement

from our Lord.
               
               
                  P.
                  I will heare, God willing.
               
               
                  M.
                  The Kings, commandement (and if it please God) is, that you let the Captaine in with his people.
               
               
                  P.
                  In the name of the Lord, praise be to our King.
               
               The Messenger speaketh vnto the King.
               
                  M.
                  Let your Maiestie know that the Captaine is present here at the gate.
               
               
                  K.
                  It is well, he shall presently be let in, but goe you, and call forth the woman first.
               
               
                  W.
                  What doth your Maiesty desire?
               
               
                  K.
                  Are all things ready for the receiuing, and well intertaining of strange guests?
               
               
                  W.
                  My Lord King, all things are prepared. For first, wee haue hung vp that blew silken cloath garnished with gold, ouer head, in stead of a canopy or couering, and haue couered all the pillars with silke. Furthermore, ouer the Kings Maiesties head wee haue hung vp that red veluet cloath leafed with gold, and for the strange guests, that greene veluet cloath intermingled with the Rhinoceros and Tigers of gold. The women that shal daunce we haue attired with red and greene

silken apparrell, hanged golden chaines about their necks, put tablets to their breasts, garnished with precious stones, gold rings on their fingers glittering with Carbuncles and Diamondes, and haue put golden bracelets vpon their armes and leggs.
               
               
                  K.
                  It is well, see that al things be so prepared, that I bee not disgraced.
               
               
                  W.
                  By Gods helpe all things shall be well and carefully prouided.
               
               
                  K.
                  Let in the Captaine.
               
               
                  M.
                  Behold, the King is at hand.
               
               
                  K.
                  Call the Interpreter to me, that I may speake with the Captaine.
               
               
                  M.
                  Hee himselfe vnderstandeth the Malaian language very well.
               
               
                  K.
                  Is it so? what, hath he bin here before?
               
               
                  M.
                  Yea King, for it is Captaine Salomon, who was heere two yeres since, brought hither from Mecha with two ships.
               
               
                  K.
                  Lay downe that vestment, and spread a mat made of taffetie for him, that the Captain may sit thereon.
               
               
                  C.

               THE SECOND DIALOGVE FOR THE BVYing of victuals and diuers prouision, when you come to a strange countrey. And the persons talking together are a certaine Germane, an Indian, and a King.
               
                  G.
                  GOd saue you my Lord.
               
               
                  I.
                  God saue you also.
               
               
                  G.
                  Pardon me my Lord, that I speake vnto you.
               
               
                  I.
                  What will you haue with me? let me heare.
               
               
                  G.
                  Doth not my Lord know, whether certaine soraine shippes were lately heere, which came from strange countries?
               
               
                  I.
                  Yea, three ships were here, but they are againe departed.
               
               
                  G.
                  Is it long since they departed from hence?
               
               
                  I.
                  No, three weekes since.
               
               
                  G.
                  But what did they here?
               
               
                  I.
                  Nothing but prouided themselues of victuals, buying Oranges, Lymons, Bananas, Honey,

Rice, Oxen, Buffalas, Goates and Sheepe.
               
               
                  G.
                  How long staied they here?
               
               
                  I.
                  About twentie daies, for they had many sicke men, whom they brought into certaine houses.
               
               
                  G.
                  Are there many of them dead?
               
               
                  I.
                  Six, as farre as we know, for many of them recouered health againe.
               
               
                  G.
                  Did they also take fresh water?
               
               
                  I.
                  Yea, out of a certaine riuer issuing forth behind that hill.
               
               
                  G.
                  Is that water good and wholesome? and may a man goe vnto it by boate?
               
               
                  I.
                  Yea, you may conueniently goe and returne from thence in your boate.
               
               
                  G.
                  Know you not whither they directed their course?
               
               
                  I.
                  They determined, surely, as they seemed, that they would saile to Atche or Bantam to buy Pepper or Cloues.
               
               
                  G.
                  They must therfore, of necessitie, be Hollanders.
               
               
                  I.
                  But who are ye? & whence come you?
               
               
                  G.
                  Wee are good men, and brought from farre countries.
               
               
                  I.
                  VVhat is your countries name?
               
               
                  G.
                  Our countrey is called

Holland.
               
               
                  I.
                  But wherefore came you hither?
               
               
                  G.
                  Wee came hither driuen by contrary tempest, to buy some fresh victuals, for we haue been long tossed in the sea.
               
               
                  I.
                  It is well. I will declare vnto the King, that strange ships are come.
               
               
                  G.
                  If you please, I will send two men with you to the King.
               
               
                  I.
                  Goe to, doe as you please.
               
               
                  G.
                  What meaneth so great a multitude of armed men comming hither? what sound of trumpets and cornets doe I heare?
               
               
                  I.
                  The King commeth there with all his princely traine.
               
               
                  G.
                  If this be so, I my selfe will go to meete him, that I may giue him honour and reuerence.
               
               
                  I.
                  Goe to, let vs go together.
               
               
                  K.
                  What are those men, who come to meete vs?
               
               
                  J.
                  O King, they are men, from farre countries, driuen hither through tempestuous weather, and they come to buy prouision for their people.
               
               
                  K.
                  Bid them come, that I may heare them speaking.
               
               
                  I.
                  It is well O King, behold they are present.
               
               
                  K.
                  Who are you, and what came you to doe here?
               
               
                  G.
                  O King, we surely are Merchants comming from far countries,

and driuen hither through the iniurie of the windes.
               
               
                  K.
                  Haue you bin long at sea?
               
               
                  G.
                  About foure moneths.
               
               
                  K.
                  Whither therefore do you determine to goe?
               
               
                  G.
                  Wee determined to saile to Bantam to buy Pepper, Cloues, Nutmegs, and Mace. But seeing wee are driuen hither, wee intreat your Maiestie to giue vs leaue to take fresh water, and buy certaine fresh victuals.
               
               
                  K.

                  I.
                  This is too long to be at sea, I should certainly dye, if I had continued so long at sea.

                  Vnlesse there were men, that would saile in the sea, this world should not be viewed.

                  It is true, but yet there must be some to till the ground.

                  Is the iourney long? I would not willingly go through the woods, seeing we often meet with many wilde beasts there, as Tygers, Rhinocerotes, and Serpents, which I greatly feare.

                  G.
                  I will pay you siluer for the oxe: but for the fruits I will change other merchandizes.

                  You shall therefore pay for him, if you please, fiue ryals of siluer.

                  This is too much, I will not buy so deare.

                  I will pay you three and a halfe.

                  I dare scarse sell them for so little, for I shall incurre the reprehension of my master.

                  Not now, for it groweth towards euening: but you must needs carrie all these things for me, and bring the oxe wel bound into the boate.

                  The most part are troubled with the laske, and some also sick of the feuer.
               
               
                  I.
                  There are many heere who can cure them, and an house may easily be had for them.
               
               
                  G.
                  Go too, to morrow, when the boate commeth to fetch fresh water, I will also come.

                  It draweth to the euening, I must therefore goe, we shad scarce come vnto the ship before midnight, for it is a long iourney by the riuer.

               THE FOVRTH DIALOGVE CONCERNING one who wandred in a wood, and is brought into the way againe. The persons talking together are Iames a Germane, and Gabriel an Indian.
               
                  I.
                  HO, ho, doth no mā heare? Ho cōpanions, ho where are you? how fearefull am I lest I haue wandred out of the way in this wood, surely I see no way, whereby I may escape: it were best, that ascending this mountaine, I looke about on euery side for a way to get out, for in this valley I seeme to see certaine little houses or cottages. I must passe this way, me thinkes I heare men there. But very fitly I see a certain man heere, I will aske him the way: God saue you my friend.
               
               
                  G.
                  God blesse you my man. But whence come you so deformed in colour, & through sweat?
               
               
                  I.
                  I will tell you this Sir. Entring into the wood with our mē, to take birds, I wandred out of the way, and therefore I sought some body, that might shew me the way.
               
               
                  G.
                  What is your name?
               
               
                  I.
                  My name is Iames: but how are you called?
               
               
                  
                  G.
                  They call me Gabriel.
               
               
                  I.
                  This is a good name.
               
               
                  G.
                  Tell me Iames, whither do you intend to goe?
               
               
                  I.
                  To our ships which ride at anchor in the hauen.
               
               
                  G.
                  You haue therefore gone farre out of the way, and you can not come thither before the euening.
               
               
                  I.
                  I would not willingly lodge all night on land, for our men would suspect, that some misfortune had besalne me.
               
               
                  G.
                  Stay with me, I pray you, here to night, to morrow I will goe with you, and shew you the way.
               
               
                  I.
                  Seeing I cannot doe otherwise, I will obey you.
               
               
                  G.
                  You cannot trauell by night, without danger, by reason of the Tygers.
               
               
                  I.
                  I will therfore tarrie as you perswade me: but I am weakened with exceeding hunger & thirst, for wandring long through the woods and bushes, I haue also torne my skinne here and there with very sharpe thornes.
               
               
                  G.
                  Enter into my house, I will giue you meate, and will kill an hen.
               
               
                  I.
                  Giue me drinke of the wine of the Palme, and some fresh Cocus nuts to eate.
               
               
                  G.
                  Let vs goe, for supper is prepared.
               
               
                  
                  I.
                  Sit you first, I will afterward sit downe.
               
               
                  G.
                  Let some body bring water to wash our hands. Eate now Iames, you eate nothing.
               
               
                  I.
                  I do nothing else but eate.
               
               
                  G.
                  Eate of the sodden or rosted henne.
               
               
                  I.
                  This meate hath a good smacke, so that I had much hunger.
               
               
                  G.
                  It is well, but drinke at length of this wine.
               
               
                  I.
                  It seemeth to me, that it is burnt wine.
               
               
                  G.
                  It is so, for it is made of Rice.
               
               
                  I.
                  But when shall we goe to bed, for we must rise early to morow?
               
               
                  G.
                  Whensoeuer you please, for your bed is prepared.
               
               
                  I.
                  Ho Gabriel, when doe wee rise, that we may begin our iourney?
               
               
                  G.
                  It is too early, you may yet sleepe an whole houre.
               
               
                  I.
                  No: for it is day, let vs rise.
               
               
                  G.
                  It is well, I will presently come.
               
               
                  I.
                  What way shall we goe?
               
               
                  G.
                  We are to passe through this wood, then we shall come vnto a riuer, ouer which wee must also passe.
               
               
                  I.
                  Is the depth thereof great?
               
               
                  G.
                  It reacheth to the knees.
               
               
                  
                  I.
                  Are we to go further when we haue passed the riuer?
               
               
                  G.
                  From thence through a very high mountaine, wee are to descend into a valley.
               
               
                  I.
                  But, doe there no theeues stay in this wood, who spoile men of their goods?
               
               
                  G.
                  Somtimes our enemies vse to make their inrodes hither, who take men, and put them to a fine of money.
               
               
                  I.
                  Is there not much danger therefore here?
               
               
                  G.
                  Sometimes also they kill men.
               
               
                  I.
                  Tell me Gabriel, when we haue passed this mountaine, may we see the ships?
               
               
                  G.
                  Surely, wee shall then see them by and by, but wee are then to turne vnto the right hand.
               
               
                  I.
                  Whether vnto the East, or towards the West?
               
               
                  G.
                  A little towards the South, and so forth.
               
               
                  I.
                  I now see the shoare, and the sea, I therefore reioyce, and hope that shortly (God willing) I shall be in the ship.
               
               
                  G.
                  What reward will you giue me because I haue brought you againe into the way?
               
               
                  I.
                  This seruice shall be well recompensed vnto you when I shal come to the ship.
               
               
                  G.
                  Goe too therefore, I will returne to morrow, for now I

must hasten home.
               
               
                  I.
                  Depart, God be with you.

If you desire a gunne, or a good sword, behold they are here, aske for what you please, I will shew you whatsoeuer you will, and that freely.
               
               
                  M.
                  For how much is an yard of this cloath sold?
               
               
                  L.
                  One ell is sold for Taiela.
               
               
                  M.
                  It is more costly then is sit for me. For how much is an yard of Chamlet sold?
               
               
                  L.
                  You shall pay me if you please, sixe Maesas for enery ell.
               
               
                  M.
                  It is too much, for it is but of a course thrid.
               
               
                  L.
                  By your leaue, behold it better, it is of a faire thrid, and of a goodly glosse.
               
               
                  M.
                  Doth it not leese the colour?
               
               
                  L.
                  If it keepe not the colour, I will restore you your money.
               
               
                  M.
                  Goe too therefore, tell me how much I must giue?
               
               
                  L.
                  I said, sixe Macsas.
               
               
                  M.
                  I will not giue so much for it.
               
               
                  L.
                  What will you therefore giue, will you lay downe nothing?
               
               
                  M.
                  VVhatsoeuer I will lay downe, you haue demanded too much.
               
               
                  
                  L.
                  I demaunded, but not In that sense, as if I could not abate any thing, and sell cheaper. Say, what you will giue for it?
               
               
                  M.
                  I will pay three Maesas, and three Coupangas.
               
               
                  L.
                  I cannot sell it for so cheape a price, for otherwise I should lose my good fortune. I haue surely of another sort, which I can sell for that price, but it is not of that goodnesse. I will let you see that, which I can sell cheaper, but you cannot doe better then if you buy the best. If we were brethren, I could shew you none of a better marke.
               
               
                  M.
                  Will you take my money?
               
               
                  L.
                  I cannot vpon that condition.
               
               
                  M.
                  I will yet adde one Maesa, and one Coupang.
               
               
                  L.
                  I cannot, I should loose somewhat of mine owne.
               
               
                  M.
                  I will pay no more.
               
               
                  L.
                  Goe too, on Gods name, goe see somewhere else, whether you can buy cheaper, surely you shall haue none any where for a lesse price, for I can sell for so much as any other in the city, but yet it is needful that I gaine somwhat, I sit not heere to leese any thing of mine. You know all things are at a great price, one thing therefore must follow another: vnlesse you will pay fiue

Maesas, I cannot help you, for you are too hard.
               
               
                  M.
                  So I am.
               
               
                  L.
                  Surely no man shall gaine any thing by you. If all men were of that niggardly disposition, I should certainly be compelled to shut vp my shop, for I should not gaine my maintenance.
               
               
                  M.
                  So surely you say.
               
               
                  L.
                  Truly it is so, as I say.
               
               
                  M.
                  Yet heare one word.
               
               
                  L.
                  Speake, I will heare.
               
               
                  M.
                  I will pay fiue Maesas, abating one Coupang.
               
               
                  L.
                  It is little, I cannot so sell it.
               
               
                  M.
                  What then, shall I' not haue it?
               
               
                  L.
                  Not for that price.
               
               
                  M.
                  Goe too then, God keepe you.
               
               
                  L.
                  Goe, God bee with you. Ho, returne and take it. I cannot let you goe, and see, that you returne another time, & buy againe of me: but yet it is too low a price.
               
               
                  M.
                  Surely in your iudgement, but I say it is too great a price, and that I am deceiued by you.
               
               
                  L.
                  I discharge you of the buying, if you repent you thereof.
               
               
                  M.
                  It were a dishonest part if I should doe this; take your money. How much doe I owe?
               
               
                  L.
                  I haue cast it into one summe, and found that eleuen Taielas,

eight Maesas, and three Coupanges are due to me.
               
               
                  M.
                  Is the account rightlie made?
               
               
                  L.
                  Yea, it is truly made.
               
               
                  M.
                  Well then, receiue and tell your money.
               
               
                  L.
                  This money is not good.
               
               
                  M.
                  Wherefore is it not good?
               
               
                  L.
                  Because many peeces of money are cracked, and broken in it.
               
               
                  M.
                  Goe too, chuse out those broken and faultie peeces of money, and restore them vnto me.
               
               
                  L.
                  I will doe so.
               
               
                  M.
                  Restore me one Coupang, which remaineth vnto me.
               
               
                  L.
                  I haue not yet receiued any Cassias to day.
               
               
                  M.
                  That therefore wee may pay, I will take these little pots for a Coupang.
               
               
                  L.
                  Take them, but another time you shall pay somewhat more.
               
               
                  M.
                  I will doe it, God willing.
               
               
                  L.
                  Will you, that any one carrie your wares? I will commit them to my seruant to be carried.
               
               
                  M.
                  It is not needfull I my selfe will carrie them, God preserue you.
               
               
                  L.
                  I heartily thanke you sir, when you will haue any thing else, returne vnto me, & you shall haue it at a reasonable price.
               
               
                  
                  M.
                  It is well, I will returne.

               THE SIXTH DIAlogue: how debt may be required.
               Ioseph, Adam, Isaak.
               
                  I.
                  GOd saue you Sir.
               
               
                  A.
                  And you likewise friend.
               
               
                  I.
                  You know without doubt, wherefore I am come, doe you not?
               
               
                  A.
                  No surely.
               
               
                  I.
                  Doe you not know who I am?
               
               
                  A.
                  I know not, who therefore are you?
               
               
                  I.
                  Haue you forgotten, that you lately bought certaine wares of me?
               
               
                  A.
                  It is true in good sooth.
               
               
                  I.
                  But when shall I receiue my money?
               
               
                  A.
                  Surely, I haue no money now, for I haue laid out all which I had among men, of necessitie therefore you must stay yet eight daies longer.
               
               
                  
                  I.
                  But I can stay no longer, it is necessarie that I be satisfied, I haue waited long enough, see that I have my money, or I will cause you to be cast in prison, else giue me a suretie.
               
               
                  A.
                  How much therefore doe I owe you?
               
               
                  I.
                  You know very well.
               
               
                  A.
                  Surely I haue forgotten, certainly I noted it, but I know not in what place.
               
               
                  I.
                  You owe me tenne Taielas, and foure Maesas, is it not so?
               
               
                  A.
                  Verely, I beleeue, that it is so.
               
               
                  I.
                  You promised to giue me money within two moneths: Is it not true? Is it not so?
               
               
                  A.
                  It is true surely, but I could not wrest money from them, who ought it me.
               
               
                  I.
                  I care not for that, see that you be satisfied.
               
               
                  A.
                  Seeing they are men, they haue money readie, what shall I doe to them? Surely I am compelled to stay while they receiue it, I must not proceed so strictly, I must haue patience and mercie, which God hath commended vnto vs.
               
               
                  I.
                  That surely is true, but I haue staied long enough. I can not waite any longer, for my Creditors also vrge me, otherwise I would stay longer.

                  I.
                  What he? Is it true friend? will you vndertake for this man?
               
               
                  I.
                  Yea, how much doth hee owe you?

                  What say you? That debt is not great.
               
               
                  I.
                  It is surely.
               
               
                  A.
                  You truly say so, but I will be sworne that it is not so much.

                  How much therefore is it?

                  A.
                  You surely.
               
               
                  I.
                  Well, be it so, yet it seemeth vnto me that they are tenne, but I will put you in sure, seeing you say that it is no more: but when shall I receiue payment?
               
               
                  A.
                  In tenne daies space.
               
               
                  I.
                  I will therfore stay so long, but see that you performe your promise.
               
               
                  A.
                  That I will doe, God willing.
               
               
                  I.
                  If he satisfie you not, I my selfe will satisfie you.

                  I am now contented, God keepe you.

                  You must goe forthright, and neither turne to the right hand or the left, vntill you come vnto a certaine huge tree, then bend your course vnto the left hand.
               
               
                  R.
                  How many miles are accounted from hence vnto the next village?
               
               
                  S.
                  Two miles and an halfe, a little more.
               
               
                  P.
                  Let vs therefore goe somewhat more slowly, for I am without all feare, and I see the tree, whereof hee spoke. It is a dustie soyle, and the dust hath almost blinded me.
               
               
                  R.
                  Take this Taffatie, and put

it to your eyes, for it will defend you both from the dust, and also from the heate of the Sunne.
               
               
                  P.
                  It is not needfull, for the Sunne is now gone downe, and I fea
                        •
                     e that we shall not come into the citie before it be night.
               
               
                  R.
                  That is very ill, because this way is dangerous by reason of theeues, who spoyle trauellers of their goods. It is not long since a certaine rich Merchant was risled heere. This causeth me to feare, lest the same may happen vnto vs, and surely it may easily be done, vnlesse we looke to our selues.
               
               
                  P.
                  There is no cause why you should feare, for I now see the

                  By your leaue, the gates are not shut before eight of the clocke.
               
               
                  R.
                  Therefore it is the better, for I vse not, willingly, to stay without the gates.

                  Leaue that care. I know the best place in the Citie, is at the red Lion in Portugall street.

But let vs proceed, I pray you, for me thinkes I see y• Porters, which are about the shutting of the gates.
               
               
                  R.
                  I am so weakned, and wearie with riding, that I can goe no further. Besides, which is more, my horse halteth, peraduenture hurt in the foote with a naile, or else he is gauled on the backe, for he goeth so heauily, that I thinke all the ribs of my body are broken.
               
               
                  P.
                  Let vs goe in.

                  You will be better when you are risen. We must needs go vnto the King and get the Siapp, that we may receiue Pepper.
               
               
                  A.
                  Goe too, I am now readie: but haue we bags in a readinesse,

                  I now see the King, giue him honour, I will speake vnto him, that hee would consent to weigh Pepper.
               
               
                  A.

                  Praise be to your Maiesty, I humbly intreate your Maiestie that it would please you to cause these Ryals to be told, and accepted, and withall that you would command the Sabandar to deliuer vs Pepper, for the time is nigh at hand, wherein we are to depart hence.

                  How much time remaineth, vntill you are to beginne your voyage?
               
               
                  D.
                  Two moneths yet remain, then the monson of the East wind will be come.

                  Goe too therefore, let the Sabandar receiue these Ryals. I will commaund him that euery day he cause Pepper to be weighed vnto you, vntill your ship bee laden.

                  The Sabandar shall set you downe the price.
               
               
                  D.
                  I would desire that it might be done before your Maiestie.
               
               
                  K.
                  Goe too therfore, you shal pay twelue Taielas for euerie Baer, and about foure Maesas and an halfe, euery Ryall.
               
               
                  D.
                  We will pay eight Taielas, accompting euery Ryall for fiue Maesas and a three fourth part.
               
               
                  K.
                  Strangers of Guiserat and Arabia pay more, but ye shall pay tenne Taielas, accompting euery Ryal for fiue Maesas, and you shal pay no custome.
               
               
                  D.
                  We heartily thanke your Maiestie. We will pay so much willingly, so that wee may lade our ship in sixe weekes.
               
               
                  S.
                  Come, wee will weigh you some part of the Pepper. Are your Mariners ready with boates to receiue the Pepper?

                  Goe too therefore, I will goe bring the key to the house, where the Pepper is laid vp, with a Notarie to set down the waight of the Pepper. The weigher also shall be brought, with weight necessarie for this purpose.

                  Pepper also shall presently bee brought vnto you from foraine places, and shall be weighed vnto you.

                  This Pepper is common and vile, that was plucked from the stalke vnripe, this is moyst with water, and seemeth to haue been purposely moystened, and hath both sand and also stones intermingled with it, yt it might appeare to much the more weightie, I will not therefore receiue this, lest the other which is better should be corrupted therewith.

but see yt I receiue good waight.

                  Well, where are they that lift vp the sackes, and fasten them to the Beame?

                  I am in good health, I thank you that you aske. But how fare you Herman?
               
               
                  H.
                  I am very well. But how doth your father, and mother?
               
               
                  I.
                  They are well, God be praised.
               
               
                  H.
                  What doe you vp so early?
               
               
                  I.
                  Is it not yet time for a man to rise?
               
               
                  H.
                  Are you yet fasting? haue you eaten nothing?
               
               
                  I.
                  Nothing surely, for it is vnseasonable yet. But haue you eaten any thing?
               
               
                  H.
                  What else, an houre since,

should I fast so long? But whence come you?
               
               
                  I.
                  Frō whence should I come? I come from the schoole, the Church, from the market place.
               
               
                  H.
                  But whether goe you?

                  It is almost twelue.
               
               
                  H.

                  I.
                  I must be gone, I shall incurre the displeasure of my mother. Farewell Herman.

                  Doe you make such hast? did our Master aske for me?
               
               
                  I.
                  I heard it not. But I cannot stay here any longer. Farewell.
               
               
                  H.
                  Depart, God be with you.
               
               
                  I.
                  I pray God giue you good euening my mother, and all the companie.
               
               
                  M.
                  Iohn, whence come you? where haue you been so song? why come you so late? is this according to my meaning? I commanded you to come at foure of the clock, and now it is vpon the stroake of sixe. Tell me where you haue been: for it is now a long time since you came frō schoole, I know this, and I will tell it vnto your master.
               
               
                  I.
                  Be not displeased mother, for I now come first frō schoole, I knew not that it was so late, I was no where else, for my part you may aske our master, whether

this be not so.
               
               
                  M.
                  I will doe so, for it is necessarie that I know the truth. Go your waies now, lay the cloath, make more haste.
               
               
                  I.
                  I will my mother, but where shall I finde the tablecloath?
               
               
                  M.
                  The tablecloath lieth in the chest. Set the saltseller downe first, can you not remember this? I haue told you more then twentie times, you learne nothing, it is a foule shame for you: goe fetch trenchers, earthen pots, and napkins.
               
               
                  I.
                  Well my mother, but where shall I finde them?
               
               
                  M.
                  You can finde nothing, behold they are here, why do you not seeke? goe fetch bread.
               
               
                  I.
                  Well, giue me money: how many loaues shall I bring?
               
               
                  M.
                  For two crosse pennies, for the one white, for the other, ordinarie: but bring them all new baked,
               
               
                  I.
                  It is well, I goe, behold I bring bread mother.
               
               
                  M.
                  Well done, goe bring wood that I may kindle a fire, make cleane the kniues, fill the Ewer with water, hāg vp a cleane towell, make a fire, your father commeth; and Dauid your cousin with him, goe forth to meete them. Vncouer your head, and bow your knees vnto them.
               
               
                  
                  I.
                  It is well my mother, I goe: I am glad father, that you come safe, with your companie.

                  Peter, drink not when you haue eaten your milke, for it hurteth the health, first eate somewhat else before you drinke. Peter, cut me a little flesh, and cut me bread, set somewhat before Francis that hee may eate, for hee hath nothing.

                  No surely, no newes, but

that which is good.
               
               
                  D.
                  Is there not much speech of peace?
               
               
                  R.
                  Surely I thinke that peace is yet farre off.
               
               
                  D.
                  Haue you not heard, that the King of France is ouercome in fight against the Spanish king.
               
               
                  R.
                  I heard it surely, but so many lies are spread abroad, that you know not what you may beleeue. Many maruellous and wonderfull things are reported, but God onely knoweth what shall be hereafter.
               
               
                  D.
                  Surely you say true.
               
               
                  R.
                  If wee would make peace with him, warre verily would not continue long.
               
               
                  D.
                  This also is true.

                  R.
                  You say well, but it is needful that yet we giue other thanks. Peter, how much wine was brought, we wil pay for the wine.
               
               
                  P.
                  What will you? you shall giue nothing at all, for I who could giue you meate, why

should I not be able to giue you drinke?
               
               
                  R.
                  What is this? wine is now at a great price.
               
               
                  P.
                  You heard what I haue said.

                  Go too therefore, we giue you heartie thankes, and we will see how we may recompense you for it.

                  This hath been long since done.

                  It hath not yet strucken.
               
               
                  R.
                  It hath surely.
               
               
                  M.
                  Iohn, bring a candle.
               
               
                  D.
                  We will haue no candle, it is a moonelight night, and there is no danger.
               
               
                  H.
                  God giue you good night.

so early?
               
               
                  P.
                  I expect Merchants.
               
               
                  D.
                  Is it long since you came?
               
               
                  P.
                  I came euen now, I haue not bin heere aboue a quarter of houre.
               
               
                  D.
                  You prepare your selfe timely to your labour, as I see.
               
               
                  P.
                  It is a thing repugnant to health, if a man sleepe all the long night.
               
               
                  D.
                  You are too diligent.
               
               
                  P.
                  So I am verily, I could surely giue my selfe to sleepe willingly as long as others, but pouertie raiseth me out of my bed.
               
               
                  D.
                  The day is very gloomie.
               
               
                  P.
                  When it shall be changed it will end in raine.
               
               
                  D.
                  Doe you yet dwell there, where you were wont before?
               
               
                  P.
                  It is now three moneths and more, since I changed house.
               
               
                  D.
                  Haue you receiued no money yet?
               
               
                  P.
                  Nothing, no not the least farthing surely.
               
               
                  D.
                  The same also hath happened to me.
               
               
                  P.
                  It is yet timely, the Merchants waite till our shoppes bee opened, and the wares set forth.
               
               
                  D.
                  It is better to hope, then

to reiect all hope.
               
               
                  P.
                  There are many beholders and cheapners, but few who purpose to buy.
               
               
                  D.
                  See, there commeth some bodie, doth it please you Sir, to buy any good thing?
               
               
                  A.
                  What merchandizes haue you?
               
               
                  D.
                  Come into the shop, the beholding shal cost you nothing.
               
               
                  A.
                  I will willingly come in, if you be readie to sell your wares at a reasonable price.
               
               
                  D.
                  See whether there be any thing which may serue your turne, I will sell it you at a reasonable price, for I had rather haue money, then the corrupting of my goods, through want of sale.
               
               
                  A.
                  Tell me the qualitie and price of your wares.
               
               
                  D.
                  You shall scarce deuise any merchandize, which I haue not, and surely of diuers prices; demaund only what you want, and you shall haue it.
               
               
                  A.
                  Shew me English cloathes.
               
               
                  D.
                  Behold, you haue a cloath like silke.
               
               
                  A.
                  I desire to haue them of diuers colours, and well and fairely smoothed.
               
               
                  D.
                  Behold I haue here for you

white, black, blew, yellow, green, redde, of a good colour, thicke, broad, of a small, indifferent, and great price.
               
               
                  A.
                  What kind of kersey haue you?
               
               
                  D.
                  Of diuers sorts.
               
               
                  A.
                  Haue you not a better?
               
               
                  D.
                  I haue surely, but it is not yet vnfolded out of the packs.
               
               
                  A.
                  What doth a whole pack cost?
               
               
                  D.
                  Without circumstances, to speake in a word, it costeth seuentie pounds.
               
               
                  A.
                  This is too much, speake at a word which may make for the purpose.
               
               
                  D.
                  I haue said as the matter is, you cannot buy it for lesse.
               
               
                  A.
                  Will you that I pay sixtie pounds?
               
               
                  D.
                  Surely I will not abate one mite.
               
               
                  A.
                  You are too hard and couetous.
               
               
                  D.
                  Hee that desireth good wares, it is needfull that he spend money.
               
               
                  A.
                  You commend your wares too much.
               
               
                  D.
                  Surely he is an vnwise Merchant, that praiseth not his wares.
               
               
                  A.
                  Let me see a cloath made of coloured wooll.
               
               
                  D.
                  Behold, here is a cloath made of the best wooll.
               
               
                  A.
                  It hath a great thred, and

ill wouen, and the cutting sheweth that it was burned in the dye.
               
               
                  D.
                  Behold it againe, and you will say otherwise.
               
               
                  A.
                  For how much will you sel it, if partly with readie money, and partly I pay you with time?
               
               
                  D.
                  In few words, and not to lose time, it is sold for 60.pounds.
               
               
                  A.
                  Sell it me at a reasonable price, I will deliuer you an obligation wherewith you may bee content.
               
               
                  D.
                  I had rather haue readie money.
               
               
                  A.
                  He that hath a good bond, may easily get money.
               
               
                  D.
                  What mans bond will you giue me, doe I know him?
               
               
                  A.
                  Hee is rich and wealthie enough.
               
               
                  D.
                  What is his name? by your leaue, what countriman is he? is he citizen?
               
               
                  A.
                  No, he is of Gaunt.
               
               
                  D.
                  In what streere dwelleth he?
               
               
                  A.
                  He dwelleth neere the new Church.
               
               
                  D.
                  What signe hath hee set forth?
               
               
                  A.
                  Hard by the signe of the Elephant, ouer against the Doue.
               
               
                  D.
                  I will deliberate, and inquire of him vntill to morrow.
               
               
                  A.
                  It is well, enquire of him, and then tell me your opinion.
               
               
                  
                  D.

                  A.
                  I should make a conscience to deceiue any man.
               
               
                  D.
                  You know not now whom you may trust, for they who seem honest men, often times think no other thing in their minde, then how they may deceiue men.
               
               
                  A.
                  You shall leese nothing by mee (God willing) although you should sell me tenne times more merchandizes.
               
               
                  D.
                  You shall lose nothing with an honest man. Goe too, that we may make an end, how much will you pay?
               
               
                  A.
                  I will speake at one word, fiue and fiftie pounds.
               
               
                  D.
                  It is little, but you shall giue fiftie eight.
               
               
                  A.
                  I will giue no more.
               
               
                  D.
                  You shall haue it at that price which you haue said, although it be very little: for he is as well a Merchant, who leeseth, as he that gaineth.
               
               
                  A.
                  Goe too, you may keepe these wares for me vntill tomorrow morning, for then I wil giue you such a bond, for the rest that shal easily secure you of the debt.
               
               
                  D.
                  Haue you no familiar friend in the citie?
               
               
                  
                  A.
                  I haue surely, here is master Antony Motten, I know not whether he be knowne to you.
               
               
                  D.
                  He is well enough knowne to me, if hee will passe his credit for you, it is sufficient, for I acknowledge him to be an honest man, whom if neede required, I would easily trust with all my goods.
               
               
                  A.
                  I will cause him to speake vnto you to morrow.
               
               
                  D.
                  Doe I pray you.
               
               
                  A.
                  I commend me vnto you, God keepe you till to morrow.
               
               
                  D.
                  I will alwaies bee readie at your seruice.

                  GOod day Richard.

                  God saue you Dauid my friend.
               
               
                  D.
                  How haue you done since I saw you last?
               
               
                  R.
                  Very well (God be praised) I thanke you sir. But how do you?
               
               
                  D.
                  As you see, being healthie in body, yet light of money; but it is a long time that you haue not been here.
               
               
                  R.
                  I doe trade in another place.

                  R.
                  I came yesterday, about the euening.
               
               
                  D.
                  Came you by land?
               
               
                  R.
                  No, I came by water, and was in so great danger, that I know not whether any greater euer besell me.
               
               
                  D.
                  How came it so to passe?
               
               
                  R.
                  There was so great a tempest, and so mightie a storme at sea, that we al thought we should haue been cast away. For, there was no other hope of safetie left, then in God, who deliuered vs out of that danger through his grace.
               
               
                  D.
                  You terrifie me with your speech.
               
               
                  R.
                  It is so, and I giue God thankes, that being deliuered frō the danger, I am now on the shoare.
               
               
                  D.
                  And I also heartily reioyce, seeing it is so as you haue said, you haue had good luck: but let vs somtimes meete together, and make our selues merrie with drinke, if you please, before you depart.
               
               
                  R.
                  What else, wee must begin again, and renew our old friendship, I will alwaies be readie at your back, when you shall commaund,
               
               
                  
                  D.
                  It is not my part to commaund you, but I desire that you would abase your selfe so much, and performe this friendship vnto me, that you would sometimes see me.
               
               
                  R.
                  I heartily thanke you.
               
               
                  D.
                  What is here reported?
               
               
                  R.
                  Nothing but good.
               
               
                  D.
                  Haue you no newes here?
               
               
                  R.
                  Nothing that I know.
               
               
                  D.
                  Are cloathes at a small price?
               
               
                  R.
                  They were not a long time at such a price. And yet the price of them will be increased, before it be diminished.
               
               
                  D.
                  For what cause, I pray you tell me?
               
               
                  R.
                  There is such abundance of things appertaining to the maintenāce of life, that the common people refuse all labour. And that which is more, you your self know that the tributes, fraights, and other charges, are great enough.
               
               
                  D.

                  R.
                  This cannot helpe vs, for they cost vs deare, and it is risen to thirtie or fortie shillings a pack.
               
               
                  D.
                  What profit therefore and

gaine shall Merchants receiue?
               
               
                  R.
                  It is needfull that seruing the time, they sell as dcare as they can.
               
               
                  D.
                  When do you expect your ships?
               
               
                  R.
                  Our ships began to be laden, when I departed.
               
               
                  D.
                  They are now almost laden.
               
               
                  R.
                  I hope that vpon the first fare wind they will begin their voyage.
               
               
                  D.
                  It is now a great calme, and a good season, for no winde almost is perceiued.
               
               
                  R.
                  The winde is altogether contrarie, but it will shortly be changed, God willing.
               
               
                  D.
                  The winde at sea is very dangerous, inconstant, and mutable.
               
               
                  R.
                  Hee must commit all to fortune, who desireth to be rich.
               
               
                  D.
                  It is better to commit half to fortune, then for the hope of great gaine, to indanger all that a man possesseth in one voyage.
               
               
                  R.
                  It is well said of you, for he who loseth all, ariseth not easily any more.
               
               
                  D.
                  But to our discourse, will there many ships come?
               
               
                  D.
                  Surely I hope so, for I know that many ships are laden with merchandizes of diuers sorts.

               THE TWELFTH DIALOGVE, OF A certaine voyage by sea.
               
                  A.
                  TO the shippe, ho friends, who will come into the ship?
               
               
                  R.
                  Whither will you direct your course Master?
               
               
                  A.
                  Am I the man whom you desire?
               
               
                  R.
                  I must call one named Adam.
               
               
                  A.
                  Goe too therefore, I am present, what doe you desire?
               
               
                  R.
                  What doe you take of any one, if you carrie him from hence to Lisbone?
               
               
                  A.
                  I take as much as I can get, and not as much as I will.
               
               
                  R.
                  What therfore shall I giue for that passage?
               
               
                  
                  A.
                  For the most part, twentie crownes are paid for the fraight, besides prouision of victuals.
               
               
                  C.
                  Pay as much as others, and take ship, while there is yet place in it.
               
               
                  R.
                  It is 'needfull that I first know the price, otherwise I will not enter into the ship.
               
               
                  C.
                  Let the sacke be tyed together with a cord.
               
               
                  A.
                  You shall therefore pay fifteene crownes.
               
               
                  R.
                  But what if the ship perish, and I perish being drowned in the waters?
               
               
                  A.
                  Then shall you pay no fraight.
               
               
                  R.
                  My parents exposed not their liues to so great dangett.
               
               
                  A.
                  Where therfore died they?
               
               
                  R.
                  In a faire and soft bed.
               
               
                  C.
                  They are to be lamented surely, for if they had taken ship, they had not died there.
               
               
                  R.
                  Is your shippe sufficiently prepared, and furnished with necessarie things for the warres?
               
               
                  A.
                  Surely there liueth not any man borne of a woman, that euer saw a shippe better prepared and furnished with Ordinance and other munition, then this is.
               
               
                  R.
                  I will prouide me bisket, and other prouision, while you

in the meane space fit the mast, and spread the sailes.
               
               
                  C.
                  You shall haue of me, at a reasonable price.
               
               
                  A.
                  Haue you any thing which you may carrie with you?
               
               
                  R.
                  Nothing but a small vessell, and a certaine little fardle, which I will presently cause to be brought hither.
               
               
                  A.
                  Haue you cleerely dischar ged the tribute and custome?
               
               
                  R.
                  I am home-bred and a citizen, looke vpon my wrighting.
               
               
                  C.
                  Go into the head or wast of the ship.
               
               
                  R.
                  Is the wind West North or South?
               
               
                  C.
                  I thinke that the Northwest winde doth arise.
               
               
                  A.
                  I find it well enough. The winde bloweth from the East towards the West. When doe you thinke we shall come to the hauen?
               
               
                  A.
                  If the winde be fit, we shall quickly sale it.
               
               
                  C.
                  If the winde blow right into the saile, we shall shortly be there.
               
               
                  N.
                  It is a calme sea.
               
               
                  O.
                  It is calme, by reason of the slaking of the windes.
               
               
                  A.
                  This calme is a forerunner of misfortune, tempest, and shipwracke.
               
               
                  
                  C.
                  Take an oar, and row with it.
               
               
                  R.
                  Let any man row that can, I am not able to performe that labour.
               
               
                  A.
                  By practise one shall soone learne.
               
               
                  C.
                  Hee that will goe to Sea, must be obedient to the gouernours of the shippe, as well as the sicke patient to the Physitian.
               
               
                  R.
                  Either the water is not deepe, or else the sea ebbeth.
               
               
                  A.
                  I cast the plummet into the deepe, and found the depth of the water to be aboue fiue fathomes.
               
               
                  N.
                  Either the wind is calme, or the ship lieth at anchor.
               
               
                  C.
                  If the winds arising should moue the sea, surely they would easily pluck vp the anchors.
               
               
                  R.
                  See what the mariners doe in the top of the ship?
               
               
                  C.
                  They hoyse their topsailes.
               
               
                  A.
                  Stirre your oare, and row.
               
               
                  R.
                  I am almost burst with tugging at an oare.
               
               
                  O.
                  See, how the waues arise.
               
               
                  E.
                  The water doth flow, and the sea swelleth.
               
               
                  N.
                  I feare lest some tempest beat hand.
               
               
                  C.
                  See how the flag flieth.
               
               
                  A.
                  It is best that wee strike

faile, and loose the tackling. For the storme and tempest troubleth the whole firmament.
               
               
                  R.
                  I pray you for Gods sake let vs put in to some hauen, that we may goe out of the ship. I will willingly giue you whatsoeuer I possesse.
               
               
                  N.
                  God will helpe vs.

                  We desire Oxen, Goates, Rice, Milke, Hony, Oranges, Limons, Cinamom, Cloaues, and the leaues of Cloaues.

            ANOTHER DIALOGVE OF ONE WHO WANDRED OVT OF THE WAY IN A WOOD: the persons are a Germane, and an Indian.
            
               English
               
                  G.
                  GOd giue you good day friend.
               
               
                  I.
                  Whence come you so red, and full of sweate?
               
               
                  G.
                  I will tell you this friend, I went out with our people into the wood, to kill some birds with a piece, but I went out of the way: wandring therfore, here & there, I seeke whether I could finde any mā that might shew me the way, for I would willinglie returne vnto the ships while it is yet. day.
               
               
                  I.
                  You haue wandred too farre out of the way, and you cannot returne vnto the ships to day, for you are too sarre off from them.
               
               
                  
                  G.
                  I would not be absent from the ships by night, lest my companions might suspect that some danger had befalen me.
               
               
                  I.
                  Tarrie with me this night, I will goe with you to morrow, and shew you the way.
               
               
                  G.
                  I am exceeding thirstie and hungrie, for I haue wandred very long in the wood.
               
               
                  I.
                  Come into this house with me, I will cause meate to be prepared for you, an henne to be killed, and rosted.
               
               
                  G.
                  Reach me wine of the Palme that I may drinke, and a nut that I may eate.
               
               
                  I.
                  Come, let vs goe to supper, for it is readie, and afterward we will goe to bed.
               
               
                  G.
                  Sit, I pray you, I will presently returne.
               
               
                  I.
                  Powre out water to wash our hands. Eate, you eate nothing, take some of this boyled henne, and of the broyled fishes.
               
               
                  G.
                  I do nothing else but eate, for it is meate of a very pleasant taste.
               
               
                  I.
                  It is well: (God blesse you) but drinke also of this burned wine.
               
               
                  G.
                  I will doe it. But when shall wee goe to bed? for to morrow

wee must begin our iourney betimes.
               
               
                  I.
                  When you please, your bed is ready.
               
               
                  G.
                  Ho, friend, when doe wee arise? It is day.
               
               
                  I.
                  It is too timely yet, you may yet sleepe an whole houre.
               
               
                  G.
                  It pleaseth me not, it is time to rise.
               
               
                  I.
                  It is well, I will come presently.
               
               
                  G.
                  What way shall we goe?
               
               
                  I.
                  VVee must goe this way through the wood, for then wee shall come vnto a certaine Riuer, and hauing passed ouer it we shall come vnto a very high hill, ouer which we must also goe.
               
               
                  G.
                  But doe there no theeues stay in this wood, who lie in wait for men?
               
               
                  I.
                  Yea, for certaine enemies of ours vse sometimes to come hither, who take trauellers, and spoyle them of their goods.
               
               
                  G.
                  But, when we are come to the top of this hill, shall wee see the ships?
               
               
                  I.
                  Yea, we shall presently see them, and then we must bend vnto the right hand.
               
               
                  G.
                  I see the shoare and the sea, I therefore reioyce, and hope that

I shall shortly see the ships.
               
               
                  I.
                  What reward shall I receiue, for that I haue brought you into the way?
               
               
                  G.
                  I will satisfie you with a thankfull minde, when I come vnto the ships.
               
               
                  I.
                  Goe too therefore, doe so, I will returne vnto you to morrow, for now I must goe home.
               
               
                  G.
                  Goe in peace, God be with you.
