            TO THE MOST EXCELlent Prince, Prince CHARLES.
            
               Most Excellent Prince,
            
            
               I Haue had three Births; One, Naturall, when I came into

the World; One Supernatural, when I entred into the Ministery; and now, a preter-naturall Birth, in returning to Life, from this Sicknes. In my second Birth, your Highnesse Royall Father vouchsafed mee his Hand, no
                  •
                onely to sustaine me
                  •
                
               in it, but to lead mee

               to it. In this last Birth, I my selfe am borne a Father: This Child of mine, this Booke, comes into the world, from mee, and with mee. And therefore, I presume (as I did the Father to the Father) to present the Sonne to the Sonne; This Image of my Humiliation, to the

liuely Image of his Maiesty, your Highnesse. It might bee enough, that God hath seene my Deuotions: But Examples of Good Kings are Commandements; And Ezechiah writt the Meditations of his Sicknesse, after his Sicknesse. Besides, as I haue liu'd to see,

(not as a Witnesse onely, but as a Partaker) the happinesses of a part of your Royal Fathers time, so shall I liue, (in my way) to see the happpinesses of the times of you
                  •
                
               Highnesse too, if this Child of mine, inanimated by your gracious Acceptation,

may so long preserue aliue the Memory of
            
               Your Highnesse Humblest and Deuo

            DEVOTIONS.
            
               1. Insultus Morbi primus; The first alteration, The first grudging of the sicknesse.
               
                  1. MEDITATION.
                  
                     VAriable, and therfore miserable condition of Man; this minute I was well, and am ill, this minute. I am surpriz'd with a sodaine change,

& alteration to worse, and can impute it to no cause, nor call it by any name. We study Health, and we deliberate vpon our meats, and drink, and Ayre, and exercises, and we hew, and wee polish euery stone, that goes to that building; and so our Health is a long & a regular work; But in a minute a Canon batters all, ouerthrowes all, demolishes all; a Sicknes vnpreuented for all our diligence, vnsuspected for all our

curiosi

                     ie; nay, vndeserued, if we consider only disorder, summons vs, seizes vs, possesses vs, destroyes vs in an instant. O miserable condition of Man, which was not imprinted by God; who as hee is immortall himselfe, had put a coale, a beame of Immortalitie into vs, which we might haue blowen into a flame, but blew it ou
                        •
                     , by our first sinne; wee beggard our selues by hearkning after false riches, and infatuated our

selues by hearkning after false knowledge. So that now, we doe not onely die, but die vpon the Rack, die by the torment of sicknesse; nor that onely, but are pre-afflicted, super-afflicted with these ielousies and suspitions, and apprehensions of Sicknes, before we can cal it a sicknes; we are not sure we are ill; one hand askes the other by the pulse, and our eye askes our own vrine, how we do. O multiplied misery

we die, and cannot enioy death, because wee die in this torment of sicknes; we are tormented with sicknes, & cannot stay till the torment come, but pre-apprehē
                     sions and presages, prophecy those torments, which induce that death before either come
                        •
                      and our dissolution is conceiued in these first changes, quickned in the sicknes it selfe, and borne in death, which be

                     res date from these first changes. Is this the honour which

Man hath by being a litle world, That he hath these earthquakes in him selfe, sodaine shakings; these lightnings, sodaine flashes; these thunders, sodaine noises; these E
                           •
                        clypses, sodain offuscations, & darknings of his senses; these blazing stars sodaine fiery exhalations; these riuers of blood, sodaine red waters? Is he a world to himselfe onely therefore, that he ha
                        •
                     h inough in himself, not only to destroy, and execute himselfe, but to

presage that execution vpon himselfe; to as
                        •
                     ist the sicknes, to antidate the sicknes, to make the sicknes the more irremediable, by sad apprehensions, and as if hee would make a fire the more vehement, by sprinkling water vpon the coales, so to wrap a hote feuer in cold Melancholy, least the feuer alone shold not destroy fast enough, without this contribution, nor perfit the work (which is destruction) except we

ioynd an artificiall sicknes, of our owne melancholy, to our natural, our vnnaturall feuer. O perplex'd discomposition, O ridling distemper, O miserable condition of Man.
               
               
                  1. EXPOSTVLATION.
                  IF I were but meere dust & ashes, I might speak vnto the Lord, for the Lordes hand made me of this dust, and the Lords hand shall recollect

these ashes; the Lords hand was the wheele, vpon which this vessell of 
                        •
                     lay was framed, and the Lordes hand is the Vrne, in which these ashes shall be preseru'd. I am the dust, & the ashes of the Temple of the H. Ghost; and what Marble is so precious? But I am more then dust & ashes; I am my best part, I am my soule. And being so, the breath of God, I may breath back these pious expostulations to my God. My God, my God, why is

not my soule, as fensible as my body? Why hath not my soule these apprehensions, these presages, these changes, those antidates, those iealousies, those suspitions of a sinne
                     
                        •
                      as well as my body of a sicknes? why is there not alwayes a pulse in my Soule, to beat at the approch of a tentation to sinne? why are there not alwayes waters in mine eyes, to testifie my spiritual sicknes? I stand in the way of tentations, (naturally, necessarily,

all men doe so: for there is a Snake in euery path, tentations in euery vocation) but I go, I run, I flie into the wayes of tētation, which I might shun; nay, I breake into houses, wher the plague is; I presse into places of tentation, and tempt the deuill himselfe, and solicite & importune them, who had rather be left vnsolicited by me. I fall sick of Sin, and am bedded and bedrid, buried and putrified in the practise of Sin, and all this

while ha
                        •
                     e no presage, no pulse, no sense of my sicknesse; O heighth, O depth of misery, where the first Symptome of the sicknes is Hell, & where I neuer fee the feuer of lust, of enuy, of ambition, by any other light, then the darknesse and horror of Hell it selfe
                        •
                      & where the first Messenger that speaks to me doth not say
                        •
                      
                     Thou mayst die, no, nor Thou must die, but Thou art dead: and where the first notice, that my Soule hath of

her sicknes, is irrecouerablenes, irremediablenes: but, O my God, Iob did not charge thee foolishly, in his temporall afflictions, nor may I in my spirituall. Thou hast imprinted a pulse in our Soule, but we do not examine it; a voice in our conscience, but wee doe not hearken vnto it. We talk it out, we iest it out, we drinke it out, we sleepe it out; and when wee wake, we doe not say with Iacob,
                     
                        Gen. 28.16. 
                     Surely the Lord is in this place, and I

knew it not: but though we might know it, we do not, we wil not. But will God pretend to make a Watch, and leaue out the springe? to make so many various wheels in the faculties of the Soule, and in the organs of the body, and leaue out Grace, that should moue them? or wil God make a springe, and not wind it vp? Infuse his first grace, & not second it with more, without which, we can no more vse his first grace, when

we haue it, then wee could dispose our selues by Nature, to haue it? But alas, that is not our case; we are all prodigall sonnes, and not disinherited; wee haue receiued our portion, and misspent it, not bin denied it. We are Gods tenants heere, and yet here, he, our Land-lord payes vs Rents; not yearely, nor quarterly, but hourely, and quarterly; Euery minute he renewes his mercy, but wee will not vnderstand,

                  O Eternall, and most gracious God, who considered in thy selfe, art a Circle, first and last, and altogether; but considered in thy working vpon vs, art a direct line, and leadest vs from our beginning, through all our wayes, to our end, enable me by thy grace, to looke forward to

mine end, and to looke backward to, to the cō

                  THe Heauens are not the lesse constant,

because they moue continually, because they moue continually one and the same way. The Earth is not the more constant, because it lyes stil continually, because continually it changes, and melts in al the parts thereof. Man, who is the noblest part of the Earth, melts so away, as if he were a statue, not of Earth, but of Snowe. We see his owne Enuie melts him, hee growes leane with that; he will say, anothers beautie
                     
melts him; but he feeles that a Feuer doth not melt him like snow, but powr him out like lead, like yron, like brasse melted in a furnace: It doth not only melt him, but Calcine him, reduce him to Atomes, and to ashes; not to water, but to lime. And how quickly? Sooner then thou canst receiue an answer, sooner then thou canst conceiue the question; Earth is the center of my body, Heauen is the center of my Soule; these two

are the naturall place of these two; but tho

                     DAuid professes himself a dead dog,
                     1 Sam. 24 15. to his king Saul, & so doth Mephibosheth to his king Dauid:
                     2 Sam. 9.8. & yet Dauid speaks to Saul, and Mephibosheth to Dauid. No man is so little, in respect of the greatest man, as the greatest in respect of God; for here, in that, wee haue not so much as a measure
                     
to try it by; proportiō
                      is no measure for infinitie. He that hath no more of this world but a graue, hee that hath his graue but lent him, til a better man, or another man, must bee buried in the same graue, he that hath no graue, but a dung-hill, hee that hath no more earth, but that which he carries, but that which hee is, hee that hath not that earth, which hee is, but euen in that, is anothers slaue, hath as much proportion to God, as if

all Dauids Worthies, and all the worlds Monarchs, and all imaginations Gyants were kneaded and incorporated into one, and as though that one were the suruiuor of all the sonnes of men, to whom God had giuen the world. And therefore how little soeuer I bee, as God calls things that are not, as though they were, I, who am as though I were not, may call vpon God, and say, My God, my God, why comes thine anger so

fast vpon me? Why dost thou melt me, scatter me, powre me like water vpon the ground so instantly? Thou staidst for the first world, in Noahs time, 120 yeres; thou staidst for a rebellious generation in the wildernesse 40 yeares, wilt thou stay no minute for me? Wilt thou make thy Processe, and thy Decree, thy Citation, and thy Iudgement but one act? Thy Summons, thy Battell, thy Victorie, thy Triumph, all but one

act; & lead me captiue, nay deliuer me captiue to death, assoon as thou declarest mee to be enemy, and so cut me off euen with the drawing of thy sword out of the scabberd, and for that question, How long was he sicke? leaue no other answere, but that the hand of death pressed vpon him from the first minute? My God, my God, thou wast not wont to come in whirlwinds, but in soft and gentle ayre. Thy first breath breathed

a Soule into mee, and shall thy breath blow it out? Thy breath in the Congregation, thy Word in the Church, breathes communion, and consolation here, and consummation heereaf
                        •
                     er; shall thy breath in this Chamber breathe dissolution, and destruction, diuorce, and separation? Surely it is not thou; it is not thy hand. The deuouring sword, the consuming fire, the winds from the wildernes, the diseases of the body, all

that afflicted Iob, were from the hand of Satan; it is not thou. It is thou; Thou my God, who hast led mee so continually with thy hand, from the hand of my Nurce, as that I know, thou wilt not correct mee, but with thine own hand. My parents would not giue mee ouer to a Seruants correction, nor my God, to Satans.
                     2 Sam. 24.14. I am fallen into the handes of God with Dauid, and with Dauid I see that his Mercies

are great. For by that mercy, I consider in my present state, not the haste, & the dispatch of the disease, in dissoluing this body
                        •
                      so much, as the much more hast, & dispatch, which my God shal vse, in recollecting
                        •
                      and reuniting this dust againe at the Resurrection. Then I shall heare his Angels proclaime the Surgite M

of the voice shall be all one; and all shall rise there in a lesse Minute, then any one dies here.
               
               
                  2. Prayer.
                  O Most gracious God, who pursuest and perfitest thine own purposes, and dost not only remember mee by the first accesses of this sicknes, that I must die, but informe me by this further proceeding therin, that I may die now,

who hast not only waked mee with the first, but cald me vp, by casting me further downe, and clothd me with thy selfe, by stripping me of my selfe, and by dulling my bodily senses, to the meats, and eases of this world, hast whet, and sharpned my spirituall senses, to the apprehension of thee, by what steps & degrees soeuer it shal please thee to go, in the dissolution of this body, hasten O Lord that pace, and multiply O my

God those degrees, in the exaltation of my Soule, toward thee now, & to thee then. My tast is not gone away, but gone vp to sit at Dauids table, To tast,

                     & see, that the Lord is good: My stomach is not gone, but gone vp, so far vpwards toward the Supper of the Lamb, with thy Saints in heauen, as to the Table, to the Cōmunion of thy Saints heere in earth: my knees are weak  but weak therfore that I should easily fall to, and  fix my selfe long

vpon my deuotions to thee.

Scarce any misery equal to sicknesse; and they are subiect to that equally, with their lowest subiect. A glasse is not the lesse brittle, because a Kings face is represented in it, nor a King the lesse brittle, because God is represented in him. They haue Phisicians continually

then they are Gods. No man is well, that vnderstands not, that values not his being well; that hath not a cheerefulnesse, and a ioy in it; and whosoeuer hath this Ioy, hath a desire to communicate, to propagate that, which occasions his happinesse, and his Ioy, to others; for euery man loues witnesses of his happinesse; and the best witnesses, are experimentall witnesses; they who haue tasted

Therefore may my words be vnderualued, and my errors aggrauated, if I offer to speak of Kings; but not by thee, O my God, because I speak of them as they are in thee, & of thee, as thou art in them.

euer, all that can any way cōduce to our happinesses, yet here also in this world, giuest vs such earnests of that full payment, as by the value of the earnest, we may giue some estimat of the tresure, humbly, and thākfully I acknowledge, that thy blessed spirit instructs mee, to make a differēce of thy blessings in this world, by that difference of the Instruments, by which it hath pleased thee to deriue them vnto me. As we see

thee heere in a glasse, so we receiue frō thee here by reflexion, & by instruments. Euen casual things come from thee; and that which we call Fortune here, hath another name aboue. Nature reaches out her hand, and giues vs corne, and wine, and oyle, and milk, but thou fillest her hand before, and thou openest her hand, that she may rain down her showres vpon vs. Industry reaches out her hand to vs, and giues vs fruits of our labor,

for our selues, & our posteritie; but thy hand guides that hand, when it sowes, and when it waters, and the increase is from thee.

hand set, ouer vs, I haue had my portion, not only in the hearing, but in the preaching of thy Gospel. Humbly beseeching thee, that as thou continuest thy wonted goodnes vpon the whol world, by the wonted meanes, & instruments, the same Sun, and Moon, the same Nature, and Industry, so to continue the same blessings vpon this State, and this Church by the same hand, so long, as that thy Son when he comes in the clouds, may

find him, or his Son, or his sonnes sonnes ready to giue an account, & able to stand in that iudgmēt, for their faithfull Stewardship, and dispensation of thy talēts so abūdantly cōmitted to them; & be to him, O God, in all distēpers of his body, in all anxieties of spirit, in all holy sadnesses of soule, such a Phisician in thy proportion, who art the greatest in heauen, as hee hath bin in soule, & body to me, in his proportiō, who is the greatst vpon earth.

                  THey haue seene me, and heard mee, arraign'd mee in these fetters, and receiu'd the euidence; I haue cut vp mine own Anatomy, diffected my selfe, and they are gon to read vpon me. O how manifold, and perplexed a thing, nay, how wanton and various a thing is ruine and destruction?

God presented to Dauid three kinds, War, Famine, and Pestilence; Satan left out these, and brought in, fires frō heauen, and windes from the wildernes. If there were no ruine but sicknes, wee see, the Masters of that Art, can scarce nūber, not name all sicknesses; euery thing that disorders a faculty, & the function of that is a sicknesse: The names wil not serue thē which are giuen frō the place affected, the Pluris

which it works, the falling sicknes is so; they cā
                     not haue names ynow, from what it does, nor where it is, but they must extort names frō what it is like, what it resembles, & b

more sicknesses thē 
                     names. If ruine were reduc'd to that one way, that Man could perish noway but by sicknes, yet his danger were infinit; and if sicknes were reduc'd to that one way, that there were no sicknes but a feuer, yet the way were infinite still; for it would ouerlode, & oppress any naturall, disorder and discompose any artificiall Mem

gone to consult, which of these sicknesses mine is, and then which of these feuers, and then what it would do, and thē how it may be countermind. But euen in ill, it is a degree of good, whē the euil wil admit consultation. In many diseases, that which is but an accident, but a symptom of the main disease, is so violēt, that the phisician must attend the cure of that, though hee pretermi
                        •
                      (so far as to intermi
                        •
                     ) the cure of the disease it self. Is it not so in

                     States too? somtimes the insolēcy of those that are great, put the people into commotions; the great disease, & the greatest danger to the Head, is the insolency of the great ones; & yet, they execute Martial law, they come to present executions vpō the people, whose commotion was indeed but a simptom, but an accident of the maine disease; but this symptom, grown so violent, wold allow no time for a consultatiō. Is it not so in the accidents of the diseases
                     
of our mind too? Is it not euidently so in our affections, in our passions? If a cholerick man be ready to strike, must I goe about to purge his choler, or to breake the blow? But where there is room for consultatiō, things are not desperate. They consult; so there is nothing rashly, incōsideratly done; and then they prescribe, the
                        •
                      
                     write, so there is nothing couertly, disguisedly, vnavowedly done. In bodily diseases it is not alwaies so; sometimes, assoon as

the Phisicians foote is in the chamber, his knife is in the patients arme; the disease would not allow a minutes forbearing of blood, nor prescribing of other remedies. In States & matter of gouernmēt it is so too; they are somtimes surprizd with such accidēts, as that the Magistrat asks not what may be done by law, but does that, which must necessarily be don in that case But it is a degree of good, in euill, a degree that ca

                      in prescribing, and in prescribing Phisick; proper and conuenient remedy: for if they shold come in again, and chide mee, for some disorder, that had occasion'd, and inducd, or that had hastned and exalted this sicknes,
                     
or if they should begin to write now rules for my dyet, and exercise when I were well, this were to antidate, or to postdate their Consultation, not to giue phisick. It were rather a vexation, then a reliefe, to tell a condemnd prisoner, you might haue liu'd if you had done this; & if you can get your pardon, you shal do wel, to take this, or this course hereafter. I am glad they know (I haue hid nothing from them) glad they consult,

(they hide nothing frō one another) glad they write (they hide nothing frō the world) glad that they write and prescribe Phisick, that there are remedies for the present case.

that thou canst not look vpon sinn, and we of so vnpure constitutions, as that wee can present no obiect but sin, and therfore might iustly

vs. There is an Eye in Nature, that kills, assoon as it sees, the eye of a Serpent; no eye in Nature, that nourishes vs by looking vpon vs; But thine Eye, O Lord, does so. Looke therefore vpon me, O Lord, in this distresse, and that will recall mee from the borders of this bodily death; Look vpon me, and that wil raise me again from that spirituall death, in which my parents buried me, when they begot mee in sinne, and in

which I haue pierced euen to the lawes of hell, by multiplying such heaps of actuall sins, vpon that foundation, that root of originall sinn. Yet take me again, into your Consultation, O blessed and glorious Trinitie; & thogh the Father know, that I haue defaced his Image receiued in my Creation; though the Son know, I haue neglected mine interest in the Redemption, yet, O blessed spirit, as thou art to my Consciēce, so be to them a witnes, that

at this minute, I accept that which I haue so often, so often, so rebelliously refused, thy blessed inspirations; be thou my witnes to them, that at more poores then this slacke body sweates teares, this sad soule weeps blood; and more for the displeasure of my God, then for the stripes of his displeasure. Take me then, O blessed, & glorious Trinitie, into a Recōsultation, and prescribe me any phisick; If it bee a long, & painful holding

of this soule in sicknes, it is phisick, if I may discern thy hand to giue it, & it is phisick, if it be a speedy departing of this Soule, if I may discerne thy hand to receiue it.

And all these are Concentrique; the common center to them all, is decay, ruine; only that is Ecoentrique, which was neuer made, only that place, or garment rather, which we can imagine, but not demonstrate, That light, which is the very emanation of the light of God, in which the Saints shall dwell, with which the Saints shall be appareld, only that bends not to this Center, to Ruine; that which was not

made of Nothing, is not threatned with this annihilation. All other things are; euen A

are least discerned; the most insensible in their wayes come to bee the most sensible in their ends.

not so dāgerous a noise, as a few whisperers, and secret plotters in corners. The Canon doth not so much hurt against a wal, as a Myne vnder the wall; nor a thousand enemies that threaten, so much as a few that take an oath to say nothing.

                        Iere. 9.21 yet he, and Death in him is come into our windowes;

into our Eyes, and Eares, the entrāces, & inlets of our soule. He works vpon vs in secret, & we doe not discerne him; And one great work of his vpon vs, is to make vs so like himselfe, as to sin in secret, that others may not see vs; But his Master-piece is, to make vs sin in secret so, as that we may not see our selus sin. For the first, the hiding of our sins from other men, hee hath induo'd that, which was his off-spring from the

beginning,
                        Io. 8.44. 
                     A lye: for man, is in Nature, yet, in posses

                     ion of some such sparkes of ingenuitie, & noblenesse, as that, but to disguise Euill, hee would not lye. The bodie, the sinne, is the Serpents, and the garment that couers it, the lye, is his too. These are his; but the hiding of sinne from our selues, is Hee himselfe: when we haue the sting of the Serpent in vs, and doe not sting our selues, the venim of sin, and no remorse for

sinn, then, as thy blessed Sonne said of Iudas, Hee is a deuill,
                     
                        Ioh. 6.70 not that he had one, but was one, so we are become deuils to our selues, and we haue not only a Serpent in our bosome, but we our selues, are to our selues that Serpent. How farre did thy seruant Dauid presse vpon thy pardon, in that petition,
                        Ps. 19.12 
                     Clense thou me from secret sinns? can any sin bee secret? for, a great part of our sinnes, though, sayes thy Prophet, we conceiue them in

                         bed, yet sayes he, We doe them in the light; there are many sins, which we glorie in doing, and would not doe, if no body should know thē. Thy blessed seruant August confesses, that hee was ashamed of his shamefastnes, and tendernesse of Conscience, and that he often be lied himself with sinnes, which he neuer did, lest he should be vnacceptable to his sinfull companions. But if we would conceale them, (thy Pr

                        Gen. 4.10. will tell thee of Cains murder; the Heauens themselues will tell thee Heauē shal reueale his iniquity;
                        Ier. 20.27. a smal creature alone, shall doe it,
                        Eccle. 10.20. 
                     A bird of the ayre shall carry the voice, and tell the matter: Thou wilt trouble no Informer, thou thy

selfe reuealedst Adams sin,
                        Gen. 3.8. to thy selfe; And the manifestation of sin is so ful to thee,
                        Eccles. 12.14. as that thou shalt reueale all to all, Thou shalt bring euery worke to Iudgement, with euery secret thing, and there is nothing couered, that shall not bee reuealed:
                        Mat. 10.26. But, O my God, there is another way of knowing my sins, which thou louest better then any of these; To know them by my Confession. As Phisicke works so, it drawes the peccant humour to it selfe,

that when it is gathered together, the weight of it selfe may carry that humour away, so thy Spirit returns to my Memory my former sinnes, that being so recollected, they may powre out them

of Confession so well, as that thou scarce leauest any new Mercy for the action it selfe. This Mercy thou leauest, that thou armest vs thereupon, against relapses into the sinnes which wee haue confessed. And that mercy, which thy seruant Augustine apprehends, when he sayes to thee, Thou hast forgiuē me those sinnes which I haue done, and those sinnes which only by thy grace I haue not done: they were done in our inclination to them,

and euen that inclination needs thy mercy, and that Mercy he calls a Pardon. And these are most truly secret sinnes, because they were neuer done, and because no other man, nor I my selfe, but onely thou knowest, how many and how great sinnes I haue scaped by thy grace, which without that, I should haue multiplied against thee.

                  O Eternall, and most gracious God, who as thy Sonne Christ Iesus, though hee knew all things, yet said hee knew not the day of Iudgement, because he knew it not so, as that he might tell it vs; so though thou knowest all my sins, yet thou knowest them not to my comfort, except thou know them by my telling them to th
                        •
                     e, how shall I bring to thy knowledg by that way,

those sinns, which I my selfe know not? If I accuse my selfe of Originall sin, wilt thou ask me if I know what originall sin is? I know not enough of it to satisfie others, but I know enough to condemne my self, & to solicit thee. If I confesse to thee the sinnes of my youth, wilt thou aske me, if I know what those sins were? I know them not so well, as to name them all, nor am sure to liue houres enough to name them al, (for I did

thē then, faster then I can speak them now, when euery thing that I did, conduc'd to some sinne) but I know thē so well, as to know, that nothing but thy mercy is so infinite as they. If the naming of Sinnes, of Thought, Word, and Deed, of sinns of Omission, and of Action, of sins against thee, against my neighbour, and against my self, of sinns vnrepented, and sinnes relapsed into after Repentance, of sinnes of Ignorance, and sinnes against

the testimonie of my Conscience, of sinnes against thy Commaundements, sinnes against thy Sonnes Prayer, and sinns against our owne Creed, of sins against the laws of that Church, & sinnes against the lawes of that State, in which thou hast giuen mee my station, If the naming o
                        •
                      these sinnes reach not home to all mine, I know what will; O Lord pardon me, me, all those sinnes, which thy Sonne Christ Iesus suffered for,

who suffered for all the sinnes of all the world; for there is no sinne amongst all those which had not been my sinne, if thou hadst not beene my God, and antidated me a pardon in thy preuenting grace. And since sinne in the nature of it, retaines still so much of the author of it, that it is a Serpent, insensibly insinuating it selfe, into my Soule, let thy brazen Serpent, (the contemplation of thy Sonne crucified for me) be euermore

present to me, for my recouery against the sting of the first Serpent; That so, as I haue a Lyon against a Lyon, The Lyon of the Tribe of Iudah, against that Lyon, that seekes whom hee may deuoure, so I may haue a Serpent against a Serpent, the Wisedome of the Serpent, against the Malice of the Serpent, And, both against that Lyon, and Serpent, forcible, and subtill tentations, Thy Doue with thy Oliue, in thy Arke, Humilitie,

                     monstration, that all the Greatnes of this world, is built vpon opinion of others, and hath in it self no reall being, nor power of subsistence, then from the heart of man? It is alwayes in Action, and motion, still busie, still pretending to doe all, to furnish all the powers, and faculties with all that they haue; But if an 
                        •
                     nemy dare rise vp against it, it is the soonest endangered, the soonest defeated of any part.

The Braine will hold out longer then it, and the Liuer longer then that; They will endure a Siege; but an vnnatural heat, a rebellious heat, will blow vp the heart, like a Myne, in a minute. But howsoeuer, since the Heart hath the birthright, and Primogeniture, and that it is Natures eldest Sonne in vs, the part which is first borne to life in man, and that the other parts, as younger brethren, and seruants in this family, haue a dependance

vpon it, it is reason that the principall care bee had of it, though it bee not the strongest part; as the eldest is oftentimes not the strongest of the family. And since the Braine, and Liuer, and Heart, hold not a Triumuirate in Man, a Soueraigntie equally shed vpon them all, for his well-being, as the foure Elements doe, for his very being, but the Heart alone is in the Principalitie, and in the Throne, as

                     King, the rest as Subiects, though in eminent Place, and Office, must contribute to that, as Children to their Parents, as all persons to all kindes of Superiours, though oftētimes, those Parents, or those Superiours, bee not of stronger parts, then themselues, that serue and obey them that are weaker; Neither doth this Obligation fall vpon vs, by second Dictates of Nature, by Consequences, and Conclusions arising

out of Nature, or deriu'd from Nature, by Discourse, (as many things binde vs, euen by the Law of Nature, and yet not by the primarie Law of Nature; as all Lawes of Proprietie in that which we possesse, are of the Law of Nature, which law is, To giue euery one his owne, and yet in the primarie law of Nature, there was no Proprietie, no Meum & Tuum, but an vniuersall Communitie ouer all; So the obedience

of Superiours, is of the law of Nature, and yet in the primarie law of Nature, there was no Superioritie, no Magistracie;) but this contribution of assistance of all to the Soueraigne, of all parts to the Heart, is from the very first dictates of Nature; which is in the first place, to haue care of our owne Preseruation, to looke first to our selues; for therefore doth the Phisician intermit the present care of Braine, or

                     Liuer, because there is a possibilitie, that they may subsist, though there bee not a present and a particular care had of them, but there is no possibilitie that they can subsist, if the Heart perish: and so, when we seeme to begin with others, in such assistances, indeed wee doe beginne with our selues, and wee our selues are principally in our contemplation; and so all these officious, and mutuall assistances,

are but complements towards others, and our true end is our selues. And this is the reward of the paines of Kings; sometimes they neede the power of law, to be obeyd; and when they seeme to be obey'd voluntarily, they who doe it, doe it for their owne sakes. O how little a thing is all the greatnes of man, and through how false glasses doth he make shift to multiply it, and magnifie it to himselfe? And yet this

is also another misery of this King of man, the Heart, which is also applyable to the Kings of this world, great men, that the venime & poy

                     on of euery pestilentiall disease directs it selfe to the heart, affects that, (pernicious affection,) and the malignity of ill men, is also directed vpon the greatest, and the best; and not only greatnesse, but goodnesse looses the vigour of beeing an Antidote, or Cordiall against it. And as the

noblest, and most generous Cordialls that Nature or Art afford, or can prepare, if they be often taken, and made familiar, become no Cordialls, nor haue any extraordinary operation, so the greatest Cordiall of the Heart, patience, if it bee much exercis'd, exalts the venim and the malignity of the Enemy, and the more we suffer, the more wee are insulted vpon. When God had made this Earth of nothing, it was but a little

helpe, that he had, to make other things of this Earth: nothing can be neerer nothing, then this Earth; and yet how little of this Earth, is the greatest Man? Hee thinkes he treads vpon the Earth, that all is vnder his fe

bush growing vpon that Turfe of Earth. How litle of the world is the Earth? And yet that is all, that Man hath, or is. How little of a Man is the Heart; and yet it is all, by which he is: and this continually subiect, not onely to forraine poysons, conueyed b
                        •
                      others, but to intestine poysons bred in our selues by pestilentiall sicknesses. O who, if before hee had a beeing, he could haue sense

of this miserie, would buy a being here vpon these conditions?

question, makes the answere, I the Lord search the Heart. When didst thou search mine? Dost thou thinke to finde it, as thou madest it in Adam? Thou hast searched since, and found all these gradations in the ill of our Hearts,
                     
                        Gen. 6.5 
                     That euery imagination, of the thoughts of our hearts, is onely euill continually. Doest thou remember this, and wouldest thou haue my Heart? O God of all light, I know thou knowest all; and it is

Thou hast declared vnto mee, in thy Word, That for all this deluge of euill, that hath surrunded all Hearts, yet thou soughtest and foundest a man after thine owne heart,
                     1 Sam. 13 14. That thou couldest and wouldest giue thy people Pastours according to thine owne heart;
                        Ier. 3.15. And I can gather out of thy

                     Word, so good testimony of the hearts of men, as to finde single hearts, docile, and apprehensiue hearts; Hearts that can, Hearts that haue learnt; wise hearts, in one place, and in another, in a great degree, wise, perfit hearts; straight hearts, no peruersnesse without, and cleane hearts, no foulenesse within; such hearts I can find in thy Word; and if my heart were such a heart, I would giue thee my Heart. But I find stonie
                     
hearts too, and I haue made mine such: I haue found Hearts,
                     
                        Ezech. 11 19.

                        Eccles. 7.26. and the fuell of Lust, and Enuie, and Ambition, hath inflamed mine; Hearts in which their Masters trust, And hee that trusteth in his owne heart,

But yet as long as I remaine in this great Hospitall, this sicke, this diseasefull

world, as long as I remaine in this leprous house, this flesh of mine, this Heart, though thus prepared for thee, prepared by thee, will still be subiect to the inuasion of maligne and pestilent vapours. But I haue my Cordialls in thy promise;1. Reg. 8.38.

                  O Eternall, and most gracious God, who in thy vpper house, the Heauens, though there bee many Mansions, yet art alike, and equally in euery Mansion, but heere in thy lower house, though thou fillest

all, yet art otherwise in some roomes thereof, then in others, otherwise in thy Church, then in my Chamber, and otherwise in thy Sacraments, then in my Prayers, so though thou bee alwayes present, and alwayes working in euery roome of this thy House, my body, yet I humbly beseech thee to manifest alwayes a more effectuall presence in my heart, then in the other Offices. Into the house of

thine Annoynted, disloyall persons, Traitors will come; Into thy House, the Church, Hypocrites, and Idolatrers will come; Into some Roomes of this thy House, my Body, Tentations will come, Infections will come, but bee my Heart, thy Bedchamber, O my God, and thither let them not enter. Iob made a Couenant with his Eyes, but not his making of that Couenant, but thy dwelling in his heart, enabled

him to keepe that Couenaunt. Thy Sonne himselfe had a sadnesse in his Soule to death, and hee had a reluctation, a deprecation of death, in the approaches thereof; but hee had his Cordiall too, Yet not my will, but thine bee done. And as thou hast not deliuered vs, thine adopted sonnes, from these infectious tentations, so neither hast thou deliuered vs ouer to them, nor withheld thy Cordialls from vs. I was baptized in

thy Cordiall water, against Originall sinne, and I haue drunke of thy Cordiall Blood, for my recouerie, from actuall, and habituall sinne in the other Sacrament. Thou, O Lord, who hast imprinted all medicinall vertues, which are in all creatures, and hast made euen the flesh of Vipers, to assist in Cordialls, art able to make this present sicknesse, euerlasting health, this weaknes, euerlasting strēgth,

and this very deiection, and faintnesse of heart, a powerfull Cordiall. When thy blessed Sonne cryed out to thee, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken mee, thou diddest reach out thy hand to him; but not to deliuer his sad soule, but to receiue his holy soule; Neither did hee longer desire to hold it of thee, but to recommend it to thee. I see thine hand vpon mee now, O Lord, and I aske not why it comes,

what it intends: whether thou wilt bidde it stay still in this Body, for some time, or bidd it meet thee this day in Paradise, I aske not, not in a wish, not in a thought: Infirmitie of Nature, Curiositie of Minde, are tentations that offer; but a silent, and absolute obedience, to thy will, euen before I know it, is my Cordiall. Preserue that to mee, O my God, and that will preserue mee to thee; that when thou hast

                     Catechised mee with affliction here, I may take a greater degree, and serue thee in a higher place, in thy kingdome of ioy, and glory. Amen.

                  VVHat will not kill a man, if a

                     vapor will? how great an Elephant, how small a Mouse destroyes? to dye by a bullet is the Souldiers dayly bread; but few men dye by haile-shot: A man is more worth, then to bee sold for single money; a life to be valued aboue a trifle. If this were a violent shaking of the Ayre by Thunder, or by Canon, in that case the Ayre is condensed aboue the thicknesse of water, of water baked into Ice, almost petrified,
                     
almost made stone, and no wonder that that kills; but that that which is but a vapor, and a vapor not forced, but breathed, should kill, that our Nourse should ouerlay vs, and Ayre, that nourishes vs, should destroy vs, but that it is a halfe Atheisme to murmure against Nature, who is Gods immediate Commissioner, who would not think himselfe miserable to bee put into the hands of Nature, who does

not only set him vp for a marke for others to shoote at, but delights her selfe to blow him vp like a glasse, till shee see him breake, euen with her owne breath? nay if this infectious vapor were sought for, or trauail'd to, as Plinie hunted after the vapor of Aetna and dard, and challenged Death in the forme of a vapor to doe his worst, and felt the worst, he dyed; or if this vapor were met withall in an ambush,
                     
and we surprized with it, out of a long shut

                     Well, or out of a new opened Myne, who wold lament, who would accuse, when we had nothing to accuse, none to lament against, but Fortune, who is lesse then a vapour: But when our selues are the Well, that breaths out this exhalation, the Ouen that spits out this fiery smoke, the Myne that spues out this suffocating, and strangling dampe, who can euer after this, aggrauate

his sorrow, by this Circumstance, That it was his Neighbor, his familiar friend, his brother that destroyed him, and destroyed him with a whispering, & a calumniating breath, when wee our selues doe it to our selues by the same meanes, kill our selues with our owne vapors? Or if these occasions of this selfe-destruction, had any contribution from our owne wils, any assistance from our owne intentions, nay frō
                     
our owne errors, wee might diuide the rebuke, & chide our selues as much as them. Feuers vpon wilful distempers of drinke, and surfets, Consumptions vpon intē
                     perances, & licentiousnes, Madnes vpon misplacing, or ouer-bending our naturall faculties, proceed from our selues, and so, as that our selues are in the plot, and wee are not onely passiue, but actiue too, to our owne destruction; But what

haue I done, either to breed, or to breath these vapors? They tell me it is my Melancholy; Did I infuse, did I drinke in Melancholly into my selfe? It is my thoughtfulnesse; was I not made to thinke? It is my study; doth not my Calling call for that

                      I haue don nothing, wilfully, peruersly toward it, yet must suffer in it, die by it; There are too many Examples of men, that haue bin their own executioners, and that haue

made hard shift to bee so; some haue alwayes had poyson about them, in a hollow ring vpō their finger, and some in their Pen that they vsed to write with: some haue beat out their braines at the wal of their prison, and some haue eate the fire out of their chimneys:

I doe nothing vpon my selfe, and yet am mine owne Executioner. And we haue heard of death, vpon small occasions, and by scornefull instruments; a pinne, a combe, a haire, pulled, hath gangred, & killd; But when I haue said, a vapour, if I were asked again, what is a vapour, I could not tell, it is so insensible a thing; so neere nothing is that that red

                     Naturall bodies, to any Politike body, to a State. That which is fume in vs, is in a State, Rumor, and these vapours in vs, which wee consider here pestilent, and infectious fumes, are in a State infectious rumors, detracting and dishonourable Calumnies, Libels. The Heart in that body is the King; and the Braine, his Councell; and the whole Magistracie, that ties all toge

the life of all is Honour, and iust respect, and due reuerence; and therfore, when these vapors, these venimous rumors, are directed against these Noble parts, the whole body suf

                     ers. But yet for all their priuiledges, they are not priuiledged from our misery; that as the vapours most pernitious to vs, arise in our owne bodies, so doe the most dishonorable rumours, and those that wound a State most, arise at home. What ill

                     ayre, that I could haue met in the street, what channell, what shambles, what dunghill, what vault, could haue hurt mee so much, as these home-bredd vapours? What fugitiue, what Almes-man of any forraine State, can doe so much harme, as a Detracter, a Libeller, a scornefull Iester at home? For, as they that write of Poysons, and of creatures naturally disposed to the ruine of Man, do as well mention the Flea,
                     
as the Viper, because the Flea,

fire of hell. But hast thou afforded vs no means to euaporate these smokes, to withdraw these vapors? When thine Angels fell from heauen, thou tookst into thy care, the reparatiō of that place, & didst it, by assuming, by drawing vs thither

thy Son. So that though our last act be an ascending to glory, (we shall ascend to the place of Angels) yet our first act is to goe the way of thy Sonn, descending, and the way of thy blessed spirit too, who descended in the Doue. Therefore hast thou bin pleased to afford vs this remedy in Nature, by this application of a Doue, to our lower parts, to make these vapors in our bodies, to descend, and to make that a type to vs,

Let vs draw down the vapors of our own pride, our own wits, our own wils, our own inuētions, to the simplicitie of thy Sacraments, & the obedience of thy word, and these Doues, thus applied, shall make vs liue.

                      We say that the Firmament is full of starres; as

though it were equally full; but we know, that there are more stars vnder the Northerne, then vnder the Southern Pole. Wee say, the Elements of man are misery, and happinesse, as though he had an equal proportion of both, and the dayes of man vicissitudinary, as though he had as many good daies, as ill, and that he liud vnder a perpetuall Equinoctial, night, and day equall, good and ill fortune in the same measure. But it is far frō
                     
that; hee drinkes misery, & he tastes happinesse; he mowes misery, and hee gleanes happinesse; hee iournies in misery, he does but walke in happinesse; and which is worst, his misery is positiue, and dogmaticall, his happinesse is but disputable, and problematicall; All men call Misery, Misery, but Happinesse changes the name, by the taste of man.

                     y bee as much discomfort in this, That the malignitie may bee so great, as that all that they can doe, shall doe nothing; That an enemy declares himselfe, then, when he is able to subsist, and to pursue, and to atchiue his ends, is no great comfort. In intestine Conspiracies, voluntary

Confessions doe more good, then confessions vpon the Rack; In these Infections, when Nature her selfe confesses, and cries out by these outward declarations, which she is able to put forth of her selfe, they minister comfort; but when all is by the strength of Cordials, it is but a Confession vpon the Racke, by which though wee come to knowe the malice of that man, yet wee doe not knowe, whether

there bee not as much malice in his heart then, as before his confession; we are sure of his Treason, but not of of his Repentance; sure of him, but not of his Complices. It is a faint comfort to know the worst, when the worst is remedilesse; and a weaker then that, to know much ill, & not to know, that that is the worst. A woman is comforted with the birth of her Son, her body is eased of a burthen; but if shee

could prophetically read his History, how ill a man, perchance how ill a sonne, he would proue, shee should receiue a greater burthē into her Mind. Scarce any purchase that is not cloggd with secret encumbrāces; scarce any happines, that hath not in it so much of the nature of false and base money, as that the Allay is more then the Mettall. Nay is it not so, (at least much towards it) euen in the exercise of Vertues? I must bee

poore, and want, before I can exercise the vertue of Gratitude; miserable, and in torment, before I can exercise the vertue of patience; How deepe do we dig, and for how course gold? And what other Touch-stone haue we of our gold, but comparison? Whether we be as happy, as others, or as our selus at other times; O poore stepp toward being well, when these spots do only tell vs, that we are worse, then we were sure of before.

                     Lord, if thou looke for a spotlesnesse, whom wilt thou looke vpon? Thy mercy may goe a great way in my soule, & yet not leaue me without spots; Thy corrections may go far, & burn deepe, and yet not leaue me spotles: thy children apprehended that, whē they said,

                        Sap. 13.14. 
                     The Caruers of Images couer spotts, sayes the Wise man; When we hide our spotts, wee become Idolatrers of our owne staines, of our

own foulenesses. But if my spots come forth, by what meanes soeuer, whether by the strēgth of Nature, by voluntary confessiō, (for Grace is the Nature of a Regenerate man, and the power of Grace is the strength of Nature) or by the vertue of Cordialls, (for euē thy Corrections are Cordials) if they come forth either way, thou receiuest that Confession with a gracious Interpretation.
                        Gen. 30.33. When thy seruant Iacob practised an Inuention to procure spotts in

his sheepe, thou diddest prosper his Rodds; and thou dost prosper thine owne Rodds, when corrections procure the discouery of our spotts, the humble manifestation of our sinns to thee; Till then thou maist iustly say, The whole need not the Phisician;

                        Iob 11.15. 
                     Lord, lift vp my face without spot, and

be stedfast, and not feare. Euen my spotts belong to thy Sonnes body, and are part of that, which he came downe to this earth, to fetch, and challenge, and assume to himselfe. When I open my spotts, I doe but present him with that which is His, and till I do so, I detaine, & withhold his right. VVhen therfore thou seest them vpon me, as His, and seest them by this way of Confession, they shall not appear to me, as the

                     pinches of death, to decline my feare to Hell; (for thou hast not left th

that phrase, That the house is visited, And that, that thy markes, and thy tokens are vpon the patient; But what a wretched, and disconsolate Hermitage is that House, which is not visited by thee, and what a Wayue, and Stray is that Man, that hath not thy Markes vpon him? These hea

If we consider Eternity, into that, Tyme neuer Entred; Eternity is not an euerlasting flux of Tyme; but Tyme is as a short parenthesis in a longe period; and Eternity had bin the same, as it is, though time had

And yet the best things are Nothing without that. Honors, Pleasures, Possessions, presented to vs, out of time, in our decrepit, and distasted, & vnapprehensiue Age, loose

their office, & loose their Name; They are not Honors to vs, that shall neuer appeare, nor come abroad into the Eyes of the people, to receiue Honor, from them who giue it: Nor pleasures to vs, who haue lost our sense to taste them
                        •
                      nor possessions to vs, who are departing from the possession of them. Youth is their Criticall Day; that Iudges them, that Denominates them, that inanimates, and informes them, and makes them

                     Honors, and pleasures, and possessions, & when they come in an vnapprehensiue Age, they come as a Cordiall when the bell rings out, as a Pardon, when the Head is off. We reioyce in the Comfort of fire, but does any Man cleaue to it at Midsomer; Wee are glad of the freshnesse, & coolenes of a Vault, but does any Man keepe his Christmas there; or are the pleasures of the Spring acceptable in Autumne? If happinesse be

in the season, or in the Clymate, how much happier then are Birdes then Men, who can change the Climate, and accompanie, and enioy the same season euer.

Though thou remoue them from being of the Essence of our Saluation, thou leauest them for assistances, and for the Exaltation of our Deuotion, to fix our selues, at certaine periodicall, & stationary times, vpon the consideration

of those things, which thou hast done for vs, and the Crisis, the triall, the iudgment, how those things haue wrought vpon vs, and disposed vs to a spirituall recouery, and conualescence. For there is to euery man a day of saluation,

So far thē our daies must be criticall to vs, as that by consideration of them, we may make a Iudgment of our spiritual health; for that is the crisis of our bodily health; Thy beloued seruant S.

dayes) they would not haue been partakers of the bloud of the Prophets; And shal we who are in the day, these Daies, not of the Prophets, but of the Son, stone those Prophets againe, and crucifie that Son againe, for all those euident Indications, and critical Iudicatures which are afforded vs? Those opposd aduersaries of thy Son, the pharises with the Herodiās, watch'd a Critical day; Then whē the State was incensd against him,
                        Mat. 22.15: 
                     they came to

tempt him in the dāgerous question of Tribute. They left him, & that day was the Critical day to the Saduces, The same day, saies thy Spirit, in thy word, the Saduces came to him to question him about the Resurrection;
                        V. 23. and them hee silenc'd; They left him; & this was the Criticall day for the Scribe, expert in the Law, who thoght himselfe learneder then the Herodian,
                     
                        V. 34. the Pharise or Saduce; and he tēpted him about the great Commādement; & him

left without power of replying. When all was done, & that they wēt about to begin their circle of vexation, and tentation again, Christ silē
                     ces them so, that, as they had taken their Criticall dayes, to come, in That, and in that day, so Christ imposes a Criticall day vpon them, From that day forth,
                     
                        V. 46. saies thy Spirit, no man durst aske him any more questions. This, O my God, my most blessed God, is a fearefull Crisis, a fearefull Indication,
                     
when we will study, and seeke, and finde, what dayes are fittest to forsake thee in; To say, Now, Religion is in a Neutralitie in the world, and this is my day, the day of libertie; Now I may make new friends by changing my old religiō, and this is my day, the day of aduancement. But O my God, with thy seruāt Iacobs holy boldnes, who though thou lamedst him,
                     
                        Gen. 32.26. 
                     would not let thee goe, till thou hadst giuen him a blessing, Though thou

haue laid me vpon my hearse, yet thou shalt not depart from mee, from this bed, till thou haue giuen me a Crisis, a Iudgment vpon my selfe this day.
                     2 Pet. 3.8 Since a day is as a thousand yeres with thee, Let, O Lord, a day, be as a weeke to me; and in this one, let me cōsider seuen daies, seuen critical daies, and iudge my selfe, that I be not iudged by thee. First, this is the day of thy visitatiō, thy comming to me; and would I looke to be welcome to thee,

and not entertaine thee

We measure not the visitations of great persons, by their apparel, by their equipage, by the solemnity of their cōming, but by their very cōming; and therefore, howsoeuer thou come, it is a Crisis to me, that thou wouldest not loose me, who seekst me by any means. This leads me from my first day, thy visitation by sicknes, to a secōd, to th

And hauing, O my God, walkd with thee these three dayes, The day of thy visitation, the day of my Conscience, The day of preparing for this seale of Reconciliation, I am the lesse afraid

of the clouds or storms of my fourth day, the day of my dissolution & trāsmigratiō
                      frō hence. Nothing deserues the name of happines, that makes the remēbrāce of death bitter;

                           〈◊〉
                         bitter is the remēbrance of thee, to a man that liues at rest, in his possessions, the Man that hath Nothing to vexe him, yea vnto him, that is able to receiue meat? Therefore hast thou, O my God, made this sicknes, in which I am not able to receiue meate,

my fasting day, my Eue, to this great festiual, my dissolution. And this day of death shall deliuer me ouer to my fift day, the day of my Resurrection; for how long a day soeuer thou make that day in the graue, yet there is no day between that, and the Resurrection. Then wee shall all bee inuested, reapparelled in our owne bodies; but they who haue made iust vse of their former dayes, be superinuested with glorie,
                     
wheras the others, condemned to their olde clothes, their sinfull bodies, shall haue Nothing added, but immortalitie to torment. And this day of awaking me, and reinuesting my Soule, in my body, and my body in the body of Christ, shall present mee, Bodie, and Soule, to my sixt day, The day of Iudgement; which is truely, and most literally, the Critical, the Decretory day; both because all Iudgement shall bee manifested to me then,

and I shall assist in iudging the world then

                  14. PRAYER.
                  O Eternall and most gracious God, who though thou didst permit  darknesse to be before light in the Creation, yet in the making of light, didst so multiplie that light, as that it enlightned not the day only, but the night too, though thou haue suffered some dimnesse, some clouds of sadnesse & disconsolatenesse to shed themselues vpon my soule, I humbly blesse

and thankfully glorifie thy holy name, that thou hast afforded mee the light of thy spirit, against which the prince of darkenesse cannot preuaile, nor hinder his illumination of our darkest nights, of our saddest thoughts. Euen the visitation of thy most blessed Spirit, vpon the blessed Virgin, is called an ouershadowing: There wa
                        •
                      the presence of the Holy Ghost, the fountaine of all light, and yet an ouershadowing; Nay

except there were some light, there could bee no shadow. Let thy mercifull prouidence so gouerne all in this sicknesse, that I neuer fall into vtter darknesse, ignorance of thee, or inconsideration of my selfe; and let those shadowes which doe fall vpon mee, faintnesses of Spirit, and condemnations of my selfe, bee ouercome by the power of thine irresistible light, the God of consolation; that when those shadowes haue done their office

vpon mee, to let me see, that of my selfe I should fall into irrecouerable darknesse, thy spirit may doe his office vpon those shadowes, and disperse them, and establish mee in so bright a day here, as may bee a Criticall day to me, a day wherein, and whereby I may giue thy Iudgement vpon my selfe, and that the words of thy sonne, spoken to his Apostles, may reflect vpon me,

                  15. MEDITATION.
                  NAturall Men haue cōceiued a two fold vse of sleepe; That it is a refreshing of the body in this life; That it is a preparing of the soule for the next; That it is a feast, and it is the Grace at that feast; That it is our recreation, and cheeres vs, and it is our Catechisme, and instructs

vs; wee lie downe in a hope, that wee shall rise the stronger; and we lie downe in a knowledge, that wee may rise no more. Sleepe is an Opiate which giues vs rest, but such an Opiate, as perchance, being vnder it, we shall wake no more. But though naturall men, who haue induced secondary and figuratiue considerations, haue found out this second, this emblematicall vse of sleepe, that it should be a representation of death,

God, who wrought and perfected his worke, before Nature began, (for Nature was but his apprentice, to learne in the first seuen daies, and now is his foreman, and works next vnder him) God, I say, intended sleepe onely for the refreshing of man by bodily rest, and not for a figure of death, for he intended not death it selfe then. But Man hauing induced death vpon himselfe, God hath taken Mans Creature, death, into his hand, and mended

it; and whereas it hath in it selfe a fearefull forme and aspect, so that Man is afraid of his own Creature, God presents it to him, in a familiar, in an assiduous, in an agreeable, and acceptable forme, in sleepe, that so when hee awakes from sleepe, and saies to himselfe, shall I bee no otherwise when I am dead, than I was euen now, when I was asleep, hee may bee ashamed of his waking dreames, and of his Melancholique fancying out a hor
                        •
                     id and

an affrightfull figure of that death which is so like sleepe. As then wee need sleepe to liue out our threescore and ten yeeres, so we need death, to liue that life which we cannot out-liue. And as death being our enemie, God allowes vs to defend our selues against it (for wee victuall ou
                        •
                      selues against death, twice euery day, as often as we eat) so God hauing so sweetned death vnto vs, as hee hath in sleepe, wee put our selues into our

                     Enemies hands once euery day; so farre, as sleepe is death; and sleepe is as much death, as meat is life. This then is the misery of my sicknesse, That death as it is produced from mee, and is mine owne Creature, is now before mine Eies, but in that forme, in which God hath mollified it to vs, and made it acceptable, in sleepe, I cannot see it: how many prisoners, who haue euen hollowed themselues their graues vpon

that Earth, on which they haue lion long vnder heauie fetters, yet at this houre are

I cannot; and oh, if I be entring now into Eternitie, where there shall bee no more distinction of houres, why is it al my businesse

now to tell Clocks? why is none of the heauinesse of my heart, dispensed into mine Eie-lids,

                  MY God, my God, I know, (for thou hast said it) That he that keepeth Israel,
                        Psa. 121.1. 
                     shall neither slumber, nor sleepe: But shall not that Israel, ouer whom thou watchest, sleepe? I know, (for thou hast said it) that there are Men,2 Pet. 2.3. 
                     whose damnation sleepeth not; but shall not they to whom thou art Saluation,

my waking: for since I finde thy whole hand light, shall any finger of that hand seeme heauy? since the whole sicknesse is thy Physicke, shall any accident in it, bee my poison, by my murmuring? The name of Watchmen belongs to our profession; Thy Prophets are not onely seers, indued with a power of seeing, able to see, but Watchmen, euermore in the Act of seeing. And therefore giue me leaue, O my blessed

                     God, to inuert the words of thy Sonnes Spouse; she said,
                        Can. 5.8 
                     I sleepe, but my heart waketh; I say, I wake, but my heart sleepeth; My body is in a sicke wearinesse, but my soule in a peacefull rest with thee; and as our eies, in our health, see not the Aire, that is next them, nor the fire, nor the spheares, nor stop vpon any thing, till they come to starres, so my eies, that are open, see nothing of this world, but passe through all that, and fix

themselues vpon thy peace, and ioy, and glory aboue. Almost as soone as thy Apostle had said, Let vs not sleepe,
                     1 Thes. 5.6. lest we should be too much discomforted, if we did, he saies againe,
                        vers. 10. 
                     whether we wake or sleepe, let vs liue together with Christ. Though then this absence of sleepe, may argue the presence of death (the Originall may exclude the Copie, the life, the picture) yet this gentle sleepe, and rest of my soule betroths mee to

thee, to whom I shall bee married indissolubly, though by this way of dissolution.

sinned euen in that fulnesse, when I haue been at thy table, by a negligent examination, by a wilfull preuarication, in receiuing that heauenly food and Physicke.

in Turky. How would hee haue enlarged himselfe, if he had beene my fellow Prisoner in this sicke bed, so neere to that steeple, which neuer ceases, no more than the harmony of the spheres, but is more heard. When the Turkes tooke Constantinople, they melted the Bells into Ordnance; I haue heard both Bells and Ordnance, but neuer been so much affected with those, as with these Bells.

                     rued it. And when these Bells tell me, that now one, and now another is buried, must not I acknowledge, that they haue the correction due to me, and paid the debt that I owe? There is a story of a Bell in a Monastery,

                      which, when

any of the house was sicke to death, rung alwaies voluntarily, and they knew the ineuitablenesse of the danger by that. It rung once, when no man was sick; but the next day one of the house, fell from the steeple, and died, and the Bell held the reputation of a Prophet still. If these Bells that warne to a Funerall now, were appropriated to none, may not I, by the houre of the funerall, supply? How many men that stand at an

                     and, which he might vse. But as when men see many of their owne professions preferd, it ministers a hope that that may light vpon them; so when these hourely Bells tell me of so many funerals of men like me, it presents, if not a desire that it may, yet a comfort whensoeuer mine shall come.
               
               
                  
                  16. EXPOSTVLATION.
                  MY God, my God, I doe not expostulate with thee, but with them, who dare doe that: Who dare expostulate with thee, when in the voice of thy Church, thou giuest allowance, to this Ceremony of Bells at funeralls. Is it enough to refuse it, because it was in vse amongst the Gentiles? so were funeralls too. Is it because some abuses may haue

crept in, amongst Christians? Is that enough, that their ringing hath been said to driue away euill spirits? Truly, that is so farre true, as that the euill spirit is vehemently vexed in their ringing, therefore, because that action brings the Congregation together, and vnites God and his people, to the destruction of that Kingdome, which the euill spirit vsurps. In the first institution of thy Church, in this world, in the foundation of

thy Militant Church, amongst the Iewes, thou didst appoint the calling of the assembly in,
                        Num. 10 1. to bee by Trumpet, and when they were in, then thou gauest them the sound of Bells, in the garment of thy Priest
                     
                        •
                      In the Triumphant Church,
                     
                        Exo. 18. thou imploiest both too, but in an inuerted Order, we enter into the Triumphant Church by the sound of Bells, (for we enter when we die;) And then we receiue our further edification, or consummation,
                     
by the sound of Trumpets, at the Resurrection. The sound of thy Trumpets thou didst impart to secular a
                        •
                     d ciuill vses too, but the sound of Bells onely to sacred; Lord let not vs breake the Communion of Saints, in that which was intended for the aduancement of it; let not that pull vs asunder frō one another, which was intended for the assembling of vs, in the Militant, and associating of vs to the Triumphant

Church. But he for whose funerall these Bells ring now, was at home, at his iournies end, yesterday; why ring they now? A Man, that is a world, is all the things in the world; Hee is an Army, and when an Army marches, the Vaunt may lodge to night, where the Reare comes not till to morrow. A man extends to his Act and to his example; to that which he does, and that which he teaches; so doe those things that concerne

him, so doe these bells; That which rung yesterday, was to conuay him out of the world, in his vaunt, in his soule
                           •
                        
                      that which rung to day, was to bring him in his Reare, in his body, to the Church; And this continuing of ringing after his entring, is to bring him to mee in the application. Where I lie, I could heare the Psalme, and did ioine with the Congregation in it; but I could not heare the Sermon, and these latter

                     bells are a repetition Sermon to mee. But, O my God, my God, doe I, that haue this feauer, need other remembrances of my Mortalitie? Is not mine owne hollow voice, voice enough to pronounce that to me? Need I looke vpon a Deaths-head in a Ring, that haue one in my face? or goe for death to my Neighbours house, that haue him in my bosome? We cannot, wee cannot, O my God, take in too many helps for religious

                     duties; I know I cannot haue any better Image of thee, than thy Sonne, nor any better Image of him, than his Gospell: yet must not I, with thanks confesse to thee, that some historicall pictures of his, haue sometimes put mee vpon better Meditations than otherwise I should haue fallen vpon? I know thy Church needed not to haue taken in from Iew or Gentile, any supplies for the exaltation of thy glory, or our deuotion; of absolute necessitie
                     
I know 
                        •
                     hee needed not; But yet wee owe thee our thanks, that thou hast giuen her leaue to doe so, and that as in making vs Christians, thou diddest not destroy that which wee were before, naturall men, so in the exalting of our religious deuotions no
                        •
                      we are Christians, thou hast beene pleased to continue to vs those assistances which did worke vpon the affections of naturall men before: for thou louest a good man,
                     
as thou louest a good Christian: and though Grace bee meerely from thee, yet thou doest not plant Grace but in good natures.
                  
               
               
                  16. PRAYER.
                  O Eternall and most gracious God, who hauing consecrated our liuing bodies, to thine owne Spirit, and made vs Temples of the holy Ghost, doest also requir
                        •
                      a respect to bee giuen to

these Temples, euen when the Priest is gone out of them, To these bodies, when the soule is departed from them; I blesse, and glorifie thy Name, that as thou takest care in our life, of euery haire of our head, so doest thou also of euery graine of ashes after our death. Neither doest thou only doe good to vs all, in life and death, but also wouldest haue vs doe good to one another, as in a holy life, so in those things which accompanie

our death: In that Contemplation I make account that I heare this dead brother of ours, who is now carried out to his buriall, to speake to mee, and to preach my funerall Sermon, in the voice of these Bells. In him, O God, thou hast accomplished to mee, euen the request of Diues to Abraham; Thou hast sent one from the dead to speake vnto mee. He speakes to mee aloud from that steeple; hee whispers to mee at these

                     Curtaines, and hee speaks thy words;
                        Apoc. 14 13. 
                     Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth. Let this praier therfore, O my God, be as my last gaspe, my expiring, my dying in thee; That if this bee the houre of my transmigration, I may die the death of a sinner, drowned in my sinnes, in the bloud of thy Sonne; And if I liue longer, yet I may now die the death of the righteous, die to sinne; which death is a resurrection to a new life. Thou

killest and thou giuest life: which soeuer comes, it comes from thee; which way soeuer it comes, let mee come to thee.
                  
               
            
            
               17. Nunc lento sonitu dicunt, Morieris. Now, this Bell tolling softly for another, saies to me, Thou must die.
               
                  17. MEDITATION.
                  PErchance hee for whom this Bell tolls, may bee so ill, as that he knowes not it tolls for

him; And perchance I may thinke my selfe so much better than I am, as that they who are about mee, and see my state, may haue caused it to toll for mee, and I know not that. The Church is Catholike, vniuersall, so are all her Actions, All that she does, belongs to all. When she baptizes a child, that action concernes mee; for that child is thereby connected to that Head which is my Head too, and engraffe
                        •
                      into that

                     body, whereof I am a member. And when she buries a Man, that action concernes me; All mankinde is of one Author; and is one volume; when one Man dies, one Chapter is not torne out of the booke, but translated into a better language; and euery Chapter must be so translated; God emploies seuerall translators; some peeces are translated by Age, some by sicknesse, some by warre, some by iustice; but Gods hand is in euery translation; and

his hand shall binde vp all our scattered leaues againe, for that Librarie where euery booke shall lie open to one another: As therefore the Bell that rings to a Sermon, calls not vpon the Preacher onely, but vpon the Congregation to come; so this Bell calls vs all: but how much more mee, who am brought so neere the doore by this sicknesse. There was a contention as farre as a suite, (in which both pietie and dignitie, religion,
                     
and estimation, were mingl
                        •
                     d) which of the religious Orders should ring to praiers first in the Morning; and it was determined, that they should ring first that rose earliest. If we vnderstand aright the dignitie of this Bell, that rolls for our euening prayer, wee would bee glad to make it ours, by rising early, in that application, that it might bee ours, as wel as his, whose indeed it is. The Bell doth toll for him that thinkes it doth; and

though it intermit againe, yet from that minute, that that occasion wrought vpon him, hee is vnited to God. Who casts not vp his Eie to the Sunne when it rises? but who takes off his Eie from a Com
                           •
                        t, when that breakes out? who bends not his eare to any bell, which vpon any occasion rings? but who can remoue it from that bell, which is passing a peece of himselfe out of this world? No Man is an Iland, intire of it selfe;

euery man is a peece of the Continent, a part of the maine; if a Clod bee washed away by the Sea, Europe is the l
                        •
                     sse, as well as if a Promontorie were, as well as if a Mannor of thy friends, or of thine owne were; Any Mans death diminishes me, because I am inuolued in Mankinde; And therefore neuer send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee. Neither can we call this a begging of Miserie or a borrowing of Miserie, as though we

were not miserable enough of our selues, but must fe

                     ch in more from the next house, in taking vpon vs the Miserie of our Neighbours. Truly it were an excusable couetousnesse if wee did; for affliction is a treasure, and 
                        •
                     carce any Man hath enough of it. No Man hath affliction enough, that is not matured, and ripened by it, and mad

                     it for God by that affliction. If a Man carry treasure in bullion, or in a wedge of gold, and haue

none coined into currant Monies, his treasure will not defray him as he trauells. Tribulation is Treasure in the nature of it, but it is not currant money in the vse of it, except wee get nearer and nearer our home, heauen, by it. Another Man may be sicke too, and sicke to death, and this af

                  17. EXPOSTVLATION.
                  MY God, my God, Is this one of thy waies, of drawing light out of darknesse, To make him for whom this bell tolls, now in this dimnesse

of his sight, to become a superintendent, an ouerseer, a Bishop, to as many as heare his voice, in this bell, and to giue vs a confirmation in this action? Is this one of thy waies to raise strength out of weaknesse, to make him who cannot rise from his bed, nor stirre in his bed, come home to me, and in this sound, giue mee the strength of healthy and vigorous instructions? O my God, my God, what Thunder is not a well-tuned Cymball,
                     
what hoarsenesse, what harshnesse is not a cleare Organ, if thou bee pleased to set thy voice to it? and what Organ is not well plaied on, if thy hand bee vpon it? Thy voice, thy hand is in this sound, and in this one sound, I heare this whole Consort. I heare thy Iaacob call vnto his sonnes, and 
                        •
                     ay;
                        Gen. 49.1. 
                     Gather your selues together, that I may tell you what shall befall you in the last daies: He saies, That which I am now, you must bee then. I

heare thy Moses telling mee, and all within the compasse of this sound, This is the blessing wherewith I blesse you before my death;
                        Deut. 33 1. This, that before your death, you would consider your owne in mine. I heare thy Prophet saying to Ezechias, Set thy house in order, for thou shalt die, and not liue;2 Reg. 20.1. Hee makes vs of his familie, and calls this a setting of his house in order, to compose vs to the meditation of death. I heare thy Apostle saying,

                     I thinke it meet to put 
                           •
                        ou in remembrance,
                     2 Pet. 2.13. 
                     knowing that shortly I must goe out of this Tabernacle. This is the publishing of his will, & this bell is our legacie, the applying of his present condition to our vse. I heare that which makes al sounds musique, and all musique perfit; I heare thy Sonne himselfe 
                        •
                     aying,

                        •
                      Only I heare this change, that whereas thy Sonne saies there, I goe to prepare a place for you, this man in thi

                     sound saies, I send to prepare you for a place, for a graue. But, O my God, my God, since heauen is glory and ioy, why doe not glorious and ioyfull things leade vs, induce vs to heauen? Thy legacies in thy first will, in thy old Testament were plentie and victorie; Wine and Oile, Milke and Honie, alliances of friends, ruine of enemies, peacefull hearts, & cheerefull countenances, and by these galleries thou broughtest them into thy bed-chamber,
                     
by these glories and ioies, to the ioies and glories of heauen. Why hast thou changed thine old way, and carried vs, by the waies of discipline and mortification, by the waies of mourning and lamentation, by the waies of miserable ends, and miserable anticipations of those miseries, in appropriating the exemplar miseries of others to our selues, and vsurping vpon their miseries, as our owne, to our owne preiudice? Is the glory of

                     heauen no perfecter in it selfe, but that it needs a foile of depression and ingloriousnesse in this world, to set it off? Is the ioy of heauen no perfecter in it selfe, but that it needs the sourenesse of this life to giue it a taste? Is that ioy and that glory but a comparatiue glory and a comparatiue ioy? not such in it selfe, but such in comparison of the ioilesnesse and the ingloriousnesse of this world? I know, my God, it is farre, farre otherwise. As thou

thy selfe, who art all, art made of no substances, so the ioyes & glory which are with thee, are made of none of these circumstances; Essentiall ioy, and glory Essentiall. But why then, my God, wilt thou not beginne them here? pardon O God, this vnthankfull rashnesse; I that aske why thou doest not, finde euen now in my selfe, that thou doest; such ioy, such glory, as that I conclude vpon my selfe, vpon all, They that finde not ioy
                     
in their sorrowes, glory in their deiections in this world, are in a fearefull danger of missing both in the next.
                  
               
               
                  17. PRAYER.
                  O Eternall and most gracious God, who hast beene pleased to speake to vs, not onely in the voice of Nature, who speakes in our hearts, and of thy word, which speakes to our eares, but in the speech

of speechlesse Creatures, in Balaams Asse, in the speech of vnbeleeuing men, in the confession of Pilate, in the speech of the Deuill himselfe, in the recognition and attestation of thy Sonne, I humbly accept thy voice, in the sound of this sad and funerall bell. And first, I blessethy glorious name, that in this sound and voice, I can heare thy instructions, in another mans to consider mine owne condition; and to know, that this bell
                     
which tolls for another, before it come to ring out, may take in me too. As death is the wages of sinne, it is due to me
                        •
                     ; As death is the end of sicknesse, it belongs to mee; And though so disobedient a seruant as I, may be afraid to die, yet to so mercifull a Master as thou, I cannot be afraid to come; And therefore, into thy hands, O my God, I commend my spirit; A surrender, which I know thou wilt accept, whether I liue or die; for

thy seruant Dauid made it,
                        Psal. 31.5. when he put himselfe into thy protection for his life; and thy blessed Sonne made it, when hee deliuered vp his soule at his death; declare thou thy will vpon mee, O Lord, for life or death, in thy time; receiue my surrender of my selfe now, Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit. And being thus, O my God, prepared by thy correction, mellowed by thy chastisement, and conformed to thy

will, by thy Spirit, hauing receiued thy pardon for my soule, and asking no reprieue for my body, I am bold, O Lord, to bend my prayers to thee, for his assistance, the voice of whose bell hath called mee to this deuotion. Lay hold vpon his soule, O God, till that soule haue throughly considered his account, and how few minutes soeuer it haue to remaine in that body, let the power of thy Spirit recompence the shortnesse of

time, and perfect his account, before he passe away: present his sinnes so to him, as that he may know what thou forgiuest, & not doubt of thy forgiuenesse; let him stop vpon the infinitenesse of those sinnes, but dwell vpon the infinitenesse of thy Mercy: let him discerne his owne demerits, but wrap himselfe vp in the merits of thy Sonne, Christ Iesus: Breath inward comforts to his heart, and affoord him the power of giuing

such outward testimonies thereof, as all that are about him may deriue comforts from thence, and haue this edification, euen in this dissolution, that though the body be going the way o
                        •
                      all flesh, yet that soule is going the way of all Saints. When thy Sonne cried out vpon the Crosse, My God, my God, Why hast thou forsaken me? he spake not so much in his owne Person, as in the person of the Church, and of his afflicted members, who

in deep distresses might feare thy forsaking. This patient, O most blessed God, is one of them; In his behalfe, and in his name, heare thy Sonne crying to thee, My God, my God, Why hast thou forsaken me? and forsake him not; but with thy left hand lay his body in the graue, (if that bee 
                        •
                     hy determination vpon him) and with thy right hand receiue his soule into thy Kingdome, and vnite him & vs in one Cō
                        munion of Saints. Amen.
               
            
            
               
               18. —At inde Mortuus es, Sonitu celeri, pulsuque agitato. The bell rings out, and tells me in him, that I am dead.
               
                  18. MEDITATION.
                  THe Bell rings out; the pulse thereof is changed; the tolling was a faint, and intermitting pulse, vpon one side; this stronger, and argues more and better life. Hi
                        •
                     
                     
                     soule is gone out; and as a Man who had a lease of 1000. yeeres after the expiration of a short one, or an inheritance after the life of a Man in a Consumption, he is now entred into the possession of his better estate. His soule is gone; whither? Who saw it come in, or who saw it goe out? No body; yet euery body is sure, he had one, and hath none. If I will aske meere Philosophers, what the soule is, I shall finde amongst them, that will

tell me, it is nothing, but the temperament and harmony, and iust and equall composition of the Elements in the body, which produces all those faculties which we ascribe to the soule; and so, in it selfe is nothing, no seperable substance, that ouerliues the body. They see the soule is nothing else in other Creatures, and they affect an impious humilitie, to think as low of Man. But if my soule were no more than the soule of a beast,
                     
I could not thinke so; that soule that can reflect vpon it selfe, consider it selfe, is more than so. If I will aske, not meere Philosophers, but mixt Men, Philosophicall Diuines, how the soule, being a separate substance, enters into Man, I shall finde some that will tell me, that it is by generation, & procreation from parents, because they thinke it hard, to charge th
                        •
                      
                     soule with the guiltinesse of Originall sinne, if the soule were infused

into a body, in which it must necessarily grow foule, and contract originall sinne, whether it will or no; and I shall finde some that will tell mee, that it is by immediate infusion from God, because they think it hard, to maintaine an immortality in such a soule, as should be begotten, and deriued with the body frō 
                     Mortall parents. If I will aske, not a few men, but almost whole bodies, whole Churches, what becomes of the soules of the righteous,
                     
at the departing thereof from the body, I shall bee told by some, That they attend an expiation, a purification in a place of torment; By some, that they attend the fruition of the sight of God, in a place of rest; but yet, but of expectation; By some, that they passe to an immediate possession of the presence of God. S. Augustine studied the Nature of the soule, as much as any thing, but the saluation of the soule; and he sent an expresse Messenger
                     
to Saint Hierome, to consult of some things concerning the soule: But he satisfies himselfe with this: Let the departure of my soule to saluation be euident to my faith, and I care the lesse, how darke the entrance of my soule, into my body, bee to my reason. It is the going out, more than the comming in, that concernes vs. This soule, this Bell tells me is gone out; Whither? Who shall tell mee that? I know not who it is; much lesse what he

was; The condition of the Man, and the course of his life, which should tell mee whither hee is gone, I know not. I was not there, in his sicknesse, nor at his death; I saw not his way, nor his end, nor can a

                        •
                      who did, thereby to conclude, or argue, whither he is gone. But yet I haue one neerer mee than all these; mine owne Charity; I aske that; & that tels me, He is gone to euerlasting rest, and ioy, and glory: I owe

him a good opinion; it is but thankfull charity in mee, because I receiued benefit and instruction from him when his Bell told: and I, being made the fitter to pray, by that disposition, wherein I was assisted by his occasion, did pray for him; and I pray not without faith; so I doe charitably, so I do faithfully beleeue, that that soule is gone to euerlasting rest, and ioy, and glory. But for the body, How poore a wretched thing is that? wee

cannot expresse it so fast, as it growes worse and worse. That body which scarce three minutes since was such a house, as that that soule, which made but one step from thence to Heauen, was scarse thorowly content, to leaue that for Heauen: that body hath lost the name of a dwelling house, because none dwels in it, and is making haste to lose the name of a body, and dissolue to putrefaction. Who would not bee affected

to see a cleere & sweet Riuer in the Morning, grow a kennell of muddy land water by noone, and condemned to the saltnesse of the Sea by night? And how lame a Picture, how faint a representation, is that, of the precipitatiō of mans body to dissolution? Now all the parts built vp, and knit by a louely soule, now but a statue of clay, and now, these limbs melted off, as if that clay were but snow

                      and now, the whole house is but a

                     handfull of sand, so much dust, and but a pecke of Rubbidge, so much bone. If he, who, as this Bell tells mee, is gone now, were some excellent Arti

Man before hee hath his immortall soule, hath a soule of sense, and a soule of vegitation before that: This immortall soule did not forbid other soules, to be in

vs before, but when this soule departs, it carries all with it; no more vegetation, no more sense: such a Mother in law is the Earth

                  MY God, my God, if Expostulation bee too bold a word, doe thou mollifie it with another; le
                        •
                      it be wonder in my selfe; let it bee but probleme to others; but let me aske, why wouldest thou not suffer those, that serue thee in holy seruices,
                     
                        Leuit. 21 1. to doe any

                     office about the dead, nor assist at their funerall? Thou hadst no Counsellor, thou needest none; thou hast no Controller, thou admittest none Why doe I aske? in Ceremoniall things (as that was) any conuenient reason is enough; who can bee sure to propose that reason, that moued thee in the institution thereof? I satisfie my selfe with this; that in those times, the Gentiles were ouerfull, of an ouer-reuerent respect to the memory

of the dead: a great part of the Idolatry of the Nations, flowed from that; an ouer-amorous deuotion, an ouer-zealous celebrating, and ouer-studious preseruing of the memories, and the Pictures of some dead persons:
                     
                        Sap. 14.14. And by the vaine glory of men, they entred into the world; and their statues, and pictures contracted an opinion of diuinity, by age: that which was at first, but a picture of a friend, grew a God in time, as the wise

man notes,
                        Sap. 13.9. 
                     They called them Gods, which were the worke of an ancient hand. And some haue assigned a certaine time, when a picture should come out of Minority, and bee at age, to bee a God, in 60. yeeres after it is made. Those Images of Men, that had life, and some Idols of other things, which neuer had any being, are by one common name, called promiscuously, dead, and for that the wise man reprehends the Idolatrer;

for health he praies to that which is weake,
                     
                        Sap. 13.18. 
                     and for life he praies to that which is dead. Should we doe so, saies thy Prophet;
                     
                        Esay 8.14. 
                     should we goe from the liuing to the dead? So much ill then, being occasioned, by so much religious cō
                        plement exhibited to the dead; thou ô God, (I think) wouldest therefore inhibit thy principall holy seruants, from contributing any thing at all to this dangerous intimation of Idolatry; and that the people might say, surely

those dead men, are not so much to bee magnified, as men mistake, since God will not suffer his holy officers, so much as to touch them, not to see them. But those dangers being remoued, thou, O my God, dost certainly allow, that we should doe offices of piety to the dead, and that we should draw instructions to piety, from the dead. Is not this, O my God, a holy kinde of raising vp

                        Apo. 1.5. Thy Sonne Christ Iesus is the first begotten of the dead; he rises first, the eldest brother, and he is my Master in this science of death: but yet, for mee, I am a younger brother too, to this Man,
                     
who died now, and to euery man whom I see, or heare to die before mee, and all they are vshers to mee in this schoole of death. I take therefore that which thy seruant Dauids wife said to him, to bee said to me;

                     If thou saue not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt bee slaine. If the death of this man worke not vpon mee now, I shall die worse, than if thou hadst not afforded me this helpe: for thou hast sent him in

                     1 Reg. 16 18. 
                     Zimrie died for his sinnes, saies thy Spirit, which he sinned in doing euill; and in his sinne, which he did to make Israel sinne. For his sinnes, his many sinnes; and then in his sinne, his particular sinne: for my sinnes I shall die, whensoeuer I die, for death is the wages of sinne; but I shall die in my sinne, in that particular sinne of resisting thy spirit, if I apply not thy assistances.

Doth it not call vs to a particular consideration, That thy blessed Sonne varies his forme of Commination, and aggrauates it in the variation, when hee saies to the Iewes, (because they refused the light offered) you shall die in your sinne;
                        Ioh. 8.21 And then when they proceeded to farther disputations, and vexations, and tentations, hee addes,

                  O Eternall and most gracious God, I haue a new occasion of thanks, and a new occasion of prayer to thee, from the ringing of this bell. Thou toldst me in the other voice, that I was mortall, and approaching to death; In this I may heare thee say, that I am dead, in an irremediable, in an irrecouerable state for bodily health. If that bee thy language in this voice,
                     
how infinitely am I bound to thy heauenly Maiestie, for speaking so plainly vnto mee? for euen that voice, that I must die now, is not the voice of a Iudge, that speaks by way of condemnation, but of a Physitian, that presents health in that: Thou presentest mee death as the cure of my disease, not as the exaltation of it; if I mistake thy voice herein, if I ouer-runne thy pace, and preuent thy hand, and imagine death more

instant vpon mee than thou hast bid him bee, yet the voice belongs to me; I am dead, I was borne dead, and from the first laying of these mud-walls in my conception, they haue moldred away, and the whole course of life is but an actiue death. Whether this voice instruct mee, that I am a dead man now, or remember me, that I haue been a dead man all this while, I humbly thanke thee for speaking in this voice to my soule, and I hum

without all disputation, wee vpon earth doe know what thy Saints in heauen lacke yet, for the consummation of their happinesse; and therefore thou hast affoorded vs the dignitie, that wee may pray for them. That therefore this soule now newly departed to thy Kingdome, may quickly returne to a io

Why should wee looke for it in a disease, which is the disorder, the discord, the irregularitie, the commotion, and rebellion of the body? It were

scarce a disease, if it could bee ordered, and made obedient to our times. Why should wee looke for that in disorder, in a disease, when we cannot haue it in Nature, who is so regular, and so pregnant, so forward to bring her worke to perfection, and to light? yet we cannot awake the Iuly-flowers in Ianuarie, nor retard the flowers of the spring to Autumne. We cannot bid the fruits come in May, nor the leaues to sticke on in December.
                     
A woman that is weake, cannot put off her ninth moneth to a tenth, for her deliuerie, and say shee will stay till shee bee stronger; nor a Queene cannot hasten it to a seuenth, that shee may bee ready for some other pleasure. Nature (if w

Man, that argument that binds his faith to beleeue that to bee the Word of God, is the reuerent simplicity of the Word, and to another, the maiesty of the Word; and in which two men, equally pious, may meet, and one wonder, that all should not vnderstand it, and the other, as much, that any man should. So, Lord, thou giuest vs the same Earth, to labour on, and to lie in; a house, and a graue, of the same earth; so Lord, thou giuest vs

                     they that saile in the Sea, tell of the danger thereof; I that am yet in this affliction, owe thee the glory of speaking of it; But, as the wise man bids me,
                        vers. 27. I say, I may speak much, and come short;

wherefore in summe, thou art all. Since thou art so, O my God, and affliction is a Sea, too deepe for vs, what is our refuge? thine Arke, thy ship. In all other Seas, in all other afflictions, those meanes which thou hast ordained; In this Sea, in Sicknesse, thy Ship is thy Physitian.
                     
                        Sap. 14.3. 
                     Thou hast made a way in the Sea, and a safe path in the waters, shewing that thou canst saue from all dangers; yea, though a man went to Sea without art; yet where I finde all

                        Act. 17.11. they were all opened to a great danger; this was a preferring of thy meanes, before thee, the Author of the meanes; but, my

                     God, though thou beest euery where, I haue no promise of appearing to me, but in thy ship: Thy blessed Sonne preached out of a Ship:
                     
                        Luc. 5.3. The meanes is preaching, he did that; and the Ship was a type of the Church; hee did it there

                     that saild with him; If they had not beene in the Ship with him, the gift had not extended to them.
                        Mar. 5.2. 
                     As soone as thy Son was come out of the ship, immediatly there met him

out of the tombes, a man with an vncleane spirit, and no man could hold him, no not with chaines. Thy Sonne needed no vse of meanes; yet there wee apprehend the danger to vs; if we leaue the ship, the meanes; in this case, the Physitian. But as they are Ships to vs in those Seas, so is there a Ship to them too, in which they are to stay. Giue mee leaue, O my God, to assist my selfe with such a construction of these words of thy

seruant Paul, to the Centurion, when the Mariners would haue left the Ship,
                     
                        Act. 27.31. 
                     Except these abide in the Ship, you cannot bee safe; Except they who are our ships, the Physitians, abide in that which is theirs, and our ship, the truth, and the sincere and religious worship of thee, and thy Gospell, we cannot promise our selues, so good safety; for though we haue our ship, the Physitian, he hath not his ship, Religion; And meanes are

not meanes, but in their concatenation, as they depend, and are chained together.
                        Iac. 3.4. 
                     The ships are great, saies thy Apostle, but a helme turnes them; the men are learned, but their religion turnes their labours to good: And therefore it was a heauy

                        Apo. 8.9. It is a heauy case, where either all Religion, or true Religion should forsake many of these ships, whom thou hast sent to conuey vs ouer these

                     Seas. But, O my God, my God, since I haue my ship, and they theirs, I haue them, and they haue thee, why are we yet no neerer land? As soone as thy Sonnes Disciple had taken him into the ship, immediatly the ship was at the land,
                     
                        Io. 6.21. 
                     whither they went. Why haue nor they and I this dispatch? Euery thing is immediatly done, which is done when thou wouldst haue it done. Thy purpose terminates euery action, and what was done before

that, is vndone yet. Shall that slacken my hope? Thy Prophet from thee, hath forbid it.
                        Lam. 3.26. 
                     It is good that a man should both hope, and quietly wait for the saluation of the Lord. Thou puttest off many iudgements, till the last day, many passe this life without any; and shall not I endure the putting off thy mercy for a day? and yet, O my God, thou puttest me not to that; for, the assurance of future mercy, 
                           •

is my assurance now? What is my seale? It is but a cloud; that which my Physitians call a cloud, in that, which giues them their Indication. But a Cloud? Thy great Seale to all the world, the raine-bow, that

                     16.10. not only was, but appeared in a cloud. Let me returne, O my God, to the consideration

of thy seruant Eliahs proceeding,1 Reg. 19.43. in a time of desperate drought; he bids them look towards the Sea; They looke, and

Seuen dayes, O my God, haue we looked for this cloud, and now we haue it; none of thy Indications are friuolous; thou makest thy signes, seales;

and thy Seales, effects; and thy effects, consolation, and restitution, whersoeuer thou maiest receiue glory by that way.

                  O Eternall and most gracious God, who though thou passedst ouer infinite millions of generations, before thou camest to a Creation of this world, yet when thou beganst, didst neuer intermit that worke, but continuedst day to

                     day, till thou hadst perfited all the worke, and deposed it in the hands and rest of a Sabbath, though thou haue beene pleased to glorifie thy selfe in a long exercise of my patience, with an expectation of thy declaration of thy selfe in this my sicknesse, yet since thou hast now of thy goodnesse afforded that, which affords vs some hope, if that bee still the way of thy glory, proceed in that way, and perfit that worke, and establish me

in a Sabbath, and rest in thee, by this thy seale of bodily restitution.

                        •
                     steps comming towards mee, is the same comfort, as to see thy face present with mee; whether thou doe the worke of a thousand yeere in a day, or extend the worke of a day, to a thousand yeere, as long as thou workest, it is light,
                     
and comfort. Heauen it selfe is but an extention of the same ioy; and an extention of this mercie, to proceed at thy leisure, in the way of restitution, is a manifestation of heauen to me here vpon earth. From that people, to whom thou appearedst in signes, and in Types, the Iewes, thou art departed, because they trusted in them; but from thy Church, to whom thou hast appeared in thy selfe, in thy Sonne, thou wilt neuer

depart; because we cannot trust too much in him. Though thou haue afforded me these signes of restitution, yet if I confide in them, and beginne to say, all was but a Na

mee; but if thou withdraw thy helping hand, alas how friuolous are the helps of Nature, how impotent the assistances of Art? As therefore the morning dew, is a pawne of the euening fatnesse, so, O Lord, let this daies comfort be the earnest of to morrowes, so f

                     counsel seeme rather to consist of spirituall parts, than action, yet action is the spirit and the soule of counsell. Counsels are not alwaies determined in Resolutions; wee cannot alwaies say, this was concluded;

actions are alwaies determined in effects; wee can say this was done. Then haue Lawes their reuerence, and their maiestie, when wee see the Iudge vpon the Bench executing them. Then haue counsels of warre their impressions, and their operations, when we see the seale of an Armie set to them. It was an ancient way of celebrating the memorie of such as deserued well of the State, to afford them that kinde of statuarie representation,
                     
which was then called Hermes; which was, the head and shoulders of a man, standing vpon a Cube, but those shoulders without armes and hands. All together it figured a constant supporter of the state, by his counsell: But in this Hierogliphique, which they made without hands, they passe their consideration no farther, but that the Counsellor should bee without hands, so farre, as not to reach out his hand to forraigne tentations

of bribes, in matters of Counsell, and, that it was not necessary, that the head should employ his owne hand; that the same men should serue in the execution, which assisted in the Counsell; but that there should not belong hands to euery head, action to euery counsell, was neuer intended, so much as in figure, and representation. For, as matrimonie is scarce to bee called matrimonie,

                      where there is a resolution against the fruits of

matrimonie, against the hauing of Children, so counsels are not counsels, but illusions, where there is from the beginning no purpose to execute

                  O Eternall, and most gracious God, who hauing married Man, and Woman together, and made them one flesh, wouldest haue them also, to become one soule so, as that they might maintaine a simpathy in their affections, and haue a conformity to one another, in the accidents of this world, good or bad, so hauing married this soule and this body in me, I humbly beseech

thee, that my soule may looke, and make her vse of thy mercifull proceedings towards my bodily restitution, & goe the same way to a spirituall. I am come by thy goodnesse, to the vse of thine ordinary meanes for my body, to wash away those peccant humors, that endangered it. I haue, O Lord, a Riuer in my body, but a Sea in my soule, and a Sea swoln into the depth of a Deluge, aboue the Sea. Thou hast raised vp certaine

                     hils in me heretofore, by which I might haue stood safe, from these inundations of sin. Euen our Naturall faculties are a hill, and might preserue vs from some sinne. Education, study, obseruation, example, are hills too, and might preserue vs from some. Thy Church, and thy Word, and thy Sacraments, and thine Ordinances, are hills, aboue these; thy Spirit of remorse, and compunction, & repentance for former sin,
                     
are hills too; and to the

                        op of all these hils, thou hast brought mee heretofore; but this Deluge, this inundation, is got aboue all my Hills; and I haue sinned and sinned, and multiplied sinne to sinne, after all these thy assistances against sinne, and where is there water enough to wash away this Deluge? There is a red Sea, greater than this Ocean; and there is a little spring, through which this Ocean, may powre it selfe into that red Sea. Let

thy Spirit of true contrition, and sorrow passe all my sinnes through these eies, into the wounds of thy Sonne, and I shall be cleane, and my soule so much better purged than my body, as it is ordained for a better, and a longer life.

                  21. MEDITATION.
                  IF man had beene left alone in this world, at first, shall I thinke, that he would not haue fallen?
                     
If there had beene no Woman, would not Man haue serued, to haue beene his owne Tempter? When I see him now, subiect to infinite weakenesses, fall into infinite sinne, without any forraine tentations, shall I thinke, hee would haue had none, if hee had beene alone? GOD saw that Man needed a Helper, if hee should bee well; but to make Woman ill, the Deuill saw, that there needed no third.
                     
When God, and wee were alone, in Adam, that was not enough; when the Deuill and wee were alone, in Eue, it was enough

No corner of any place can bee empty; there can be no vacuity; If that Man doe not fill the place, other men will; complaints of his insufficiency will fill it; Nay, such an abhorring is there in Nature, of vacuity, that if there be but an imagination of not filling, in any man, that which is but imagination neither, will

much Iustice, so much integrity to the place, as shall spoile the place, burthen the place; his integrity may bee a Libell vpon his Predecessor, and cast an infamy vpon him, and a burden vpon his successor, to proceede by example, and to bring the place it selfe, to an vnder-value, and the market to an vncertainty.

What Hypocrates, what Galen, could shew mee that in my body? It lies deeper than so; it lies in my soule: And deeper than so; for we may wel consider the body, before the

that sinne hath another root, another fuell, originall sinne; and can I deuest that? Wilt thou bid me to separate the leuen, that a lumpe of Dowe hath receiued, or the salt, that the water hath contracted, from the Sea? Dost thou looke, that I should so looke to the fuell, or embers of sinne, that I neuer take fire? The whole world is a pile of fagots, vpō which w

and not falsifie that which thou hast said, that sin is gone ouer all? But, O my God, I presse thee not, with thine owne text, without thine owne comment; I know that in the state of my body, which is more discernible, than that of my soule, thou dost effigiate my Soule to me. And though no Anatomist can say, in dissecting a body, here lay the coale, the fuell, the occasion of all bodily diseases, but yet a man may haue such a knowledge

of his owne constitution, and bodily inclination to diseases, as that he may preuent his danger in a great part: so though wee cannot assigne the place of originall sinne, nor the Nature of it, so exactly, as of actuall, or by any diligence deuest it, yet hauing washed it in the water of thy Baptisme, wee haue not onely so cleansed it, that wee may the better look vpon it, and discerne it, but so weakned it, that howsoeuer it

may retaine the former nature, it doth not retaine the former force, and though it may haue the same name, it hath not the same venome.

                  O Eternall and most gracious God, the God of securitie, and the enemie of securitie too, who wouldest haue vs alwaies sure of thy loue, and yet wouldest haue vs alwaies doing something

onely stand vnder a falling house, but pull it downe vpon vs; and wee are not onely executed, (that implies guiltinesse) but wee are executioners, (that implies dishonor;) and executioners of our selues, (and that implies impietie.) And wee fall from that comfort which wee might haue in our first sicknesse, from that meditation, Alas, how generally miserable is Man, and how subiect to diseases, (for in that it is some degree of

                     comfort, that wee are but in the sta

                     minde, and from the consideration of the sicknesse, to that sinne, that sinfull carelesnesse, by which I haue occasioned my relapse. And amongst the many weights that aggrauate a relapse, this also is one, that a relapse proceeds with a more violent dispatch, and more irremediably, because it finds the Countrie weakned, and depopulated before. Vpon a sicknesse, which as yet appeares not, wee can scarce fix a feare, because

wee know not what to feare; but as feare is the busiest and irksomest affection, so is a relapse (which is still ready to come) into that, which is but newly gone, the nearest obiect, the most immediate exercise of that affection of fear

                  MY God, my God, my God, thou mightie Father, who hast beene my Physitian; Thou glorious Sonne, who hast beene my physicke; Thou blessed Spirit, who hast prepared and applied all to mee, shall I alone bee able to ouerthrow the worke of all you, and relapse into those spirituall sicknesses, from which your infinite mercies haue withdrawne me? Though thou, O

my God, h
                        •
                     ue filled my measure with mercie, yet my measure was not so large, as that of thy whole people, the Nation, the numerous and glorious nation of Israel; and yet how often, how often did they fall into relapses? And then, where is my assurance? how easily thou passedst ouer many other sinnes in them, and how vehemently thou insistedst in those, into which they so often relapsed; Those were their murmurings
                     
against thee, in thine Instruments, and Ministers, and their turnings vpon other gods, and embracing the Idolatries of their neighbours. O my God, how slipperie a way, to how irrecouerable a bottome, is murmuring? and how neere thy selfe hee comes, that murmures at him, who comes from thee? The Magistrate is the garment in which thou apparellest thy selfe; and hee that shoots at the

                     cloathes, cannot say, hee meant no ill to the man: Thy people were feareful examples of that; for, how often did their murmuring against thy Ministers, end in a departing from thee? when they would haue other officers, they would haue other gods; and still to daies murmuring, was to morrowes Idolatrie; As their murmuring induced Idolatrie, and they relapsed often into both, I haue found in my selfe, O my God, (O

my God, thou hast found it in me, and thy finding it, hath shewed it to me) such a transmigration of sinne, as makes mee afraid of relapsing too. The soule of sinne, (for wee haue made sinne immortall, and it must haue a soule) The soule of sinne, is disobedience to thee; and when one sinne hath beene dead in mee, that soule hath passed into another sinne. Our youth dies, and the sinnes of our youth with it; some

                     sinnes die a violent death, and some a naturall; pouertie, penurie, imprisonment, banishment, kill some sinnes in vs, and some die of age; many waies wee become vnable to doe that sinne; but still the soule liues, and passes into another sinne; and that, that was licentiousnesse, growes ambition, and that comes to indeuotion, and spirituall coldnesse; wee haue three liues, in our state of sinne; and where the sinnes o

                     youth expire, those of our middle yeeres enter; and those of our age after them. This transmigration of sinne, found in my selfe, makes me afraid, O my God, of a Relapse: but the occasion of my feare, is more pregnant 
                     
                        •
                     han so; for, I haue had, I haue multiplied Relapses already. Why, O my God, is a relapse so odious to thee? Not so much their murmuring, and their Idolatry, as their relapsing into those sinnes, seemes to affect

thee, in thy disobedient people. They limited the holy one of Israel,
                     
                        Psal. 78.41. as

                     hou complainest of them: That was a murmuring; but before thou chargest them with the fault it selfe, in the same place, thou chargest them, with the iterating, the redoubling of 
                        •
                     hat fault, before the fault was named; How oft did they prouoke mee in the Wildernesse; and grieue me in the Desart? That which brings thee to that exasperation

against them, as to say, that thou wouldest breake thine owne oath,
                     
                        Num. 14 22. rather than leaue them vnpunished, (They shall not see the land, which I sware vnto their fathers) was because they had tempted thee ten times, infinitely; vpon that, thou threatnest with that vehemencie,
                     
                        Ios. 23.12. 
                     if ye do in any wise goe backe, know for a certainty, God will no more driue out any of these Nations from before you; but they shall be snares, and traps vnto you, and scourges

in your sides, and thornes in your eies, till ye perish. No tongue, but thine owne, O my GOD, can expresse thine indignation, against a Nation relapsing to Idolatry. Idolatry in any Nation is deadly; but when the disease is complicated with a relapse (a knowledge and a profession of a former recouerie) it is desperate: And thine anger workes, not onely where the euidence is pregnant, and without exception, (so thou saiest,

                     when it is said,
                     
                        Deut. 13 12. 
                     That certaine men in a Citie, haue withdrawne others to Idolatrie, and that inquirie is made, and it is found true, the Citie, and the inhabitants, and the Cattell are to bee destroied) but where there is but a suspicion, a rumor, of such a relapse to Idolatrie, thine anger is awakened, and thine indignation stirred.

                           s. 22.11. In the gouernment of thy seruant Iosua, there was a voice, that Reuben and Gad, with those of Manasseh,

had built a new altar. Israel doth not send one to enquire;1.12. but the whole congregation gathered to goe vp to warre against them; and there went a Prince of euery Tribe: And they obiect to them, not so much their present declination to Idolatry, as their Relapse;
                     
                        Num. 25 4. 
                     is the iniquity of Peor too little for vs? An idolatry formerly committed, and punished with the slaughter of twenty foure thousand delinquents. At

last Reuben, and Gad satisfie them, that that Altar was not built for Idolatry, but built as a patterne of theirs, that they might thereby professe themselues to bee of the same profession, that they were; and so the Army returned without bloud. Euen where it comes not so farre, as to an actuall Relapse into Idolatry, Thou, O my GOD, becommest sensible of it; though thou, who seest the heart all the way, preuentest

all dangerous effects, where there was no ill meaning, how euer there were occasion of suspicious rumours, giuen to thine Israel, of relapsing. So odious to thee, & so aggrauating a weight vpon sinne, is a relapse. But, O my God, why is it so? so odious? It must bee so, because hee that hath sinned, and then repented, hath weighed God and the Deuill in a ballance; hee hath heard God and the Deuill plead; and after hearing, giuen

                     Iudgement on that side, to which he adheres, by his subsequent practise;
                        Tertull.
                      if he returne to his sinne, hee decrees for Satan; he prefers sinne before grace, and Satan before God; and in contempt of God, declares the precedency for his aduersary: And a contempt wounds deeper than an iniury; a relapse deeper, than a blasphemy. And when thou hast told me, that a relapse is more odious to thee, neede I aske why it is more dangerous,
                     
more pernitious to me? Is there any other measure of the greatnesse of my danger, than the greatnesse of thy displeasure? How fitly, and how fearefully hast thou expressed my case, in a storm 
                     
                        •

                     and they goe downe againe to the depth:) My sicknesse brought mee to thee in repentance, and my relapse hath cast mee farther from thee:
                        Mat. 12.45. 
                     The end of that man shall be worse than the beginning, saies

thy Word, thy Sonne; My beginning was sicknesse, punishment for sin; but a worse thing may follow,
                     
                        Io. 8.14. saies he also, if I sin againe: not onely death, which is an

                        Mar. 14 70. Thy great seruant denied thy Sonne, and he denied him againe; but all before Repentance; here was no relapse. O, if thou haddest euer re-admitted Adam into

                     Paradise, how abstinently would hee haue walked by that tree? and would not the Angels, that fell, haue fixed themselues vpon thee, if thou hadst once re-admitted them to thy sight? They neuer relapsed; If I doe, must not my case be as desperate? Not so desperate, for,
                        Ecclus. 2.18. 
                     as thy Maiestie, so is thy Mercie, both infinite: and thou who hast commanded me to pardon my brother seuenty seuen times, hast limited thy selfe to no

                     Number. If death were ill in it selfe, thou wouldest neuer haue raised any dead Man, to life againe, because that man must necessarily die againe. If thy Mercy, in pardoning, did so farre aggrauate a Relapse, as that there were no more mercy after it, our case were the worse for that former Mercy; for who is not vnder, euen a necessity of sinning, whilst hee is here, if wee place this necssity in our own infirmity, and not in thy

                     Decree? But I speak not this, O my God, as preparing a way to my Relapse out of presumption, but to preclude all accesses of desperation, though out of infirmity, I should Relapse.

I know that this comes to neare, to a making thy holy Ordinances, thy Word, thy Sacraments, thy Seales, thy Grace, instruments of my Spirituall Fornications. Since therefore thy Correction hath brought mee to such a participation of thy selfe (thy selfe, O my God, cannot bee parted) to such an intire possession of thee, as that

I durst deliuer my selfe ouer to thee this Minute, If this Minute thou wouldst accept my dissolution, preserue me, O my God the God of constancie, and perseuerance, in this state, from all relapses into those sinnes, which haue induc'd thy former Iudgements vpon me. But because, by too lamentable Experience, I I know how slippery my customs of sinne, haue made my wayes of sinne, I presume to adde this petition too, That if my

                     infirmitie ouertake mee, thou forsake mee not. Say to my Soule, My Sonne, thou hast sinned, doe so no more;
                        Ecclus. 21.1. but say also, that though I doe, thy Spirit of Remorce, and Compunction shall neuer depart from mee. Thy Holy Apostle, Saint Paul,
                     2. Cor. 11.25. was shipwrackd thrice; & yet stil saued. Though the rockes, and the sands, the heights, and the shallowes, the prosperitie, and the aduersitie of this world do diuersly threaten mee, though mine

owne leakes endanger mee, yet, O God, let mee neuer put my selfe aboard with Hymeneus,
                     
                        Timo. 1.19. nor make shipwracke of faith, and a good Conscience, and then thy longliud, thy euerlasting Mercy, will visit me, though that, which I most earnestly pray against, should fall vpon mee, a relapse into those sinnes, which I haue truely repented, and thou hast fully pardoned.
