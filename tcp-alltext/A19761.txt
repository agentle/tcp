            A SERMON PREACHED BEfore the Kings Maiestie at Whitehall, on Christmas day. ANNO 1609.
            
               
                  GALAT. 4. verse. 4, 5.
                  When the fulnesse of time was come, God sent his Sonne, made of a woman, made vnder the Law.
                  That, Hee might redeeme, them that were vnder the Law, that wee might receiue the Adoption of sonnes.
               
            
            
               IF when the fulnesse of time commeth, God sent his Sonne: then, When God sent his Sonne, is the fulnesse of time come. And as this day, God sent his Sonne. This day therfore, (so oft as by the reuolution of the yeere it commeth about) is to vs a yeerely representation of the fulnesse of time. So it is: and a speciall honour it is to the Feast, that so it is. And wee our selues seeme so to esteeme of it. For we allow for euery month a day, (Looke how many moneths so many dayes) to this Feast; as if it were, and wee so thought

it to be, the ful recapitulation of the whole yere.
            This honour it hath, from Christ, who is the substance of this, and all other Solemnities. Peculiarly, â Christi missá, from Christs sending. (For, they that read the ancient writers of the Latin Church, Tertullian, & Cyprian know that Missa, and Missio, & Remissa and Remissio, with them are taken for one. So that Christi missa, is the sending of Christ.) And when then hath this Text place so fit, as Now? Or what time so seasonable to entreat of it, as This? Of the sending of his Sonne; as, when God sent his Sonne: Of the fulnesse of time; as, on the yeerely returne and memoriall of it.
            To entreat of it then. The Heads are two
                  •
                1. Of the fulnesse of time. 2. And of that, wherewith it is filled. 1. Times fulnesse, in these, when the fulnesse of time came. 2 Times filling in the rest, God sent his Sonne, made of a woman, made vnder the Law, &c.
            
            
                In the former, (Quando venit plenitudo temporis,) there be foure points. 1. Plenitudo temporis, That, time hath a fulnesse; or, that there is a fulnesse of time. 2. Venit plenitudo. That, that fulnesse commeth, by steps and degrees, not all a
                  •
                once. 3. Quando venit. That, it hath a Quando,
               
(That is,) there is a time, when time thus commeth to this fulnesse. 4. And, when that When is? And that is, When God sent his Sonne. And so passe wee ouer to the other part, in the same Verse, Mi
                     •
                  it Deus; God sent his Sonne.
            
            For the other part, (touching the filling of  time.) There be Texts, the right way to consider of them, is to take them in pieces. And this is of that kinde. And if wee take it in sunder, we shall see; as it is of fulnesse, so a kinde of fulnesse there is in it: euery word, more full then other: euery word, a step in it, whereby it riseth still higher, till by seuen seuerall degree
                  •
                it commeth to the top, and so the measure is full. 1. God sent, the first. 2. Sent his Sonne, the second. 3. His Sonne made, the third. 4. And that twice made, made of a woman the fourth. 5. Made vnder the Law, the fift, euery one fuller then other, still.
            And all this, for some persons, and some pur
                  
                     •
                  ose.
                The persons, Vt nos, that we. The purpose, 
                  
                     •
                  eciperemus, that we might receiue. Nay, (if you marke it) there be two Vt's, vt ille, vt nos, that He might, and, that we might. He might redeeme: 
                  ••
               d we might receiue, that is, Hee, pay for it, 
                  •
               nd, wee reape the benefit. 6. A double

benefit, of Redemption first from the state of persons cast and condemned, vnder the Law, which is the sixt. 7 And then, of translation into the state of adopted children of God, which is the seuenth; & the very filling vp of the measure.
            Al which, we may reduce to a double fulnesse. Gods, as much as He can send. Ours, as much as we can desire. Gods, in the fiue first. 1. God sent. 2. Sent his Sonne. 3. His Sonne made. 4 Made of a Woman. 5. Made vnder the Law. And Ours in the two latter, 6. We are redeemed, the sixt 7. We receiue adoption, the seuenth.
            In that of Gods, euery point is full; The thing sent, full. The sending, and the maner of sending full. The making, and the two maners of making Of a woman, and, vnder the Law, both full. And our fulnesse in the two latter, the effects of these two Actes, or makings of a woman vnder th
                     •
                   Lawe, Redemption, and Adoption, which mak
                  •
                vp all. That, when we were strangers from th
                  •
                
               Adoption; and not that onely, but lay vnder th
                     •
                   Law, as men whom sentence had passed on From this latter, we are redeemed, (Hee vnd
                     ••
                   the Law, that we from vnder the Law) Tha
                  •
                (being so redeemed) we might further recei
                     ••
                   the adoption of children, (and as Hee the Son
                     ••
                  
                  
of man: So we might be made the sonnes of God.) Which two are as much as we can wish. And this is Our fulnesse.
            
            And to these, I will craue leaue to adde another fulnesse o
                  •
                
               Ours, rising out of these, and to make a motion, for it. That, as it is the time, when wee from God, receiue the fulness
                     •
                  
                
               
                  •
               f his bounty: so it might be the time also, when He from vs, may likewise receiue the fulnesse of our duetie. The time, of His Bounty fulnesse, and the time, of our Thanke-fulnesse: That it may be Plenitudo temporis, quà ad illum, quà ad nos; downeward, and vpward; from Him to vs, and from vs to Him againe: and so be both wayes, The fulnesse of time.
            
            
               Quando venit plenitudo temporis.
               
                  FIRST, there is a fulnesse in Time. The terme,
                     Plenitudo tempor
                           ••
                        
                     
                   
                  Fulnesse, carieth our conceit to measure straight, fromwhence it is borrowed: which, is then said to be full, when it hath as much,Sap. 11.17. as it can hold. Now, God hath made all things in measure: and if all things, then Time.
                  Eph. 4.13. Yea, Time it selfe is by the Apostle called, Mensura temporis, The measure of time. As

then, all other measures haue theirs; so the measure of Time also hath his fulnesse, when it receiueth so much, as the capacitie will conteine no more. So, Time is a measure: it hath a capacitie: that hath a fulnesse. That, there is such a thing as, as the fulnesse of time.
               
               
                  
                     Venit pleni

                  B
                     ••
                  , nothing is full at first: no more is Time by and by. Venit plenitudo, it commeth, not at once, or straightwayes, but by steps and paces, neerer and neerer: Fill's, first a quarter, and then halfe, till at last it come to the brim. And degrees there be,
                     Alcuin.
                   by which it commeth. Ecce palmares posuisti dies meos, Psal. 39.6. From which word palmares, it is an obseruation of one of the Fathers, a man may reade his time. In his owne hand, visibly there is an ascent, the fingers rise still, till they come to the top of the middle finger; and when they be come thither
                     •
                   downe againe by like descent, till they come to the little, which is the lowest of all: So is i
                     •
                   in our time; It riseth still by degrees, till we com
                     •
                   to the full pitch of our Age, and then declinet
                     •
                   againe, till we grow to the lower end of ou
                     •
                   
                  dayes. But, howsoeuer it may be (as it oft falle
                     •
                   out) the descent is sudden, wee goe down
                     •
                   headlong without degrees, goe away in a mo
                     •
                  ment;

yet, euer this holdeth, to our fulnesse we come not, but by degrees.
               
               Now thirdly,
                     Quando venit.
                   this comming hath a Quando venit, a time, when it commeth thither. As a time there is a great while,Ioh. 7.6. when we may say, Nondum venit hora, the time is not yet come, while the measure is yet but in filling: So at the last, a time too, that we may say,Ioh. 12.23. 
                  Venit hora, the time is now come, when the measure is full: That is, A time there is, when time commeth to the full: As in the day, when the Sunne commeth to the Meridian Line: in the moneth, when it commeth to the point of opposition with the Moone: in the yeare, when to the Solstice: In man, when he commeth to his full yeres: for that is the fulnesse of time the Apostle alledgeth, in the three verses before.
               And, when is that When, that time thus commeth to his fulnesse? Quando misit Deus,
                  
                     Quando.
                   when God sends it: for, Time receiues his filling from God. Of it selfe, time is but an emptie measure, hath nothing in it: Many dayes and moneths 
                     •
                  unne ouer our heads, Dies inanes, sayth the Psalmist. Menses vacui, sayth Iob: Emptie dayes, Psal. 78.33. Void moneths, without any thing to fill them, Iob 7.3.
               
                  That which filleth time, is some memorable thing of Gods powring into it, or (as it is in the Text) of his sending, to fill it withall. Mi
                        •
                     it Deus is it: and so commeth Time to be more or lesse full; therafter as that is, which God sends to fill it.
               Now, many memorable mission's did God make before this heere; whereby in some measure, hee filled vp certaine times of the yeere vnder Moses, and the Prophets: all which, may well be termed, The implements of Time.
               
               But, for all them, the measure was not yet full
                        •
                     filled perhaps to a certaine degree, but not full to the brimme: full it was not (seeing it migh
                     •
                   bee still fuller) till God sent That, then which, 
                     •
                   more full could not be sent.
               
               And, That He sent, when He sent his Sonne, a fuller then whom, He could not send, nor Time could not receiue. Therefore, with the sending Him, when that was, Time was at the top, that was the Quando venit, then it was plenitud
                        •
                      temporis, indeed.
               
                   And, well might that Time, be called the fulnesse of Time. For when he was sent into the world,Col. 2.9.
                  Ioh. 3.34. in whom the fulnes of the Godhead dwel
                        •
                      bodily: In whom the Spirit was not by measure
                        •
                     
                  
                  
In whom was the fulnesse of grace and trueth.
                  Ioh. 1.14. Ioh. 1.16. Of whose fulnesse we all receiue, when He was sent, that was thus full, then was Time at the full.
               
               And well also might it be called the fulnesse of Time, in another regard. For, till then all was but in promise, in shadowes, and figures, and prophecies onely, which fill not, God knowes. But when the performance of those promises, the body of those shadowes, the substance of those figures, the fulfilling or filling full of all those Prophecies came, then came the fulnesse of Time, truely so called. Till then, it came not: then it came.
               
               And well might it bee called the fulnesse of time, in a third respect. For, then the Heire, (that is the world) was come to his full age: and so, that the fittest time, for him to bee sent. For to that, compareth the Apostle their estate then; that, the former times vnder Moses and the Prophets were as the Nonage of the world; sub Paedagogo, in the 3. Chapter, ver. 24. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , at their A.B.C. or rudiments, (as in the very last words before these) Their estate then, as of Children in their minority, little differing from seruants. For, all this while, nondum venit, the fulnesse of time was not yet come.
                  
But a time there was, as for man; so for mankind to come to his full yeeres: That time, came with Christs comming, and Christs comming with it, and neuer till then, was the fulnesse of time; but then it was.
               And let this be enough, for this point; more there is not in the Text. But if any shall further aske, why then, at that age of the world, the world was at his full age, iust then, and neither sooner nor later? I know, many heads haue bene full of deuices, to satisfie mens curiositie in that point. But, I hold it safest,, to rest with the Apostle (in the second verse) on Gods 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Let that content vs. Then was the time, for that was Tempus praefinitum á Patre, the time appointed of the Father. For, euen among men, (though the Father being dead) the Lawe setteth a time, for the Sonne to come to his heritage: yet the Father liuing, no time can be prefixed, but onely when it liketh Him to appoint; and the Father here liueth;Acts 1.7. and therefore let his 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   stay vs. The times and seasons, He hath put in his owne power, it is not for vs to know them. This is for vs to know, that, with his appointment, we
                     •
                   must come to a full point. So doth the Apostle
                  
                     •
                   and so let vs, & not busie our selues much with

it Time is but the measure or caske, that wherewith it is filled, doth more concerne vs. To that therefore let vs come.
               The degrees are seuen (as I said.) To take  them, as they rise. Misit Deus. God sent.
                  God sent. That standeth first; and, at it, let our first stay be. That, will fall out, to make the first degree. For, euen this, that God sent at all, Ipsum mittere Dei, this very sending it selfe, is a degree. It is so; and so we would reckon of it, if wee knew the Sender, and who he is; the Maiestie of his presence how great it is, & how glorious, how farre surpassing all we can see on earth.
               For Him, for such an one as Hee, to condescend, but to send; is sure a degree. For, ynough it had beene, and more then ynough, for Him, to be sent to; and not to send, Himselfe. To haue sit still, and beene content, that we might send to him, and haue our message and petition admitted, and not, he send to vs. That had beene asmuch as we could 
                     •
                  ooke for, and well, if wee might haue 
                     •
                  ene vouchsafed but that. But it was he that sent, not we to him first, nay, not we to him at 
                     •
                  ll, but, he to vs.
               
               
                  He to vs? And what were we, that He to vs?

Vs,
                  Ephes. 2.12. (as elsewhere he termeth vs) meere Aliens from Him, and His Houshold; Not that onely, but Vs, in case of men, whom the Law had passed vpon. (So is our estate described in the end of the Text:) for Him, to send to Vs, so great as He, to such as we; to thinke vs, tanti, so much worth, as to make any mission, or motion, or to disease any about vs; This, may well be the first. Be it then so; that to vs, or for vs, or concerning vs, God would trouble himselfe, to make any sending. A fulnesse, there is in this. Full he was; a fulnesse there was in him, (euen the fulnesse of compassion in His bowels ouer our estate,) else such a Sender, would neuer once haue sent.
               
               
                  
                     His Sonne.
                  
                  God sent; Sent, and sent his Sonne. That, (I  make no question,) will beare a second. Other
                        •
                     
                   He might haue sent; and whosoeuer it had bene Hee had sent, it might well haue serued ou
                     •
                   turnes. If, sent by the hand of any his Seruants, any Patriarch, Prophet, any ordinary messenger, it had beene ynough. So hitherto had bene his Sending. So, and no otherwise
                     •
                   euer till now.
               Then, if to send by any may seeme sufficient
                     •
                   to send his Sonne, must needs seeme full. For
                     •
                   euer the more excellent the Person sent
                        •
                     
                  
                  
the more honourable the sending: the greater He, the fuller it. Now, greater there is not, then his sonne,
                  Colos. 2.9. His first, His onely begotten Sonne, in whom the fulnes of the Godhead dwelt; In sending him, He sent the greatest, the best, the fullest thing He had.
               To heape the measure vp yet more, with the cause of his sending, in the word

                  ; It was voluntarie. Hee sent him not for need: but for meere loue to vs, and nothing else. There was no absolute necessitie, that He should haue sent him. He might haue done what Hee intended by the meanes and ministerie of some besides. God could haue enabled a Creature; a Creature enabled by God, and the power of his might, could soone haue troad downe Sathan vnder our feete. But, if it had bene any other Hee had sent, his loue and regard to vs, had not shewed so full. It had bin ostendit Deus charitatem, but not, Ecce quantam charitatem ostendit Deus.

               For, if one be in debt and danger of the Law, to haue a Brother, of the same blood, made of the same woman, both (as we say) lying in one belly; will little auaile him, except He will also come vnder the Law, that is, become his Surety, and vndertake for him. And such was our estate. As Debters wee were,Col. 2.14. by vertue of Chirographum contra nos, The hand writing that was against vs. Which was our Bond, and we had forfeited it. And so, factus ex muliere, to vs, without factus sub lege, would haue bene to small purpose.
               No remedy therefore, He must be new made, made againe once more. And so He was, cast in a new mould, and at his second making, made vnder the Law, vnder which if He had not bene made, we had bene marred: euen quite vndone for euer, if this had not beene done for vs too. Therefore, He became bound for vs also, entred Bond anew, tooke on Him, not onely our nature, but our Debt; our Nature, and Condition both Nature, as men: Condition, as sinful men; expressed in the words following; [Them that were vnder the lawe] for that was our Condition.
                  
There had indeed beene no captiuitie in him, to doe this, if the former had not gone before, factum ex muliere; if He had not bene, as we, made of a woman, but the former was for this; Made of a woman He was, that he might be mad

                   become sub lege, which before He could not, but then he might and did: And so, this still is the fuller.

                     •
                   did, He shed then a few drops of his blood wherby He signed the Bonde (as it were) and gaue those few drops then, tanquan arrham vniuersi sanguinis effundendi, as a pledge or earnest, that when the fulnesse of time came, He would be readie to shed all the rest, as He did For, I would not haue you mistake, though we speake of this, sub lege, being vnder the law, in the termes of a Debt sometimes: yet, the

truth is, this debt of ours was no money debt, we were not sub lege pecuniariâ, but Capitali: and the debt of a Capitall law, is death: and vnder that, vnder Death He went, and that the worst death law had to inflict, euen the Death of the Crosse, the most bitter, reprochfull, cursed death of the Crosse. So that vpon the matter, factus sub lege, and factus in Cruce, come both to one; one amounts to as much, as the other. Well, this Hee did vndertake for vs, at His Circumcision: and therefore then, and not till then, He had his n

               Howbeit all this, was but one part of the law, But He was made sub lege vniuersâ, vnder the whole law, and that, not by his death onely, but by his life too. The one halfe of the law, (that is, the Directiue part) Hee was made vnder that, and satisfied it, by the Innocencie of his life,

without breaking so much, as one iot or title of the lawe: and so, answered that part (as it might be, the Principall.) The other halfe of the law, which is the Penaltie, He was vnder that part also, and satisfied it, by suffering a wrongful death, no way deserued, or due by him, and so answered that (as it might be the forfeiture.

               3. And so we are come, to the full measure of His sending. And, that we are come to the ful, ye shall plainely see,Verse 5. by the ouerflowing, by that which we receiue from this fulnesse, which is the latter part of the verse, and is our fulnesse, euen the fulnesse, of all that we can desire. For, if we come now to aske, For whom, is al this adoe This Sending, This making, ouer & ouer againe? it is for vs. So is the conclusion, vt nos, that wee might from this fulnesse, receiue the full of our wish. For in these two behinde, Redemption, and Adoption; to be redeemed, and to be adopted, are the full of all, we can wish our selues.
               The transcendent Diuision, of Good and Euill, is it, that comprehendeth all. And heere it is. Our desire can extend it selfe no further then to be rid of all euill, and to attaine all, that good is. By these two, (being redeemed, and being

                  adopted) we are made partakers of them both. To be redeemed from vnder the law, is to be quit of all euill. To receiue the Adoption of children, is to be stated in all that is Good. For, all Euill is in being vnder the law, from whence we are redeemed, and, all Good, in being inuested, in the heauenly Inheritance, whereunto we are adopted. Thus stood the case with vs:Eph

               Briefly of either:That hee might redeeme them that were vnder the Lawe. And first, of our Redeeming. Redeeming (as the word giueth it) is a second buying, or buying backe of a thing, before aliened or sold. Euer, a former sale is presupposed before it. And such a thing there had gone  before. A kinde of alienation, had formerly beene, whereby we had made away our selues, (for a sale I cannot call it, it was for such a trifle) our nature aliened in Adam, for the forbidden fruit; a matter of no moment. Our Persons likewise, daily wee our selues alien them, for some trifling pleasure, or profit, matters not much more worth. And, when wee haue thus passed our selues away, by this Selling our selues vnder sinne,
                  Rom. 7.14. the Law seizeth on vs, and vnder it wee are

What euill is there not, in this estate, and on euery soule that is in it? Well then, the first vt, the first ende is, To get vs ridde, from vnder this estate.
               He did it: not by way of intreaty, step in

and beg our pardon: That would not serue; Sold we were, and bought we must be. A price must be laide downe for vs: To get vs from vnder the Lawe, it was not a matter of Intercession

                  or it, and haue it. No, He must purchase it, and pay for it. It was a matter of Redemption.
               
               And, in Redemption or a Purchase, we looke to the Price. For, if it be at any easie rate, it is so much the beter. But with an high price, He Purchased vs; it cost Him deare to bring it about

pay be their Redemption: and so it was. And, so wee come, to bee redeemed from vnder the Lawe.
               
               And this is to be marked, that Them that were vnder the Law, and, We that are to receiue, are but one, one and the same persons both: But being so redeemed, then we are our selues. Till then, the Apostle speakes of vs, in the third person, Them, that were vnder the Lawe, as of some strangers, as of men of another world, none of our owne: But now being redeemed, the stile changeth. He speaketh of vs, in the first person vt nos, that we: for till now we were not our owne, we were not our selues, but now we are: till this, it was the old yeere still with vs, but with the new yeere, commeth our new estate.
               Being thus redeemed,That wee might receiue the Adoption of Children we are got from vnder the Lawe: and that is much. Till a party come to be once vnder it, and feele the weight of it, hee shall neuer vnderstand this aright; but then he shall. And if any haue beene vnder it,
                   he knowes what it is, and how great a benefit to be got thence. But is this all? No, He leaues vs not heere; but to make the measure compleat, yea, euen to flowe ouer, He giues vs not ouer, when he had rid vs out of this wretched estate,

till He haue brought vs to an estate, as good, as He himselfe is in. After our Redemption, we stood, but as Prisoners enlarged; that was all: But, still we were as strangers, no part, nor portion in God, or his kingdome: nor, no reason, we should hope for any. He now goeth one step further, which is the highest and furthe
                     •
                  t step of all. For further then it, He cannot goe.
               
                  That we might receiue the Adoption, (that is) from the estate of Prisoners condemned, be translated into the estate of Children Adopted. Of Adopted: for, of naturall, we could not: That is His peculiar alone, and He therein onely abou
                     •
                   vs, but else, fully to the ioynt fruition, of all that He hath, which is fully as much, as we could desire. And this is our Fieri out of His Factum ex muliere. We made the Sonnes of God, as Hee the Sonne of man;
                  2. Pet. 1.4. We made partakers of his Diuine
                  
                     •
                   as He of our humane nature. To purchase our pardon, to free vs from death, and the laws sentence, this seemed a small thing to Him:2 Sam. 7.19. ye
                     •
                   this is Lex hominis. Mans goodnesse goeth no farther; and gracious is the Prince, that dot
                     •
                   but so much. For who euer heard of a condemned man, Adopted afterward; or that thought i
                     •
                   not enough and enough, if Hee did but scape
                     •
                  
                  
with his life? So farre then to exalt his bountie, to that fulnesse; as pardon, and Adopt both, Non est lex hominis haec. No such measure among men, Zelus Domini Exercituum, The zeale of the Lord of Hosts, was to performe this:Es. 9.7
                        •
                     
                   
                  The fulnesse of the Godhead, dwelt in Him, that brought this to passe.
               For (to speake of adopting:) We see it dayly; No father adopts, vnlesse He be orbe, haue no childe; or i
                     •
                   He haue one, for some deepe dislike, haue cast him of.Heb. 1.3

                   But God had a Sonne, The brightnes of his Glorie; The true character of his Substance:Mat. 17.5. and no displeasure there was; No, In quo complacitum est, In whom He was absolutely well pleased: yet, would He by adoption, for all that,Heb. 
                        •
                     .10. 
                  bring many Sonnes to Glory. Is not this full on his part?
               We see againe, no Heire will endure to heare of Adoption, nay, nor diuide his Inheritance, no not with his naturall Brethren. Then, that the Heire of all things,Heb. 1.2. should admit ioynt Heires to the Kingdome hee was borne to;Rom. 8.17. and that admit them, not out of such, as were neere him, but from such as were strangers, yea such as had beene condemned men vnder the Lawe, Is not this full on his part? To purchase vs, and

to purchase for vs, both at once? And not to doe this for vs alone but to assure it to vs: For, as his Father, in this verse, sends Him: So, in the next verse, He sends the Spirit of his Sonne, to giue vs sei

                  eall Thankesgiuing indeed. In which cup is the blood, not onely of our redemption of the Couenant, that freeth vs from the Lawe, and maketh the Destroyer pass eouer vs:Mat. 26.28. but of our Adoption of the new Testament also, which intitles vs, and conueyes vnto vs (Testament-wise, or by way of Legacie) the estate wee haue in the ioy and blisse of his heauenly kingdome, whereto we are adopted. We are then made partakers of Him, and with Him of both these His benefits. We there are made to drinke of the Spirit,
                  1. Cor. 12.13. by which we are sealed,
                  Ephe. 4.30. 
                  to the day of our redemption, and adoption both. So that, our freeing from vnder the law, our inuestiture into our new adopted state, are not fully consummate without it.
               And what? Shall this be all? No, when this is done, there is allowance of 12. dayes more, for this fulnesse of time: that, we shrinke not vp our duety then into this day alone, but in the rest also remember, to redeeme some part of the day, to adopt some howre at the least, to bethinke our selues of the duetie, the time calleth to vs for: that so, we haue not Iobs dies vacuos, no

day quite emptie in this fulnesse of time. Hereof assuring our selues, that what we doe in this fulnesse of time, will haue full acceptance at His hands. It is the time of his birth, which is euer a time as accepted,
                  2. Cor. 6.2. so of accepting, wherein, what i

                   done, will be acceptebly taken to the full: fully accepted, and fully rewarded by Him, of whose fulnesse we all receiue:Ioh. 1.16. with this condition, of grace for grace, euer one grace for an other.
               And so, growing from grace to grace, finally from this fulnes, we shall come to be partakers of another yet behinde, to which we aspire. For all this, is but the fulnesse of time
