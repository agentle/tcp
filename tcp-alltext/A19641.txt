            TO THE RIGHT Honourable Robert Lee, Lord Maior of the honorable Citie of London: And to the Right worſhipfull the Aldermen his brethren.
            
            
               I Am not ignorant (Right Honorable and right worſhipfull Senators) of the cuſtome of this age, which is, that ſuch as write bookes do vſe to dedicate thē to ſome worthy perſō or other, vnder whoſe protection they might paſſe with more ſafetie from the byting of the enuious: ſo that many times a light diſcourſe is grac't with a iudiciall cenſor: I was therefore imboldned to obſerue the ſame Method, and that chiefly becauſe I know true Vertue loueth whatſoeuer is like it ſelfe be it neuer ſo little, and accepteth what is zealouſly offered, though not alwayes deſeruingly excellent, whē baſe deiected minds want wiſedome & experience to direct the puritie

of iudgement. And although I haue ſcattered here and there ſome iarring notes and harſh conſonants, vntunable to a modeſt eare: yet the vglines of vice made me ſtriue to paint out her lanus-face to the eye of the world. Alexander refuſed not a cup of colde water at the hands of a ſilly begger, the poore widows myte was more accepted then the abundance of the Scribes and Phariſes, for ſhe offered all that ſhe had, they of their ſuperfluitie: ſo a noble mind doth alwaies patronize a poore gift as willingly, as it is deuoutly dedicated. If in like ſort your bounties wil deign to giue free admittance to this homely worke, I ſhall be prouoked not to end with this my rude beginning, but ſtriue to ſhewe ſome greater monument of my loue heereafter. And thus leauing to trouble your wiſedoms with tedious circumſtance, I rather abreuiate of that I would ſay, then by ſpeaking too much to breed ſuſpitiō of my ſimple well meaning. And ſo I humbly commit your affaires to the good guidance of the Almightie, and my ſelfe to your fauourable cenſures.

               Ex viro, dicitur virtus. The Stoikes, call Vice and Vertue, Animalia, liuing creatures, becauſe by them a man is diſcerned, for in reſpect of Vertue, a man is ſaid to be a man, which is the Etymologie of the word, and in reſpect of Vice, to be a

                  〈◊〉
                proper to a vertuous and good man.
            
               Vertue is diuided into two parts, the Intellectiue, and the the Mortall, the former is begotten and nouriſhed by good tutors, reading good Bookes, and exerciſe, from this floweth wiſedome, ſcience, prudence, memorie. The latter commeth by cuſtome and vſe, for theſe two are ſo forcible, as by it a man may get him a ſecond nature,Actus. and this worketh this thing called Actus, in the extreame parts, and is the mother of Liberalitie, Fortitude, and of all good manners.
            The diuine eſſence of the ſoule, beholdeth nothing with contentment, but the perfect Idea of Vertue▪
                being ſo pure and excellent, as ſhe onely aymeth at perfect happineſſe▪ if the corruption and diſobedience of the body, did not contaminate & defile her. And therefore the Philoſophers ſay, whē ſhe is in the company of good men ſhe poſſeſſeth ioy, but among euill, is euermore in heauineſſe: for the ſoule is occupied in heauenly contemplation, and delighted to know her Creator, his omnipotent maieſtie and power, the workes of nature: but being impriſoned followes the bodies inclination,The Chriſtian Vertue. and by that meanes is kept backe from the hauen wherevnto it would moſt willingly arriue. But according to a Chriſtian expoſition, the verie faculties of the ſoule, are ſo eſſentially defiled with Adams tranſgreſſions, that it hath no power to thinke one good thought, or beget an acceptable motion, before it be regenerated and borne anew; for Chriſtian Vertue ſtandeth in Faith, Hope, and Charitie, not faſhioned according to Philoſophie; but to haue him the Author, which is both truth and righteouſneſſe.
            
               
We muſt not reſt then vpon the morrall vertue, and make that the chiefe good, which are but ſteppes to clyme vp therevnto, as the wiſe Heathen taught: for all theyr doctrine, was but to faſhion the outward man to ciuill obedience, making that the end which are but motiues to the end. For it is not all one, to be a morrall wiſe man, and a good Chriſtian, a great proficient in humane Sciences, and a great Clarke in diuine miſteries, heere is a maine difference, let no man repoſe himſelfe, vpon ſuch a ſandie and ſhallow foundation, if he will ſtand ſure: but build on Chriſt the Rocke, the bright ſtarre of the immortall maieſtie, on him to caſt Anchor, purifie the inward parts, and digge vp that dunghill of filthineſſe, deriued from originall corruption. Mans happineſſe ſtandeth not in pleaſures, honour, nor in the goods of Fortune: but onely in thoſe holy Vertues which proceed from a pure heart. This is the plaine pathway to ſanctitie, and immortallitie, Vice ſincking downe to hell, the one, with Eagle-winges mounts vp to heaue

            But to proſecute my intent, which is to handle the morrall Vertues, and lay open the parts of humanitie, it wil not be amiſſe to touch by the way, the foure chiefe and principall Vertues, called cardinall Vertues, as Prudence, 
                     •
                  uſtice, Fortitude, and Temperance, which are diſtinguiſhed one from the other by their ſeuerall properties, all conioyne in one, and make a vnion: For though Vertue be ſubſiſting in one ſingle being, yet becauſe of diuers workes, ſhe is deuidable, and albeit many ſprigges growe out of theſe foure braunches, yet is ſhee called

               Vertue in the ſingular number.
            
               Prudence. Prudence, is a certaine brightneſſe ſhining in the minde, by which the light of truth is deſcried, foreſeeing what is fit to be done, a true affection, labouring by reaſon to finde out the quallitie, and to iudge what is iuſt, fit, honeſt, profitable, equall, and good, not onely aduiſedly looking to the firſt motiue cauſe: but alſo to the conſequent and finall endes, by this the preſent felicitie, and infelicitie of this life, is ſweetly tempered, and all things ordered in comelineſſe.
            Whoſoeuer raſhly ſetteth vpon his buſineſſe without her, ruſheth vpon the rockes of errour▪ and by his owne headie opinion commeth ſoone to ruine: becauſe it is impoſſible to effect any thing well, vnleſſe he be guided by her light, neither can hee be able to diſcerne good from euill, things profitable, from thinges preiudiciall: but as a blinde man doth venterouſly trauaile without a guide, and at euery ſtep readie to ſtumble: ſo hee that is ignorant in plotting his affaires, wadeth in darkeneſſe, wherein euery ſtorme of triall doth ouerturne his pollicie.
            A prudent man, is ſo cautelous and vigillant, as wel in the conſideration of fore-paſſed daungers, as in preiudicating perills to come, that he meeteth with euerie miſchiefe, and is not ouertaken, with non putaui, had I wiſt, for hauing ſet his reſt on a firme ground, doth not doubt but expect, not repēt in the end, but reioice in the whole action: ſo that ſhe regardeth things paſt, preſent, and to come, and bendeth her force to that part that is needfull, to defend the weakeneſſe of reaſon, and when ſhe hath drawne out the plot, which honeſtie doth require, committeth it to Sapience, whch as a hand-maide,

is readie to execute that in the outward worke, which before was determined. The main difference betweene theſe two, is, the former is a generall comprehending and knowledge of things; the other an experience of that in action. For as by reaſoning, reading, and conuerſing with wiſe men, a man may vnderſtand much: yet without practiſe all is nothing. Before a Phiſition doth miniſter to his Patient, he ſearcheth into the nature of the diſeaſe, and acquaints himſelfe with the ſtate of the body, which hauing once found out, it is to no end if he apply not himſelfe in outward meanes, to benefite the ſicke perſon with his potion: So if there be but a defuſedScire tuum nibil eſt: niſi te ſcire, ho

To be briefe, ſhe is the right diſpoſer of all things, an enemie to ignorance, the key of knowledge, which openeth the rich treaſure of diuine and humane things; doing nothing but that which is right, iuſt, and praiſe-worthy.
            
               Iuſtice. Iuſtice, is a vertue that giueth to eueryman his owne, the firſt and principall part whereof is, and euer was, to doo God that honour which is due to his diuine maieſtie, conſiſting in feare, loue, & reuerence, for as Iuſtice

will equally render to euery man his owne, & bring diſcording things to an equalitie, by conſidering the difference betweene them: ſo much more and moſt of all, it is moſt iuſt, to loue God, of whom wee haue all that we haue, and being periſhed by originall corruption, were eftſoones recouered, by the ſufferings of his ſon: this part of Iuſtice, ought to be imbraced with other affectiō than the Heathen, who wandring in the darknes of ignorance, know not God as he is. A iuſt man coueteth not that that is an others, but rather neglecteth his owne for the good of the Common-wealth, nor with a greedie humor, doth incroach vpon his neighbors poſſeſſion. Without Iuſtice, no eſtate can ſubſiſt, for all vertues are comprehended vnder the name of Iuſtice, of which a man is ſaid to be a good man, for all the other vertues cannot make a man good, if Iuſtice be abſent. Tully calleth her the Lady & Queen of all other vertues; by her is the ſocietie of man preſerued, the moſt excellēt bleſſing that euer God gaue to man was, to be gouerned by Iuſtice, which bridleth the hot fury of the wicked, comforteth the innocent, & equally decideth between Meum, & Tuā. And he that is exerciſed herein, his mind is lifted vp to the apprehenſion of greater wiſdome. For howſoeuer the world is troubled with hurly burly, yet the quietneſſe of his minde is no whit diſtracted, but reſting in ſecuritie, ſmileth at the worlds turbulent ſtate. Finally it is a bloud in the vain, giuing life to the whole body, the head of all vertues: for of her ſelfe ſhe may do many things, but without her the reſt can doo nothing rightly.

the greateſt perils, and with eager purſuite to hunt after honourable actions, thirſting after glory, not reſpecting the tedious difficultie of the paſſages therevnto, to encounter wiih dangers, wade through the myſtic clouds of darknes, & willingly endure all bitternes of fortune, for the ſafegard of the country, ſuch were Scipiones, Fabij, Alcibiades, Hannibal, &c. who by their valour & great prowes, reached to the top of honour. Neither is true Fortitude meaſured by the compaſſe of a great body, nor by dooing great enterpriſes, in reſpect of the huge ſtature, but by a fierce and couragious ſpirit, ſtri

Heere was cauſe to make a coward valiant, and the fearefull forward to fight, becauſe he was compelled to take vp weapons for his owne ſafetie; and he that will not defend himſelfe, is not worthy to liue in peace, eſpecially when his wife, children, father, mother, brothers, ſiſters, yea the whole Countrey is in daunger

We may call to mind, and we cannot remember it too often, the ouerthrowe they then had, not ſimply in reſpect of our owne proweſſe, but by the aſſiſtance of a higher power, we being but a poore handfull to their great multitude; they came like Briarius, threatning the heauens, and caſting mountaines at Iupiter; yet theyr glorious tytle of inuincible was confounded, to theyrGod g

to aſſaile a greatmany, beyond hope to vanquiſh, it is no maruaile, if the ſucceſſe fall out againſt his deſire, for Ne Herculus contra duos. For Hercules himſelfe held it oddes to deale with two: but when for the common good of the Countrey (as I ſaid before) any man ſhall vndertake ſome hard aduenture to free it of ſome imminent perill (if ſent by imperiall commaund) though he looſe his life in the action, yet for that hee is indued with true Fortitude, doth winne immortalitie: as the three Romans called Decij, who for the ſafegard of their Countrey auowed to dye, and with reſolute and vndaunted courages, pierced the hoſt of their enemies, and though they loſt their liues, yet by their ſtout example gaue ſuch audacitie and courage to the reſt of the Romaines by prouoking them forward, as they eaſily obtained the victorie, which was thought to be vnconquerable. I might ſpeake the like of Codrus, Marcarius, Curtius, Marcus, and Regulus, which dyed moſt willingly for their Countrey. I might recite here alſo a Catalogue of thoſe valorous Engliſh Knights, that haue honourably yeelded vp their liues in the field of Mars, for their Prince and Countrey: but that I intend not now to make an Apologie of this Vertue, but referre it to a Treatiſe of Iuſtice, which I ſuppoſe ſhall ſucceed this worke, eſpecially vpon the improuement of this, God giuing mee time and quietneſſe of minde to performe that.

Extreames are euer hurtfull; for if a man eate too much or too little, doth it not hurt the body? ſo is it of too immoderate labour, or too much idleneſſe, of too much boldneſſe, and too much cowardneſſe: theſe extremities are vicious and euill, but the meane doth temper them both.
            No man is wiſe, happy, or any thing worth, if Temperance ſquare not out the courſe of his life. And herein the benefite of olde age is to bee honoured, for that it hath this preheminence ouer youth, time hath weakened theyr affections, abated their courage, and ſtayed the intemperate blaſtes of vnbrideled libertie, and by long experience haue gottē a more large portiō then they, whoſe affections being ſtrong, and diſcretion weake, ſet themſelues againſt this Vertue, eclipſe her brightneſſe with the fogges of ignorance. And for this cauſe haue wiſe men ſo ioyfully embraced olde age, which Tully ſo highly applaudes in his booke De Senectute.
            
            
               
This is guided by Prudence, which doth gouerne the life of man with ſuch reaſon, as ſhee is euer carefull for the welfare of the body, by curbing thoſe paſſions of the mind, which are vehement and vnruly: by her the mind is made capable of honeſt actions, and beautifull demeanours, and like a prouident gouerneſſe, ruleth ouer concupiſcence & flouds of luſts, which would elſe ſurround the puritie of the minde. A potion to purge the ſoule, an Antidote againſt pride, and a valiant tryumpher ouer flaming deſires, not like Aetna, too hotte, or Caucaſſus too colde: but is content betweene both, and reioyceth in it.
            If the bodie be not dieted with moderation, it will proue a ſtubborne ſeruant to the ſoule, vnfruitfull, fit for nothing but thorny cogitations, the greateſt enemies to the ſpirituall powers that can be, for the fleſh pampered in delicates, or kept ſhort of her naturall needments, is effeminated, corrupted, and weakened, and many diſeaſes be gotten, which are all ſtaid by a meane and temperate dyet and the boyling luſts of the bodie aſſwaged.
            Thus farre of theſe Vertues: more might be added, if I meant to intreat of them at large: but this briefe recapitulation, may ſerue as an introduction, to our following diſcourſe. Omnis virtus, vna virtus abſoluta, All Vertues, are but one ſimple Vertue, being chained andPlato. linked ſo neer together, as one cannot be ſundred from the other, without diſparagement of the whole. Fortitude is a noble Vertue, but if deſtitute of Iuſtice, ſhee is hurtfull to the good; if Temporance keepe not her vnder ſhe will turne into rage; and if Prudence be abſent, they all fall into error. There is a mutuall league, a proximitie, and neare acquaintance, which doth conglutinate and

ioyne them all in one, one muſt haue relation to an other, and follow by degrees; Pietie, Truth, and Temperance, muſt march before Fortitude; In a word, Vertue is no other but Vitium fugere: hating Vice, and loathing euil, and we better knowe her by her contrary, then by her ſelfe, which doth make the imagination geſſe at Vertue a farre off: ſo that knowing Vice, is a good grounde of Vertue, whereby the inwarde powers are helde in, with vnſpotted ſimplicitie, farre more better then ſuch as cunningly ſeeke to knowe what Vertue is, then willingly betake themſelues to follow it in theyr life, ſo that knowledge is not enough alone, vnleſſe it be practiſed by outward action: for it is better to doo wiſely, then wiſely to deuiſe.
            So that in generall, Vertue rightly carried, comprehendeth whatſoeuer, is conducing and leading to a good and holy life, and hee that once hath taſted the ſweetneſſe of one, is drawne with much deſire to an other; one good thing begetteth an other, and taking once a deepe impreſſion, his eſtate is thereby preſerued incorruptible without chaunge: whereas if a man taketh holde on externall goods, and leane to the mutabilitie of Fortune, doth often ſtumble vpon many daungerous Rockes, and fall into wretchedneſſe, when Vertue will firmely vpholde a man in the midſt of all calamitie.

            Siluer is cheaper then Gold, and Gold of leſſe price then Vertue. She is of great moment and moſt ineſtimable value, although a carnall and groſſe minde, cannot equally deeme the price of ſo rare a Iewell, for where ignorance doth couer the minde, ſhe is reiected

and held of baſe eſteeme: as a ſimple peaſant trampleth many wholſome hearbes vnderfoote, which a skilfull herbaliſt would carefully gather vp, & extract ſome rare quinteſſence out of theyr hidden ſecrets. Wilt thou build thy ſafetie vpon a ſure foundation? then here is the rocke that no tempeſt can ſhake; here is a ſhelter to defend thee from perils, a ſafegard to preſerue the puritie of the ſoule, from beeing polluted by the concupiſcence of the body, and though neuer ſo many ſtormes of aduerſitie and ſhewers of perſecution, beate vpon thee (being in this world as in a wilderneſſe of woes) yet ſhrowding thy ſelfe vnder the Cannapie of Vertue, thou ioyeſt in the middeſt of all ſorrow, and though the whole world be of an vprore, yet what is that to thee? thou art no whit moued thereat, for Animo calestia tangis, thy affections are mounted vp to heauen, & thy mind aduanced aboue all earthly weakneſſe.
            It is not onely hard, but very difficill to finde out, which of the Vertues are moſt predominant, that the victory may be imputed to her, becauſe they are all knit in one ſingle vnion, for the good of the ſoule. For as one linke of a chaine draweth an other, and an other after, til it come to the laſt, the Antecedent the Relatiue: ſo one Vertue is an Adamant that draweth an other Vertue vnto it.
            And though ſhee take vp her lodging in a crooked and deformed body (as ſhe is euer readie to dwel where ſhee findeth the heart yeeldable to honeſtie) yet penetrating with inward deſire, and bringing the ſtragling powers of the minde to a vniformitie, doth make vp the want of nature, with a ſupply of grace, cauſing him

ſhine like Chriſtall, for when the life is laudably lead, there appeareth ſo great a glory, that it is not onely admirable to the eyes of man, by reaſon of formall carriage in humanitie: but alſo high pleaſing to God, by the intellectuall goodneſſe, Vertue, is the ſpurre of Honour. It is not the aboundance of wealth and great dignitie, that maketh a man truly noble: but the poſſeſſion of Vertue, which is true honour and auncient riches, and is not gotten by loytering Idleneſſe; but with induſtrie and much labour, for Ardua virtutis via eſt, Tis labours force that carrieth a man to Vertue, a hard entrance, a continuall perſeuerance, becauſe he muſt encounter againſt his paſſions, and ſtop the flouds of intemperance: for ſuch high and admirable things cannot be had without effectuall indeuour, and by how much the more ſtraighter the paſſage is therevnto; by ſo much the more carefull muſt hee be, leaſt it ſlip away through arrogance or vaine glory: for in Vertue, pride begins to ſwell, or ſome Vice or other to creep in, which if not beatē back at the firſt, wil hazard the whole frame of Vertue; or beeing maiſtred by ſome ouer-weening thought, or ſingularly carried away with ſelfe-loue, a paſſion of the minde diſquieting reaſon, doth wholly eſtraunge himſelfe from her Beatitude▪ looſing thoſe complements which formerly he was poſſeſt of.

The reward of Vertue, is true generoſitie, and where it is ioyned with great poſſeſſions, and hath long continued in the houſe of a Gentleman, without corruption of bloud, that nobilitie is moſt to be honoured, foraſmuch as long continuance hath giuen it the badge of glorie.

               Vertue. Yet if one ſhall ſtand vpon his riches, parentage, office, place, dignitie, and by theſe onely ſuppoſe to win the place of true honour, he climeth a rotten ladder: for what is all this worlds pompe, or titulary preferments, if not atchieued by Vertue? or what doth great birth auaile if hee debaſe it by his ill life? or a vertuous memorie of his aunceſtors, if hee follow not their example? are they not like ſmoake and vapours, which vaniſh with the Sunne? can a man without offence brag of the Vertues of his auncients, if his owne life be vitious? For hath he not broken off the ſucceſſion of Vertue by wilfull detraction? wherefore what worldly glory ſoeuer is otherwiſe had, is filched, and her chaſtitie at no hand will bee defiled with ſuch baſtardly plants. Prayſes and commendations waite euer on Vertue. And therefore Tully in his Tuſcul: queſtions, defineth honour to be a vnion of praiſes of good men, which iudge of Vertue without partialitie, and not by the opinion of the multitude, which looke more to a veluet Iacket, the outward brauerie, then to the minde how it is qualified: ſo that the nobleneſſe of man is his vertue, and they ought to be called noble & honorable, which are moſt honeſt and vertuous.

yee? but his Vertue and wiſedome, for which they thought him worthy of ſo high a calling; this they reckened true nobilitie: likewiſe Quintius, a poore Husbandman, was made Dictator, which was a great office, and for three moneths had a Regall power, and when he had ended his office, went againe to his olde labour without indignitie to his perſon, or derogating ought from his worthineſſe, of this high eſtimation was Vertue among them.
            He that is nobly borne, and deſcended of an auntient houſe, ſhould beare in his mind the remembrance of his birth, and frame himſelfe to imitate his parents in Vertue, as well as hee looketh to poſſeſſe their inheritance, and ioyning theſe two in one, is truly noble: for if his auntients were more noble then he, whoſe dignitie he enioyeth, his praiſe is diminiſhed, and becommeth a bye-word and a reproach, among them that haue heard of the former Vertue; or if they were vicious and of euill life, then to auoyd the ſcandal in himſelfe, to abhorre the like, and couet to liue in Vertue: ſo ſhall he purchaſe true honour to his riches, and worthily be deemed to enioy the inheritance. And there is great reaſon to induce him therevnto: for of ſuch a one there is a generall expectation of ſome notable Vertue; the eyes of all men are bent vpon him as on a Commet or blazing ſtarre, prying narrowly into him how hee liueth, what he doth, to what ſcience he bēdeth his mind, and what good hee doth in the Common-wealth, for which he is borne, and as if his priuate actions ſhould be openly done, no one word or deed of his can eſcape the common cenſure. It is the more behouefull, then to apply the mind to laudable actions, & to do good in the

place where he is, for ſo much as he may appropriate to himſelfe a good report for well doing, & by that means participate the heartie prayers, and many good wiſhes of the common people; gaine their loue, and induce thē with more facilitie, by his good example, to trace in the wholſome path that leadeth to the houſe of honour.
            Likewiſe the vnknowne, the iſſue of a baſe ſtocke, obſcurely brought vp, if he wil be aduanced to the type of honour, muſt addict himſelfe to Vertue, which will be ſo much the more glorious at the laſt, by how much more obuious his eſtate was at firſt. And this I ſuppoſe, ſhould be a ſpurre or goade to puſh them forward, becauſe they ſhall not onely bee admired by the praiſes of the good, which are the badges and ſimballes of Vertue, but alſo acquire perpetuall fame and renowme, as the ſurname thereof. What ſhould I ſay? Vertue is aThe commod

What a diuine glory is heere? that ſtriketh the beholder in admiration, dazeleth his ſight, and forceth the very abiect to reuerence him in whom it dooth appeare, for ſhee is ſo beautifull a Lady, as ſhee maketh many gaze at her a farre off, that haue no power to come nigh her, but ſtriketh into wonderment at her incomparable maieſtie, are metamorphoſed, as it were by Meduſa.

And verily, no pretence or vaine ſhewe can preuaile againſt her, but that ſhe will haue the iuſt victory and triumph ouer thoſe that haue deſpiſed her; and when they are on the toppe of their hatefull enuye, they ſhall wiſh her company, and deſire to imbrace her, though it bee but with dull affection, which the Poet well noteth,Ho

It is not the riches of Creſſus, the tryumphes of Caeſar, the conqueſts of Alexander the great, or any worldly pompe, can make a man truly happie, or crowne him with true honour, but onely Vertue.

To conclude, where the Common-wealth is guided by godly lawes of Princes, the lampe of Vertue ſhining in the hearts of ſubiects, laudable ſciences imbraced, Iuſtice without partialitie adminiſtred, the good protected, the bad puniſhed, & peace maintained; there is a happpie and bleſſed gouernment, a ſweete harmonie of nature, and an earthly Paradize: for he that ſhall goe about to counite and couple Vice & Vertue in one, putteth a man and a beaſt together: honeſtie admits no ſuch knot, for the end of good, which ought to be after one ſort, muſt not be mingled with any thing diſagreeable in an other ſort; for Vertue is no longer Vertue, if mixed with contrarie qualities: we may then ſafely conclude, that there is no goodlyer poſſeſſion then Vertue, and that it is perfect folly, to couet to be rich, mightie, and creepe vp to worldly honour, and make ſo ſmall reckening to be ſtored with Vertue, which is ſo certaine, the tytle ſo glorious and permanent, wherevpon one calleth it Dimidium animae meae, which is not vnproperly ſpoken, for take away vertue from a man, which is the plain path to ſanctimony, he muſt be numbred among thoſe creatures that haue onely eſſence, and want vnderſtanding, ſith hee aymeth not at the purpoſe of his creation.

Alas for that you haue ſmall cauſe; for ſay you were in the middeſt of yonder great ſea, loaden with treaſure, in daunger of drowning, would you not willingly loſe your goods to ſaue your life?

But the pathe leading to Vertue, though it be toyleſome, laborious, difficult, a way vneaſie to be trackt, hard to finde, craggie, ſtonie, thorny, and a ſweating turmoyle, as the Poet deſcribeth:

            But hauing thus rudely run ouer the profitable ſtudie of Vertue, in this homely manner, as the dulneſſe of my wit, and ſhortneſſe of time would ſuffer, it now remaineth to blaze out her enemie Vice, & more liuely to paint out thoſe capitall euils which oppoſe themſeluesA diometrical oppoſition betwixt Vice and Vertue. againſt honeſtie. And in this the method of the auntient Philoſophers is to be obſerued, who were not content to explain the morall vertues, with a bare and ſimple demonſtration, but alſo ſet to euery one her contrary and repugnantvice, that by due conſidering both, we might embrace the good and ſhun the euill; and that by the glory of one, the other might be more vgly and loathſome: for when Vertue is viſibly painted out, inuironed with Vice, we haue her in greater admiratiō, and her excellencies in higher regard, & therfore Fortitude hath audacitie on the one ſide, & timiditie on the other ſide, ſcience, ignorance, & ſiniſter perſwaſion, and ſo euery one, the more & the leſſe, whereby we ſee not onely the Image and reflexion, but the very abſtract and eſſence of them both, & although one would think that Temperance, a heauenly Vertue, were inough to moue to ſobrietie, yet if the many enormities that come of the contrary be omitted, a man is hardly diſſwaded. Therfore Diogenes being demaunded how one ſhould keepe himſelf ſober, by beholding (quoth he) the beaſtlineſſe

of drunkards; for it is manifeſt, that when a crabbed viſage and a misſhapen body, ſhall ſtand by an amiable & louely perſonage, the deformitie of the one doth much illuſtrate and beautifie the other. Venus was euer faireſt when ſhe ſtood by Vulcā: ſo that viewing this Antithiſis, honour and ſhame, perfect bliſſe & neuer dying ſorrow, & looking to the finall endes, & the reward that they both yeeld at laſt, we may be ſtirred vp with an ardent zeale, to deſtroy Vice, & maiſter that comberſome ſeruant paſſion.

doth not eaſily chaunge any good courſe it vndertakes, but vpon well grounded reaſons. For hauing ſome knowledge of it owne inward good, findeth nothing without of ſo equall rate, for which it ſhould alter and turne, but being firmly ſetled in an honeſt courſe, keepeth a ſweete concord betweene the intellectiue and the morrall, and yeeldeth it ſelfe ſutable, to the vertuous diſpoſition of the minde, the excellencies whereof, is manifeſted with ſuch rare demonſtrations, that it neuer ſubiecteth it ſelfe to baſe inconſtancie and feeble hazards, expelling Vice, as an enemie to all good endeuour.

Securitie and eaſe draweth to Vice, if a man then will build vpon a perfect aſſurance, and make his eſtate durable, hee muſt bend his whole endeuours to honeſt labour, & not onely do well, but continue therein to the end. But if a man ſuppoſe to be richly vertuous for one good deed; as in paying duties, impoſitions, tallages to the poore Church, or Commō-wealth; if taxed according to his abilitie, and forcibly exacted from him, it is but the ſuperficies and blaze of Vertue: for Intentio animi non actus perfecit actum: the willingnes doth approue the act: or if a man do a good deed by accident and haphazard, to blinde the opinion, and by a counterfeit ſhewe ſeeke to inſinuate into a good report, when otherwiſe the whole ſcope of his life be vitious and euill, what lawde can hee iuſtly merite? but where intirely the minde is bent therevnto, and inflamed with her pulchritude, ſo that he perſiſt and holde out therein. As for example, as he is not to be termed a

Taylor, that onely mendeth his garment, or he a ſhoomaker that onely patcheth his ſhooe, vnleſſe he make it his whole art, and expoſe himſelfe therevnto, as to his trade and occupation: ſo in like manner, he that ſtumbleth vpon one good action by chaunce, is not by and by to be deemed a perfect man; but he onely that doth well, and perſiſteth in ſo doing, and as his trade, bee wholly occupied therein. For as the minde of the huſbandman is euer vpon cattell, tillage, and ſuch things as belong to his calling, Saylors vpon their ſhips, & ſouldiers on the warres, and ſchollers on learning, ſo muſt the whole diſpoſition and carriage be occupied in Vertue, as on the day-ſtarre that guideth to the hauen of reſt.
            It is not therefore one or two good deeds, or ſuch things as are done by chaunce-medley, or peraduenture without a ſetled minde, that Vertue honoreth, for euery man goeth ſo far in common honeſtie: but when the integritie of the heart is ſtirred vp by deuotion to ſtreame out a continuall ſtore of good workes, with a mind willingly diſpoſed therevnto.

So that heere is the depth of policie, in ſifting the carryage to the humour of good men, that tracing the path of counterfeit holyneſſe, might gaine both fauour and aduancement. For as I ſaid before, if Vice ſhould come in her own ſhape, fewe or none would giue her entertainment, and though

in wardly imbraced of ſome, yet outwardly deteſted of all.

So in like manner do colde Chriſtians prey vppon the ſimplicitie of honeſt mindes, and fit themſelues to all companies. If among good and vertuous men, then is he like them, ſetting himſelfe in his beſt properties, and ſeeme to haue that which euery honeſt man ought to haue, and ſo by that means hide great vices vnder a thin colour of Vertue, that by ſo fitting his habit to the time and place, is for the humour of euery perſon, and thus by craftie and diſguiſed diſſimulation, liue in outward happineſſe, by praying vpon the good opinion of other men.
            But as Socrates ſaid to an humble hypocrite, his pride might be ſeene through the rents of his cloake: ſo this falſe and double dealing cannot ſo long be hid, but it wil breake out at one rent or other, and detect his pilferie, according to the chaunge of times.

O how pleaſant & ſweet is the ſauour of gaine to the carnall man, be it neuer ſo iniuriouſly gotten! Veſpaſian the Emperour, delighted ſo in powling and pilling his ſubiects, that nothing was exempted from his tallage: not ſo much as the very vrin made in euery houſe, but he had tribute for a certaine quantitie, for which being maligned and ill ſpoken of, his ſonne diſſwaded him from it, as a thing baſe & diſhonourable: but putting ſome of the piſſing mony in aVnlawfull gaine is ſweet to a ſtinking minde. perfumed napkin, held it to his ſonnes noſe, asking him how it ſmelt; meaning thereby, that though it was had of a filthy excrement, yet the money ſauoured well enough; Suauis odor lucriex qualibet, and that gaine is ſweete of whatſoeuer it commeth.
            All lying, in making bargaines is vtterly forbidden, falſe waits & meaſures abhominable, and wealth gotten this way clogs the ſoule: for it is neuer profitable to do euil, becauſe it is euermore hatefull: and becauſe it is alwayes honeſt to deale iuſtly, tis euermore profitable.

Surely yes, when they are not transferred with the rule of meaſure, to doo that which they may continue to do, and ſith they haue meanes to do good, to raiſe vp a happie memorie by dedicating theyr beneuolence to poſteritie: and this was the cauſe our auntients ſet forth the picture of a Gentleman with his hands open, to ſignifie that liberalitie was the honour of a Gentleman,

and that to giue was alwayes heroicall.
            Now what aduantage then hath a rich man, that by rewards may purchaſe immortalitie, and outſtrip the furie of Vice with good workes? if ſo be hee abandon vaine glory, and do that he doeth with ſinceritie.
            From a good man, gifts paſſe with a free donation, not looking backe for requitall, nor blowing the trump when he giueth almes: yet can wee not ſay, but gratitude as a hand-maide, is euer attendant; for though a poore man cannot acquite againe in meaſure, yet is he forced, will hee, nill hee, to confeſſe a debt beyond meaſure; for a good mind doth alwayes remunerate a good turne.

            So that it is a great decay of Vertue, when the merits of the vertuous are careleſly ouer-paſſed, for when men are ledde by paſſion, not by reaſon, many worthy ſpirits run out their liues vnprofitably, conſume their daies in condolement, and repent the time ſpent in ſcience, when they might haue gotten ſome adulterous trade. Now I ſay when Vertue doth knocke at the doore of liberalitie, and can haue no entrance, no maruell though ſhe be frozen with colde, & goe a begging from doore to doore: but the iniquitie of the time hatcheth many euils in aduancing where Vertue doth not merit, in raiſing vp ſuch as are voyd of all good parts. Now whē notable imploymens are vnworthily beſtowed, and giuen by corruptiō, the power of Vertue muſt needs be weakened and growe colde, and be feeble as the Orator ſaith;

Some iuggle theyr lands into gay apparell, and clap it vp in a ſmall roome, that contained a great circuite, and holde it a point of pollicie, to put their lands into two or three truncks of new cloathes, that wearing their lands on their backs, they may ſee that no ſtrip nor waſt be done by their tenants: but when they would Iuggle backward their cloaths into lands againe, alas and weladay they are ſo thredbare & out at th'elbows, that they will not match the former value, and ſo is dubd Sir Iohn Hadland; a knight of pennyleſſe bench. Thus to make Idolls of their carkaſſes for a while, begger themſelues for euer. And many ſuch baſe peſants that haue witleſſe wealth, or wealth without wit, are puft vp with ſuch preſuming thoughts, as they ambitiouſly aime to tricke vp themſelues in coſtly ſuites, and couet to match, nay to exceed men of good worth and place: but this is deſtined

to ſuch high mindes, that when they are crept vp to the toppe of ſuch brauerie, they often fall to great ſhame, being the firſt ſteppe to the downe-fall of beggerie: but howſoeuer they incroach into vaine-glorious tytles, yet wiſe men meaſure all eſtates by their vertues, not by pompe and outward brauery, and deſpiſe not him whome birth, time, place, or office, maketh worthie of ſuch coſtly ornaments, but holde it lawfull and commendable to fit their degrees in apparrell, anſwerable to their callings: but if we ſhould enter into the intollerable abuſe of Pride, wee might paint out ſome that are dying theyr faces with painting, to be more louely and amiable, and ſtretch their wits aboue Ela to be the originall of ſome new toye: but who is ſo fooliſh to count them the fairer for that? but rather the fowler: for that face that is ſlubbred & ſtarched with ſo many ointments & dregs, is more liker a ſore & ſcurffe, then a naturall face: God hath giuen the face, and thouPainted faces abhominable. defileſt it with myre & dirt; wouldſt thou be faire, to be more amiable? why, ſilence, ſobrietie, chaſtity, are beautifull ornaments, and richer then any orient pearle, and with wiſe men more ineſtimable: but indeede if thou wouldeſt intice the eyes of them that behold thee, nouriſh luſt in young men, and drawe them after thee, then this is the way: but in my opinion, it is impoſſible for thee to get a good & vertuous husband with whō thou maiſt liue quietly & wel, by ſmering thy viſage: for whē he ſeeth that thy face was but floriſht ouer, he ſhall finde thee a deceitfull crocodile, and ſo loathe and hate thee more afterward, then euer he loued thee before.

Againe, is he beggerly, hath he no money nor meanes? why then let him packe and walke along, no penny, no Pater noster: for hee is as one dead, among the liuing; though indeede properly this peremptorie ſentence ought not to be ſo applied; but rather to Vertue, and littrature, without which the bodie is dead, although it liue.

this opiniō of it ſelfe, that looke whatſoeuer it ſpeaketh is authenticall, and droppeth frō the mouth like the Oracles of Appollo. There is nothing therefore ſo holy, ſo pure, ſo honeſt, ſo chaſte, but money will corrupt, violate, and batter downe: ſo that theſe emptie bottles, apiſh geſtures, and anticke faces, if wealthy, rich, & well monied, all groſſe imperfections are ouerſhadowed. So that whē men are ſotted in the alluremēts of this life, & dedicate their whole labours to ſo wicked a ſaint, they ſoone looſe the vſe of their goods, & become partially affected: if paſſion rule, & not reaſon, all goes to wracke; for if either prodigallitie rule the purſe, whereby the mind is ſtrongly carried into temporarie ioy, or ſo gripple and couetous as to doo nothing but ſcrape in the dunghill of this world, why theſe extreames doo ſo vrge the opinion, that they headlong run at randome into all licentious and looſe liuing, in ſo much as they do not perceiue to what ende they are aduanced aboue other men, and made ſo rich among a company of beggers.
            Many there be (the more is the pittie) that although God hath abundantly multiplyed his bleſſings vpon them, that they cannot iuſtly ſay they want any worldly thing, yet bee they ſo neere to holde faſt that whichHard-hearted Chriſtians. they haue, that they doo as it were, ſingle themſelues from all common duties, and lay aſide that regarde of the publique good, which theyr conſcience and priuate abilitie doth inſtantly tye them vnto; let vs note them a little, who will ſooner ſhift and wrangle off honeſt duties then they? will they not brabble and ſophiſticate for verye ſmall payments? and will they not wreſt and winde lawes

Let this great dutie therefore be conſidered, ſeeing thou haſt ſtore, with-hold nothing that is due: is not hee a caytiffe that will ſee his mother dye for hunger, and he hath bread to relieue her if he would? why, the Common-wealth is thy mother, euery poore Chriſtian is thy brother, wilt thou ſee them famiſht before thy face and not ſuccour them, hauing inough? Thou haſt thy wealth to that end, if thou couldeſt ſee it, and vſe it aright. Neuertheleſſe, we ſee how men of good place and reckening, will hide themſelues in corners, liue priuately, onely to keepe their purſes, that theyThe Citie is extreamly poſtered with Inmates and Idle families, when ye Countrey lies waſte & vnpeopled. may be lyable to no impoſition, and crowde into Cities, Boroughs, and priuiledge places, or like nonreſidents, rowle vp and downe from one lodging to an other, to the intent that being vncertaine where to be had, their ſtates may be vnknowne, and by this meanes both ouerthrowe hoſpitalitie, defraude the Queene and Common-wealth of neceſſarie duties, and depopulate the countrey. Is it not a token of a couctous minde, that men of good poſſeſſions and faire liuings, ſhould breake vp houſe, and ſoiourne onely with one or two ſeruants, that they may hoorde vp theyr rents, when they are ſufficientlye able to keepe a good houſe themſelues? ſurely it is a ſigne of a baſe condition.
            
               
Furthermore, many wealthy Yeomen, & rich Farmers that are riſen vp to goods inough, doo tread the ſame path. For wheras erſt when they dwelt vpon their owne, they kept good houſes, and were no ſmall ſtay to the places where they liued, are eyther couetous of ſome vaine-glorious title of gentilitie, or otherwiſe ſo miſerly greedie of wealth, (for one of the two I know not which) thruſt themſelues in like maner, into Cities, Corporations, and Liberties, and yet holde theyr Farmes ſtill in their owne occupying: for they haue ſuch long armes, that they claſpe many great liuings. And alſo lying vpon the aduantage, take Farmes ouer their neighbours heads, ten yeares before their Leaſes be expired: And what do they with theſe plurified liuings? but place ſhepheards, heards, vnderlings, and ſuch thred▪bare tenants in their ſtockes, and that at ſuch vnreaſonable rents too, that the poore ſnakes that dwell vnder them are driuen to weake ſhifts, to fare hardly, liue barely, moyle and toyle the whole yeare to ſcrape vp theyr rent, not ſauing at the yeares ende for all theyr paines, ſcarce the price of an old Friſe Ierkin: for theyr Lorde knowes better then they what profit will ariſe, and how euery thing will fall out: and if hee thriue vnder him, then doth hee ſtretch and racke it to the vttermoſt, till at laſt hee bring the whole gaine into his owne bagge; and ſo by this means can hardly beare ordinarie charges, much leſſe doo workes of ſuperrerogation, being kept downe ſo cruelly by their greedie Land▪lords.
            Now theſe haue not onely theyr meanes brought in vnto them by the ſweat of poore mens browes, and ſleepe in peace and ſecuritie when others watch and labour (a great bleſſing, if rightly weighed) but will

cloſely and cunningly ſeeke to ſhift off all duties by withdrawing them into odde corners. Oh that men of ſuch abilitie ſhould haue ſuch Iron ruſtie hearts, to hide their heads, ſhut their hands, and whip deuotion from their doores! doo they not ſeeke to ſubuert and weaken the ſtate as much as they can, by with-holding that part of dutie required by the lawe of nature? but the greedineſſe of gaine cauſeth vnrelenting hearts, for one would poſſeſſe all alone.
            O how are men deceiued in their owne eſtate, that being rich, are yet euer poore, becauſe opinion is neuer ſatisfied: whereas if we onely reſpect nature, no man can be poore, Natàr a enim vt ait Philoſo. paucis minimiſ

But to bring all this to a head, though ſome bee carried with the ſtreame of pride, ſome with the flouds of deſire, ſome prodigall, ſome pinching; and though the couetous man gape for more, more, and like hell mouth, neuer ſatisfied, yet will they hide theyr plough-ſores vnder the carpet of liberalitie, as now and then to giue an almes againſt a good time (as they call it) to beate downe a hard opinion, intimating thereby to bee good free-hearted men, when all the yeare beſide, they ſcrape and clawe it from other by the exceſſiue prices of theyr badde commodities, and by pinching them with many vncharitable gripes, and yet will they hide theyr want of loue vnder Vertue and Religion: and why ſo▪ becauſe it carrieth a generall good liking of all men: for although many haue no religion at all, nor one ſparke of a vertuous man, yet for all this wil they ſeeme to loue and embrace it intirely, becauſe of the vnſpotted ſimplicitie they ſee in the

true profeſſors thereof: and that chieſly, becauſe this outward ſhewe is ſome meanes to aſſwage the heate of ſharp reprehenſions; and that vnder colour of this, they may liue in ſome good report of the common ſort: for if they ſhould not hide the malice within, with a ſhewe of holineſſe without, but permit the rebellion to ruſh forth, they would be hatefull to others, and diſquiet theyr owne peace: to hold friendſhip therfore with the world, it is expedient for them to be hypocrites and deceiuers, and therefore will they performe many Chriſtian duties, and communicate with the Saints, yea and crowde to the Church doore of true deuotion, and both pray and vſe good exerciſes in their families, frequent Sermons, yea and ride and goe ſix or ſeuen miles to heare a good Preacher: are not theſe good things,Cunning deceluers. and the very properties of a true Chriſtian▪ yes verily: but all this is but done in pollicie to mocke the world: how know you that▪ why looke into their courſe of life; if any vaine opportunitie be offred, wil theynot follow it? if the wicked call to goe, will they not run▪ will they not dice, carde, ſweare, ſwagger, and be drunke? are they not vſurers, extortioners, proud perſons, and ſo cold in charitie, that no Chriſtian dutie can heat their loue? ſo it is an caſie thing to ſee their hypocriſie, if a man but caſt his ſight vpon their conuerſation.
            And in like manner, many at the end of the yeare (as a charitable worke) will keepe open houſe, and ſet opē their gates, for al the rake-hels & looſe vagabounds in a countrey, and fill idle bellies with their fleſh-pots, when the poore, blind, lame, and ſicke, are faine to lye in the depth of miſerie, without comfort, helpe, or ſuccour: and to what ende is this great ſuperfluitie?

Thus I ſaye like Epicures they conſecrate the memorie of this bleſſed feaſt, with ſuch a ioy, as ſauours altogether of the droſſe and ſlime of the earth: and this is liberalitie forſooth, charitie, and Chriſtian loue, when it is but prodigallitie, vainglory, and hypocriſie.

ouerthrowe their ſtate by building, not being able to vſe one roome well of thoſe many they build: for if a man of reaſonable wealth fall into this humour of building gay houſes, if he did ſmall good before, is now vtterly vnable to do any at al, his new foundation hath eaten vp all his olde meanes: this is the ſimple pollicie of ſome men that loue to begger themſelues to pleaſe the eye. Againe, how prouident men are to graft their childrē into great ſtocks, that may not eaſily be ſtriken with the thunder-claps of aduerſitie, & though the ſtocke be neuer ſo rotten, infected, & blaſted with Vice, yet if rich and mightie, it is inough: and ſurely this Ethicall pollicie were highly to be aduanced, if ſo be that our continui

Is not Vertue then more honorable thenVertue more honourable then riches. riches? doth it not raiſe a man to immortalitie? & doth not riches ouerthrow his happineſſe, if not duly ouerwatcht with Temperance? and if ſo be a rich man looke narrowly into his ſtate, and caſt vp his accounts well, he ſhall finde himſelfe a very bankerout, and to owe more then he is worth: for why hath hee more plentie of baſtardly riches then other men, but that hee is a bayliffe, ſteward, & Feoffer in truſt, to diſpoſe & lay out in almes and charitable workes? Now then if hee apply them to his owne vſe, what reckning can he make, or how wil he anſwer it at the great aſſiſes, when it ſhall be obiected by the king of glory, When I was naked, you cloathed mee not: when I was hungry you fed me not? &c. Goe into euerlaſting fire, &c. And therfore theſe great rich men of the world, haue obiects before theyr eyes, and are hemde in with poore on euery ſide: heere is one crying for bread, there an other for cloathes, the ſicke to bee viſited,

the lame and infirme to be comforted, the ſtraunger to be lodged, ſo that they cannot turne their eyes no way, but they haue motions to ſtirre vp charitie, and wofull clamors ſounding into their eares of want: and yet had diuers of them rather doo any thing then relieue theyr neceſſities, to giue tenne pound for a Hawke, then ten pence to cloathe the naked. The Rauen forſakes her young ones aſſoone as they are hatcht, becauſe ſeeing them of an other hew, thinkes them of an other kind: ſo in like maner ſome rich men looke aloft, ſnuffe & fume at their poore brethren, and caſt off all deuoſion & brotherly loue, becauſe ſeeing them humbled and brought lowe in the world, iudge them vtterly vnhappie, when verily they are not only of one ſelfe-ſame iſſue & parent, but alſo more acceptable to God in their baſe eſtate, thē they in all their royaltie.
            Is it not lamentable, to ſee a number of poore winterſtarued people lye pining in miſerie, which mightCold charltie in theſe daies, among many myſers. bee relieued, if it were but with the ſurpluſage of their vaine expences, and comforted with that, which they waſtfully conſume? For do but view theſe kinde of men, and you ſhall ſee they will ſpare for no coſt to build faire houſes (as I ſaid before) though they impoueriſh themſelues for euer: galleries, bowling-allies, walkes, and whatſoeuer may bring delight; to ride with great retinew to ſhew their pompe, and maintaine their▪ quarrels, to feede idle bellies with their fleſh▪pots, that are no ſooner vp but run to vaine ſports: but if a poore man be fallen into want, or an honeſt cauſe craue ſome reliefe, a penny is as hardly gotten from them, as fire out of a flint▪ſtone, or if it doth at laſt come, it is many times more for faſhion to ſhunne reproach, then for charitie

to the cauſe. But ſome perhaps will ſay, it is my owne, and may I not do with mine owne what I will? but tis neither ſo, nor ſo: for it is not thine, thou art put in truſt to laie it out, to helpe and ſuccour thy poore needy brother. Perhaps thou wilt ſay againe, I brought him not to beggery: did I lame him? did I vnparell him? or did I vnhouſe him? wherfore then ſhould I recompence him whom I neuer wronged? Are Bees bounde to gather honey for droanes? and muſt I keepe life in rattes and myce, and ſuch vermine as are bred by the infection of a plentious yeare? Indeed they are made poore, but tis becauſe thou art rich; that thereby thou mighteſt exerciſe thy loue, for there ſhall be poore alwayes to ſet charitie a worke: yet ſome are ſo farre from loue, as they fall into barbarous cruelty, that they had rather cut their throats, then cheriſh them with beneuolence: as it is recorded of a B.

For as there is a diuine coherence between the members of the bodie, though they haue all a diſtinct and peculiar office, yet they all miniſter to the common ſocietie: ſo in like manner we being members of that bodie, whereof Chriſt is the head, ought to bend our actiuitie for the health & welfare of the ſame, and to beare ſuch a mutuall coniunction and ſimpathie, as feeling members, to open the bowels of compaſſion on ſuch as are in want: and this onely is Vertues Common▪wealth.

An other wil boaſt of that litle he doth, and be the trumpe of his owne praiſe: ſaying, I giue thus much weekly to the poore, and do this and that good: but he is to examine himſelfe if it be according to his wealth and place or no, for otherwiſe an other man doth as much that is farre behind in ſubſtance, and with whom hee would bragge without meaſure, in comparatiue termes: but ſome thinke if they do a little good, though it be nothing in liew of their ſtate, or if they doo not a great deale of hurt by pilling, powling, ſtrife, factions, and ſuch like troubles, they haue done ſo much good, that God is bound to paie them ſomewhat back again.

            But the hauen I intend to harbourin, is to ſpeake ſomewhat of thoſe vaine, idle, wanton Pamphlets and laſciuious loue-bookes, which as fire-brands, inflame the concupiſcence of youth: for in my opinion nothing doth more corrupt and wither greene and tender wits, then ſuch vnſauoury and vituperable bookes, as hurtful to youth, as-Machauile to age, a plaugh dangerous, and as common as dangerous.
            The lazie Monkes, & fat-headed Friers, in whom was nought but ſloath & idlenes, bred this contagion; for lining in pleaſure & eaſe, and not interrupted with cares, they had time inough to vomit out their doltiſh & rediculousVaine bookes the ſpoile of many young wits. fables, & this was the ſubtiltie of Satā thē, to occupie Chriſtian wits in Heathens foolery▪ but now this age is more finer, mens wits are clarified, the dulneſſe of that time is thruſt out, an other method is brought in, fine phraſes, Inkchorn-termes, ſwelling words, bumbaſted out with the flocks of ſundry languages, with much polliſhed and new-made eloquence▪ with theſe daintie cates they furniſh and ſet out their filthy and vicious bookes; now what do they, but tye youth in

               nchaſte arguments? the very nurſes of abuſe, by which the minde is drawne to many peſtilent wiſhes. For when as young folkes haue licked in the ſweete iuice of theſe ſtinking bookes, their conuerſation and manners are ſo tainted and ſpotted with Vice, that they can neuer be ſo cleane waſhed, but ſome filthy dregges will remaine behinde. I may liken them to fawning curres, that neuer barke till they bite: or a gaye painted coffer, full of toades and venemous beaſts: So in like manner many of theſe bookes haue glorious outſides, and goodly titles: as if when a man tooke them in hand, he were about to read ſome angelicall diſcourſe: but within, full of ſtrong venome, tempered with ſweete honey: now while the minde is occupied in reading ſuch toyes, the common enemie of man is not idle, but doth ſecretly inſnare the ſoule in ſecuritie. And ſome of good partes, andGood wits vaine writers. beautified with no common gifts, both of art and nature, not being ledde by the ſun-ſhine of Vertue, infect the puritie of wit with prophane inuention, in ſome looſe ſubiect; as patrons of Vice, and nurſes of impietie, and ſpend the bleſſedneſſe of time in vnneceſſary babling.
            Other baſe and ſeruile wits runne raſhly into any ſinfull argument, and crowde to the preaſe with might and maine, not ſo much regarding the generall hurt, as ſome ſixe▪penny allowance: nay, euery triuiall mate and caſhired Clarke, will bewray his folly in print, and

with a tumultuous confuſion of words, lay out a deale of amorous prattle, though he be as tedious to his reader, as a muddie way to a wearie traueller. Now what is to be found in theſe bookes? but filthineſſe and groſſe ignorance; as for learning, there is none to be found in them, which neuer came neare the ſhadow of learning themſelues, and as little wit, but a fewe fine words of luſt, which are chiefly ment to bend the minde to wantonneſſe: yet are they led with this vaine ſuppoſitiō, that if they haue bin luld a ſleepe but one night on the Muſes lap, are able to publiſh any thing with well deſerued commendations: and I muſt needs ſay, that I my ſelfe haue read in them, and taken great delight in their fooliſh lyes; but ſurely I could neuer find either goodnes or wit, vnles Vice be Vertue, or to tel a bawdie tale be wit.
            Neuertheles, I would not haue any man think, that I inueigh againſt, or diſcommend Poetrie; for in al ages it hath bin thought neceſſarie: but only againſt thoſe abuſers of Poeſie, who vnder the name & title of Poets, foiſtModeſt Poetrie cōmendable. in their wanton & laſciuious verſes. The true vſe of Poetrie ſtandeth in two parts; the one in teaching the way to Vertue; the other to moue with delight therevnto: for honeſt delight ſtirreth vp men to take that goodneſſe in hand, which otherwiſe would bee loathſome & vnpleaſant: ſo that when it is bent to a good end, and euery thing laide out in his due annalligie, with ſome ioy the affections are thereby inuoked to a ſerious conſideration, to imitate that goodneſſe wherevnto it is moued. Thoſe bookes that both delight and perſwade with learned diſcretion, & out of which ſome wholſome document may be extracted, though it be ſimple, yet is it praiſeable. Diſdaine not (ſaith the wiſe Heathen) the

ſimple labour of an other, though thou beeſt neuer ſo great; eſpecially if he ſpeake good words. Againe, conſidering the diuerſitie of mens minds, and how diuerſly they are diſpoſed, all honeſt delight is not to be diſproued, becauſe euery man may finde both pleaſure & profit: for as I ſay, by a pleaſant diſcourſe the minde is more chearefully carried, both to read & meditate, to muſe and ſtudie, & the memory more willing to holde that it hath conceiued: So that Poetrie is no other thing, but a liuely preſentatiō of things ingeniouſly diſpoſed, wherby Vertue is painted out with ſuch freſh colours, that the mind is inflamed with her excellent properties.
            Now whoſoeuer ſhall diſcent from this true vſe, is no Poet, but a vaine babler: for what are all theſe ſcurrillous tales, & bawdie verſes? do theſe moue to Vertue with honeſt delight? nay doo they not rather ſtirre vp bawdrie and beaſtlineſſe? for are they not full of Paganiſme and ribald ſpeeches, to ſtirre vp the mind to ſhady idleneſſe? is this Poetrie? verily they are as vnworthy the name of Poets, as Chirrillus, who had nothing to grace his verſes by, but onely the name of Allex.
            
            But if a man ſuperficially & ſlitely glideth ouer theſe pye-bald Pamphlets, they are like a pleaſing dream, that mockes the mind with ſilken thoughts: but if ſeene into with a ſober iudgement, hee ſhall finde in that faire beaten path, many Adders & Snakes lye in waite to byte him by the heele.
            
               A Legend of lyes. For if a view be had of theſe editions, the Court of Venus, the Pallace of Pleaſure, Guy of Warwicke, Libbius and Arthur, Beuis of Hampton, the wiſe men of Goatam, Scoggins Ieaſts, Fortunatus, and thoſe new delights that haue ſucceeded theſe, and are now extant, too tedious

to recken vp: what may we thinke? but that the floudgates of all impietie are drawne vp, to bring a vniuerſall deluge ouer all holy and godly conuerſation: for there can be no greater meanes to affright the mind from honeſtie, then theſe pedling bookes, which haue filled ſuch great volumes, and blotted ſo much paper, theyr ſweete ſongs and wanton tales do rauiſh and ſet on fire the young vntempered affections, to practiſe that whereof they doo intreate: who by reaſon of theyr infancie and imbicillitie of wit, are ſoone ſeduced, and with wine-puft eloquence, doo ſo artificially lim out the life of vanitie, as they eaſily take the impreſſion of that which is portrayed out vnto them: and on this rocke ſtands the enſigne of their glory, if ſmoothly and pithily they can trick vp a tale of ſome beaſtly prapus, of lawleſſe luſt, and rip vp the genealogie of the Heathen gods, to carrie the minde into wonderment: ô how they will diue into the bottome of their braine! for fluant termes, and imboſſed words, to varniſh theyr lyes and fables to make them glib, and as we vſe to ſay, to goe downe without chewing, which as poyſon doth by litle and litle, diſperſe it ſelfe into euery part of the body.
            From hence riſeth ſo much fooliſh idle prattle, the Seruing-man, the Image of ſloath, the bagge-pipe of vanitie, like a windie Inſtrument, ſoundeth nothing but prophaneneſſe, and ſome are ſo charmed, as they ſpend their whole life in vaine reading, becauſe they ſee in thē as in a glaſſe, their owne conditions: now ſuch vaine fragments as fit their humors, they ſucke in, and

more breed Vice, then twentie godly treatiſes can induce to Vertue: nor twentie Sermons preached by the beſt Diuine in Englād, doth not ſo much good to moue to true doctrine, as one of theſe bookes do harme to intice to ill liuing: they corrupt good learning, & ſubuert all ſanctimony, and by a tedious pratling ouer-ſway the memory from that good purpoſe whervnto it ought to be imployed, not informing the iudgement in matters worthy to be learned.
            From whence then creepeth in this peſtilence, but out of theſe vaine bookes; for euery miſchiefe by litle & litle crawleth vpon the good manners of men, which vnder ſome ſhewe of goodnes is ſuddenly receiued, which by a voluntary admittance at the firſt becōmeth habituall, eſpecially when the ſpirituall faculties are defiled with much conuerſatiō: in ſo much that many that hold places in ſacred aſſemblies, become affected to their phraſes, Metaphors, Allegories, and ſuch figuratiue and ſuparlatiue termes, and ſo much vaine eloquence, as they yeeld no fruite at all to their auditors, but driue them into amazement with a multitude of Inkehorne-termes ſcummed from the Latin, and defuſed phraſes, as they flye aboue the commō reach, when the moſt profitable and beſt affected ſpeech is that that is moſt congruable and fitly applied to the intendment & vnderſtanding of the hearers by familiar and ordinarie termes, not ſophiſticall, darke, and obſcure, nor too baſe and barbarous: but ſuch as are animated by their preſent abillitie to ſpeake more then other men, and be addicted to affectation, haue commonly a dearth of iudgement, ſildome edifie, but gallop ouer prophane writers to ſhewe theyr vaine reading.

            To returne, doo not theſe idle pernicious bookes poyſon the well diſpoſed manners of youth, and macerate and kill the ſeedes of Vertue that begin to bloome? for doo they not vſe more vaine eloquence then confidence in matters of wiſedome? So that all that which they do, is but to make a mutinie.

            And if Plato, ſawe ſo great cauſe to ſhut them out of his common-wealth, as noyſome to the peace and tranquillitie thereof, what ought our Platoniſts to do? ſith they more abound heere then euer they did there: or if we had but the zealous affections of the Epheſians, we would loathe the price of ſo great iniquitie, and ſacrifice them at a ſtake, though they were of neuer ſo great value. But happily it will be demaunded how Ladies, Gentlewomen, &c. ſhould ſpend the time, and buſie their heads, as though idleneſſe were not a vice badde inough of it ſelf, without fire to be added, and as though there were not a Bible, and many good bookes wherein they might be vertuouſly exerciſed.

Neither can I ſee but that they drawe our language from the auncient tenor, by mixing it with ſo many ſtraunge countries, that it ſeemeth rather more artificiall, then naturall: and more baſer then the common lawe, which is compounded of French, Engliſh and Latin, &c.

            But if we oppoſe our quotidian Enterludes to them of former time, and conſider the multitude of ours, with the paucitie and fewneſſe of theirs, wee ſhall ſee a great diuerſitie as well in the method of writing, as in the time, place, and company: for now nothing is made ſo vulgar and common, as beaſtly and palpable folly: luſt, vnder colour of loue, abſtract rules artificially compoſed, to carrie the minde into ſinfull thoughts, with vncleane locution, and vnchaſte behauiour, as groping, colling, kiſſing, amorous prattle, and ſignes of Venerie, whereby the maidenly diſpoſition is polluted with luſt, and moued to impietie.

               Playes in the night, very hurtfull. But eſpecially theſe nocturnall and night Playes, at vnſeaſonable and vndue times, more greater euils muſt neceſſarily proceed of them, beeauſe they do not onely hide and couer the thiefe, but alſo entice ſeruants out of their maiſters houſes, wherby opportunitie is offered to looſe fellowes, to effect many wicked ſtratagems. In a word (as they are now vſed) they corrupt good manners, and ſet abroach the veſſell of all vncleaneneſſe; the eare is tickled with immodeſt ſpeeches, the minde imprinted with wanton geſture, and the whole affections rauiſhed with ſinful pleaſure: in ſo much as many leaue their honeſt callings, liue idlely, and gadde to thoſe places where the diuel diſplayeth his banner, liuing ſo long vpon the ſpoile of other men, till at laſt they are eaten vp by Tyborne. Nay many poore pincht, needie creatures, that liue of almes, and that haue ſcarce neither cloath to their backe, nor foode for the belley, yet will make hard ſhift but they will ſee a Play, let wife & children begge, languiſh in penurie, and all they can rappe and rend, is little in ough to lay vpon ſuch vanitie. Neuertheleſſe ſome will obiect they are neceſſarie, and fit to be allowed in pollicie: and why ſo? becauſe they are meanes to occupie idle people, and keepe the worſer ſort from worſer exerciſes: for if Playes were not

This proueth them as lawfull in London, as the common Stewes in Rome, or Venis: for is this a ſencible reaſon, that of neceſſitie one ſinne cannot be pulled downe, but an other as bad or worſe, muſt be erected in ſtead of it? it is no ſound argument, to diſpence with one to eſchew the other, and ſo by ſhunning Carribdis, fall vpon Scilla: but how ſhall we ſpend the time? as though there were no exerciſe to be vſed, but that that leadeth to miſchiefe. Time flyeth away apace, and therfore we are commanded to redeeme the time, ſeeing we haue but too much, when we wilfully looſe and abuſe it. Idleneſſe is a ſinne great inough of it ſelfe, though it haue no nouriſhment by ſinfull games and ſports: but doubtleſſe if the cauſe were remoued, the effect would ſoone ceaſe, and the time bee ſpent in more honeſt endeuours, and by litle and litle (the lawe obſerued) the men would be wained from ſuch intollerable abuſes.
            Others will belch out this blaſphemie, that a man may edifie as much at ſome Play, as at a Sermon: this I eaſily graunt, if ſo be when he goeth to Church, he leaueth his heart at home; or at leaſt it is ſo

Beſide, the affections are not alike: for at a Play the whole facultie of the minde is altogether bent on delight, the eye earneſtly fixed vpon the obiect, euery ſence buſied for

the time, the eare narrowly waiteth to catch that that is vttered, ſending it to wit: wit to reaſon: reaſon to memorie, which locketh it vp in a clozet, leaſt it ſlip out againe: the diuell in the meane time like a quiet fellow, doth not trouble the affections with ſtrange deluſions; and why ſo? becauſe they are occupied in his worke. Furthermore, a man is not wearied be it neuer ſo tedious, becauſe they doo not onely (as I ſay) feed the eare with ſweete words, equally ballanced, the eye with variable delight, but alſo with great allacritie doth ſwiftly runne ouer in two houres ſpace, the dooings of many yeares, galloping from one countrey to an other, whereby the minde is drawne into expectation of the ſequell, and carried from one thing to an other with changeable motions, that although hee were vnacquainted with the matter before, yet the cunning Art hee ſeeth in the conueyance, maketh him patiently attend the Cataſtrophae: when as at a Lecture and holy exerciſe, all the ſences are mortified and poſſeſt with drowſineſſe: ſo that by this then we may ſee our corrupt nature, and the ſore that runneth ouer the whole body; for the minde is nothing ſo tentible at a good inſtruction, nor the eare ſo audible, as at a vaine and ſportiue foolerie: ô how dull is the affections to the one, and how prompt to the other! how the tongue will itterate and repeate the one with great ioye, and ſmoulder vp the other in drowſie melancholye.

            To conclude, it were further to be wiſhed, that thoſe admired wittes of this age, Tragaedians, and Comaedians, that garniſh Theaters with their inuentions, would ſpend their wittes in more profitable ſtudies, and leaue off to maintaine thoſe Anticks, and Puppets, that ſpeake out of their mouthes: for it is pittie ſuch noble giftes, ſhould be ſo baſely imployed, as to proſtitute their ingenious labours to inrich ſuch buckorome gentlemen. And much better it were indeed they had nor wit, nor learning at all, then to ſpend it in ſuch vanitie, to the diſhonour of God, and corrupting the Common-wealth: but he that dependeth on ſuch weake ſtaies, ſhall be ſure of ſhame and beggerie in the ende: for it hath ſildome beneſeene, that any of that profeſſion haue proſpered, or come to an aſſured eſtate.
            Haſt thou wit, learning, and a vaine to write wickedneſſe? adde wiſedome to thy wit, and couet to write goodneſſe: ſo ſhalt thou in ſtead of curſing, be bleſſed, and immortally praiſed of the good and honeſt. The floud of wittie fooliſhnes, hath a long time ouerflowne the bankes of modeſtie, the world is full of idle bookes, and friuolous toyes, neuer in any age was the like: turne thy pen, write not with a gooſe quill any longer, clenſe thy wit of groſſe folly, and publiſh things profitable and neceſſary, new, and good, to the building vp of Vertue and godlineſſe.
            Againe, is the minde and body wearied with vnreaſonable care and labour? reſt, eaſe, and inoffenſiue paſtimes,

                In the ſweat of thy browes ſhalt thou eate thy bread. What whoredomes, drunkenneſſe, ſwearing, and abhominable Sodomie is daily practiſed? doth it not inuite and call vpon Magiſtrates to draw the ſword of reformation? do they not crie for vengeance to heauen? ſurely there was neuer more filthineſſe committed then now, the word contemned, Preachers deſpiſed, and a direct oppoſition againſt all honeſtie, that were it not for ſome fewe that ſtand in the gap, fire and brimſtone would fall from heauen & conſume the wicked like Sodome and Gomorrah. For doubtleſſe the ſins of Sodome, are as rife here as euer they were there, pride, gluttony, cutthroat-enuy, ſelf-loue, vnmerciſulneſſe to the poore, and ſuch like, and thoſe not priuate: but vnuerſall in all places, and amongſt moſt men.
            
               Ideneſſe the roote of all cuill. The next enemy to Vertue is Idleneſſe, a burthen of impediment, a vice ſo deeply rooted in ſome, that it caſteth them headlong into infernall bondage: the toade out of which iſſueth nought but drunkenneſſe, whoredomes, pride, ignorance, errour, blindneſſe, beggerie, and a thouſand moe miſeries. Time is like ſo many lighted lampes, that with care & diligence ought to be kept with oyle: which with dampiſh idleneſſe are ſoone put out, and by negligence let fall: for mans life of it ſelfe is

not ſo ſhort by nature, but it is more ſhortned by ſinne, and the length of time haſtened on by iniquitie. The ſoule is of too fine a mettall and ſo pure a temper as to loue to do nothing, but wil be imployed in labour; yet becauſe ſhe is impriſoned in the walles of fleſh, followeth her ſluggiſh inclination: the body by too much eaſe is like a pampered Iade vnſeruiceable, and her dexteritie and faculties being made blunt and dull with ſloth, becommeth wholy vnfit for honeſt labour: for if he remit and giue his minde to idleneſſe, ill corrupting motions creepe into the ſoule, which polluting the purer parts, do by little and little carry him to all impietie, vntill the whole man become nothing but the ſonne of Belial: by it a wide gap is opened, for adultery to enter in at, and therefore Diogenes was wont to ſay, by doing nothing we learne to do euil: and luſt (quoth he) is the trade and occupation of loyterers: and as that grandmaiſter of wantonneſſe Ouid, in his booke Deremedio amors ſaith; Oſia ſit

            Idleneſſe is a capitall plague, a ſore vexing the body with extreame torment, and loading the bones till they cracke with weakeneſſe, pouertie, impotencie, and in the ende leaueth olde age naked and vnprouided for. In a word, nothing is more vnſeemely in a Chriſtian, nor more contrarie to the lawe of God, which commaundeth euery one to get his liuing with the ſweate of his browes, preiudiciall to humane ſocietie, and iniurious to nature: and therefore Themistocles tearmeth idleneſſe the graue and tombe of ſuch men as

               An idle man is a dead carkaſſe. are aliue, for that there is no difference betweene an idle man, and one that is dead, for that neither one nor the other doth any good.
            Euery one is commaunded to be induſtrious in that calling wherein hee is ſet, and earneſtly ſeeke to applie himſelfe therevnto, for he that worketh not, is not worthie to eate: but hee that followeth his trade with diligence be it neuer ſo baſe or mechanicall, is alwayes ſure of competencie and ſaturitie, when as the luskiſh and idle notwithſtanding their great aboundance, are in ſhort time conſumed and come to nothing, as the wiſe

            This kinde of life was ſo much hated among the Aethenians, that who ſo was ſeene idle was ſeuerely puniſhed. And for this vſe, was there Sophroniſtes and graue Fathers, that had the ouerſight and ſurueighing of the Common-wealth, and moſt chiefly looked

to the manners of youth. Tully reports that none durſt walke the ſtreetes of Rome without bearing about him ſome ſigne of his profeſſion, leaſt hee ſhould bee impeacht of idleneſſe: and in his oration Pro Archita poeta, hee ſaith of himſelfe: What time other men ſpent in ſports, playes, bankets, dice, cardes, tennice, &c. that ſaith he, I beſtowed in poring on my booke: which is vndoubtedly true, for ſurely had he bene idle and giuen to paſtime, as many ſtudents are in theſe dayes, hee could neuer haue bene that notable and excellent ſummus Orator.

            It were a world to note the idleneſſe of many in theſe times, and what multitudes liue with doing nothing; or at leaſtwiſe in doing things vnprofitable and diſhoneſt: yea, what numbers there be both in Citie and Towne, that liue like Drones & idle Graſhoppers, as a right wiſe and honourable Counſellor reported in the Starre-chamber, that in the citie as hee verily was perſwaded, there were at leaſt a thouſand families that could giue no honeſt reckening of their life. Some like Aeſops labber, ſit beating their heeles againſt a ſtall, ſome friske from houſe to houſe, as buſie-bodies: others in curious obſeruations and fault-finding with the gate, apparell, ſpeech, and defects of other, and fat themſelues with buſie apprehenſions.

               Lamea, who as the Poets faine, had broade proſpectiue eyes to pull out and in at pleaſure, and at her going abroad, would put on and be very curious and circumſpect in peering and poring about to ſee what was amiſſe in her neighbours houſe; but at her return home, would locke them vp in a cap-caſe, and ſatte downe to ſpinning as blinde as a beetle, and neuer ſawe what was amiſſe in her owne houſe: ſo in like manner, many both ſonnes and daughters ſhe hath, that cram the forepart of the wallet with ſmall defects, when the waight of their owne behinde, is readie to pull them backeward into all contempt: and many female ſinners frequent great aſſemblies for nothing elſe but to ſpye out new faſhions, of which they make large coments at their returne, neuer reſt night nor day, till they be trickt vp with like trumperie, and if they ſpye a hole in theyr neighbours coate, a moate amiſſe, a wrinckle awry, then there is to do and to do, and turning it ouer againe and againe, as men ted hay, with wot you what neighbour, ſuch a man is too familiar with his maide, he is a bankerout, an hypocrite, a buſie-body; ſhe is a muddie queane, a filthy beaſt, a lumpe of kitchinſtuffe, and ſuch like: is not here good ware which they offer to ſell, to euery ones diſgrace? and thus they paſſe away the time in vaine and idle obſeruations, and vtterly forget to looke into their owne boſome, and prune and correct their owne deformities, which no doubt they ſhould finde labourſome inough to reforme.

Callings are diſtinguiſhed into ſundry profeſſions, according to the neceſſitie of the time, becauſe euery man may not onely haue wherein to imploy himſelfe, and to benefite others by his trauell, but alſo to haue helpe by the facultie of his neighbour: yet all come into theſe two, either in minde or in body, the Magiſtrate, Miniſter, and ſuch as holde publique and ſacred places, do labour in minde with good counſel, in gouernment and doctrine, which is the more excellent calling: others are manuell or mechanicall, which is the more weariſome & toilſome: without theſe no common-wealth can ſtand; for as it is a great pollicie in maintaining diſcipline, ſo is it not a little cheriſhed by other callings.

            We are borne to labour, as well as the birds to flye. Salomon ſendeth vs to the Emet to learne wiſedome, to conſider her induſtrie, who like a good Econimiſt,

prouides in Sommer for Winter, whereof Eſope affoordeth a pleaſant conceited fable: The Ant & the Graſſehopper (ſaith he) walking together on a ſunnie banke, the one piping and careleſly skipping, looked after nothing; the other circumſpect in prying about what prouiſion was ſcattered in the way, carefully gathered it vp and carried it to her cabbin, whom the Graſſehopper ſeeing, ſcorned this needleſſe thrift with many bitter taunts: now it fell out, that in ſhort time theſe two parted, the one to her faire ſweetes which the ſeaſon did yeeld, the other to her labour; the one reſpected the time preſent, thinking the Spring would laſt all the yeare; the other time to come, prouiding againſt the ſharpe ſtormes of froſt and ſnowe. Anon colde winter grew on, and tooke from the Graſhopper her wonted moiſture, bereft him of his piping, and with his ſhackle hammes weakely skips too and fro, and beeing pincht wth hunger, and drencht with ſhewers, went for ſuccour to the Ant, her olde acquaintance, and entreated ſome teliefe, but the litle worme demaunded what ſhe had done all the Sommer time, ſhe could not prouide for Winter? The Graſhopper anſwered with a hollow voyce, ſhe ſung to delight the paſſenger: then now you may daunce quoth ſhe, to eaſe your hunger. With this the Graſhopper yeelding to the weathers extremities, foodeleſſe, comfortleſſe, and ſuccourleſſe, died without remedie: alluding by the alligorie to ſuch idle and laizie meacocks, who ſpend the Sommer of youth in wantonneſſe, that when the winter of olde age commeth, are forced to want and feele the ſtormes of penurie, and languiſh by inferred pouertie. And therefore while time doth offer it ſelfe, and the body able to endure, it

is good to ſeeke for thoſe things that may bring ioy and comfort to olde age. Neuertheleſſe youth doth ſuppoſe that God keepeth a court of faculties for them to take vp a diſpenſation, to runne madding after euery vanitie, hauing as they thinke, ſo much time as they know not how to ſpend it: but as the Miller who hauing too much water, openeth his floud-gates and ſluces to let it paſſe: ſo they think they haue time pluſquam ſatis, more then needs, and therefore vſe meanes to ſpend it by breaking vp the floud-gates of their vaine affectiōs: and leaſt they ſhould be pent vp with too much time, let it vnprofitably runne out, and gather nothing by theyr owne labour, but ſpoile houſe, land, and whatſoeuer is left, in banqueting, dicing, hunting, hawking, and carding, which like a bauin giueth a goodly blaze for a while, but is ſoone out, and in the end glad to warme their nailes with their owne breath, and when froſtie age commeth on, the ioynts feeble, the bloud dead, the body colde, and a quiuering paulſey ouer-ſpread the limbes: oh how faine would he be thriftie, and how nearely doth his want pinch him! he is forced with the laizie Graſhopper to bewaile his ſtate, and repent the loſſe of time. Oh what goods and poſſeſſions did my friends leaue me, which are prodigally waſted? how often did they ſeeke to reclaime me with good counſell if I had bene gracious? and thoſe vices that muſtered about my young yeares, how ſoone might I haue ſuppreſt them? but then being young and fooliſh, am now olde and beggerly: to whom ſhall I communicate my griefe, that will yeeld ſuccour? all my laments are bootleſſe, relentleſſe, and pittileſſe: what a heauie reckening haue I to make, waſting ſo many idle houres in eating,

drinking, ryoting in ſports, games, and paſtimes, and all my flouriſhing youth in idleneſſe, not ſpending one houre in his ſeruice to whom all is due, & now I ſhould finde moſt comfort in that I haue got ſo neare my end, a hell of vnquiet torments lye on my conſcience readie to ſinke me downe to hell. Let youth therefore be warned, and laie holde on the winges of Time while it is to day, leaſt by ſlipping the tyde of opportunitie they fall into a ſorrowfull lamentation when it is too late.
            And therfore ſuch old men as are ſorrie their youth is gone, it is a ſure token they were neuer wiſe nor gratious, for hee is no wiſe man that repineth at the moſt profitable things, for age taketh away the delight of the fleſh, the roote of all euill: for there can be no greater plague to mans happineſſe then the will of the bodie, which by the priuiledge of youth is ſubiect to ſo many indirect courſes, deſtroying the iudgement, and putting out the eye of reaſon, no communitie with Vertue, but a liuely brotherhood with vice and vanitie: yet ſome take great glorie to crake of their youthfull acts, and tell many ſtories of their prankes in former time; I did this and this ſaith one, I thus and thus ſaith an other, I holpe the Prieſt to ſay Maſſe ſaith a third, and by bragging of their ſtinking rottennes, and reuiuing their own ſhame: Suppoſe they gaine credite for ſuch infamous practiſes, and commend themſelues to poſteritie, as men enduedThe vani

               Licurgus by his lawes forbad young men to play, or goe idlely vp and downe in the Marte or common places, or to be nurſed vp in delights and pleaſures, but in husbandry and tillage, that in their firſt yeares they might not taſte of idleneſſe.
            And Zenocrates did vſe to diuide the day into parts, reſeruing one part for ſilence, that hee might meditate how to ſpeake: not onely therefore the Realme is proſperouſly held vp by buſineſſe and labour, but a mans priuate wants ſupplied, and his domeſticke needements maintained: whereas idleneſſe ouerthroweth all: and therefore warres in a kingdome are more profitable (ſaith one) then peace, for warres ſtirreth the minde to Vertue, when peace breedeth idleneſſe.

            How lamentable is it therfore for youth to be ignorant, and defeat theyr mind of the ſtore▪houſe of knowledge, & ſo iniuriouſly wrong themſelues in the way to bliſſe? for ignorance is fearfull, an inconſtant paſſiō, baſe and contemptible, and is ſoone ſeduced, becauſe it knowes not how to vſe that well it poſſeſſeth, but is raſh and headie, taking falſehood for truth, Vice for Vertue, not being able to diſtinguiſh one from the other; and by this deceit is carried into errours, omitting all good examples and honeſt actions: for if the carriage of wiſe and graue men be not obſerued, the minde is clogged with ignorance, not onely not able to direct others in any matter of doubt, but is forced to aske counſell for himſelfe in euery trifle. But a foole (ſaith Salomon) is wiſer in his owne conceit, then ſeuen wiſe men that can render a reaſon: and drinking ſo much the water of ſelfe-loue, doth get ſuch a buzzing in his braines, that managing his buſineſſe by his owne wit, draweth vpon himſelfe ſpeedie repentance.
            O how ſoone Vice creepes vpon the affections of youth in the ſpring of their yeares, if idleneſſe ſlip in: for being intangled in the net of libertie, doth chauke out to himſelfe the way to trace in, affecting that which the multitude ſeeme to allow, be it neuer ſo contrarie to ſound iudgement: and therfore the beſt inheritance that fathers can leaue to their children, is good bringing vp, as a ſure ſtocke to liue on in oldeage: for to

put wealth into the hands of youth before hee haue wiſedome to guide it, is as if hee ſhould ſet him on a young coults backe that was neuer ſadled, needs muſt he dangerouſly fall, hauing neither wit nor ſtrength to rule him as he ought: or as if hee ſhould put his patrimonic into a ſhip, and make his ſonne Pilot, who for want of skill, needs muſt ſuffer ſhipwracke. And youth is no ſooner capable of reaſō, but by idleneſſe the mind is carried into a multitude of vices, like a ſtanding pond that gathereth nothing but ſcum and filth.
            Thoſe parents therefore that put their children to be ſeruing-men, haue ſmall care of their education, for that they doo not onely miſpend the time, but learne ſuch vices as cleaue faſt to nature, not eaſily to be ſhakenA Seruingmans life an idle life vnl

And Gentlemen incumber their houſes with many vnqualified ſeruants, which deuour and eate much, but get little, and vnder pretence of ſeruice, do nothing leſſe then ſerue without all contradiction; it is no charitie to foſter ſuch an idle ſuperfluitie of ſeruants, with that which might better be ſpent on the blinde, lame, and poore people, then on ſuch which ſerue for nothing but to beautifie a houſe and picture and ſhewe forth their perſons. Honor and worſhip reſteth not in keeping many ſeruants, or riding with a great troup, but in his owne vertue. For though wiſe men for curteſie, and fooles for ſimplicitie, do reuerence and ſalute them, yet are they no whit the more honourable, vnleſſe they be iuſt, temperate, affable, modeſt, and haue ſuch vertuous properties, & morrall conditions, as that they may be vſed in the Common-wealth, for the ſeruice of their Prince & countrey.
            
               
Many idle perſons drop out of Gentlemens houſes, who with a frowne of their maiſter, are turned out of all preferment, not able to get their owne liuely-hood, but conſtrained through want to follow bad courſes, & being out of ſeruice, fall into offence of lawe, and are many times eaten vp by Tyborne.
            And yet ſome heires of good poſſibilities, vnder colour of learning ciuilitie, humanitie, and ſome commendable qualities, are by their parents made Seruingmen, and their young wits ſo peſtered with vice, that they ſildome proue good members in the Commonwealth.
            To conclude, euery one ought to betake himſelfe to ſome honeſt and ſeemely trade, and not ſuffer his ſences to bee mortified with idleneſſe: for whom the diuell findeth in that caſe, hee ſoone poſſeſſeth, imploying him in ſome damned worke, and wicked practiſe, and for euer diſabling him to be vſed in matters of good conſequence.

            Rioting and drunkenneſſe doth both corrupt the body, and pollute the ſoule, and is ſuch an extreame madneſſe, as it transformeth a man into a beaſt, ſauing in forme and portraiture, putting out the light of vnderſtanding,

This cacoethes, or ill cuſtome, vſurpeth ſuch a priuiledge, and incroacheth ſo vpon the good maners of men, by comming in the habit of honeſtie, that they are not aſhamed to hide their filthineſſe with glorious titles, and neceſſarie colours, as a ſpurre to quicken the wit, and ſetThe benefit of d

            Neither can theſe allegations imputed to this vice, excuſe the dāgerous effects which proceed of her monſtrous deformitie. For as the Poets allude that Meduſa could turne men into marble pictures, Circes into ſwine,

ſo the exceſſiue vſe hereof altereth reaſon, vnderſtanding, and all the poores of the minde, and wrap vp many brutiſh conditions in a humane ſhape; for he that is ouerladen with ſenſualitie, looſeth the vſe of all thoſe graces and diuine faculties wherewithall a modeſt and ſober man is poſſeſt. And as thoſe properties may holde in part, that is, ſo long as moderation beareth ſway, ſo once falling into the more, it can no longer ſtand: for as one may ſharpen his knife with grinding, ſo by too much and often doing it, the edge and mettall may be quite ground away and made blunt; and therfore Anacharſis, a great wine-bibber, who was choked with a huske of a grape, did notwithſtanding preach this doctrine: The firſt draught ſaith he, cheriſheth the bloud, the next comforteth the heart, but the third inflameth the braine, fumeth into the head, and breedes drunkenneſſe.
            He ſaid moreouer, that the vine bareth three maner of grapes, the firſt of pleaſure, the ſecond of drunkenneſſe, and the third of ſorrow.
            O how farre doth intemperance make a man differ from himſelfe, and forget the finall ende of his creation, in procuring enemies againſt his owne happineſſe! O what lamentable Tragedies is by this Vice acted among wine-bibbing companions! There bee euils inough we bring with vs into the world, and we haue worke inough to holde warre with them, though we procure no more, which are alwayes a temptation to our beſt parts.
            Drunkenneſſe is no inbred nor inherent ſinne, but procured by cuſtome and bad company, it corrupteth the ſoule, ſucketh out the iuice of the body, withereth

the beautie, drieth vp the ſinewes, and like a canker corrodeth and deuoureth vp all good motions, making that body which ſhould be a holy temple, a habitacle and dwelling houſe for the diuell: for being ouerladen with wine & gluttonie, the body is ſo much brokē, that as a holy Father ſaith, it is a wonder that thoſe bodies made of earth and clay, become not myre and dyrt: it ſtirreth the mind to whoredome, for like twins they are neuer a ſunder: Sine cerere & baccho friget venus, without wine and belly-cheare luſt would be aſſwaged, incapable of conceit: for you ſhall neuer ſee a drunkard ſo wel aduiſed to aske counſell, or with patience marke good documents, but either fleere and laugh it out, or be furious and quarelſome: and therefore Father Cate was wont to ſay, it was loſt labour to talke of Vertue to the belly, for that it hath no eares to heare, becauſe their looſe life maketh religion loathſome to their cares. This wine-waſhing licour giueth ſuch ſcope and libertie to the tongue, as it rowleth vp and downe reſtleſſe, annoying the whole world with vnneceſſarie prattle, running into all degrees, cenſuring all men, and laying out that openly, which modeſtie would conceale, powring it into the boſome of his pot-mate: for the tongue of a drunken man, is the clozet of his heart; and that which a ſober man thinketh, a drunkard ſpeaketh. And as by a noiſe of crowes, one may gheſſe where carrion is, ſo a flocke of drunkards may be found by their words, being ſo inflamed with the fume and ſtrength of the lycour, as it is impoſſible to keepe ſilence. Therefore as Cicero ſaith, there need no racking to procure confeſſion of the truth, for it may with more eaſe be gotten by drunkenneſſe.
            
               
And as Homer ſaith, wine diſtracteth the wits of a wiſe man withvoluntary madneſſe, and his grauitie is vtterly quenched with indiſcretion. A drunken man is ſo prolixious and talkatiue, as he moleſteth all his hearers: if he be in company with a ſober man, he wearieth him with talke: if he come to the ſicke, he grieueth him more then his ſickneſſe: if in a ſhip among paſſengers, he annoyeth them more then the waues of the ſea: ſo that wherſoeuer he commeth, he is troublous and irkeſome.

Some like ſwine, wallow in their owne filth, and forced to diſgorge and caſt vp the ſuperfluitie and exceſſe, which calleth for vengeance from heauen, for ſo monſtrouſly abuſing the good creatures of God.
            And though a drunkard recouer himſelfe againe, yet the effect doth ſtill remaine, leauing ſuch a ſlyme behinde, as defileth both body and ſoule: yet not a fewe are rocked a ſleepe in this brutiſh deſire: but ô

beaſtly and ſinful deſire, to circumſcribe a mans chiefeſt good within the compaſſe of his belly, and deſtroy all thoſe good parts that inhabit about the ſoule, and ſuffer the baſeſt part of the body to ouercome the fiue wits. What a madneſſe is this, cuſtome getting victorie by little and little, preuaileth ſo much with ſome, that they become remedileſſe, and haue not only the mappe of drunkenneſſe drawne on their viſage by continuall vſe, but the whole man polluted with the eſſentiall properties thereof. Oh how odious is this vice to God and good men? and how dooth it putrifie and contaminate body and ſoule, and yet how plentifully doth it raigne in moſt places without ſuppreſſion? for now all good fellowſhip is in drinking, and hee is a flincher that will not take his licour, and be drunke for companie.

            Is it not lamentable that a poore man who hath nothing to keepe his charge but his ſore labour, ſpendeth all hee can rap and rend in drunkenneſſe and ryoting, and his wife & children want that which he leaudly waſteth, and where is the cauſe but in ſuch baſe minded people, that for greedineſſe of filthy lucre doo ſuffer them to drinke out theyr eyes, and ſweare

out their hearts ſo they may gaine: but let them be aſſured that hell mouth gapes to ſwallow vp ſuch greedie accurſed monſters, vnleſſe they turne with ſpeedie repentance.
            It is now growne an exerciſe and a game of actiuitie, to ſwill and quaffe much, and he that drinketh moſt winneth the prize, whereof hee is as proud, as if he had carried an oxe with Milo at the Olympian games. And by your leaue, drunkenneſſe is too groſſe a terme, and deſerueth the ſtabbe. For although all thoſe fine termes and prittie Epithites, which are giuen to that ſinne, import as much, yet (forſoothe) it muſt be couered with many ſportiue denominations; otherwiſe you ſhall incurre no ſmall diſpleaſure, and bring your ſelfe into a drunken danger. But let them blinde it ſo long as they can with neuer ſo many faire attributes, yet ſobrietie and reaſon will vnmaske and lay them open, to their vtter obliquie: and though they frame this naked excuſe, which they alledge as a poore ſhift to ſaue theyr credit, that they are not drunke ſo long as they knowe what they doo, can goe, ſtand, hold their firſt man, and keepe a iuſt reckening of their pottes. But he that drinketh more then will content the want of nature, and falleth into the exceſſe, though his braine be ſo well ſetled as he is not by and by bereft of reaſon, yet he deſerueth no other epithite then a bowſie beaſtly drunkard.
            And when by coaction one ſhall be vrged either being not a thirſt, or his appetite not mouing, the one offendeth in offering, the other in taking: and hence it is ſo great ſtrife and quarelling ariſeth, and ſo many frayes and field-meetings growe.

And being thus ſurfetted liue diſconſolate, and haſten their owne deſtruction by caſting themſelues headlong into the bottome of endleſſe wretchedneſſe.

               Noah was mocked of his ſonnes. Holofernes had his head cut off by a poore woman: for it is an eaſie thing for the diuel to accompliſh his will, if the mind be bent to ſurfetting. For this is that poyſoned fountaine out of which floweth ſo many maladies, greeuous & long diſcaſes, impoſtumations, inflamations, obſtructions, ventoſities, and what not, whereby the mildneſſe of nature is diſturbed.

            But theſe ſtraunge euents happen not ſimply in reſpect of the wine it ſelfe, being in it owne nature good, (for if it be moderately taken it comforteth the bodie, and cheriſheth the minde, ſtrengtheneth the ſinewes, and helpeth the eyes: and that was the cauſe Saint Paul counſelled Tymothie to drinke a little Wine) but only and altogether in the intemperate and immeaſurable vſage.
            So is it likewiſe in meates, when one doth gurmandize and feede vpon diuerſitie and diſguiſed diſhes of manifolde operations. Many accidences ariſe and diſeaſes growe, and this is by reaſon of the contrarietie and different natures of thoſe meates, and in the ſuperfluitie and aboundance as the prouerbe ſaith, much meate much maladie: whereas in ſimple and vniforme kindes, delight neuer exceedes the appetite: and

he that feedeth but of one diſh, liueth longer, and is more healthfull then thoſe accidentall dieters & queaſie ſtomackes that glutte themſelues with eueric kinde artificially compounded, ſometime of eaſie digeſtion, then of harde digeſtion, that many times before one can be concocted, the other putrifieth in the ſtomacke, and this is verie familiar in common knowledge, that the ploughman that liues by curdes, bread and cheeſe, and ſuch homely fare, workes harde all the day, and lyeth vneaſie at night, is more ſounder, healthfuller, and more free of malladies then thoſe fine, nice, and curious dyeters.
            Now when the bodie is thus miſdieted by ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe, it is not only ſubiect to diſeaſes, and afflicted with torments and incurable laments, whereby it becommeth vnweildie & vnfit for any vertuous exerciſe, but alſo draweth the horror and iudgements of God vppon both bodie and ſoule. How ought men therefore to liue ſoberly and chaſtely, and ſtoppe the abuſe of ſuch abhominable Epicuriſme: and as wiſe Cato ſaieth, Eate to liue, and not liue to eate, like the Epicure, that putteth all his felicitie in Bacchus his belly-cheare.
            By this the quicke conceit of the ſpirit is dulled and made impregnable, the glorious ſun-ſhine of Vertue eclipſed, and all good motions quite extinguiſhed, that a man cannot be ſaide to be a man, but the trunke or ca

As Alexander, who in his drunken neſſe would ſley his deareſt friends, and being ſober, w ould be readie to kill himſelfe for anger: and all thoſe noble vertues and princely qualities wherewith he was endued, were all defaced by the intollerable delight he had in drinking. The famous Citie Perſepolis in a drunken humour was burned to aſhes, which was no ſooner deuiſed by Thayis the harlot, but was executed with great celeritie: but recouering his wits, repented his folly: for with this ſpirit is a drunken man alwaies poſſeſt to attempt things raſhly, to deſpiſe good counſel, to vndertake great exployts, but neuer with mature deliberatiō, vnruly, diſobedient, and violating the lawes both of God and man: and laſtly, with the fooliſh Troians, (ſero ſapiunt phriges) be wiſe when it is too late. If this Hidra infuſe her venome into the tendernes of youth, and not cruſhed downe when it begins to peepe, by killing the ſerpent in the egge, but ſuffered to growe ripe, ô how it diſtilleth into the ſoule, and pulles downe the whole frame of Vertue, whereby he is caſt downe headlong from a high promentarie, into a deepe vgly dungeon: it weakeneth the nature, and maketh them fooles and meacockes, not fit for any imployment.

               Sampſon could ſlaie the Philiſtines with a iaw-bone, and yet was made a ſlaue to Dalilath.
            
            In like manner the Poets aſcribe to Hercules many incredulous labors, as in killing the ſnake of Learna, maiſtering the wilde bull of Aramanthus, clenſing Domedes ſtables, killing the Centaures, and ſuch toilſome works,Ouid Metam. that his taske-miſtreſſe Iuno was faine to crie out, Defeſſa ſum iubendo, and yet for all this was conquered by luſt, and made ſpinne on a rocke by Omphila, with womens garments.
            So that by this we may ſee, that it is more difficill to quench the raging luſt of concupiſcence, and chaſe away the corruption of nature, then to do theſe wonderfull labours. Which thing Cicero in his Oration Pro Marcello dooth well remember, ſpeaking to

the Emperour: O Caeſar (ſaith hee) thou haſt ſubdued kingdomes, ſubiected nations, tamed the Barbarians, and brought them vnder the Romaine yoake, and by thy matchleſſe and heroicall ſpirit, haſt made the Capitoll ring of thy glorious triumphes: yet notwithſtanding, to beate downe ambition, to bridle furie, to temper iuſtice with mercie, to be humble in maieſtie, and conquer the vnruly paſſion of the minde, hee that can do this, Non ego eum cum ſummis viris comparo, ſed ſimillimum deo iudico. I do not onely compare him with the beſt men, but I thinke him rather a God.
            By this it is manifeſt, that this Annarchie, this rebellion that is in nature, cannot ſo eaſily bee bridled and kept from ruſhing into diſorder, but by execution of lawes: and to this ende is the Magiſtrate ſet vp, and the ſword of Iuſtice held out, to tame the vnrulineſſe of nature.
            Now therefore the whole felicitie of man ſtandeth in temperance, and in quelling thoſe boyling luſts that ſet themſelues againſt the nobleneſſe of Vertue.
            
            
               Epictetus giueth two rules, to beare, and forbeare; by the firſt, patiently to beare aduerſitie, and the bitterneſſe of Fortune: by the ſecond to flye concupiſcence, and abſtaine from the will of the fleſh; and theſe are the two pathes leading to Vertue. To conclude, there is no true ioy without Vertue, this is perfect honour & true nobilitie: ſhe offereth herſelf freely to euery man, ſhe denieth none, but is open and ready to all that will ſeeke her, and doth neither require houſe, land, orworldly wealth, but is content with a poore naked man: and therefore ſeeing that all is vaine without her, it is a ſhame

to deſire glory by riches or birth, and not rather deſerue it by his owne vertue. For he that is therewith poſſeſt, is famous in earth, glorious in the graue, and immortall in heauen, according to the Poet:

               To fatall chaunge are ſubiect ſure,
               and vnto greiſly death:
               But Vertue onely with the gods remaines
               immortall aye,
               Where her religious followers
               do liue in happie ſtaye.
            
            By Vertue the famous Camilli, Fabij, & Scipiones, are mounted vp aboue all earthly weakneſſe, & a memorie of their noble vertues cōmēded to poſteritie. For there is nothing in this world of ſo great price, and which cauſeth more to augment, then the trade of good manners. For by this meanes, not onely fathers of families haue taken a domeſticke forme of regiment in theyr houſes, by good order keeping, but alſo Kingdomes, Common-wealthes, and publique affaires, doo hereby flouriſh, and are happily maintained. And for this cauſe I haue willingly aduentured to moue and ſtirre the mind therevnto, and that with a zealous affection. And although I haue taken vpon mee a thing very vnfit for

my rude and ſmall vnderſtanding, yet I doubt not but the honeſt and vertuous will gratifie and approuc this my ſimple endeuour: eſpecially becauſe they more eſteeme the preciouſneſſe of Vertue, then the pompious glorie of Vice: wherein they obſerue the counſell of the wiſe Heathen, who wiſheth that no man ſhould deſpiſe the ſimple labor of an other man, eſpecially if he ſpeake good words, and giue no offence to the weake. And this was Platoes diuine inſtitution amongſt many other ſoueraigne decrees, that it is needfull in euery Common-wealth to preſcribe and giue order that it be not permitted to any man to publiſh any thing hee hath compoſed, except it be firſt peruſed and allowed by indifferent Iudges therevnto aſſigned. If this iniunction were duly obſerued, ſo many leaud bookes, vaine pamphlets, and ſcurrillous ditties would not ſo eaſily paſſe, neither would idle wits bend themſelues to write. For now through the abundance of naughtie bookes, wee are greatly endamaged, for by learning the ſound doctrine of good men, the baſeſt and blindeſt manner of writers is moſt-what approued. From this ſpring or fountaine is riſen this mortall and monſtrous infection before noted.
            Neither is this all, for there is a naturall rebellion, which like a ſore runneth ouer the whole body: ſo that if the ground of the heart be not fallowed and ploughed vp, and good ſeede ſowne therein, the happineſſe and felicitie of man is choked hith weedes, and poyſoned with Hemplocke, iniquitie hath gotton the vpper hand ſo farre, that if we looke into the monſtrouſneſſe of ſinne in this age, we may ſee euery abhomination ſport it ſelfe, as though there were no God.

               iſie, deceit and couſonage, a common practiſe. In a word, there be too many whores, too many knaues, too many brothel▪houſes, too little labour, too much idleneſſe, too many Ale▪houſes, too litle loue, too much hate, too little deuotion, and too much hard-hearted Chriſtianitie. But I ſpeake not this to derogate ought from the diligence of any. Neuertheleſſe, it were to be wiſhed, that more care were had to execute Iuſtice on ſuch grieuous malefactors. If I haue done well to note what is amiſſe, thou ſhalt doo much better to mend the abuſe.
            
               Or if it be ill and of little worth,
               If thou canſt do better, I pray ſet it forth.
            
            Finally, the conſideration of theſe abuſes before named, ought to ſtirre vp both ſuperiour magiſtrates, and inſeriour officers, to aduance Vertue, and reforme Vice: becauſe as the one begetteth moſt heauenly things in this earthly world: ſo is the other the ouerthrowe of all happineſſe, both here and in the life to come. The Miniſter of the word therefore is not exempt from this labour, for as he is the Phiſition of the ſoule, ſo is hee to watch ouer the ſicke patient; not ſo much to attendere famae & corpori, as to negligere ſalutem ecclcſie, to be olde in yeares, and young in knowledge: to couet to be rich in purſe, and poore in charitie: to purchaſe pleaſures, build great houſes, and ſhewe no fruites by the ſequell and euent that they worthily enioy their dignities: as many do in this age that ſtand in a ſpiritual place, are notwithſtanding meere temporall men, and ſo rooted in the

ſleſh, as they yeeld no fruites at all of the ſpirit: but they ought for care, conſcience, and in a godly zeale, holding ſacred places, to labour earneſtly and officiouſly, to ſuppreſſe thoſe horrible euils that are ſo vſuall and commonly practiſed; that by this, ſinne and wickedneſſe may be aboliſhed, the true ſeruice of God maintained, to his owne glory, the good of his Church, and the happy and peaceable gouernment of this honorable Citie.
