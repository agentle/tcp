               CVstome which maketh this claime of Dedication, and the goodnesse of your noble and worthy Natures, stirres in me a bouldnesse

to call vpon your names, and to fixe them to the Frontispiece of this small and little Treatise, that as a safe Armour they may shield it from the bitternesse of Enuie. What the worke is, or how profitable it may be, either to the present times, or those of the future, your owne iudgements can better tell, then any defence in mee make perfect; It is sufficient that I haue haue brought it into the world to doe you Seruice, at which ende if it haue the happinesse to arriue, it hath the full gaine of all mine owne wishes; if otherwise it stumble on mischance, the obliuion which shall couer me shall bee no greater then the patience which I haue long since made mine owne and onely companion. Howeuer my hope which cannot sincke, and your goodnesses (which is the strong ground-worke of this my poore

endeauour) shall keepe mee thus confident that what I haue done is both honest in it selfe, and wholesome for others, and with that Liuory I send it into the World to doe you and yours seruice, both here, and in other forraine places.
            By him that is the true admirer of your Vertues.

is triall and experience, and the full ayme at which it bends is the generall good of all good men, whose painefull industries makes them the Masters, Fathers, and Nurses of the best Knowledges.
            Ignorance, Wealth, and Ease may hold sleight of the argument, but that Wisdome and Experience which hath runne through the test of Affliction, will say it is worthy and necessary: for it will feed the hungry, cloath the naked, and giue soft rest to the weary; it will appease Mutenies, breede Loue, and make men able euery way to doe and suffer.

To the Treasurie of that action of Plantation, loe, I bring this my poore mite, and offer it to your seruice, which if you shall please to accept, I doubt not but the benefit shall returne to those in your imployment a reuenue worthy their practise; and my selfe rest euer ready to doe you and my Countrey Seruice.

                  Of the pleasant recreation of Fowling, and all the particular knowledges belonging to the same.
               
               
                  FOwling is an Art of discerning The Art of Fowling. and vnderstanding how to take all manner of Fowle, and it is to bee applyed or vsed two seueral wayes, that is to say, either by enchantment, or enticement, by winning or wooing the

Fowle vnto you with Pipe, Whistle, or Call: which either beguileth them with their own voyce, or amazeth them with the strangenesse of the sound: or else by Engine, which vnawares surpriseth and entangleth them: of both which I shall speake more largely hereafter.
               Now for the Fowle on which this Art D

                     sitie of Fowle. is to be exercised, they are diuers and of sundry natures; and so as if a man should runne into all the particularities, it were infinite to discribe, because they alter in nature as in feather: but for the purpose of which I intend to entreat, and for the better vnderstanding of the Reader, I will reduce them onely into two generall kindes or heads: that is to say, into Water-Fowle, and Land-Fowle, concluding vnder them all whatsoeuer is vsefull or necessary for man: as whether it bee for his pleasure, his particular profite and vocation, or for his dishe, whereby his Table and dyet may bee supported and maintained, and but for some one of these three, this Art is needelesse and vselesse.
               To speake then first of Water-Fowle, The nature of Water-Fowle. which fo
                     •…
                   their more aboundance and generalitie of vse, you shall vnderstand

they are a kind of Fowle which naturally take delight to liue in the water, gathering from thence their foode and sustenance: and out of the which they cannot by any meanes liue, which makes them more particular in some places then other Land-Fowle are: for into high and dry countries they wil not come except in the Winter season, and not then neither, except it bee vpon great inundation or ouerflowing of Brooks, which commonly so soone as they returne into their first narrow and small estate, they foorthwith quit the places and are no more seene there; for it is to be vnderstood that all Water-fowle are in their owne nature the subtillest and wisest of Birds, and most respectiue to their owne safetie: whence it came to passe that the most auncientest and skilfull Faulconers haue compared them to a well ordered, and well gouerned Campe strongly fortified and intrenched with floods of waters, Riuers and Ditches, with their high bankes almost vnpassable, and hauing Scouts on land farre off, and Courts of Guard, Sentinels, and all sorts of other watchfull Officers surrounding the body

of the grosse, to giue a speedy allarume on any aproach or dismay taken; and indeede, who soeuer shall obserue their maner of liuing or coutching, shall find no lesse then I haue spoken, and how euer some straggling Fowle which lye alooffe from the greater number, or whole body will still call first, and as it were awaken the rest vpon the least noyse, amazement, or other affright discerned; for it is the nature of Water-fowle neuer to flye alone, but in great flockes and heards, hauing euer a most especiall respect to the generall safetie: and where at any time you shall see a single Fowle, or a couple flying alone, there you may be assured they haue violently beene stirred vp by some affright, and so either in the amazement or pursuite, haue beene compelled to seperate and disperse themselues, yet such is their natures, and so adicted to sotietie and company, that they will not cease; nay, hardly sometimes leaue wing vntill they haue met together againe: and as this may sometimes happen by mens passing vp and downe by their haunts, so it most commonly chaunceth by the beating of Hagards,
                  
and wilde Hawkes vpon riuers and blanke waters which turning alost, and watching for their pray: when at any time they arise, presently pursue them, and cause these alterations: Nay, the very bald Buzzard, and Ring-tayle will sometimes occasion the same.

                  NOW of these Waterfowle, and such as may very well passe vnder that title, there are innumerable kindes, if feather or proportion should distingush them: but for the better order and method of this worke which I intend, I will onely reduce them into two seuerall kindes. That is, such as liue of the water, and vpon the water by gathering much of their food from thence, and swimming continually thereupon, and such as liue of the water, but

not vpon the water, as by the gathering of most of their food from thence, but not swimming vpon the same, more then wading with their long legs therin, & diuing with their long necks to gather that wh

                   of Fowles: The first and principalest

thing our skilfull Fowler hath to learne, is the knowledge of the hannts or places of residence where these Fowle for the most part abide; for to hunt (as men say) after Had I wist, or to finde the pleasure you pursue but by chance or hazard, without Art, knowledge and experience, makes the toyle so much greater then the delight, and the profit so incertaine, that both lye drowned and lost in the ignorance. This to redresse and draw a certainty to the recreation: you shall vnderstand that all sorts of greater Wilde-fowle, which are those which cleaue the foote; their haunts are commonly by the edges and sides of shallow Riuers, Brookes, or other rundels, or currents of water which doe either come from their especiall heads, or else are worne and made by the violence and force of the inundations of Land-waters, which falling downe into those low places or draines, doe for the Winter time runne like small Brookes, or Riuers, and these Sewers or passages of water commonly doe not last longer then the Winter or Spring, but dry vp as the yeare groweth dry and temperat.

Neither shall you heere expect to finde herdes or flockes of these Fowle, for neither will the place affoord them foode, nor is the safety so pleasing to multitudes, onely vpon such wadable Ri

you shall shoote a Piece, two or three off vpon those blancke waters and raise the Fowle from thence, which at that time being scard will presently pack to the Riuers, then you shall take your larger and midle sizd Nets, and with them you shall surround your small plashes, pits, or blancke waters, hanging your Nets slopewise and houering ouer them, yet so loose as is possible; then with your largest or longest Nets of all, you shall goe to the Fenns or bigger waters, and in those places where the greatest haunts of Fowle are, you shall stake downe your Nets on the bankes, shoaling ouer the water in such sort as hath beene formerly discribed; so as no Fowle can come to the banke, or rise from the banke, but may be intangled: also if there be any couert of Sedge, Reede, Rushes, or other matter within the water, you shall pitch your Nets about them also; which done an howre or two before day in the Morning, you shall take your Peice and goe to the Riuer first and see what your Nets hath taken, which when you haue vnlayded, you may then take vp those Nets and lap them vp till the next Euening,

then if you finde there be many Fowle on the Riuer, you may shoote off your Piece in one or two places, and that will presently send them to the Fenns and blanke Waters, which done, when you haue bestowed your Nets in places conuenient til you haue further vse for them, you shall about the first rising of the Sun, goe to your other Nets which are on the blanke waters, and see what they haue taken and vnlade them; and so hang them by till the next time of vse as aforesaid, and thus without fayle, where plenty of Fowle are you shall take plenty: and where they are the scarcest yet you shall haue an equall share without much trouble.
               The next manner of taking of Fowle The taking of great Fowle with strings. is with Strings or Lines made of long small Coard knotted here and there, and containing in length many fadomes, acording to the proportion of the places and haunts where you are to lay them; and they are of especiall great vse for the taking of all sorts of the greater Wild-Fowle, and the Plouers of both kinds, which when o

                   shall these limed Strings be drawne and layd vpon the forkes some rowes higher then! other some, like a billow of water, higher in one place then another, till euery row be filled and the haunt couered all ouer, then shall you fasten the endes with a slipping loope, in such wise that vpon any violent straine the whole string

may loosen and lap about any thing which toucheth it, and in this wise you shall take a great number of Fowle together, according to the flockes and heards in which they flye, especially Plouers, which for the most part come many together, and not in a single file or rowe as commonly other Fowle doe, but in a great broad cluster, spreading and couering the ayre as it were all ouer; and this manner of taking happeneth most commonly in the falling or comming to the ground o
                     •…
                   the Fowle, whose nature is to swoope close by the ground a good distance before they light, which happening amongst the strings, either all or most part are many times intangled, and these strings you neede not ouer precisely watch, but being placed you may goe about other businesse till the time of flight be past, and then returning to see what is taken, you shall finde such as are stricken with the strings fast enough, so as they can neither loosen themselues, nor yet runne away with the string to hide either it or themselues, and noting in what sort you layd your strings, in the same rankes commonly you shall finde them,

or not much further off, which being vnladed you may lappe them vp againe till you haue other conuenient time to vse them.

                      with strings. Stringes, may also be very well applied for the taking of the smaller wild- fowle, and such as onely haunt the water, onely then our Fowler must obserue to lime all his Srings with strong and very good water tride lime, such as will indure the water and not loose his vertue therein; and these Strings are to be applied either for the Morning or Euening flight as aforesaide; obseruing to take time enough before either of the flights, for the placeing of the String; and not to place them any where but vpon the most assured haunts, where the Fowle certainely doe frequent and feede; for otherwise it is losse of labour and much trouble to little purpose; now for the manner of placeing these Strings, as before you did them vpon the ground, so now you shall doe them ouer the water within lesse then halfe a foote thereof: making your forked stickes so much longer on purpose, acording to the shallownes or deepenes

of the water: and heerein you shall obserue to lay these strings seldome or neuer in any Mooneshine night, lest the shadow of the Lines giue offence to the Fowle, or if you doe lay them to set it in such darke and obscure places, where by the helpe either of Bancke, Tree, or other shelter, the Mooneshine may be helde backe and obscured, and your worke not perceiued.
               And thus you may also lay these strings ouerthwart Riuers or Brookes, and so, as they may almost very neere touch the water, nor neede you heerein at any time to make shorter your strings but pricking downe the first ende, goe from boughe to boughe till you haue couered so much of the Riuer all ouer, as you shall thinke to bee fit and conuenient, and so as if any Fowle light thereon they may not fall out of your compasse, or from your danger: as thus for example.
               
               
                  
And hauing thus placed your strings both on the banke waters and crosse the Riuers, and obseruing the earliest houres as soone as the flights are past, to come and visit your workes, you shall finde (that knowing the right haunts) if Fowle fall any where, they must necessarily fall within your danger, nor can you chuse but take very many: For (as I saide) comming in whole shoales or flockes together, though these Fowle 
                     •…
                  ye singly one after one, yet in their discent or lighting on the water, they doe spread themselues and come into a single ranke, all as it were lighting together (though not flying in one ranke or company) on the water in one and the same instant: whereby it is not a single Fowle that striketh the string alone, but for the most part the whole flocke flye so neere together, and so come swooping into the Nette.

                  THe next maner of taking of Fowle is with the Lime-twigs, which may likewise, as the rest before spoken off, be appropriated and accommodated to all sorts of Fowle, both the greater and the smaller. Touching the taking of the greater sort of Wild-fowle with Lime-twigges: our Fowler must prouide himselfe of good store of rodds, the best kind whereof are the long, smale, and streight growne twigges, or roddes which growe on the bushie branches of the Willow, being cut of an euen length one by another; and these twigges of which we speake, being for the greatest sort of Fowle, should be of the greatest length and thicknes, yet but small, light, and slender, being apt to play, winde about and cleaue to the least feather

which toucheth it; and for the true length thereof, it must suite the place in which it is to be vsed, as the length of the grasse, fogge, rushes, or such like amongst which it is to bee pricked, or else the depth of the water, that as much of the twigge as is limed may in the standing be free from other annoyance.
               These rodds or twigs thus prepared, you shall with very good and strong Bird-lime besmeere all the vpper parts or points thereof, downe below the middle part of the rodde, and holding them before the fire make the Bird-lime melt and and runne vpon them that the barke of the rodde may not be discerned from the Bird-lime; and thus hauing made a conuenient number of them according to the quantitie of grounds or haunts wherewith you are acquainted, you shall vse them in this manner.
               First, hauing well obserued and acquainted your selfe with the haunts and feedings of these greater sort of Wildfowle, and know both morning and euening where they vsually doe light, you shall then before Sunne set (as before I shewed) if it be for the euening flight,

and before day if it be for the Morning flight goe with your Lime-rods to their seuerall haunts, and in the very heart or midst of the haunte you shall first pinne downe a stale, which should be aliue foule formerly taken, of the same kinde which they are that now haunt the place, and for which you now lay, and this Stale you shall pinne downe in such sort that she may haue libertie of wing to flutter vp and downe at pleasure, and then on each side, and round about this Stale euery way you shall pricke downe your Lyme-roddes within a foote or thereabout one of another in euen rowes one by one, and rowe after row till you haue couered the haunt all ouer, and left no place for any Fowle to fall besides them.
               And these roddes you shall pricke sloape wise with the points bending into the winde and from the ground a good foote and better. Some vse to crosse pri

                  ke them, that is, one point into the winde, and another against the winde, that which way soeuer the Fowle commeth they may the more readily take them without any preuention; and

truely it is not to bee disallowed, for it doth affoord much safety to the worke: when you haue thus placed your Limeroddes, you shall then place a Stale or two more aloof
                     •…
                   from the Lime-roddes, and then finding a

                  fitte and conuenient place for your selfe to lye concealed in, and hauing small strings running along the ground, by which you make the Stales stirre at your owne pleasure; lye as closse as is possible, and when you heare or see any Fowle comming, stirre your Stales and they will presently vpon sight of them, stricke and swoope in amongst them, where if any touch (if you haue so much leisure) you may take them away presently, but if not let them flutter and tumble amongst the roddes till the greater heards come, and that you haue lymed as many as you are able to deale with; then you may rise, and gather them together at your pleasure; and here is to be noted, that in this case of taking Fowle with the Lyme-rods, as your selfe may not be absent, so you must haue also for your better ayde an excellent good, well-taught and obedient Waterdogge, that when any Fowle offereth

                   will doe though your eye be neuer so good, the dogge may foorthwith finde them out and bring them vnto you, for in this confusion and taking of mauy there will be worke enough for both: when you haue gathered vp al your foule, slain such as you please, and saued those you thinke meete for Stales, and so bagged them seuerally, you shall then gather vp your Rods and bundel them vp together and so carry them where they may lye safely till your next ocasion to vse them; and thus you may doe Morning and Euening during the season of the yeere, and as longe as the haunt shall serue you purpose.
               These Lime-rods may also be applied Taking of smaller Fowle with Limerods. for the smaller sorte of Wild-Fowle, and and such as onely frequent the water, and they must be trimd and sizd out acording to your vse, and the depth or sounding of the water, making them so much longer as the water is deeper: and the Lime which trimmeth these Rods would bee good strong water Lime such as no moysture or frost may trouble, now for the placeing of these Rods as you did pricke

them on the dry Land so you shall pricke them in the Water, as much of the Rod as is limed being aboue the water, and amongst your Rods you shal stake downe here and there a liue Stale being either a Mallard, or a Widgon, or a Tayle, and thus you may doe all ouer either any shallow plash, fenne, or any other blanck water which is wadeable, or so as you may with conuenience prick downe your Lime-rods, also you pricke them downe vpon the dry bankes, or borders which doe surround these Fennes, plashes, pits, and blanke-waters; fixing a Stale or two amongst them, which may intice the Fowle from the water to the dry Land, and vpon the very brimme or edge of the water you shall pricke your Rods shoa

These lime-rods (as the other formerly treated off for the greater sorte of Wild-fowle) you shall not need continually to watch and

at al in him you cannot lose a foule, for the lime is so strong a sent that almost a man may follow it, thus when you haue gathered what for that time is taken, you shall set all your Rods in order againe, renewing all such as are broken or spoyled, and so let them stand (as before) till your next time of comming; And thus you shal continue to doe as long as you finde the haunts fit for your purpose, but so soone as you see it beginne either to decay or that the game goeth away, (for it is to be known that these Fowle are so subtill and carefull of their owne safetie, that being much beaten vpon they will finde it and foorthwith forsake the place) then you shall immediately hunt out a new haunt that is vntroubled, and there doe as hath bin before declared, & then after a month or three weekes rest, the first haunt will become as good as it was before; and so you may haue sport continually, nor at any time fleepe without haueing your pray in your owne possession; There are some which vse to mixe with their Limerods and their Lime-strings, laying a row of the one and then a row of the other,

yet in the Winter time it couereth not the Earth, nor is the blade so twight that being neare, it is much discerned from the Earth, therefore as I said the darkest colored Rods are the best; and these you shall place sloape-wise vpon the Lands as was before declared for other dry places, and about the water Furrowes on euery side & in the midst, you shal place sundry rowes of lime-rods so as the foule may in no wise come to the water without the touch of them, and these Rods shall be of the largest and heauiest, for the Fowle is of great strength and will beare a little Rod cleane away; and from these Rods when you haue plast them, you shall not be farr distant more then to auoyd trouble or suspition of the Fowle, (which

the hoope, and as you goe farther and farther from the hoope or Springe, so you shall make the way wider and wider, that the Fowle may be entred a good way in before it perceiue the fence; the beginning or first entrance being as wide as the largest furrow whatsoeuer, so that any Fowle falling neare the same, they may be inticed to goe and wade vp the same, where they shall no sooner touch the Springe either with head, foote or feather, but they shall presently be taken, and that member swickled which first toucheth the Springe; and acording to the strength of the plant, so you may take any Fowle how greate or bigge soeuer: for I haue my selfe taken a Faune in one of these Springes, which hath equald the strength of any Fowle, and that by one legge onely, whereby it hath had the whole body to strugle withall.

onely it may be of much lesse strength and substance, according to the Fowle it is set for, especially the sweaper or maine plant, which as it is prescribed of Hazell, Elme, or Witchen, so in this case it may be of Willow, Sallow, strong growne Ozyer, or any yeelding plant which will bend and giue againe to it owne straightnesse; and this kinde of Engine is for the Winter season onely, when much wet is on the ground, and not when the furrowes are drye; But if there happen any great frosts so that you are lockt out from these ordinary waters, then you shall search out where these standing waters haue any dessents or small passages, so as by the swift current or motion the water is not so apt to frieze, and in these places you shall erect your Springes, and where such currents are not, there you shall as much as you can inforce and make them; for although the greater Fowle will packe to the Riuers, and deeper running Brookes, yet these smaller Fowle cannot goe thither, but will labour and plye any place which is made or prepared for them, & the greater the forst is, the sooner and apter they are to be taken.

                  THe next Engine to these is the Gun or Fowling Piece, which is a generall Engine and may serue forany Fowle great or little whatsoeuer, for it hath no respect at what it striketh, being within the leuell: And of the Fowling Piece you shall vnderstand that to be the best which is of the longest barrell, as fiue foote and a halfe, or sixe foote, and the boare indifferent, as some what vnder Harquebush, for these hould the best charges, & carry the farthest leuell, which is a principall thing to be regarded; for Fowle are of such a tickell and counning nature, that a man shall hardly get within any indifferent or neare station, and to shoote

                  ut of leuell or distance were to shoote against the winde, and scarr-Crow like,

onely to affright Fowle with the losse of labour; as for the shape or manner of it, tis better it be a fier locke or Snaphaunce then a cocke and tricker, for it is safer and better for carriage, readier for vse & keepes the powder dryer in all weathers, whereas the very blowing of a coale is many times the losse of the thing aymed at; as for the charge your round haileshot or drop-shot, is better then the single or doble Bullet, and this halle-shot would be of bignesse according to the Game you shoote at, which if it be great and large, then it would be of twenty or thirty to a charge, or lesse as the Piece will carry; but if the Game be small, then it would bee of fortie or threescore, as shall seeme best in the discretion of the Fowler; Now for the vse of this Fowling-Peice, it is either for Land or Water that is passable or may bee waded, as whether it bee in Fenne, vppon Plash, or Pits, or any other blankwater; and heerein first the Fowler is to obserue the finding out of his Game, and which Fowle lyeth fittest for his purpose, at no time striuing to shoo

compasse more within his leuell; then hee shall seeke as neare as hee can to shoote with the winde, not against the winde, and rather sidewaies or behinde the Fowle then full in their faces, then hee shall seeke the conuenientest shelter hee can finde, as either hedge, Banke, Tree, or any other shaddow which may hide him from the gaze of the Fowle, for they are so fearefull of the proportion, visage, or motion of a man, that vpon the least suspition they are gone in a moment, and therefore when vnder his couert or pertision he is gotten within his leuell and hath the Winde fit and certaine, then hee shall make choyce of his marke, which (as before I said) would in no wise be a single Fowle, hauing more within your leuell, but rather the longest and largest Rancke or File of Fowle you can finde, for since one shoote is as much as you can get at one time and in one place, it is meete you put it to as great vse and profit as you can possibly, which done you may instantly and speedily discharg, and then send foorth your Dogge to fetch what you haue strucken, both

as well those which are slaine out right as those which are hurt and mayned; and being so as you cannot your selfe conueniently come by them: but by all meanes you must haue your Dogge in such true obedience that hee may not stirre from your heeles, or let so much as his shaddow be perceaued, till you haue shot and your selfe bid him goe, for to rush foorth too soddenly or vpon the first fier or cla

               And as you make vse of this Stalking horse, so must you not in any wise want your Water-dogge, for he is as vsefull at this time as at any other, nor can you well doe any thing without him; especially if it be vpon Riuers or broad deepe waters, yet you should haue him at such obedience that whilest you are a stalking you may leaue him with your Bagges, sadle & bridle & other needments, wher he may lye close, & neuer stirre till you haue shot, and then vpon the least gybbet or call, to come running vnto you, and to fetch foorth what you shall kill, which with a small practise he will doe readily

                  , or Horses to stalke withall, are not

euer in readinesse, and at the best aske a good expence of time to bee brought to their best perfection: as also, in that euery poore man or other which taketh delight in this exercise, is either not master of a Horse, or if hee had one yet wanteth fit meanes to keepe him: and yet neuerthelesse this practise of Fowling must or should bee the greatest part of his mantenance.
               In this case he may take any pieces of oulde Canuasse, and hauing made it in the shape or proportion of a Horse with the head bending downeward, as if hee grased, and stoping it with dry Strawe, Mosse, Flocks, or any other light matter, let it be painted as neere the colour of a Horse as you can deuise; of which the Browne is the best, and in the midst let it be fixt to a Staffe with a picke of Iron in it to sticke downe in the ground at your pleasure, and stand fast whilest you chuse your marke, as also to turne and winde any way you please, either for your aduantage of the winde, or for the better taking of your leuell, and

and wagging it in such wise that it may seeme to mooue and graze as it goeth; nether must this in any wise exceed the or dinary stature or proportion of a common Horse, for to bee too low or little will not couer the man, and to be two big and huge will be both monstrous & troublesome, and giue affright to the Fowle, therefore the meane in this is the best measure, and only worth the obseruation.
               
                  The forme and manner of the Stalking horse of Canuasse stopt.
               
               
                  
Now these Engines are euer better and more proper for the water then the Land, and though they will serue very fitly for both, yet are they more conueuient for the Water, by reason that the Water hideth all their imperfection, and maketh them appeare to the Fowle one and the same thing which at the first they did seeme.
               Now there be some which doe not so The Horse vnstopt. well approue of this Horse thus stopt and furnisht out; alleaging it to be too heany and troublesome, and though a man vse all the Art that may be in the lightnesse thereof, yet still they say it is to waighty; and therefore they will by all meanes haue them made of single Canuas vnstopt at all, but onely strecht out vpon splents made of wood, or vpon strong wyer proportiond like vnto a Ho
                     •…
                  se wherein they vary nothing from the Figure formerly described, but onely in the stoping; for this and the other must be painted also, and that very thick too, lest in the turning it against the Sun it prooue transparent, or so as a man may see through it, which will giue such an offence to the Fowle, that they will in no sort endure it.
               
                  
Also you must obserue in the Stalke to turne that side euer vpon the Fowle which is plaine without splents, or other markes more then the painting onely for feare of offence, and these are as good as any liue Horse for this vse being artefully handled in the motion, and made to mooue by slow degrees at leisure, as a Horse doth, and not suddenly or rudely, for that will discouer them and breed affight in the Fowle.
               There be others which vse insteed of The Oxe or shape of hornd beast. this Stalking Horse of Canuas either stopt or vnstopt, to make the proportion of a beast or hornd Neat, as Oxe, Cow, or Bull in Canuas, as afore is shewed, either stopt or vnstopt, according to the fancy of the Fowler, and as he shall finde fittest for his strength to support and carry without any offence, and this figure he shall make in as true forme and proportion as he can deuice, for the eye of a Fowle is so cunning that they will easily perceiue any grosse absurdity, or mishapen, or vnlike forme, and thereat quickly take offence, and auoid the thing deceiuing; it shall also bee very well painted to the life, either

Blacke, Browne, or Pied, according to the vsuall colours of the cattell in those places; for though blacke and browne are generally the best, because of their shaddow, yet in such places where no such Blacke or Browne cattell are, or at least very gayson or nouell, there they are the worst colours, and ought least to be vsed; for your Engine must euer bee sutable to that wherewith the eye of the Fowle is most acquainted, nor must you alone stand precisly vpon the colour, but also vpon euery other face or maine carracter, by which the whole body is disstinguyshed; as in fixing the Hornes, which must euer be sutable to the colour of the Beast and the breed of the Countrey, for it is commonly seene heere with vs in England, that your entire blacke, your browne, and your brended Cattell haue euer the goodliest Heads and fayrest extended Hornes, the whitest & the largest, and your white pide, and bloodred Cattell the least Heads, crumpled, short, and foule collored; Therefore to make your Engine blacke, browne, or brended with short crooked and ilfauord Hornes, or white or pyed, with great,

straight and large spred Hornes, were both an absurdity to be laught at, and a preuention of the sport you labor for, by affrighting the Fowle out of your company with that, by which you should intice them only to stay and grow familliar with you; and therefore you must accommodate euery thing in his true and propper nature, without strangnesse or offence. Nor may you in any sort stalke with these Engins in any place but where these Cattell are vsuall and in most abundance, for to stalke with a Horse where no Horses liue or are bred, or with the Oxe, where no Oxen are know is absurde and losse of labor, but this is no doubt in our Nation, therfore the best vse I can giue you of these Engines, is that when you haue so much beaten the Fowle with the Stalking-Horse, that they beginne to find your deceit, and will no more sit or indure you, (as generally it falls out,) then you may an other while stalke with the Oxe or Beast, till the Horse be forgotten, and thus by the chang and alteration of your Engins you may make your sport last & be continually, for the shape of your Oxe Engine, it followeth in the next Page

               Now there bee others without a further curiosity (and indeed it is nothing at all to bee discomended) which frame themselues Engines like Stagges, or redd Deere, and these also they frame of canu
                     •…
                  sse as the former, either stopt or vnstopt, with the naturall hornes of Stags fixed there on, and the colour painted so

liuey, that the Fowle may not discerne them from a Stagge or a thing that is liuing, and these Engines are right good and very vsefull in all such places or low fenney grounds where any such Stagges or Deere doe vsually feede; as about Hatfield Chase in the North parts, or Ramsey in Huntintonshire and such like where the Stagge is more familiar with Fowle, and feedeth neerer them then either the Horse or the Oxe, and therefore this Engine being artificially & wel made is of as good vse as any of the former Engines, and will indeede bring a man within a farre neerer distance; onely it is subiect to quicker discouery, and therefore it must be the oftner altered and changed to preuent the subtiltie of the Fowle: as for the proportion or forme of this Engine it is placed in the next page.

               I doe confesse it is the face of a man which keepeth all liuing things in the greatest awe, and that the face being couered or concealed a man may proceed better in these pastimes, but that it should worke this great effect and be as vsefull as the former models, I vtterly deny and differ from; for the very body of man is too well known vnto Fowle, that when soeuer it is mixt with any vnnaturall forme or monstrous shape, it presently causeth amazement, which amazement though it may a little hold the Fowle at gaze, whereby the man may come at a much neerer distance; yet before the marke can be chosen and the leuell taken commonly the astonishment wasteth away, and feare entring the minde, the Fowle suddenly ariseth, before the Piece can be discharged: And therefore though

               Lastly the skilfull Fowler must vnderstand that these Engines of what kinde soeuer, are fitter for the early morning Stalke or the late euening Stalke, then at any other time of the day when the Sunne is aloft or in his high glory, for at such time the lest blinke or deformity is very soone perceiued, and the naturall feare of the Fowle is most prone and apt to raise vp by thoughts and feares, where by they are forced to rise vp and flye away before that the skilfullest man ca

                  e and troublesome, and not onely maketh him sooner to faint and giue ouer his sport, but also makes him by his ouerheating, more subiect to take the Maungie.
               And so likewise in matter of wager, it is a very heauy burthen to the Dogge, and makes him to swimme lesse nimbly and slower, besides the former offences before receited; But for the cutting or shauing of a Dogge all quite ouer, euen from the Foote to the Nostrill that I vtterly dislike, for it not onely takes from him the generall benifits which Nature hath lent him, but also brings such a tendernesse and chilnesse ouer all his body, that the water in the end will grow yrksome vnto him; for how soeuer men may argue that keeping any creature cold, will make it the better indure colde, yet we finde by true experience both in these and diuers other such like things, that when Nature is thus continually kept at

her vttermost ability of indurance, when any little drope more is added to that extreamity, presently she faints, and growes distempered, whereas keepe Nature in her full strength and she will very hardly be conquered, and hence it doth come that you shall see an ordinary land Spaniell, being lustily and well kept, will tyre twenty of these ouer shauen Curres in the could water: whereas let them haue the rights Nature hath bestowed vpon them, and the water is as familliar vnto them as the Land any way can be

                   therefore to conclude this poynt, I would haue the skilfull Fowler, if he keepe his Water-Dogge onely for his vse of Fowling as to attend his Nets. Limerods, Fowling-Piece or such like, which is only for the most part apropriate to the Winter season, then not to shaue his Dog at all, for hee shall find in the sharpe frost and snow, when the Ayre shall frize the drops of water faster on the hayre th
                     •…
                   the Dogge can caste them off; that the vttermost benefit that Nature hath granted, is no more but sufficient, and the carefull Maister should rather seeke to increase then deminish them.
               
                  
Now for the manner of trayning or His trayning. bringing vp of his Water Dogge, it is to be vnderstood that you cannot beginne too early with him, that is to say euen when you first weane him, and teach him to lappe, for euen then you shall beginne to teach him obedience, which is the maine thing that includeth all the lessons which hee shall learne, for being made to obay your will, hee is seruiceable for any purpose you shall imploy him in, as one the contrary part, wanting due obedience hee is good for nothing at all but to syoyle the worke you shall labour to effect; and therefore (as I said) so soone as it is able to lappe, you shall teach it to coutch and lye close, not daring to stirre or moue from that posture in which you put it, without your especiall license, cherrishing it euer when it doth your will and correcting it when it doth the contrary, and alwayes obseruing this maxime in the first teaching of him, that you neuer let you Dogge eate or taste any meate but when he doth something to deserue it, that custome may make it know, foode is a thing which cōmeth not by chance, or the bounty of your hand,

but for reward or merrit when he doth your commandement, and this will not onely make him willing to learne, but apt to remember and retayne what hee learneth, and diligently to performe your pleasure without sticke or amazement, the carracters of your commands, being so dee
                     •…
                  ely Imprinted in his knowledge: and to this end you must haue no more teachers no more feeders, cherrishers, or correcters but one, for multiplicity breeds confusion, and to teach diuers wayes is to teach no way well: also you must be very constant to the words of directions by which you teach, chusing such as are the most signifficant for your purpose, and fittest for the action you would haue the Dogge doe, and by no meanes alter that word which you first vse, though you vse a word of the same signification: for you must vnderstand the Dogge takes notice of the sound and not of the English, and therefore the least variation puts him into amazement, and is a language he vnderstands not; as thus for example: I
                     •…
                   when you teach your Whelpe first to Coutch, you vse the word (Coutch) 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
after you vse the word (Downe) and not Coutch, it will put the Dogge into amazement and he will not know what to doe: And how euer some hold of opinion it is good to vse all sorts of words, yet it is not so, for the ouerloading of the Dogges memory with many words for one and the same lesson, is the first thing that breeds forgetfulnesse, and fils the Dog full of by-thoughts and doubtfullnesse: when you haue the Dogge thus acquainted with the word which is due to the instruction of his lesson, you must then teach him to knowe the word of reprehension or correction, for no lesson can bee taught without a fault, and no fault ought to escape at the best without chiding; and in this word also you must be as constant as in the former without variation of sound, or multiplycity of language, that the Dog may know assuredly when you chide, or are angry, and not stand amazed between hope and feare, as not knowing whether you chide or giue encourag
                     •…
                  ent; and of these words there are diuers; as Wilt thou villain, Ha Rasball: and such like, which at first should not bee vsed without a Ierke

or small stripe, to make him knowe that it is a word of wrath and anger, neither must such words procceed from you louingly and gently, but with passion and and roughnesse of voice, that the Whelp may euen tremble when hee heares you: Now to these words of reprehention you must also ioyne words of cheerishings, that as the one correcteth him for faults committed; so the other may encourage and comfort him as oft as hee doth your pleasure: and in teaching these dumbe things, correction may better bee spared then cheerishing, because the reward and comfort he findes by doing your will, is the onely certaine and sure ground which expounds your meaning vnto him, and makes him capeable of those things you would haue him learne; and in these words also, you must be as constant and certaine as in any of the other without variation or change of sound, allacrity and cheerefulnesse of spirit, being accompanied either with food, the spitting in the
                     •…
                   mouth, cheerishing of the hand, or other clawings in which the Dogge taketh delight, that he may know by such comforts hee hath

truely done your will, and bee thereby encouraged to doe it as oft ouer as you shall bee pleased to command him: And these words of cheerishing are also diuers; as Thats a good boy, Well done, S
                        •…
                      boy, and such like as shall best agree with your nature and inuention.
               And to these three you shall adde a fourth word, which is no lesse necessary then any of the former, being nether altogether instructiue, altogether correcting, nor altogether cherrishing: but taking as it were a part from them all, and doeing something of them all in one instant and one breath, and this may bee called the word of aduice or heed taking, being onely to be vsed when a Dogge is about to doe his lesson, and either goeth the wrong way to worke, or too rashly, too slowly, or too negligently; or else leaueth out some obseruation which hee should performe in the Lesson, any of which assoone as you perceiue him incline vnto, you shall immediately vse your word of aduice vnto him, which both as a bit shall serue to restraine and stay him, till he haue better thought of what he go
                     •…
                  th about, or else as a Spurre

or Rod, put him froward with more alacrity of spirit, till hee haue done his Lesson in such forme as may content you, and these words of aduice are as the others, diuers also: as Hem, Be-wise, Takeheed; or such like, and to these you must be as constant as to the former, and make election of that you intend to vse and no other, and by all meanes be exceeding carefull not to misapply them, as to aduice when you should correct, cherrish when you should aduise, Inst

                  uct when you should punish, or punish when you should instruct, any of which is grosse in a teacher and brings the Dog into confusion.
               When therefore you haue made your whelpe vnderstand these seuerall sounds or wordes, as that of Instruct on, Correction, Cherrishing, and Aduise, and that he will couch and lye downe at your feete how you please, when you please, and as long as you please, and that with a single word or a looke onely, you shall then proceede and teach him to leade in a line and collor, following you at your heeles in decent and comely order, nether treading vpon your heeles, or going

before or side by you which shewes too much hast, nor hanging backe or strayning your Line by the meanes of too much sloath, but following in decent and orderly manner without offence either to the Dogge or his leader, and this kinde of leading is to make the Whelpe familiar with you, that he may loue and acknowledge you and no man else, in which Lesson when you haue made him perfect by his daily attendance of you, and by goeing into no place without the Dogge, you shall then make him attend you loose, in the same manner as he did in the Line, without straying or going his length from your heeles vn

reward his obedience, you fhall then teach him to fetch and carry any thing you shall throw forth of your hand; and this you shall first beginne to teach by the way of sport or pastime with the Dogge, as by taking your gloue and shaking it about his head and lips, and making him catch and snap at it, and to play with it as a thing in which he delighteth, and sometimes to hould it in his mouth and striue to pull it from you, and then casting it a little way from you suffer him to mussell and worry it on the ground, and then take hold on it againe and take it from him with cherrishing, and thus doe till he will take it from the ground, and hold it in his mouth as it were to tempt you to take it, then cast it further from you and say Fetch, or Bring Sirra, and if he doe bring it you make exceeding much of him and reward him either with Bread, or Meate, and let him haue no foode but what he deserueth by doeing your will in his Lesson, and thus daily and howrely augment and increase your Lesson, till you haue made your Dogge so perfite that he will fetch your Gloue vnto you wheresoeuer you thro

it: In which if at any time hee offer to runne away with your Gloue, or to tosse it vp and downe, and play with it without regard to bring it vnto you; then first vse your word of aduice, which if it doe not preuaile, then vse your word of correction, but if both faile, then giue him blowes, and for that time let him loose his foode and finde no reward till hee doe your pleasure: when by this meanes you haue perfeited him, that hee will fetch your Gloue quickely and readily vnto you, wheresoeuer you throwe it, and so truely vnderstand that it is his duty to bring it onely vnto you, that if twenty men in the company call him seuerally, yet he will shunt he n all to bring it vnto you, and lepe vp to your bosome to deliuer it, you shall then reward him exceedingly and after traine him to fecth whatsoeuer you shall throw from you, as Staues or Cudgels, Bagges, Nets, Instruments of all kindes, and indeed, any thing whatso
                     •…
                  uer that is portable: then you shall vse him to fetch round cogell stones, and flints, which are troblesome in a Dogges mouth, and lastly, Iron, Steele, Money, and all kinde of metall,

which being colde in his teeth, flippery and ill to take vp, a Dogge will bee loth to fetch, but you must not desist nor let-him taste food, till he will as familiarly bring and carry them as any thing else whatsoeuer: as for the vsing him to carry, dead, or liue Fowle, or Pullen, it is not amisse, because by that meanes he will not breake or teare in pieces any Fowle at all, which fault is intollerable in any Dogge whatsoeuer, and proceedes from too much greedinesse, but in the vse thereof let him euer bring the least Fowle you can get without hurt, that if you send him for a Larke, he may bring it without brusing a feather. This lesson this perfected, you shall then as you walke, drop something behind you which the Dogge may not see, and being gone a little way from it, send the Dogge backe to seeke it, by saying, Backe I haue lost, or some such like word, and if at the first he stand amazed, vrge him still and cease not, by poynting with your finger the way you would haue him goe, till he doe turne backe and finde that which you haue dropt, which make him take vp and bring after you; then drop it againe

and goe twice as farre as you did at the first, and then send the Dog back to seeke it, not leauing til you make him hunt and bring it you, then cheerish and reward him, and where he failes there chide and punish him, somtimes with blowes, sometimes with want of foode, and thus continue to do till the Dog wil hunt the way backe in which you went, be it a mile or more according to your occasion: and heerein is to bee noted that if you send your Dog backe to fetch any thing, if he returne aud bring backe any thing in his mouth, though it bee not the thing you lost, yet you shall receiue it and cheerish him, but not suffer him to stay, but immediatly send him backe againe, saying Away againe, or I haue lost more, and neuer bee satisfied till hee bring the thing you want, for the much toyle will be punishment enough for his mistake, and make him more careful to the sent of any thing about you; but if at any time he returne without any thing in his mouth, then bee sure both to chid & beat him, for his emptinesse of mouth shewes both sloth and negligence: when he will thus fetch, cary, and finde things being lost, then you

may trayne him to hunting, beginning first with tame Fowle, which by your owne helpe at diuing and other losses, you may make him with little labour, take, which incourragement will harten and make him delight in the sport, then after you may make him vse all his owne cunning, and without assisting him, let him either get or loose his pray, obseruing to giue him reliefe according to his desert in well hunting, and to punish him with want of reward according to his sloth or negligence; and thus woonte him till he bee full master of his game, and can finde the aduantages and losses in enery water, and obseruing euer to make him (when he taketh his prey) to bring it on shoare vnto you without hunting, and that he shall not dare to nyppe or bite it, after once you shall say Forbeare, or Tis dead, or any such like thing whatsoeuer.
               After this you shall traine him vnto you Peece, in forme as was shewed in a former Chapter, making him stalke either step by step behinde you and vnder the couert of your shadow, till you haue shott, or else to couch downe and lye

vexation, and therefore by all meanes haue him in that true obedience that he may not dare to take any freedome more then you giue him.

in some narrow creeke or straitned place (if it be in the broad blank waters) pitcht vp your nets, get with your boates betweene the couert and the Fowle, and so taking vp your dogges withall leisure and gentlenes driue the Fowle before you (who of their own natures, will shun your presence) till you bring them within the compasse of the Nets, and then surrounding them about you may ouerthrow

some of mudde, and some of grasse, and indeede not any in generall either very fatte, or very pleasant; whereas these which are thus taken and fedde by hand in the house, and there crambd with food in which they most delight, as the Lyuers of Beasts and Sheepe, Whay, Curddes, Barley, Paste, scalded Branne, and such like, are both passing fat, exceeding sweet, and of great price, and therefore to be preferd before all other Fowle whatsoeuer.

Champaine Countries, and that is with the Tramell, or long Tramell Net, being much like vnto that Nette which is formerly described for the Lowbell, both in shape, mashe, and all other proportions, yet if you please it may bee somewhat longer but not much broader, because then you shall be forst to runne vpon it and endanger the breaking.
               This Nette when you come into the place where the haunt of Birds are, which rest vpon the earth (being such as are before named) you shall then spread it vpon the ground, and let the neather or or furthest end thereof (being plummed with small plummets of lead) lye loose on the ground and then bearing vp the former ende, by the strength of men at the two for most ends onely, traile it a

               Then on each side the Nette shall bee carried great blazing lights of fire, such as were formerly spoken of, and by the

                  nder the Netts so to take them; and in

this sort you may goe ouer a whole corne Field, or any other Champaine ground where the haunts of Birdes are, till you haue compassed euery part thereof. And this will most assuredly affoord you great store, both of pleasure and profit, according as the haunts of the Birdes are, for if there be plenty you shall take plenty, if their be few, yet of those few you shall haue your share.
               Next to the Tramell I thinke meete to Of Batfowling. proceed to Batte-fowling, which is likewise a nighty taking of all sorts of great and small Birdes which rest not on the earth, but on Shrubbes, tall Bushes, Hathorne trees, and other trees, and may fitly and most conueniently be vsed in all Woody, rough, and Bushy Countries, but not in the Champaine.
               For the manner of Bat-fowling it may be vsed either with Nettes, or without Nettes: If you vse it without Nettes (which indeede is the most common of the two) you shall then proceede in this manner. First, there shall be one to cary the Cresset of fire (as was shewed fo
                     •…
                   the Lowbell) then a certaine number as two, three, or foure (according to the

greatnesse of your company) and these shall haue poales bound with dry round wispes of hay, straw, or such like stuffe, or else bound with pieces of Linkes, or Hurdes dipt in Pitch, Rosen, Grease, or any such like matter that will blaze.
               Then another company shal be armed with long poales, very rough and bushy at the vpper endes, of which the Willow, Byrche, or long Hazell are best, but indeed acording as the Country will afford so you must be content to take.
               Thus being prepared and comming into the Bushy, or rough ground where the haunts of Birds are, you shall then first kindle some of your fiers as halfe, or a third part, according as your prouision is, and then with your other bushy and rough poales you shall beat the Bushes, Trees and haunts of the Birds, to enforce them to rise, which done you shall see the Birds which are raysed, to flye and play about the lights and flames of the fier, for

                  s it were almost to scorch their wings in

the same; so that those which haue the rough bushye poales, may (at their pleasures) beat them down with the same, & so take thē. Thus you may spendas much of the night, as is darke for longer is not conuenient; and doubtlesse you shall finde much pastime, and take great store of birds, and in this you shall obserue all the obseruations formerly treated of in the Lowbell; especially, that of silence, vntill your lights be kindled, but then you may vse your pleasure, for the noyse and the light when they are heard and seene a farre of, they make the birds sit the faster and surer.
               The byrdes which are commonly taken by this labour or exercise, are for the most part, the Rookes, Ringdoues, Blackebirdes Throstles Feldyfares, Linnets, Bulsinches; and all other Byrdes whatsoeuer that pearch or sit vpon small boughes or bushes.
               This exercise as it may be vsed in these Of the Sparrow Net. rough, woody and bushie places, so it may also be vsed alongst quickset hedges, or any other hedges or places where there is any shelter for Byrdes to pearch in.
               
                  
Next to these general takings of birds in the darke of night, either in Champaine or Woody grounds, wee may annexe and place the taking of Byrds with the Sparrow net, which is an excercise to be vsed after Sunne-set in the euening and before Sunne-rise in the morning, which is either after birds goe to their roust, or before they stirre in the morniug.
               The Engine or Sparrow-nette which is to be made for this purpose, must carry this fashion or proportion.
               First, you must haue a long poale of the bignesse or quantity of a handsome Haukes poale, and at the vpper ende thereof must be fastened strongly, either with one, two or moe graines, a small square crosse wood like vnto the head of an ordinary Hayrake, but of a much larger length and size and of a little longer square, according to the fashion or proportion of this figure following.
               
                  
                  
                     The forme and manner of the first Crosse-staffe.
                  
               
               
                  
Then you shall make another staffe in all proportions like vnto this, but not aboue a third part in length at the vttermost this shorter Crosse-Staffe you shall ioyne to the longer, with a strong small Coard so loosely that at your pleasure it may fall two and froe from the longer Crosse-Staffe, and when both the Crosse-Staues meete together, that then they may be both of one equall length and height, and ioyne euen and iust together without any difference; for otherwise they will be out of order, and that which you seeke to take will escape away by meanes of such disorder, but being iust and euen, the proportion will shew you this Figure following.
               
                  
                  
                     The forme and manner of the second Crosse-staffe.
                  
               
               
                  
These two Crosse-staues being thus ioyned together euen & fit to meet together, you shall then both to the one & to the other, fixe a large & wide Purse-net hauing that liberty at the toppe that the Crosse-staues may fall and part the one from the other a pretty distance and the lower ende of the Nette shall bee straite and narrow, and fastened fast to the same hole in the longer Crosse staffe, to which the shorter Crosse-staffe was before fastned, then shal you haue twosmale coards or lines, which with knots shall be fastened to each ende of the shorter Crossestasse passing through the two holes, and so through the holes of the longer Crossstaffe, through which they may goe and come at your pleasure, and then shall the other two ends of the wards be tyed on a knot together, at such an euen distance that the shorter staff may fal at your plea sure from the longer as farr as you thinke meet, or the widenes of the Net wil suffer it, and then another single ward being made fast to that last knot of the to cords (which single ward you shal euer carry in your right hand) with it you shal at your pleasure drawe the Crosse staues close

together, and close vp the Net as you shall finde occasion, and also with it you shall make the staues and Net flye open & widden as the place shal require where you are to set it; for you must haue great regard in the vsing of this Engine euer to place it close, for if you leaue any parte open either by too much slacknesse, or the whole haunte not couered by too much straightnesse, the Birds will quickly finde it, and so escape and get away before you can come to your purpose: But euery thing being made handsome and fit, and the Lines yare and ready to passe too and froe with ease and gentelnesse, then will the whole and intyre Engine, cary the fashion and proportion of this figure which heere followeth.
               
                  
                  
                     The forme and maner of the Sparrow-Net.
                  
               
               
                  
Now for the vse of this Sparrow-Net, is (as was before said) to be vsed late in the Euening, or early in the Morning, by seting it against the Eues of thatcht Houses or other houses, or against the eaues of Stackes, Houeles Barnes, Stables, and other out-Houses, or against the eaues of Doue-coates, and being set close against them to knocke and thrust the Crosse-staues close against the same, making such a noyse as may inforce the Birds to flye out of their holes & haunts into the Net, and then presently to draw the longe single Line and shut vp the Crosse-staues close, and then to take out the Birds so taken, and in this manner you may in an Enening, or else in a Morning, goe ouer all your Houses, Barnes or Stacks, where are any haunts of Birds and take so many as you please. The Birds which are generally taken with this Engine, are Sparrowes, Robins, Wrens, Starlings, extrauagant Pydgio

               The chiefe benefite of it is for the

mewing of Hauks, or geting into lust and strength, sicke and weake Haukes, for with this Engine you may Euening, and Morning take so many Birds as you please, and no more: and so giue them warme to your Hauke, which is the greatest nourishment that can be, and both raiseth a Hauke soone, and makes her mew fast, because they are as it were taken out of their owne nest, and from their owne liberty and freedome of feeding, whereas Birds that are taken longe before they are vsed, and so preserned day after day for these vses, they mourne and fall away, growing leane, vnsauory, and vnholesome, and the Haukes fedd and nourisht therwith, prosper but little better then with ordinary Dogges flesh, or other flesh that is lest nourishing. And thus much for Land-Fowle and the generall taking of them, as well by day as by night; Euening, or Morning.

all the yeare long, and at all seasons and houre

                  , so long as the weather is cleare and the Sunne shineth.
               There is yet another way of taking Vse of Stales with the Lime-Bush. these small Birds with the great Limbebushe (before mentioned) and that is if either you want a call, or haue not the true vfe of a call: then you shall imploy the Stale, (of which there are diuers) as thus for instance: when your Bushe is placed as was before shewed, you shall then take a night Batte or two, being aliue, and place them vpon the obiect which is next of all to your Lime bushe, and in such apparant manner, that no Birde thereabouts but may behold them, which will no sooner be perceiued, but euery Byrde will come to gaze and wonder at them; then hauing no other conuenient lighting place but the Limebushe, they will flocke as thicke into the same as may be, and so you may take them at your pleasure.
               Now as these night Batts, so the Oule is of like nature, and may be employed after the same manner; and by reason that she is lesse stirring and more melancholly then the Batte, as also of greater

quantity, and sooner to bee perceiued, shee is a better Stale then the Bat.
               Now if you haue not a liue Owle or a liue Batte, if you can get but the skins of either and stoppe them with woole or flockes, they will serue as well as if they were aliue, and continue (with carefull keeping) twenty yeeres and better. I haue seene some that for want of either of these hath had an Owle so liuely cut out in wood, and so artificially painted, that it hath serued him for this purpose, as well as any liue one could doe, and he hath taken Byrdes in wonderderfull great abundance therewith.

                  HAuing written of the generall taking of Land-Fowle of all sorts both great and small; and also descended to the taking of some particular Byrdes as hath beene before shewed; we will now write of the manner of taking of Hawkes of all kindes; especially such as are most frequent in our Kingdome, and with which my experience hath oft beene familiar, as the Goshawke, and her What Hawkes breede in England.

accidents they come into the Kingdome wilde, and sometimes breaking out of the Mewe turne wilde, so that without some especiall Art they are not to be recouered, because hauing any long time preyed for themselues, the Luer, voyce, and all rules of obedience are then vtterly forgotten.
               To beginne then with such Hawkes as The taking of young Hawkes. breed in our Kingdome, you shall vnderstand that they are to be taken three seuerall waies, and at three seuerall seasons: that is to say, either from the Ayery after they be disclosed (and then they be called Eiasse,) or after they bee full summed and beginne to forsake their Nest, (and then they bee called Braunchers;) or lastly, after they haue preyd for themselues (and then be called Sore-Hawkes, or Hawkes in their S

                     reage.)
               For the taking of the Eiasse Hawke The taking of Eiasse Hawkes. or Hawkes, from the Ayerie, which is as soone as they be disclosed, and haue cast off the first Downe which couereth their feathers, there is but small difficulty to be vsed, more then in the finding out of the Ayerie or Nest, which is soone done by walking vp and downe in the Woodes

amongst the tallest and goodliest Trees How to finde the Ayrie. which grow in the thickest couerts and are furthest from pathes, waies or places where people accustome to frequent, for in such they build and no other, and if you chance to come where the Ayrie is, you shal know it by the mutings & slycings of the old hawks; which wil not only bedaube the Tree and trences vnder the Ayrie, but also the ground and other places; as also, commonly vpon the ground (at the foote of the tree) you shal finde much plumage, feathers and bones of birdes scattered, any of which characters when you find, you may then be well assured that there the ayrie is; so that if you please but to watch neere or about the same, either early in the morning, or at the closing of the euening you shall see the male Hawke bring in prey for the female Hawke which sitteth vpon the nest, which when you see, you may then (if you please) when the female riseth to bath or solace her self (which commonly is about hie noone) clime vp into the tree, & look into the nest, and view how many egs she sitteth vpon; but in any wise be carefull not to touch any of them or giue any affright

fright to the old Hawke, but only looke vpon them and so depart, (for any grosse affright wil soone make her to forsake the ayrie.) This done you must let them rest till the young Hawkes be disclosed, which after they are a weeke or tenne daies old you may take them from the nest at your pleasure, and beare them home, and so bring them vp, with war

These Hawkes be called Eiasse, or Foole hawkes because they will doate and be fonde of the man as of their naturall dambes, following him vp and down, and crying after him for foode as oft as they see him or be hungry, yet this is not the best manner, nor the best season for the taking of young Hawkes; for neither can the man feede them so naturally and choicely as the true dambe can, nor halfe so well preserue their feather from hurts and bruises, which by reason of their tendernes & bloudines they are much subiect vnto, and a hurt taken on the feathers whilst they are in the bloud may disable The rake

The second season for the taking of young Hawkes is when they are Branchers, that is to say, when they are full summed; hard quill-featherd, and beginne to forsake their Nests and trust to their owne winges, skipping from bough

to that ende you shall make fast the strong lines to some knagge or branch of the tree, that when the hawke or hawkes are taken, they may not fall downe to the ground with the nettes, but hang fettred in the same; and that in such straite and little compasse that they may not haue liberty to beate or bruse themselues but hang safe without the breaking or hurting of any feather; which aboue all things is chiefely to be regarded, for the breaking and brusing of any of the maine feathers, is such a disabling of the hawke, that either she will not be able to flye at all, or if

                   doe flye, yet through the want of those hurt feathers shee will not be able to make fourth her way with that naturall and true swiftnesse which otherwise she would doe, and where the pray is too hard in flight for the pursuer, there is not onely all labour lost, but the pleasure depriued and no contentment to be taken in the pastime; besides it makes the Hawke grow cowardly and fearefull, and forces her to turne Tayle, by reason of the knowledge she takes of her owne inabillity and weaknesse;
               When you haue thus plast your first

Nette about and ouer the Nest, you shall The placeing of the other Nets then take your second Nette of the same size and fashion, and place it betweene the most thickest and vsuall branches, through which the Hawkes passe two and fro, both from & to the Nest, and which before you had principally marked when the Hawkes went first from the Nest, and this Nette you shall place, somewhat more vpright then the first, yet as close and secretly, and hauing greate regard that the Hawkes may by no meanes passe either vnder or aboue it without danger of taking, and it shall also as the first run together like a purse, when it is stricken into, and be fastned after the same, manner to the branches, that it may by no meanes fall to the Ground, but containe and hould the Hawke till you come to vnloose her.

neither goe from the Nest, nor come to the Nest without the danger of taking of them.

Now as soone as the olde Hawke is come in with her prey, (which for the most part are euer li

               Now if it happen (at the first comming in of the olde Hawke as the young ones passe to the Nest) that one or two bee stricken and taken in your Nette, you shall not presently ascend the tree, and fetch them downe, but let them hang still in the Nette till the old Hawke haue fed the rest, and is againe departed, and that those young Hawkes which escaped, likewise are come againe from the Nest; and if (by reason that the Nettes are filled) they then goe free, you presently go vp to the tree and fetch downe those which are taken, loosening the Nets, and

                  uffling of their feathers, and presently make them vp, and if you haue any Ruster hoods, you shall put them on their heads, for it will keepe them the quieter, and make them lesse subiect to struggle or hurt themselues.
               For the manner and forme of Mayling The manner of Mayling Hawkes. of your Hawkes, it is thus to bee done; you shall take a handkercher, or any square piece of Linnen cloth, Canuas, or the like, and then knit the two ends of any one side together in such straite and close manner that the Hawke may onely thrust her head thorow it and no more, and that the pynions of the wings may rest vpon the noosse, and stay the body from going thorow; then you shall draw the rest of the handkercher all ouer the Hawkes body, and folding it close together about her traine, wrap it in such sort

fast about the body of the Hawke that she may in no wise stirre or moue any feather about her; and if herein you obserue to draw out the Hawkes legges, so as she may not pull them vp, or gather them closse to her body, it will be more easie for the Hawke, and you shall carry her with a great deale lesse danger.
               There is another manner of Mayling T
                        •…
                     etrussing of Hawkes. of Hawkes, and that is to take a soft flatte string of leather, (or any other gentle stuffe, which will neither pinch much, nor yet yeld much) & this string you shal put down between the pinion of the wing & the hawkes body as low as you can; and then bringiug it about the outward part of the wing draw the two ends together, & knit them of a reasonable straitnes, so as the hawke may by no meanes moue or stir any part of her wing, which dōne you shall do like to the other wing, so carry home your hawks, & then gently vnmaile or vntrusse them as you shal findoccasion, for the lesse time your hawke lies mailde or trnst vp, the more wholesome it is for your hawks body, and the longer she lies maylde or trusst vp, the more apter shee is to receiue disease or lamenesse.
               
                  
And herein is also to bee vnderstood that this latter kind of Mayling of haukes (a trussing vp of the wings) is nothing neare so good as the first Mayling with the handkercher, nor carrieth a Hawke so easily nor yet so free from danger, becanse it not onely pincheth the wings and maketh the pinions sore and tender, but also, a little bruseth the fethers, which being but newly quilled are not come to their full strength and hardnesse, and if any of them chance to be in bloud (as all Hawkes (though of one Ayrie) yet some not at one instant) then it is great odds but this trussing them either breaketh or bruseth them in their bloud, whereby those feathers are made vnseruiceable, for all that yeare following.
               There bee some that when they take The Seeling of Hawkes. these young Hawkes, doe neither Mayle them nor Trusse them, but onely Seele them after this manner.
               They take a Needle with a square point (which we commonly call a Glouers Needle) being fine, smale and much worne, and put in it a Crymson silke, then put the Needle betweene the Hawkes eye, and the neather lidde of the eye, and

so drawe the silke thorow it, and then bring it crosse ouer the Hawkes heade, and there taking the Needle from the Silke, bring the two endes of the same ouer the toppe of the Hawkes head, and so drawing both the nether liddes close ouer the eyes, knit them with a fast knott vpon the crowne of the Hawkes heade, and so carry her either in your handkercher, or vpon your hand, at your pleasure.
               But this manner of Seeling of hawkes Discommodities in Seeling of Hawkes. is both troublesome, painefull, and dangerous to the hawke, and except the man haue a steedy hand and a cunning eye that doth it, hee may not onely endammage the putting out of the Hawkes eye with the point of the Needle; but also by any little ouer straining of the silke, teare out the skinne of the lydde, and thereby both cause a foule blemish and sometimes blindnesse as is continually seene in dayly experience.
               To helpe then this discommodity of Helpe for the discom modities. Seeling; If you haue neither skill to Mayle your Hawke, nor to trusse your Hawke (rather then you shall Seele her) you shall take a plaine Ruffter hood

which some call the first hood) being made of soft and gentle leather, large and easie for the head, and put it vpon her, and so carry the Hawke home.
               The next manner of taking of hawkes Taking Hawkes in their Soreage. (according to their seasons) is to take them in their sorage, which is indeede from that time they haue preyed for themselues and are masters of their owne strengthes and courages, being able to make a true choise of their prey, and to conquer it; vntil the first whole yeare be fully expired, and that they haue mewed and exchanged either all, or at least, most part of their first feathers, after which time of the second coat, they are no more called Sore-hawkes, (or hawkes in their soreage) but entermewers, (or hawkes of the second Coat) and they are most easily to be distinguished from the first, for the feathers of the second coat are a little more palish blew, and not so blacke as are those of the first, and euery time that she changeth, her coate is paler and paler till she come to bee called a white Hawke, which you shal so much the easilier distinguish, if you obserue the differences of her feathers, for no hawk meweth

so entirely but she leaueth euer some feather of the former yeare vnmewed, & those are so easily to be distinguished one from an other, that any diligent obseruation you shall be euer able to knowe of what yeare or age your hawke is. Now to proceed to the maner of taking these hawks in their sorage, or after they preyed for themselues, you shall (being perfit in the knowledge of the ayrie for that is euer first to be intended) most diligently marke their morning and euening going forth to find out their prey, and how and where they prey, as also the manner of their returning home, & where they take their stand (that is, on what brāches of the tree they do most vsually sit) for hawkes are the constantest of all birds to the places wherunto they inure & woont themselues, neither will as others doe sit one while in one place & another while on an other. Therfore when you are acquainted with their hours of going out & the places wher they sit at their returne, you shal then take aduantage of her going out, & when shee is absent about her prey, you shal climb the tree wher her stand is & in a strait place through which necessarily

she must passe, you shall take a paire of those Nettes, which Faulkoners commonly doe call Vrines, or Vrnes, being not much different in shape from the nets formerly described for the Branchers only they are much, larger and more hollow in compasse, and indeede are to bee bought almost of any Barbar, or Nettemakers which dwell in the Wood Countries; and they must be of strong twisted browne thride, and dyed either Blewe or Greene, as aforesaid, with a reasonable large mashe, for that sooner entangleth and holdeth the faster.
               These Vrines you shall place in euery Placing of the Vrines seuerall passage, and in sundry Trees round the stand which the Hawkes vsethso as she may come no way to the stande without danger of the Nettes, into which if at any time she strik, she is presently taken, and then to be disposed as was formerly described.
               Now because you may not in any wise suffer the Hawke to hang too long in the Nette for feare of bruising and hurting her selfe, you shall as soone as your Vrines are placed, take vp some secret and vnseene place, where you may

lye and watch the comming of the hauke and assoone as you see her strike or be intangled, presently (with as conuenient speed as you can, and not doeing any hurt to your other sport) you shall assend vp to the tree, and take downe the hauke and mayle, trusse or hood her as you shal finde occasion.
               Now if by the vncertainetie of the Taking with stales Hawkes comming home, or the opennes and liberty of the passages which these young Hawkes haue, you finde that this manner of worke auaileth not, you shall then rise two howres at the least before day, and come as neere to the Hawkes stand (or resting place) as you can possibly get (without giuing of any affright or amazement to the young Hawkes) and ascending vp into such trees as you see doth most face those places where the Hawkes sit, and are so plaine in their viewes that they cannot rise without beholding them, and in such trees amongst the most conuenient branches you shall pitch and place your Vrines, and vnder the guard of them you shall fixe Stales of such Birdes, either great or little, as you see the Hawke dayly preyeth vpon,

and these Stales you tye at such a conuenient liberty, that they may flutter with their wings, and flye a little vp and down about the Nette, yet by no meanes without the guard of the Nettes, nor so as the Hawke may not in any wise come vnto them, or offer to stricke at them without the certaine danger of the Nettes.
               And hauing thus placst your Nets round about the stande in euery conuenient place, you shall then descend and lodge your selfe in some secret place where you may lye and watch what issue doth follow of your businesse; Then you shall see that assoone as the day openeth, and the Hawke beginneth to rouse her selfe vpon her stand, and to gaze and looke about her (as it is the nature and manner of euery Hawke) and hath also cast vp her casting of plumadge, or feathers which shee had receiued into her body the day and night before, and is then sharpe, eager, and hungry, as of necessitie and likelyhood shee must needes be. Then will shee no sooner espie your Stales, but with all speed possible she will flye vnto them, a

                  d stricking at them with great eagernesse (as her hunger

will compell her) shee will presently be intangled in the Neetes, so as you may take her at your pleasure; and thus in one morning with a little diligence and temperance, in one morning you may take the whole Ayerie; But if out of too much rashnesse and hastinesse, or for the couetousnesse to bee Master of one Hawke you rise vp to soone, and shewe your selfe, whereby the rest of the Hawkes doe take affright or dismay; presently those Hawkes vntaken will mout and flye away, and so all the rest of your hope is vtterly lost for that day, and you must begin againe and be more ad

               There bee some that for the taking of Taking with Lime diuersly. these Sore-hawkes doe vse Lime-roddes, or a little small Lime bushe artificially made of fine twigges fixt so gently into a little socket of woode made like a handle, that assoone as any thing toucheth or striketh them they presently depart from the socket and clappe close to the thing that toucheth them, whereby they are intangled, these little bushes are artificially placed about the stand wher the hauk vseth to sit, cōpassing

it so about that the Hawke cannot come to the same, whether with winges opened or wings close, but she must of necessitie touch the points of the roddes, (for more then the points must not come neere the stand, or appeare, aboue it for feare of giuing affright) and then assoone as the points are touched, (leauing the socket) they clap vnder the Hawkes wings and so entangle her.
               As for the Lime-roddes which are to be vsed single by themselues, they must be fixed to the neerest branches to the stand, comming sloapewise so neere vnto the stand that the Hawke cannot come in, or settle her selfe vpon the same, but must of force touch some one point or other of them, which no sooner shall be touched, but presently it must forsake the place where it was fixt and clap vnto the Hawke; which assooue as shee feeleth, and beginneth to be angry, and to beate or strugle with her wings, then instantly the rest clap about her, and altogether intangle her.
               And here is i
                     •…
                   to bee noted that these Lime-rods must not be onely placed in and about the Stand, or that particular

place where the Hawke most vsually sitteth, but also in and about all passages and places of likelihood through which the Hawke goeth, or flyeth when shee comes to the stand; yet in such secret & close maner and so sheltered with leaues, and other branches, that the Hawke may by no meanes discerne or distinguish them from the naturall spraies or twiggs of the tree. And here is further to be noted that these single Lime-twigs or Limerodds may be of a good size or length, as a foot, or a foot and a halfe, and Limed either halfe or three parts, as occasion shall serue, yet the smaller and finer that these roddes are the better they are, and doe much sooner catch and more safely entangle. But for those that are to bee vsed Bush-wife in the wooden sockets or handles, containing some a dozen, and some sixteene rods in a cluster, yet so as one may not touch another; these must be as small as small may be, as not aboue sixe inches at the most, and limed about foure inches and no more, two inches being left cleane and vnlymed: that is to say, halfe an inche which must stand in the socket; and also an inche and a

halfe aboue the Socket, which is preserued for the Man to handle and touch, when either hee putteth the Roddes into the Socket, or taketh them out of the Socket.
               Now for the manner of making of The making of the little Lime bus
                        •…
                     e. this little Lime-Bush with the Socket, it is two wayes to be framed, that is to say, if the Socket be round and thicke and of a large compasse, whereby it is to be fixt into the Stand, and nothing but the rods to appeare aboue, then must all the holes (in which the Lime-Rods must stand) be made aboue sloape-wise all of one iust height and iust depth, and the Rods of one true and equall length without difference.
               But if the Socket must bee small and slender whereby it cannot containe aboue a hole or two on the toppe of the Socket, and that it is to be fixt amongst the branches as a naturall branch, or a maine spray of the Tree, then must the holes be made sloapewise downe all the length of the Socket, and in such wise as you see twiges grow, that is to say not one iust oposite to another, but one in the mid part or middle space betweene

two, as by cutting of any naturall bushie branch whatsoeuer, you may easily perceiue.
               And in this case you shall not haue your Roddes all of one entire length, but the vppermost must bee the shortest, (as about the scantling before mentioned of sixe Inches) and then the next longer by so much more as there is difference betweene the holes, and so as the toppes may meete, and bee of an equall height, the next longer then that, so as it may also meete in an euen height with the first; and so consequently euery one longer then other, yet so as none at the toppe may be longer or shorter then the first, but all meete of one equall height and make the Bushe of one entire and euen proportion.
               Nowe although this manner of taking Discommodities of taking with lyme. with Lyme is very safe and certaine and may bee doue with more ease and lesse trouble then any of the former, yet is it nothing so good nor so neate: First, in respect it fouleth the feathers and gleweth them together, whereby the hawke is depriued the perfit vse of them, for the Bird-lyme (whose cleauing

and sticking nature almost no man is so Ignoraut as not to vnderstand) when it is gotten vpon the feathers, doth so stick & felter vpon the same, that it is almost in no wise to be taken away, but doth so disable the Hawke, that I haue seene many in mine owne experience, that albeit they did try many experiments, yet could they neuer make their Hawkes (once limed) cleane againe, till those feathers were mewed & new came in their place; Secondly it fouleth and disableth not the ordinary and vselesse feathers (as the plumage on the breast, or the small feathers on the backe, but the maine and principall feathers belonging to the winges, and without which a Hawke cannot at all mooue, or beare her selfe in the Ayre.
               And lastly it is of such a melting and loose Nature, that albe it touch or hurt but a feather or two at the first; yet with strugling and striuing, or much rubing and handling of the Lime, or seeking to wash away the Lime with things not fit for that purpose, it presently spreadeth farther and farther, so that where there was but a few feathers infected, presently

you shall haue the whole Hawkes body, and hardly any feather free from the anoyance of the Lime.
               Now in asmuch as the manner of takeing Remedies against Lime. of Hawkes is most common, (because most easie) both among Fowlers, and Faulconers; and that indeed oulde Hawkes are very hard or sildome gotton without the helpe of Lime, as well in respect oftheir Naturall winge, and skill to apprehend and find out what they imagine may hurte them, as also in respect of their vigilance and care to flye and eschew all manner of affrightes, and shewes which shall interpose and happen betweene them and the places which they haue chosen for their haunts: And because that euery man is not a taker of Hawkes, but may and doth many times buy his Hawke from the Fowler or other Land-taker, and that indeede the Fowler or Land-takers, may and doe happen very many times light of excellent principall choyce Hawkes, both Haggards and others, that therfore this offence of Lime may neither hinder you of a good Iewell when it is tendered you. nor abate from the Fowler any part of

the iust reward and merrite which is due to his labour, as also that ignorance in this case may not hinder you of a full yeares sport, (as many times it doth when this mischance hapneth) but that you may clense and make cleane your Hawke; presently as soone as you see this pollution and foulnesse, you shal first obserue to take off your Lime-rods with your wette hands, (hauing for that purpose euer water in readinesse) so gently and easily as may be, not rowling (as some doe) the Lime-rods vp and downe and so spreading them farther, but (lifting them vpright and putting a white paper betweene the Lime-rodd and the feathers) deuide them gently without any further anoyance, and betweene euery feather and another that is touched with the Lime, (as neere as you can) put a little piece of white paper, for this will both keepe the other feathers from further infection, and also sucke in the Lime and make it much apter and easier to be taken away, nor will it let the lime spred any whitt further then it was at the first applying, then hauing thus guarded all the rest of the feather, you may very well

mayle vp your Hawke (if shee be a wilde one) or otherwise put on a Rufter-hood, and so bring her home (but mayling is the better) when you haue brought her home, you shall vnmayle her; and first, take away one paper (beginning with the principalest feathers) and then hauing very fine clarified Capons Grease, or at least Goose-grease, annoint the lymed feather very well and thicke therewith, then take of the finest hower glasse sand and scatter it as thicke as you can vpon the oyntment; which done goe to another infected feather and doe as much, and so consequently to as many feathers as you can well handle at one time, and then hauing warme water ready, bathe the infected feathers (thus drest as aforesaid) in the same, and then gently rubbing and chafing the Lymed feathers betweene your fingers, working off the Lyme, which you shall finde will come away in thicke little rough roules so fast as you can wish or desire it. But if it so happen that you cannot come to bathe these feathers in the warme water, then (hauing annointed them as aforefaide, and pounvst on the sand) you shall take a

piece of spundge, and dipping it in the warme water, bath the feathers therwith and then working them betweene your fingers you may easily bring away the Lyme as aforesaid, and make your hauke as cleare as she ewas before her taking, obseruing euer and anone when the Lime sticketh & commeth not away so roundly and quickly as you would haue it, then presently to powre on more of the sand, and so to continue, till the Hawk
                     •…
                   be thorowly clensed.
               Now there is another maner of taking Taking Hawkes with the Lanthorne of theseyoung Hawkes, and indeede no more generally for them then for other elder hawkes of what nature or quallity soeuer they be, so they take their stands either on Trees, Rockes, Towers, or any place aloft which is assailable, and where a man may climbe without danger or eminent perill, and especially this maner of taking is excellent for the regaining of all such Hawkes as shall happen to breake out of the Mewe, where hauing bin long kept and without familiaritie with the man (more then the receiuing of their foode) they are becomed almost vterly wild and Haggard againe.
               
                  
And also for all such hawkes as shall happen to escape or break away before they be reclaimed or made to know the man and obey his voyce, or for any other wilde hawke as hath been before spoken. Any of which chaunces or mischaunces The Art how to follow a hawk fledde. when they shall happen vnto you, you must first diligently pursue and follow the Hawke both by inquisition and Art: By inquisition, as by enquiring amongst Field-keepers, Shepheards, Heardsmen, and the like, if they haue seene or heard of a Hawke, and by Art in taking aduantage of the wind and weather, for if there blow any stiffe or loud gale of wind then commonly, a Hawke will flye downe the winde, but if the Ayre be milde, gentle, and pleasant, then now and then shee will put vp into the winde. Also you must haue a very diligent eye to note in your pursuit if you see any Checke arise, whether they be Crowes, Pydgions, Rauens, or any other birds, for it is tenne to one that there you shall be sure to finde your Hawke.
               Now that you may know what a Check What a Checke of any Fowle is, you shall vnderstand that whensoeuer you see any flockes or multitudes

of Crowes, Pidgions, Rauens or the like, to raise vp and gather together in one place & flye about and about in the same place making a noyse, or shewing much rouble and vexation, one while feeing, a nother while mounting, somtimes stoopeing, and sometimes rainging & wheelin and euery motion shewing either anger, feare, or amazement, according to the nature of the Fowle which are troubled, then you shall know that such an obiect is called a checke, and that these Fowle (what soeuer they be) thus troubled are either pursued by some other Fowle of pray that is their enemie, or else haue found some affright or amazement which causeth them thus to flye vp and down
                     •…
                   and wonder: so that presently when you perceiue any such checke you must make into it and behould the reason therof; and againe as you haue an eye and care to respect this matter of checke and the other obseruations before specefied, so also if your hauk be a long wingd hauke and altogether traynd vp at the Riuer, and that the time of the yeare and season is fit for that purpose then you must haue a diligent regard to looke downe to the

valles and lower grounds, especially in the morning & euenings, & at such times as are fite for pray, and there you must beate alonge the Riuer side, and about al blanke or standing waters as are plashes, pittes, quarries, or any other place where either Ducke, Mallard, Shell-fowle, or Greene-fowle haue any haunt, and it is greate odds but in some one of th
                     •…
                  se places and at these times and seasons, you shall finde your Hawke, but if it be not a long-wingd Hawke, but a short-wingd Hawke, as a Goshawke, Tercell or the like, then you shall make your search about Woodes, Groues, plumps of Trees, and such like places where Birdes greate or little doe resorte, as also about mens Houses, Barnes, backe-yardes, Pullenhouses, and such places where Pullen doe resort and vse to feede, for Gos
                        •…
                     wkes and such like, especially those which are called Poulterers doe euer most frequent those places, and will euer for the most parte take there stands either in high Trees, or on the topps of vnfrequented Houses, or on the toppe of some other high stakes, or Houells neare adioyning to such places.
               
                  
Now when by this atificiall search and inquirie you haue fonnd your Hawke, you shall then with all care and diligence watch and pursue her from place to place till you bring her to the euening or night stand, which will be about the closing or setting of the Sunne, (for it is to be presupposed, that this Hawke is vtterly ramadge and wilde, and not to bee taken by any Call or Luer:) when you haue therefore brought her to the stand, and see her safely and constantly setled, which you shall know by the rousing of her selfe and shaking of her feathers, as also by her feaking, pruning, and such like delights, which shee will take in her selfe after she is constantly setled, (for before you shall see no such motion come from her) then you may be bould to depart and leaue her, for without some extraordinarie affright, nothing will moue her till the next morning; then hauing prouided all things, fit for your purpose, both for clyming vnto her, as also for the matter and manner of her taking, you shall then in the dead of the night, and when it is at the vttermost darkenesse, (for no night can bee too darke for this

purpose) come to the stand and hauing with you a darke Lanthorne (which is that which sheweth the light at one side, and by the turning of your hand may be extinguished and wholly darke at your pleasure) you shall turne the light of the the Lanthorne iust before your face, and as directly against the hawke as you cau deuice, to carrie it, and so with as little noise as as you can possible make, you shall clymbe vp to the Hawke, obseruing euer to carry the Lanthorne so iust before your face, that your Hawke may in no wise perceiue your face, for the least blinke thereof may affright her, but being well guarded by the light of the candle, and the darkenesse of the night, you are safe enough, and may by this meanes come euen to the very branch, or certain place whereon shee sitteth, vnto which assoone as you are arriued and that the Hawke is within the compasse of your reach, you shall then very 
                     〈◊〉
                   artificially steale vp your other hand in which the Lanthorne is not, and with it take her fast by the legges, thrusting your great singer betweene her legges, and your forefinger on the outside of one legge,

and your middle finger and little finger on the out-side of the other legge, and so hold her that shee can neither stirre nor moue; then hauing a hooke or some other crooked engine at your side whereby to fasten your Lanthorne, presently clap the Hawke to the contrary side with one hand and stay the batting of her wings with the other, and then hauing your handkerchife or some other linnen cloth in a readinesse, presently mayle the Hawke and so bring her downe from the stand and carry her home.
               This is a certaine and most infallible way for the taking of any of those wilde Hawkes before mentioned, yet if in this worke you observe to couer your face with a close hood either, of greene or blew collour leauing onely two loope holes for your eies and the rest of your face concealed, your worke will be more easie, and you shall come to your prey with a great deale lesse suspition, for nothing is so affrightfull in this case as the face of the man only.
               And albe the glimmering or light of the candle mixt with the darknesse of the

night is a guard sufficient, because the flame of the candle is the onely obiect which taketh vp the Hawkes eye, yet neuerthelesse in as much as your hand may now and then chance sometime to fayle in the carriage of the Lanthorne, and partly by looking for your right way, and to auoide daunger, and partly to make sure your prey, so that you may neither come too rashly vpon her, nor yet goe too farre away or wide on either hand, you may now and then let your Lanthorne slip from before your face to the hazard and losse of all your labour, therefore it is most expedient that you haue this hood before spoken of to couer and conceale your face, and then you shall not neede to feare, but your worke will prosper and goe on according to your wish, and in the fulnesse of perfection.
               Now there is another wilde Hawke Of the old wild Haggard. (which is of a great deale more price and value then any of these which we haue formerly written of) which will hardly or neuer bee taken with any of these waies, meanes, deuices, or engines

before recited, because she is a Hawke of more age, circumspection and cunning and that is the Haggard Faulcon gentil, and now and then (though seldome) the Gerfaulcon or the Gerkin.
               
               These Hawkes come into this Land The comming of the wild Haggard. (or any other of like clymat or temperature) in the beginning of Winter, and (according to the opinions of the best Faulconers and Fowlers) to come in by the pursuing of Wild-foule (at that season of the yeare) from other more colder Nations, where the waters and riuers are closed vp and couered with ice, so as they can neither finde reliefe nor pleasure, nor any thing to sustaine them; and heere commonly they doe continue from October to March (if the season of the yeare doe fall out any thing wet) but after that time they depart againe and will not stay by any meanes; whence it comes that your skilfullest Faulconers will not (after March is spent, and sometimes before it be gone) in any wise let their Haggards flie either at the Ryuer or at any other prey (as the Hearne or the like) for by a very naturall instinct and mouing of their owne bloods at that

time of the yeare, they are forced vpon euery toy or conceit to flie away, nor will turne tayle againe, till they come into those colder Regions from which before they departed; where finding the riuers beginning to open, and all sorts of foule to come in and resort, there she presently meeteth with her Tercel, where coopling and ingendring, they bring forth their ayries together vpon the rocks, clyffes, and other high places bordering neere the Sea side.
               Now when the Haggard (whether it The haunts of Haggards. be Tercel or Faulcon) is comed into this Kingdome, you shall vnderstand that their haunts are euer for the most part both vpon great and small riuers which runne through low and lardge leuelled valleies or plaines, where there is euer some drie ground whereon to land her prey when she hath taken it, and where all kinde of the middle sort of foule doe resort, as Duck, Mallard, Tayle, Widgeon, Shel-foule and Greene-foule; and vp and downe these riuers she will beate and flie at an extraordinarie high pitch, so that if any foule happen either vpon affright or otherwise to rise vp; or if any

foule happen to come in vnto that riuer, th
                     •…
                  n be sure one of them is euer her owne, for her art and skill is so great that it is hard for any foule to escape her.
               As they doe haunt thus vpon the riuers and mouing streames, so also they will haunt vpon the plashes and blanke waters; in the open seasons, and when they are not closed and bound vp with ice, and also vpon pits and quarries where stone hath beene digged, and vpon small rundles or little narrow and shallow streames when any Foule vse but to frequent and lye vpon the same.
               Now heere is a principall thing to To know the good Hawke from the bad. be obserued, that in searching the haunts of these Haggards, such Haggards as you shall finde to prey vpon the great, lardge and strong waters, whether they be riuers or blanke waters, that you shall account euer those Hawkes to bee the best, as in that greatnesse and strength of conquest to be euer most valiant, most cunning and nimble and the highest fliers, and such Hawkes as shall prey vpon little pits, small plashes, or narrow rundels

and small riuellets, that those are the weaker Hawkes, lesse skilfull, and lesse valiant.
               Now when you haue either heard of, How to take these Haggards. or shall by your owne especiall obseruation see the comming in of any of these Hawks and from the knowledge of their owne worth and value shall be desirous to make your selfe owner and possessor of so gentlemanly and rich a treasure, you shal first then early in the morning by the spring of day rise vp to watch her haunt, and as neere as you can see her manner of preying (not so much for any thing that is auaileable therein to the taking of the Hawke, as to haue a true knowledge of her worth and excellencie) when you haue seene her take her prey and feede, you shall then see her rouse her selfe and goe to her place of reioycing, where after she hath fea
                     •…
                  t and trimmed her selfe, and pruned some of her feathers, you shall then watch her vnto day stand, which is neuer very farre from the place where she preyeth, and is most commonly either vpon some dead remoate raile or pale, or some old stake or poale set vp for cattell to rubbe

themselues against in the Sommer season, or else vpon the withered trunke or armes of some old, dead and decayed tree; To which stand when you haue watcht her, and see her safely and constantly setled; you may then depart away about any of your other businesse, for she will not begin to stirre (from that place) till it be towards euening, which commonly is betweene three and foure of the clocke in the after noone; Now about three quarters of an houre, or halfe an houre (at the least) before that time you shall come forth againe, and watch her as before vnto her euening prey, and so from thence to her night stand; which commonly will be either vpon some medow-stake, mearestone, or else some of the other things before rehearsed: Now when you haue thus found out both her day stand and her night stand, to which these Hawkes are wonderfull constant, you shall then the next morning come to the day stand and hauing noted the arme or the braunch whereon she most vsually sitteth: you shall mount vp to the place and hauing very fine small long lyme rods well lymed

with the best lyme, you shall of them make a cradle, that is, you shall crosewise The Placing of the Cradle. place your lymerods on the branch or stake on penthouse wise hanging ouer another, that when the Hawke commeth in with her spread wings to light vpon the stand, that then as she gathereth in her wings together, she may so draw in the lymerods vnder her wings, and by that meanes be intangled and taken, and these lymerods you shall place so yare and nimble to rise and fall about the Hawke, that vpon the least touch of any feather they may presently in an instant cleaue vnto her, and one lymerod must depend and by a small string be so fastened vnto another. that when the Hawke toucheth but one rod, presently in an instant all the rest may suddenly clap about her.
               Now that I stand not more seriously and in larger tearmes to discribe this Cradle, the true manner figure and proportion, I hold it a matter halfe needlesse because it is a thing so exceeding frequent amongst all sorts of Faulconers and Foulers, that hardly one man in ten if he haue any skill or delight that way)

but can shew you how to performe it, Besides, these things which consist onely in action and not in relation, are so hard to be set downe in words (especially that an ignorant vnderstander may get profit thereby, multiplicitie of words confounding memory, and scarcitie of words wanting satisfaction) that I had rather referre the diligent learner to a Q
                        •…
                     ere amongst the skilfull Foulers, then by an animation of vnperfect words, make him doe any thing contrary to art and good order: let it suffice then that this Cradle is nothing else then a rowe or circle of lyme-twigges which are fastned one to another with an entire thrid, and placed so artificially about the stand that the Hawke may by no meanes come to seate her selfe vpon the same, without the danger of touching some one of them; which one touched, doth presently draw all the rest after it and by that means the Hawke is taken.
               When you haue thus placed your cradle on the day stand, you shall then goe to the night stand and there doe as much, placing your cradle in the same manner as was before shewed; and this must be

done during the time that the Hawke is vpon her day Stand, which performed, you shal then go againe to the day stand to see what effect your worke hath taken and if you finde that the Cradle is either too largewhereby the Hawke commeth into her Stand without touching it, or too lowe & narrow, that all her feathers are so high aboue it that any of them can touch it; then you shall vpon her first departure reforme all those errours, and out of the true Iudgement of your eye, make it so fite that by no meanes possibly she may escape the second time, and then fourthwith hauing the true scantling of the first Cradle, make the second (which is that vpon the Night-Stand) sutable and answerable in all poynts to the former, and so either in one or the other, you cannot chuse but accomplish your purpose, which assoone as you haue attained, you shall fourthwith take the Hawke and draw off the Lime-rods in such sorte as hath beene before shewed, then Mayle her vp, bringe her home, clense away the Lime, and then man and order her according to the arte of a skilfull Faulconer: and so keep
                     •…
                   her either

for vse or sale, as you shall finde occasion or the necessitie of you affaires requireth.
               There be other Fowlers which vse to take these kind of Hawkes) which goe a neerer way to worke (yet nothing more sure then this, or certaine) and that is they will find out their hauntes, some times by the Check and trouble of foule, which rising from the water will presently Enewe and turne backe againe to the Riuer as not daring to goe forward in their passage, or by the comming in of Fowle, and presently seeing them wheele about and turne backe againe as fast as wing can beare them, and sometimes by seeing the bald Buzzard, Ringtaile, or other such like cowardly byrdes of pr

                  y, hanging and watching about the Riuers, for it is the nature of them, assoone as they see the Haggard, to follow, watch and alloofe to pursue him, and then when the Haggard hath taken his prey and fedde thereon at his pleasure, assoone as she forsakes it and is gone away, presently this cowardly byrde ceazeth on the remainder and taketh such leauings as the Haggard had left behinde her, so that

you cannot haue a better guide vnto the haunt of a Haggard then one of these Buzzards, for they will direct you at a haire to the place of their preying.
               Now therefore others which will not take this paines neather, but thinke it much to tedious, and therefore they will onely desire to informe themselues of the Hawkes stands, and they care for no further, whence it doth come that they wll labour about to search in the most likely places to finde out the stands, and when they come truely to the place indeede and where the stand is, they may perfectly knowe it by the Mutings and Slycings of the Hawke, which indeede differeth much from any other Fowle whatsoeuer, and these Mutings or Slyseyngs will be in great plenty both vpon the stand, and also round about the Stand.
               Now if it be the day Stand, then you How to know the Day-stand from the Nightstand. shall find about it nothing but Mutings, & Slyscing without any mixture of other matter; But if it be the night Stand, then you shall finde lying amongst the mutings many and diuers castings of feathers, plumage and the like, which you

may know to belong to a Hawke, and no other Fowle, by the bignesse, proportion and substance; For if it belong to a Faulcon it will bee almost as bigge as a reasonable Almond in the shell, fully as long and somewhat more ronnd, with both the endes alike of equall sharpenes, and for the substance it will bee all feathers and plumadge without any other mixture. Any of these characters, when you haue truely found, and haue

               Now forasmuch as this Haggard Faulcon Gentill and her Tercell which is the Male Hawke, are of so much prise and worthy estimation heere amongst vs, and that our Land affords them in the seasons before said in a reasonable plentie. I thought good in this figure following to represent vnto your view,

the true shape and Beauty of both these Hawkes, the Haggard-Faulcon and the Goshawke.

                  How to take diuers sortes of Land-Fowles, and Water-Fowle, with Baytes.
               
               
                  HAuing spoken thus of the generall taking of Land-Fowle of diuers and sundry natures, as also of the taking of sun dry other kinds of smal Birdes, great Birdes, Birdes of prey, and the like, for all such I haue shewed the Engines, Tooles, Instruments, and deuises which are to be applyed in those businesses; I will now descend to another generall way o

                   taking diuers kindes of Land-fowle, and diuers kinde of Waterfowle also, without any kinde of engine or instrument at al but only with Battes, and inti

                   and sicke, so as at your pleasure you may

take them, and make your selfe master of what prey soeuer you shall be disposed to spend your time vpon, and although I cannot giue any singular commendations of these experyments, so farre fourth as they are applyed to the taking of any Fowle or Birds which are to be vsed for foode, because they are poysonous, and astonishing, and so may make the flesh which is so poluted and infected both dangerous & vnwholesome, yet whensoeuer at any time they are vsed for the destroying, killing, and consuming of rauenous and wicked Birdes, such as are Rauens, Kites, Buzzards, Carryon-Crowes and the like, any of which are not onely hurtfull to flockes and Foulds, by killing and destroying new yeand Lambes, sicke weake sheepe and the like but also are very offenciue to Conny-warrens, Parks and other places of Chase, by killing in great abundance many younge Rabites, pecking out of the eyes of young Faunes Kydes and the like, then is there no knowledge more beneficiall and excellent, or ought with greater violence to be pursued and followed in this busie and arteficiall pastime of Fowling, then this

manner of taking and destroying Birdes with these baytes and engines of foode, which are so much the more certaine and assured and effected with greater ease and lesse labour, by as much as the foode is feareful and affrightful then the engines, and that Birdes will follow it with lesse suspition and amazement, then either Nets, Limerods, Springes, S

                  rings, or any other Engine, that carieth a greater shew and presenteth affright in a more large and horrid manner.
               To speake then first of the destroying How to destroy Kites Rauens, Buzards, &c. of any of these wicked, rauenous and offensiue birdes; you shall first doe well to obserue their hauntes, and the places where they houer most for the gayning and compassing of their prey; and aboue all things you shal obserue the times and howres in which they are most sharp and eager for the getting of their prey, as namely, very earely in the morning as soone as they do vnpearch themselues & range about to get foode, as also in the eueniug a little before Sun-set, at which time likewise they rise from their day Stand, and do with as much painefulnesse hunt about & range to get food as in the

morning; and especially, if it be at that time of the yeare, when they haue young ones, then shall you not cast out any bait so fast as they will with greedinesse ceaze it, nay, and with that extraordinarie eagernesse, that they will not many times sticke to strike at it, when you hold it fast within your fingers.
               Hauing thus sorted your time & place couueniently, you shall take a prety quantitie of Nux-Vomica, and first dissolue it either in wine vineger, or wine lees, of which the lees of sweet wines are euer the best; or for want of them you may either take the lees of claret wine or white, then take the garbage or e
                     •…
                  
                  trailes of any fowle or bird whatsoeuer; as whether it be Chicken, Pullet, Ducke, Mallard, or any other foule that you haue occasion to kill either for dinner or supper, or for want of such garbage you may take the intrals (which is the small gutes and other such like reffuse stuffe) either of Piges, Rabites, or any thinge that you kill which is of like nature, and these intrals or garbage you shall all to besmeare and anoynt with the confection of Nux-Vomica, prepared as is before shewed,

and then cast fourth the garbage into such places where these rauenous Birdes doe haunt, and then lodge your selfe in some conuenient place, where you may watch the bayte thus prepared, and you shall see that it shall no sooner be ceazd vpon, and but a bitte or gobbett or two deuowred or swallowed downe, that then presently whatsoeuer hath so eaten it, will presently grow dissie and as it were dumbe, reeling & tumbling vp & downe, vntill it fall into dead sound, so that you may come and with your hand gather them vp.
               There be other Fowlers, which to Other waies to vse the former Bayte. worke the distruction of these kinde of rauenous Fowle, doe take little prettie bigge pieces of rawe leane flesh, as either Beefe, Mutton, Veale, or any other kind of Flesh, and doe make little secret holes in the, flesh, then take little pieces of Nux-Vomica, and put them into the flesh and so close the holes close together againe, and then cast out the baite into such places where these rauenous Fowle resort, and so watching it assoone as the bayte is ceazed and preyed vpon, presently it will worke the same effect as was

before spoken of, and you shall take your prey both certainely and quickly, nor neede you (if you please) to take them single, or one by one, but if you please to cast out many of these baites, you shall take many of them at one stooping, for you shall fee them so eager and busie striuing who first shall seaze the first bayte, that if you cast out twenty hardly will any one of them be found frustrate, but each will take the full effect, that either your labor or wish requireth.
               Now whereas some doe vse to stake Of fastning Baits to the Ground. downe these baytes, and fasten them so to the Ground that they may not be taken away, but that the Fowle shall bee forced to prey vpon them in the places where they lye, that is nothing neare so good as to let them lye loofe, and so as they may trusse them and carry them away at their pleasure, for it is the nature of these rauenous Creatures to snatch and catch at their preyes, and euer to trusse it and carry it away with them, which when at any time they finde to be fastned, and that it will not rise and goe with them, presently they beginne to doubt, and suspect that some mischiefe

lyes hidden therein, and you shall see them presently forsake it, & then mounting vpon their traynes, flye whueing into the Ayre, nor will they euer after offer to strike at it or come neere it, for it is 
                     •…
                  o be vnderstood that these rauenous Kytes, as they are fearefull and cowardly out of their owne natures, so are they likewise infinitly iealous and suspicious, and apt to catch at any apprehension which shall be offered, either of feare or danger, and what places soeuer they suspect, from them they presently flye, nor can any intisement whatsoeuer againe draw them within the compas of their former feare, and therefore to avoyde this suspition, let euer your Baytes lye loose vpon the ground, and so as they may easily be trust vp and borne away by the violence of any stooping.
               Now as you vse either the intrals 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Of carrion to be vsed for baites. garbage before spoken off, or else these smaller pieces of flesh, (of which we hau
                     •…
                   already sufficiently intreated) so you may vse any kinde of Carrion whatsoeuer, whether it be Horse-flesh, or Dogs-flesh, or any other kinde of flesh made carrion by any mischance whatsoeuer, and either

besmeare and daube it with this confecttion of Nux-Vomica dissolued as before saide, or else stope the gumme as beforesaide into the fleshie partes of the carrion, and questionles you shall then take of these rauenous creatures in infinite aboundance.
               Now if you haue a desire to take any Taking of other foule with baits. other Land-fowle with these baites, as House-doues, Stocke-doues, Rookes, Chaughes, or any other, then you shall take Wheate, Barley, Fetches, Tares or other pulsse, and boyle them very well with good store of Nux-vomica in ordinary running water, and when they are almost boyled dry, and as it were ready to burst, then you shall take it from off the fire, and set it by, and couer it till it bee thorowly colde, and that the Graine hath suckte vp and drunke in all the moysture; which done, take this Graine thus boyled, and in the seuerall hauntes where any of these kinde of Fowle frequent, which you would haue taken, scatter and strew it as thicke as you can possibly deuise, and bee you then well assured of it, that as many of them as shall chance or happen but to

take or eate of the same, presently they shall fall downe in a dead swound, and you shall come and gather them vp at your pleasure, for their dissinesse and drunkennesse comes sodenly and swiftly vpon them, that they shall haue no time or leasure to slecke away or to hide themselues, but that you may take and gather them vp, and so carry them whether soeuer you shalbe disposed.
               As thus you take these greater kind of Taking of small birds with Baytes. Land-Fowle, so you may also take all manner of other smaller Land-Fowle, of what nature or qualitie soeuer they be whether of the lesser, midle kinde, as are the Thrushes, Blacke-birds, Fell-fares, Iay

                   your Mustard-seede, for though it be not so pleasant as any of the other seedes, not yet so apt to intise Byrds to feed vpon it, yet when it is thus vsed and boyld, it then

doth take more surer and certaine then any of the other seedes whatsoeuer, both by reason of the naturall sharpenesse and fume which it carryeth, and sends vp to the braine to amaze and intosticate it, as also the strength of the other mixture, which ioyning with the former naturall violence, doth so vtterly take away all sence and motion, that not any thing is left to the poore Bird but a most deadly slumber.
               There be other Fowlers which insteed Other Baites. of the Nux-Vomica doe only take the lees of wine, (and the sharper & quicker such lees are, the better they are and the better effect doth proceede from their vse,) and in these lees of wines, they doe boyle any or al of their graynes, as wheat barley, fetches, or any other pulse, as also any or al of the seedes formerly rehersed, and doe strew and scatter them in the haunts where the foule or Byrdes doe vsually vse to haunt which you would take, and it is altogether as good and as fully effectuall as the Nux-Vomica is, and is a greate deale more neate and more wholesome, and far better then any other, for not being poysonous or infectit

               Now in the making of this confection neede you to stand too strickly or seuearely on the boyling of it, for if you haue not euery thing answerable to your purpose, if you onely steepe and infusse your graines or seeds in the lees of wine, it will be fully as effectual, and without any boyling at all will doe euery way as much as can be desired herein, onely it must then have a longer time to stand and infuse, so that the Graynes or seedes may drinke in the Lees, and be as it were ready to burst before you make any certaine vse of them.

                   say, the olde, the young, and altogether,

the old Cocke, the old Henne, and all their poots as they flecke and runne together in the thicke & obscure woods, or particularly when you take none but the ould Phesants, or such young Pheasants as are comed to the age of coopling and payring, so as you can haue no hope with your Nettes to strike at more then one Pheasant or two at the most at one instant or fixed time, for these kinde of Byrdes are of a melancholie, sadde and sullen disposition, and after once they bee coopled and payred together, doe no more keepe in flockes, or companies together, but liue seperated and assunder from other payres.
               When therefore you shall intend to The generall taking Phesants with Nets. put in practise this generall way of taking of Pheasants with Nettes, which (as before I saide) is to take the whole Eie of Pheasants both younge and old, and altogether without any reseruation, you shall then first of all learn
                     •…
                   to know the hauntes of Pheasantes and their vsuall and common places of breeding: otherwise doe what you can, your worke will be frustrate, and your labour spent in vaine.
               
                  
The hauntes then wherein Pheasantes 
                  Haunts of Phesants. naturally doe abide and breede are not in open and plaine Fieldes, (for their feares are so great, and their cowardlynesse so much that they dare not liue without couert or shelter) nor yet vnder the couert of Corne Fieldes; lowe shrubbes or bushes, neither yet in tall ould high Woods where euery Tree may fitly be imployed for Timber.
               But in thicke young Coppses well growne and ready for ordinary saile of small bush wood, Poales and the like, hauing bin diuers yeares reserued from the haunts of Cattell of all kindes, and from the tracing and pathes of mens feete: by reason of which solitarynesse and safenesse, the Pheasant takes great delighte herein, and will here aboue all other places breede and bringe forth her young ones, prouided that it be euer thicke growne and obscure, for if it be otherwise thinne, plaine and passable, she will n

                  ither breede nor come neere it, for she accounts the strength of her couert to Howe to finde the Eye of phesants. be her onely safetie.
               Now when you haue thus found out the hauntes and breeding places of the

                  Pheasant, then your next care is to finde out the Eie or brood of Pheasants, which you may doe sundry waies: as first, by your eye, in searching vp and down those hauntes, and viewing the bushes and trees and other obscure places, where for the most part they reside, and where you shall see them flecke and runne together in companies and heapes, as it were so many Chickins after the Henne; or else by rising earely in the Morning, or comming late in the Euening, and obseruing, how and when the old Cocke and Henne calleth to the young ones, and then how the young ones answers back vnto them againe, and so from that sound to direct your pathe as neere as you can to the place where they meete and gather together, lying there downe so close and secretly, that by no meanes you may be discerned; but that you may take a true obseruation how they meete, and how they lodge together, that from thence you may take a true knowledge, both how, where, which way and after what manner to pitch your Nettes, and with what aduantage both of winde and weather, for the gaining of you purpose.

But if it so fall out, that either by your owne want of knowledge in this kinde of practise, or through any other naturall imbecility either in your eye or eare, that neither of these wayes sort with your liking but seeme either too tedious or too difficulty.
               Then the most certainest, readiest and Of the ca

                      for the Phesant. easiest way for the finding out of this pleasure, is to haue an absolute, perfit, and naturall Pheasant-call, of which you must both by practise, and the instruction of the most skilfull in that Art, not onely learne all the seuerall notes and tunes which the Pheasant vseth, but also the seuerall and distinct applications of them, and the time when, and to what purpose she vseth them: as whether it be to cluck them together when shee would broode them; to call them to foode and meate when she hath found it, to chide them when they stragle too farre, and to keepe them out of danger, or to call them together and to make them reioyce and wanton about her, and to labour and seeke for their owne liuings; for any of all which shee hath a seuerall Note or Tune.
               
                  
All which when you haue learnt perfitly vpon your Call (of which Cal I shal speake a great deale more largely, in a particular Chapter hereafter) then you shall with your Call come into these haunts (before spoken off) at such houres as are most conuenient and sitting for the purpose: as namely, very earely in the morning, at which time they stragle and goe abroad to seeke out their foode, which commonly is for the most part before the Sunne rising, or else at furthest iust with the Sunnes rising, or else in the euening, somewhat before the Sunne beginne to set, at which time they doe the like also in straggling abroad to to seeke their foode.
               Now here is to be vnderstoode, that Tymes to vse the Call. albeit these two particular times of the day, as the earliest of the morning, and the latest of the euening are the best times of the day for the vse of the Call, and the finding out of the Pheasants whether it b

                  e by couples, or otherwise the whole Eye or company; yet neuerthethesse they are not the onely and alone times but you may as well vse the Call any time in the forenoone after the

Sunne rise, or any time in the afternoone before Sunne set, by altering and exchanging onely your note or tune, for as before Sunne rise, and at Sunne set, your note is to call them to their foode, or to giue them libertie to range; so your notes after Sunne rise, and before Sunne set, which are called the forenoone and afternoone notes, must be to clucke them together and to bring them to brood, as also to chide them for their straggling, and to put them in feare of some danger ensuing.
               As for the notes of reioycing or playing, they may bee vsed at any time, yet not so much for the discouery of these young Pheasants, as for the finding out of the old couples, when they are seperated and gone any distance one from another, whether it be for foode, through affright, or any other naturall or casuall occasion whatsomener, as euery hower hapneth to these fearefull and cowardly creatures.

Now assoone as you heare this answere or report backe againe, if you finde it come farre, and is but one single voyce and no more, then shall you as close and secretly as you can by degrees steale and creepe nearer and nearer vnto it, still euer and anon applying your Call, and you shall finde that the Phesant which answereth you, will also come nearrer and nearter vnto you, which assoone as you perceaue, you shall then obserue that the nearrer and nearrer yon meete, the lower and lower you make your Call to speake, for so you shall perceiue the Phesant her selfe to doe, and her in all poynts as neere as you can you must imitate, and thus doeing, in the end you shall get sight of the Phesant either on the ground, or on the pearch, that is vpon the bowes of some small Tree, as it were prying and seeking where she may finde you which assoone as you perceiue you shall then cease from calling a space, & then as secretly and as speedily as you can, see you spread your Nettes in the most conuenientest place you can finde betwixt your selfe and the Phesant, ouer the toppes of the lowest shrubbes and

bushes making one end of your Nette fast to the ground, and holding the other end by a longe line in your hand, by which when any thinge straineth it, you may draw the Nette close together or at least into a hollow con passe, which done you shall call againe, and then assoone as you perceaue the Pheasant to come iust vnder your Nette, then you shall rise vp and shew yourselfe, that by giueing the Pheasant an affright he may offer to mount, and so be presently taken and intangled within your Net.

till all the Pheasants be commed vnderneath your Nettes, and then boldly discouer your selfe and giue the affright to make them mount, which done take them out of the Netts, and dispose of them at your pleasure; and in this manner (before discouered) you may take either the single couples of olde Pheasants, if it be after the time of the yeare of their payring, or else the whole Eye of Pheasants, according to the time of breed, and the true and proper vse of the season.

the boughes and Bushes which shalbe round about you, which assoone as the poottes doe heare, they will presently runne in a heape together from it as fast as they can a little way, and then stand and listen, keepeing all as close together as can be (for then they dare not scatter) and then you shall giue another racke or two, at which they will runne againe as before, and thus by racking and dashing vpon the small trees and bushes, you shall driue them like so many sheepe before you, which way or whether you please, and if at any time they chaunce to goe that way which you would not haue them, then you shall crosse them, and making a noyse with racking, as it were in their faces, they will presently turne and goe as you would haue them, for against the noyse they dare not come for their liues, and thus you shall not cease driuing them by little and little till you haue brought them altogether in one flocke wholy into your Nets, into which they will run with all eagernesse till they be so intangled that not any one can escape, but will all rest at your mercy to dispose acording to your owne pleasure.
               
                  
Now in this dryuing of the Pheasant,

               The other obseruation is time and leasure in the worke, for this businesse hath no greater foe in the world then rashenesse and hastinesse, for any thing that is done to these fearfull creatures suddenly or rashely, breedeth offence and amazement, and euery amazement is to them an allarum of death, nor will their feares suffer them to argue or dispute with the obiect, but the very first apprehension is sufficient to make them all flye at an instant, nor will their feares let them stay till euery one haue beheld the thing which should suddenly affright and feare them: But if any one of them take a scare, it is a sufficent warning piece to set all the rest a packing, and therefore you cannot take too great leasure or care in this businesse, and when at any time you shall finde any staggering or (as it were) astonishment amongst them,

then presently cease, and lye as still as if that you were dead, till the feare be passed ouer and forgotten of them, and that you see they gaze no more about them, but gathering themselues together doe beginne to peepe and clucke one to another, and to ioy and reioyce amongst themselues; which when you doe perceiue, then you may beginneagaine, and fall to your worke as you did before, til it you haue brought to that fol period of your desires which your a

And as you haue a care thus to the placing, so you must also haue an especiall care to the number and to the true forme and proportion in which they stand, for when you either want of your number and doe not take vp what you set downe, or if you find that your proportion is in any place broken, then you may be very well assured that some are touched and fled, which you haue not found, and then you must hunt with your Spaniell (as hath beene before declared)

and so bring them foorth, for euery time you looke vpon your Lime-Roddes it is not necessary that you take them vp or count them, (for that were toyle to no purpose) but onely looke vpon your proportion, and if that hould perfite then you may be well assured not any thing hath commed amongst them, but if that fayle or be disordered, then there hath beene something amongst them and something is taken.
               Now to make any comparisson betweene The seasons for the vse of Nettes or of Lyme the vse of the Nettes, and the vse of these Lime-roddes, or to giue any preheminence or place more to the one then to the other were needlesse and to no purpose, since they are both of equall vertue and goodnesse, and haue indeed each of them their distinct times and seasons for their seuerall imployments, for you shall heere vnderstand that those Lime-Roddes or the vse of Lime is onelye for the winter season, as from the beginning of Nouember at whichtime euery tree hath shed his leafe, & euery bird is content to pearch vpon the twigs which are the very figures and Emblems of Lime-twigs, vntil the beginning of May,
                  
at which time on the contrary part euery Tree is budded and doth begin to spread and open his leafe, so as all Birdes may coutch and hide themselues vnder the couert and shaddowes of the same, and the true vse of the Nettes are from the beginning of May when Trees are leaued, till the latter end of October when euery tree doth shed and loose his leafe, so there is no time of the yeare, more then the very time of ingendring, but may be exercised in this pleasure, whence what profite may arise I leaue to be iudged by those which keepe good Houses and such as haue good Stomacks.
               Now for the substance, fashion or The fashion of the Nettes. proportion of these Nettes, they would first be made of the best twyned double Huswifes thred that can be gotte, and if it be dyed either greene or blew it is so much the better, the mash would be reasonable square and large, as almost an inch betweene knotte and knotte, it would be in length about three fadome at the least and in bredth seauen foote or better, it must be verdgd on each side with strong, small fine coard, and as it were surfled thereon and the Net placed

not straight, but thicke and large, so that at any time it is extended it may lye com passe wise and hollow, also the two ends shall be verdgd likewise with small coard, yet that more for strength then for any particular vse or purpose, some doe vse to make these Nets of a much more lardger size, as seauen fadome or fiue fadome, but such Nettes are combersome and full of trouble, and hardly to be ruled with one hand, & therfore in case there be need of any such longe Nettes, then you may take a couple of the first size (which was three fadome) and ioyning them together, or pitching them one close by another, they will serue fully as well, and rather better then those long sizd nettes, and bee both better to pitch, readier to take vp, and a great deale more yare and nimble for any purpose in which you shall imploy them. And thus much for the taking of Pheasants, in generall either with theNettes, or the Lyme-bush.

Bayte, Engine, or other deuice whatsoeuer, whether it be by intisement of Call, or Stale, or any other allurement, or else by affright or terrour, whence it comes that albeit this art of taking these Partridges be pleasant, profitable and necessary, yet it is neither much painfull nor much difficult, but may be attained to in the fullnesse of all perfection by a mans owne and onely labour, iudgment and industry, prouided that his diligence be alwayes accompanied with an earnest desire and willingnesse, and that willingnesse must by al meanes possible neuer be abandoned of temperance rest and discretion

Waies to take Partridges of Partridges, you shall vnderstand that it is to be done foure seuerall wayes that is to say, by Nettes, by Lime, by Engine, and by the setting Dogge, for as touching the Hawke, which curiositie may make a fift way for the taking of them, I will heere omit it, as a strain too high for this discourse, and as a peculiar Art belonging to the Noble faulconer, not the homely and honest plaine Fowler.
               
                  
For the taking of Partridges with Hauntes of the Partridge. Nettes, it is likewise to bee done diuers and sundry waies, according to the manner of haunts, and the places wherein these byrdes doe inhabit, for you must vnderstand, that Partridges are not like Pheasants, (in this case) constant to one place of abiding, but doe come into diuers; nay, if they haue any small couert whatsoeuer, be it so high as a mans hand they will lodge in the same, and sometimes in the very plaine Champaines where they haue no shelter whatsoeuer, more then the poore short grasse.

thereof) both by reason of the excellencie of the graine on which they loue to feed before all other, as also for the hight and largenesse of the stuble, which makes their couert safer and stronger, but whē this wheat stubble is either scantie or of small circute, or when it is too much soyled and troden either with men or Cattell, then they forsake it and goe either to the Barley stubbles which albe they yeeld not so safe couert, nor so sweet food, yet being fresh, pleasant and not so vsually troden or beaten they doe take great delight therein, and will in the furrowes amongst the clottes, brambles and longe grasse and fogge, hide and couer both themselues and their whole Couies or Broodes very sufficiently, although they be very many in number, (for no Bird bringeth fourth more then the Partridge) sixteene and seauenteene being an ordinary brood or Couie, twentie, two and twentie, and fiue and twentie many times found, and I haue hard speake of thirtie and one and thirtie, now after the Winter season cometh and that these stubble fields are either torne vp with the Plough, or otherwise ouer soyled with

cattell, meanure, or the like, then doe these Partridges resort into the inclosed grounds or vpland Meadowes and doe lodge in the dead grasse or fogge, vnder hedges, amongst moale hils and vnder bankes or at the rootes of trees.
               Also you shall finde the haunts of Partridges all the yeare long in small Copsies or Vnderwoods, especially if any Corne fields lye bordedring vpon the same, as also in bushie Closses where grow plenty of shrubs and Brambles, or where there growes Broome, Brakes, Ferne, Whinnes, Gorse, Ling, or any couert great or little whatsoeuer; prouided still that some Corne field be euermore adioyning to these couerts and quiet places, for otherwise these birdes will take little or no delight and pleasure therein, but rather shunne and eschewe them.
               Againe, in the height of haruest time when euery Corne fielde is full both of people and cattell, so that these Byrdes can haue no quiet lodging in the same, then you shall finde them in the day time in the Fallow or tilthe fields which are next adoyning to the Corne fields

where they will lye lurking amongst the great clottes and wilde ketlockes; and onely in the earely mornings, and likewise late in the euenings, fetch their food from the Corne shocks or sheaues that are the neerest adioyning.

               There be others, that finde out these Partridges, by the hantes or places where they did last couch and lye, which when they haue by their ranging found out, they first looke whether the haunt bee olde or newe, which they may knowe by the newnesse or oldenesse of their dung or ordure, by their padlings or treading, and by the warmth or coldnesse, for if the haunt be newe, the dunge or ordure will be greene and soft, and the white ends will colour your fingers: the padlings and treadings, round about the haunt, will bee soft and durty, and the earth will bee new broken and of darker

               There be others which to finde out To take Partridge by the Iuke. 
                  Partridges do goe vnto the haunts either very earlye in the Morning, or at the closing vp of the Euening, which is called the iuking time, and there doe listen for the calling of the Cock Partridge, which will be very lowd and earnest, then presently after some few cals the Henne will make answere, which assoone as they heare they listen and follow them til they meete together, which you shall verie well perceiue and know by their chattering and reioyceing one with another which assoone as you heare, then you shall take your rainge about them, and drawing in by little & little to the place

where you heard them iuke, you shall carefully cast your

                  ie about you, especially towards the Furrowes of the lands, and there is no question to be made, but you shall presently finde where the Coouie lies, and after what manner, so that after you may proceede to the businesse of taking them according as your delight and pleasure shall leade you.
               Now the last way for finding out of To take Partridges with the Call. these Partridges (and which of all other is both the best, safest, most easie, and most artificiall) is with the call (of whose sharpe proportion, and manner of making I shall speake more largely heereafter in a particular Chapter) with this call hauing learnt the true and naturall notes of the Partridge and being able to tune euery seuerall note in their right and proper key, and that you know the due times and seasons for euery note, and can fitly accommodate them to the haunts and places wherein they are to be vsed, after the same manner as hath beene formerly declared for the Pheasant; for you are to vnderstand that the Partridge hath as

variable notes and tunes, and differeth as much in her seuerall callings as the Pheasant doth, and in some cases more: hauing therefore (as I said) your cals made ready and fit, and that the time of the day (which must euer of necessitie bee either Morning or Euening, (for the Noone-day is neuer any good or seasonable time for this purpose or exercise) you shall goe to the haunts where you doe know that Partridge

the Partridge call, which if you doe, you shall then make answere againe, and that in the same note or tuen in which the Partridge calleth, and euer as shee altereth or chaungeth her note, or doubleth it ouer more or lesse, so shall you euer make answere and alter and change your note and time, and double or treble as shee shall giue you example, and still apply your call till you finde that shee draweth neerer and neerer vnto you, and not one single Partridge onely, but many, if many be within the compasse of the sound of your call, and not the old ones onely single by themselues, but attended and followed on by their seuerall coouies, for this calling is so delightfull and naturall vnto them that they will pursue and follow it as farre as they can heare it, when thus you haue drawne the Partridges vnto you, and that you see them and their whole flocks to becomed within your view, you shall then cast your selfe flat vppon your back, and lye without mooueing as if you were dead, and then you shall see the Partridge come running and pecking about you without any feare or dread, so as you

shall not onely take a full view of them, but also if you please you may number and count them.
               After thus you haue gotten the full Taking of partridges with Nets. perfection how to finde out Partridges, your next lesson shall be to learne how to take and intangle them: And first of the taking of them with Nettes, you must vnderstand that the Nettes where-with you must take Partridges, ought to be shaped and proportioned in all points, both length aud breadth like vnto the Pheasant Nette, onely the mash would be somewhat smaller; It must be also of the selfe-same thrid, and in like manner dyed and colloured, or if it be somewhat longer or somewhat broader, it will not be amisse, but a great deale better, and you shall take your prey more certainely and with lesse care and hazard, for you are to vnderstand that the longer your nets are, the longer you may make your circumference or walke about them, and the broader that they are, the more ground you may couer, and so bring more within your daunger, prouided alwaies that they be not to

of their length or breadth, for thereby you may not onely anoy your selfe and hinder the worke, but also breede affright to the birds, which are so fearefull and tender of their safeties, that vpon the least blinke or dislike, they will presently spring vp and flye away leauing all your labour frustrate and disappointed; Therefore (as before shewed) hauing your nets of true size and compasse, and fitly accomodated to your purpose with Lines and Cordes answerable; you shall then (hauing found out the Couye by any meanes aforesaid, or by other accident) drawe foorth your Nets and taking a great large circumference or ring about the Partridg

                     •…
                   manner you may take either single Partridges,
                  
paires, or the whole coouies, and that not at one distinct and proper time, but at all seasons of the yeare whatsoeuer, and in any ground, champaine or Woodland, or any other haunt or abiding place whatsoeuer.
               The next way to take Partridges is Taking of Partridges with Lime. with lime or lime-rods, after this manner: You shall first take of the fairest, strongest and lardgest Wheate-strawe you can get (of which, that which is called the whole straw wheate, is the best, or for want of it the fairest and lardgest Rye-straw) and cutting them of betweene knot and knot (obseruing the lowest ioints or knots are the strongest and best) you shall then lime these with the strongest and best lime, in such manner as hath beene formerly deelared in other Chapters for the liming of other rods or wands, and so comming to the, haunts where Partridges doe vsually frequent, after you haue called a little, and find that you are answered againe, you shall then in such manner and forme as hath beene formerly shewed you for other roddes, prick downe these limed strawes round about you in many

crosse rowes and rankes, and that not very neere you, but a prety distance off, yet not out of the compasse of your eye, but so as you may discerne when any thing toucheth them: and these lymed strawes you shal place not onely crosse the Lands but the furrowes also, taking at least two or three Landes within your circumference; which done, you shall then lay your selfe downe closse and secretly and beginne againe to call, not ceasing till you haue drawne them toward you, whither they cannot come, but they must of necessitie passe through the Lime, which they shall no sooner touch, but presently they are taken and intangled and by reason that they come flocking and closse together, like so many Chickins, they wil so besmeare and daube one another, that if there be twenty in the Coouy hardly any one will escape.
               Now here is to bee noted, that this manner of taking of Partridges with Limed 
                     •…
                  awes, is properly to be vsed onely in Corne fieldes, and that principally, in the Stubble time, or from Angust th

                   Christ
                     •…
                  as, for before or after it is not so conuenient: But if you will take them

in woods, in pastures, or meadowes with Lyme, then you shall vse the ordinarie Lyme-rods made of wooden wandes, as hath bin before shewed, and pricke them downe, and order them in all points in such sort as is already mentioned of the Lymed strawes, for it is both the safest certainest, & best course that can be taken
               There is yet another way for the taking Taking partridges with Enggine, or the driuing them. of Partridges, which is no lesse profitable and vsefull then either of the other and indeed somewhat pleasanter and fuller of delight, and that is the taking them with engine, or as some call it the driuing of Partridges, which albe it is especially applyed to the wood-countrey, yet may it notwithstanding be very well & commodiously vsed in any place or ground whatsoeuer. The maner to do it is thus; you shal first make an engine in the fashion of a Horse, which engine shal be made of Canuas, or some such staffe, and stopt with straw or such like matter, of which engine (amongst other engines) I haue spoken very largely of in the former part of this Booke intreating of Waterfowle, and therewithall set downe the liuely forme or figure thereof, so that

to stand longer vpon it, were but a double labour, needlesse, vselesse, and to small purpose.
               Hauing therefore this engine and your nets in a readinesse, you shall goe into the haunts where the Partridges doe frequent, and hauing by some of the meanes or charracters before mentioned found out the coouy of Partridges, you shall then in the most secretest and likelist place for that purpose, and taking the best aduantage of the winde (which is euer to goe aboue it and driue downe the winde) you shall there pitch your net, not flatte and couching, but sloapewise and houering, and that so close and secretly and so ouer-shadowed either with bushes, shrubs, leaues, weedes or some other that groweth (naturall to the ground it standeth) in that not any thing may perceiue it till it be intangled in it, when you haue thus placed your net or nets, you shall then take your engine and goe to the place where the coouy of Partridges lodgeth, and hauing your face couered or hid with some hood of greene or darke blew stuffe, you shall (pntting the engine before

you) make your foote stalke towards the Partridges, and by gentle and slow steps or degrees, you shall steale vpon the birdes, and raise them as gently vpon their feete (not their wings) as may be, and so make them runne before you, which naturally they will doe of themselues, for their feare is such, th

                  Too much pitty spoiles a Citie, and so too much care of themselues is the destruction and losse of themselues.
               To proceed then to our purpose, it is What a a setring Dogge is. meete that first before I wade further into this discourse, I shew you what a S

                  ting

Dogge is, you shall then vnderstand that a Setting Dogge is a certaine lusty land Spaniell, taught by nature to hunt the Partridge before, and more then any other chase whatsouer, and that with all eagernesse and fiercenesse, running the fields ouer and ouer so lustily and busily, as if there were no limit in his desire and furie; yet so qualified and tempered with Art and obedience, that when he is in the greatest and eagerest pursuit, and seemes to be most wilde and frantike, that yet euen then, one hem or sound of his Masters voyce makes him presently stand, gaze about him, and looke in his Masters face, taking all his directions from it, whether to proceede, stand still, or retire; nay, when hee is commend eu
                     •…
                   to the very place where his prey is, and hath, as it were, his nose ouer it, so that it seemes hee may take it vp at his owne pleasure, yet is his temperance and obedience so made and framed by Arte, that presently euen on a sudden he either stands still, or falles downe flatte vpon his belly, without daring once to open his mouth, or make any noyse or motion at all, till that his Master come vnto him,

and then proceedes in all things according to his directions and commandements.
               When therefore you haue either by How to set Partridges your owne industry made such a dogge, or else by your purse, friendship, or other accidents obtained such a dogge, you shall then take Partridges with him after this manner; being come into the fields or haunts, where Partridges doe frequent, you shall there cast off your dogge, and by crying Hye-Ret, or Hey-whyrr or such like words of encouragement according to the custome of his owne nature or education, giue him leaue to raunge or hunt, which as soone as he beginneth to doe, you shall then cease from any more words, except any fault or mistaking enforce you, and then you shall vse the words of correction or reprehension due for that purpose, and in all his hunting and labor, you shall haue great and especiall heed that hee neuer raunge too farre from you, but beate his ground iustly and euen, without casting about or flying now heare and now there, and skipping many places, which the heate and

mettall of many good dogges will make them doe if they be not reprehended, and therefore when any such fault shall happen, you shall presently with a hem, call him in, and then with the terror of your countenance so threaten him, that he shall not dare all that day after to doe the like, but shall raunge with that modesty and temperance, hunting all the ground ouer at an inch, and euer and anon looking you in the face, as who should say, doe I now please you I or no; all which, when he doth, you must then giue him cherrishments and encouragement.
               Now if in this raunging and hunting you chaunce to see your dogge to make a sudden stop or to stand still, you shall then presently make into him (for he hath set the Partridge) and assoone as you come to him, you shall bid him goe nearer; which if he doe, you shall still say to him, goe nearer, goe nearer; but if you finde he is vnwilling to goe or creepe nearer, but either lies still, or stands shaking of his tayle, as who should say heere they are vnder myne nose, and withall, now and then, lookes backe vpon

you, as if hee would tell you how neare they are; then presently, you shall cease from further vrging of him, and then beginne to take your range or circumference about both the Dogge and the Partridge, not ceasing but walking about with a good round pace, and looking still before the Dogges nose, till you behold and see plainely, how and in what manner the Coouy lyeth, whether closse and round together in one plumpe heape, or cluster, or else stragling and scattering, here two, there three, aud in other places more or lesse as fortune shall administer: when thus you see how the Couye lyeth, you shall then first charge the Dogge to lye still, and then drawing foorth your Nette as you walke, hauing prickt downe one ende to the ground (as hath beene before shewed) then spread your Nette all open, and (as neare as you can) couer all the partridges therewith, euen from that which lyeth next to the Dogge to that which is furthest off, but if you finde that one Nette will not serue to couer them, then you shall draw foorth another, and holding your raunge or walke stil in continuall motion spread

out it, and lay it before the first Nette, and thus you may doe with as many Nettes as you shall haue occasion to vse, till the whole Coouye be couered, which done you shall then make in with a noyse and, springe vp the Partridge, which shall no sooner rise, but they shall presently be intangled in the Net so as you may take them at your pleasure, and dispose of them as you shall haue occasion, in which taking whether it be this way or any other formerly spoken off, if after they are in your mercy, you will then be pleased to let goe againe the old Cocke and the old henne, it will not onely be honest and Gentleman like, but also good and profitable, and a meanes both to continue and increase your pastime, for

               Now for a conclusion of this treatise, Taking of Rayles, Quailes, &c. when you are exquisite and pefect in all the things before spoken of and that you can do them readily & perfectly, & with all Art and cunning, you shall then know that from these, you may deriue the taking of diuers other Byrdes, as Qua

               Now for their manner of haunts they Their hauntes. are as the Partridges are, most in Corne Fieldes, or in Pastures or Woods neare vnto Corne-Fieldes, onely the Quaile loues most the Wheate Fieldes; the Morepoots loues most the Heath and Forrest groundes where is store of Lynge and such like couert, and the

                     uaile loue the long and high grasse wherein they may lye closse obscure and hidden.
               For the manner of finding them it Howe to finds them is in all points like that of the Partridge,
                  
by the eye, by the eare, or by the haunt all which aske the same obseruations and carracters which haue beene formerly declared touching the Partridge, and with the same causions exceptions and difficulties. But the chiefe and principall meanes of all, and which indeed exceedeth all, is to finde them out by the call or pipe, to which they listen with such earnestnesse that you can no so
                     •…
                   chaunt their notes but in an instant they reply and make answere vnto you, pursuing and following the call with such greedinesse, that they will neuer cease till they come vnto you, and skippe and play about you, especially the Qudi

                     e, which is inamored to heare her owne tune, that you can no sooner make your quaile pipe speake in the true tune but in a trice she will make answere & not 
                     •…
                  aue till she come to you, and sport about you.
               Now you are to obserue in the calling Diuersitie of Notes. of these Byrdes, that they haue diuers notes and tunes, some belonging to the male Byrdes, and some vnto the female, all which you must haue per
                     •…
                   in your remembrance, and then when you heare the male Byrd call you must answere

in the note of the female, and if the female call, you must answere in the note of the male, and so you shall be suer that both the one and the other will most busily come about you, and neuer leaue till they finde the place from whence the sound commeth, to which when they doe approch they will stand and gaze and listen till the Nette be quite cast ouer them.
               Now for the manner of taking of any, How to take them. or all of these Byrds, it is one and the same with the taking of the Partridge and may be done either by 
                     •…
                  ttes in such sorte as is formerly declarred in this Chapter, or else by Lyme (either bush or rodde) by the stalking Engine, and manner of driuing, or lastly by the setting-Dogge in the same manner and forme as hath beene spoken of the Partridge. Of which Setting-Dogge since he is of so great vse and excellencie, I thinke it not amisse here in this place to demonstrate his true Figure and proportion.
               
                  
                  
                     The forme and proportion of the Setting Dogge.
                  
               
               Now although some may thinke it strange that a Dogge should be brought to Set this small game, yet there is no strangenesse therein; for Dogs in this Arte are made to any thing that they are accustomed, so it be not a thing meerely contrary and against their natures, which this is not; for it is the nature of euery Spaniell, naturally to hunt all manner of

Byrdes, or any thing that hath wing (though some with more earnestnesse & greedinesse then othersome.) Now these are Byrdes and haue wing, so that they are naturall for the Spaniel to hunt, and there then remaineth nothing but the accustoming the Dogge thereunto, and acquainting him with your minde and determination, that this is the thing which you would haue him hunt, which assoone as he vnderstands, instantly hee pursues and followes it, and is as earnest in it, as in any other chase, prey or pleasure whatsoeuer.
               And thus much for the taking of Partridges and other smaller Byrdes of like nature, as also of the Setting-Dog, and his seucrall vses.

                   manner of vsing him being brought to perfection and fite for the present vse of the pastime, I will heere in this place speake more generally and largely of him, and shew how he is to be trayned and brought to be trayned and seruiceable for the purposes before treated off, for albe I know that in diuers places of this Kingdome these Setting-Dogges are to be taught (so that most men of ability may haue them at their pleasures) yet likewise I know they are sould at su
                     •…

                  ous man whatsoeuer (which ether loues the sport or would bepartaker of the benefit) but will be glad to learne how to make such a dogge himselfe, and

so both saue his purse and make his pleasure and profit both more sure and more delicate; for this I must assure all men, (that buy their dogges from mercinary teachers) that euermore those sales-men doe reserue in their owne bosomes some one secret or another, for the want of knowledge, where of the purchaser quickly findes his dogge imperfit, and so is forced vpon euery disorder or alteration of keeping to send the dogge back to his first master a new to be reformed, which drawing on euer a new price, makes the dogges certaine price without end, without valuation.
               This falt to redresse; and to make euery man the true master of his owne worke, I will shew you heere in a briefe and compendious manner al the mysteries and secrets which lie hidde in this laboursome businesse.
               The first thing therefore that you must learne in this art, is to make a true election of your dogge, which you intend to apply to this purpose of Setting, and in this election you shall obserue, that although any dogge which is of perfit and good sent, and naturally adicted

to the hunting of feathers, as whether it be the Land-Spaniell, Water-Spaniell, or else the Mungrell betweene either of both those kindes, or the Mungrels of either of those kindes, either with the shallow flewed hound, the tumbler, lurcher, or indeede, the small bastard Mastiffe may bee brought to this perfection of Setting (as I haue seene by daily experience, both in this and in other Nations) yet is their none so excellent indeede as the true bred Land-Spaniell, being of a nimble and good size, rather small then grosse, and of a couragious and fierie mettall, euermore louing and desiring toyle, when toyle seemes most yrksome and wearie, which although you cannot know in a whelpe so yong, as it is intended he must be, when you first begin to traine him to this purpose, yet may you haue a strong speculation therein, if you choose him from a right litter or breede, wherein by succession you haue knowne that the whole generation haue beene endued with all these qualities, as namely; that he is a strong, lusty and nimble raundger, both of actiue foote; wanton tayle, and busie nostrill, that his toyle is

without wearinesse, his search without changeablenesse, and yet, that no delight nor desire transport him beyond feare or obedience; for it is the perfectest charracter ofthe most perfectest Spaniel, euer to be fearefull and louing to him that is his Master and keeper: I confesse I haue seene excellent rare Setting dogs made in the Low-Countries, which haue beene of a Bastard tumblers kind (for indeede a true Lande-Spaniel, is there Gaysson) and indeede, I haue found in them (if I may so tearme it) a greater wisedome (which indeede is but a greater feare) then in our Land-Spaniels, but comparing the whole worke together, that is the labour in raundging, the scent in finding, and the art in Setting, they haue beene much inferior to our dogs, and not able to stand vp with them in the lardge and spatious Champaines, nor yet to brush through or make their waies in the sharpe thickets and troublesome couerts. To speake then in a word touching the best choice of this Setting dogge, let him be as neere as you can the best bredde Land-Spaniell, that you can procure, and though some haue beene

curious in obseruing of their colours, as giuing prehominence to the Motley, the Liuer-hude, or the White and Blacke spotted; yet questionlesse, it is but a vaine curiosity, for no colour is amisse for this purpose, prouided the naturall qualities bee perfit and answerable for the worke to which ende you intende them.
               Now when you haue thus made a good election of your Dogge, you shall beginne to handle and instruct him at foure monethes olde, or at sixe moneth at the vttermost, for to 
                     •…
                  ferre longer time is hurtfull, and will make the labour greater and more difficult to compasse, for the elder Dogges are the more stubborne they are and doe both vnwillingly learne, and with lesse will retaine that which is learned. The first thing therefore that you shall teach your Whelpe is, by all meanes possible to make him most louing and familar with you, so that hee will not onely know you from any other person, but also fawne vpon you and follow you wheresoeuer you goe, taking his onely delight to be only in your company, and that you may bring this the

better to passe you shall not suffer him to receiue either foode or cherishings from any mans hands but your, owne onely; and as thus you grow familiar with the Whelpe, and make him louing and fond of you, so you shal also mixe with this familiarity a kinde of awe and obedience in the Whelpe, so as he may aswell feare you as loue you
                     •…
                   and this awe or feare you shall procure rather with your countenance, frowne, or sharpe words, then with blowes, or any other actuall crueltye, for these whelpes are quickly terryfied, and the vyolence of

your meaning) by shewing him a piece of bread or some other foode which may intice him and draw him with more willingnesse to come vnto you, and in this lesson you must obserue that when he offereth to come vnto you, if he either raise from the ground his fore-parts, or his hinder-parts, or if he doe but so much as offer to lift vp his head, that then presently you doe not onely with your hand thrust his body downe in such sort as you would haue him, but also accompany that action with the terror of your voice, and such ratings as may not onely a

                  line and to follow you at your heele

close without either trouble or straining of his collor, in which there is small art to be vsed, more theu a daily labour and practise, and not striuing too roughly with the Whelp, but by all gentle means, first giuing him vnderstanding what to doe, and then shewing the manner how to doe, you shall see that in a day or lesse, hee will doe as much as can be desired.
               When all these things aforesaid are perfitly learned, it is to be imagined that by this time the whelpe will be at least twelue moneths of age, at which time (the season of the yeare being fit) you may very well aduenture to goe into the field and suffer him to raunge and hunt therein, yet with such carefulnesse and obedience, that albe his spirit and mettall do neuer so much transport him, yet vpon the first (Hem) or warning of your voice that he stop and looke backe vpon you, as who should say (doe you call) and vpon the second, or reitteration of your voice, that forthwith he either forbeare hunt further, or else come into your foote and walke by you, till you giue him new incouragement; and in

this raunging or hunting of the whelpe, you finde that through wantonnesse or foolishnesse he be giuen to babling or opening without cause, you shall then at first chide him therefore, but if that preuaile not, you shall then correct him much more sharpely, as by biteing him hard with your teeth at the rootes of his eares, or else lashing him hard with a sharpe whip-corde-lash, till you haue made him so staunch that he will hunt close and warily, without once opening either through wantonnesse or the rising vp of any small birds before him.
               Now when you haue brought your dogge to this staunch and obedient manner of hunting, and that he will bestow himselfe in such manner as you please to appoint him, then as soone as you finde him to come vpon the haunt of any Partridge (which you shall know both by his greater eagernesse in hunting, as also by a kinde of whimpering and whining in his voice being greedily desirous to open, onely feare and awe keepes him in an vnwilling obedience) you shall then speake vnto him as warning him to take

heede, by saying, (Be wise, Take heeede) or the like, but if notwithstanding he either rush in and so spring them, or else open or vse any other meanes by which the Partridge escapeth, you shall then presently take him and correct him very soundly, and then cast him off againe and either let him hunt those in such places as you haue markt them, or else in some other haunts where you are assured some Couey lodgeth; and then as before shewed, being commed vpon the haunts, giue the dogge warning, and if you see that out of feare he standeth still and waueth his taile, looking forward as if he did point at something, then you may be sure that the Partridge, or that he hunteth, is before him, then you shall make him lie close, and your selfe taking a lardge raunge or ring about him, shall looke if you can finde the Partridge: which as soone as you haue found, if he haue set them farre off, you shall then by saying (goe nearer) make the dogge creepe on his belly nearer to the Couey, but if he be neare enough you shall then make him lye close without stirring, and then drawing your nets

take the Partridge as hath beene before shewed, and then cheerish the dogge exceeding much, first by giuing him the heads, necks and pinions of the Partridge, and then by clawing and clapping him, and by giuing him either bread or other foode which you must euermore at those times carry about you; but if it happen that as before, so againe hee chance to spring vp the game, by his awant of taking heede or other rudenesse, then againe you shall correct him more then before, and so take him vp into your string and leade him home, tying him vp for that night, without giuing him any thing more then a bit of bread and water to keepe and maintaine life in his bosome, and then the next day haue him to the field, and doe as before shewed, yet with somewhat more terror and hard countenance, that hee may not onely call to minde his former falt, but also see that yet he hath not gotten your fauour, and there is no question but he will be much more carefull then hee was before, & striue in al things more readily to obey your commandements; and then when he performeth your will

and doth according to your expectation you must by no meanes forget to bestow vpon him all the cheerishings that may be, as those of the voice, the hands, and of foode also, whereby the dogge may be delighted and encouraged to increase and goe forward in his well doing. And heerein you are to obserue also, that when your dogge setteth the Partridge, if he doe stand vpright vpon his legges looking as it were at, or ouer the Partridge, that then such standing is a fault and may giue a blinke or offence to the Patridge, and therefore in this case you shall speake vnto the dogge and chide him, saying vnto him, Be wise, or lye close, not leauing till you see him lay himselfe downe vpon his belly on the ground.
               Againe, you shall obserue, that when you goe in vnto the Couey to spring the Partridge vp into your nets, that if the dogge rush hastily after you, and offer to spring them either before, or as soone as you, that likewise it is a great fault, and you must correct him very bit

                  erly for the same; and to the ende no that fault in you, may bring on that

fault in the dogge, you must obserue to goe very leasurely and with great discretion into the Couey and euer as you goe speake to the dogge to be wise and to lye close, terrifying him in such sort that he may not mooue till you giue him libertie.
               Many other obseruations there be, but none more materiall then these already rehearsed; so that being carefull and diligent to vse and obserue these according to the truth of their natures, there is no doubt but you shall bring your whelpe in one foure or fiue moneths to that full perfection which can be required of any reasonable iudgement. And thus much for the bringing vp of any Spaniell-Whelpe to this excellent art of Setting.

                  Of the making of the best Lyme, and of the preseruation, as also of the Lyming of Roddes, Bushes, Strings, &c.
               
               
                  NOw for as much as the perfection of this Art consisteth in the perfection of the Instruments which are to be imployed therein, and that whereas any of them shall either grow or bee defectiue, that there the whole worke must necessarily perish and fall to ruine, and for as much as there is no instrument more auaileable or more casuall then Bird-lime is, both by reason of the strength, and vigour, and abilitie to hold and intangle when it is good and perfit, and also the aptnesse to loose, not to cleaue or stick, when it is either weake rotton or defectiue: I think

it not heere amisse to declare vnto you how and in what manner to make and compound the most excellentest and perfitest Bird-lime, for all manner of vses or purposes, wherein soeuer it shall be imployed, whether it be in Winter or in Sommer, in the Frost or in the Thawe, or whether it be by Water or by Land, or for any generall

                  fe to be imployed in this art of Fowling.
               To make then the best and most excellentest Making of Bird-lime Bird-lime, you shall take at Midsomer the Barke of Holly and pill it from the Tree, so much as will fill a reasonable bigge vessell, then put to it running water, and set it on the fire, and boyle it till the gray and white Barke rise from the greene, which will take for the most part, a whole day or better in boyling, then take it from the fire and seperate the Barkes after the water is very well drained from it, which done, take all the greene Barke and lay it on the ground in a close place, and a moist floare, as in some low Vault or Cellar, and then with all manner of green weedes, as Docks, Hemlock, Thystels and the like, couer it quite ouer a good

thicknesse, and so let it lye for the space of tenne or twelue daies, in which time it will rot and turne to a filthie and slymie matter, then take it vp from the ground and put it into a lardge morter, and there beate and grinde it exceedingly till it be comed to one vniuersall paste or toughnesse, without the diserning of any part of the Barke or other substance, which as soone as you see, you shall take it out of the morter, and carry it to a quicke and swift running streame, and there wash it exceedingly, not leaning any moate or foulenesse within it, then put it vp in a very close earthen pot, and let it stand and purge for diuers daies together, not omitting but to skum it and clense it as any foulenesse rises, for at least three or foure daies together, and then perceiuing no more skum will arise, you shall then take it out of that pot and put it in another cleane earthen vessell, and couer it close, and so keepe it.
               Now when you haue occasion to vse How to v
                        •…
                      Lyme. your Lyme, you shall take of it such aquantitie as you shall think
                     •…
                   fit, and putting it into an earthen pipkin, with a third part of Hogges-grease, Caponsgrease

or Goose-grease, finely clarified (but Capons-grease or Goose-grease is the best) and set it one a very gentle fire and there let them melt together, and stirre them continually, till they be both incorporated together, and that you cannot discerne any seperation of bodies, but all one entire and perfit substance, then take it from the fire and coole it, stirring it still till it be cold
               As soone as your Lime is well coold, Lyming of Roddes, Strings, &c. you shall then take your Lyme-roddes, and beaking or warming them a little ouer the fire to make them warme and drye, then take some of the Lyme (so prepared as aforesaid) and winde it about the tops of the roddes, then draw the roddes asunder one from another and close them againe, then open them and shut them againe, continually plying and working them together, till by smearing one vpon another you haue equally bestowed on euery rodde a like quantitie of lyme, not any rodde hauing more or lesser then another, but all alike both in thicknesse and depth, alwaies prouided that you keepe the full and entyre breadth of your hand (at least) free

and without any lime at all, euer and anon warming the roddes before the fire to make the lime spread and bedde vpon them the better and to make it lye smoother and plainer, without any grosse or palpable shew, whereby the Foule may take affright or amazement before they come to touch it; If you lime any strings, you shall doe it when the lime is very hot and at the thinnest, besmearing the strings on all sides, by foulding them vp together and vndoing them againe, and by laying the places that are vntoucht to the places that are toucht, till all be generally touched and no part of the corde free from lime, nor any part thicker or thinner then another, the knots only excepted, which must be a little better lymed then any other part of the corde; both because of their waight and that they may fasten a great deale the sooner. Now lastly for the lyming of Strawes, it must be done also when the lyme is very hot, and in such manner as the roddes are done, before the fire, only you must not doe a fewe, but a great heape together, as much as you can well gripe in your hands, for so they are

the stronger, and not so apt to bruise or breake in pieces, and therefore in the opening and working of them you shall not doe it with a little quantitie or a few together, but still as many as you can well gripe, tossing and turning them, and working them before the fire, till they be all besmeared, and that euery straw haue his true proportion and quantitie of lyme, which as soone as you see it is done in perfection, you shall then haue cases made of leather, in which to put in your seuerall bunches of roddes, and so set them vp and keepe them till you haue occasion to vse them.
               Now if it so fall out that the weather doe prooue so extreame sharpe and frostie, that your Lime-roddes doe freese, and thereby loose all their strength and vigor, so as they cannot hold any thing at all; then when you mixe your grease and lyme together, you shall take a quatter so much of the oyle of Peter (which the Pothecaries call Petrolium) as you doe of Capons-grease, and mixing them together well, and working it vpon the roddes, it will euer keepe your

And thus much for the knowledge of Lyme and the seuerall vses, with which I end this briefe Treatise or Summarie Collection of this pleasant and delightfull Art of Fouling, which if it giue any small satisfaction or contentment, to the industrious and diligent Reader, I haue the full accomplifhment of my desire, and hold my paine sufficiently rewarded.
