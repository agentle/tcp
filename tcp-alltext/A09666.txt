            Patrono Pimlyconico.
            Facie Claro,
Facetijs Raro,
Thomae Normano.
            
               ALL hayle, (ô Tom Norman,)
            I make thee, the Foreman
            
            Of Pimlyco Iury:
            You are chargde to enquire Sir,
            What kindles that fire sir,
            That burnes with such fury.
            What fire doe you suppose sir?
            Tis the fi
                  •
               e of your Nose sir,
            Which your Face beares about.
            For (like to the fornace,
            That glowes in the Glasse-house,)
            It neuer goes out.
            To keepe that hye Colour,
            
            And make it looke fuller,
            You shall die it in graine sir:
            Of the Pimlyco Iuice,
            If you get the right vse,
            O how well will it staine sir.
            I create you Sole Patron
            
            Of the Pimlyco Squadron,
            
            choose therefore Ale-cunners.
            
            That now against Easter,
            
            (If you purpose to feast there)
            may be your fore-runners.
            Hoyst then vp your Sayle sir,
            For rich Pimlyco Ale sir,
            That cullors like Roses,
            
            With your Copper Seale, marke sir,
            All those that Embarke sir,
            
               For Pimlyco-Noses.
            Vade, Vale, Caue ne titubes.
         
         
            
            To all Trauellers.
            
               YOu that weare out your liues and weary your bodies,
in Discouery of strange Countries, (bee it for
pleasure or profite) Rig out a Fleet, and make a Voi
               age
to an Iland which could neuer be found out by
the Portugals, Spaniards, or Hollanders, but only
(and that now of late) by Englishmen. The name of it is Pimlyco,
Here haue I drawne a large Map of it: by this Chart, may
you in a few houres, and with little or no winde, ariue in the very
mouth of the Hauen. Some that haue trauelled thither, affirme it
to be a part of the Continent, but the better sort of Nauigators
say, it is an Iland: full of people it is, and they are very wilde, the
women beeing able to endure more, and to doe better Seruice than
the men. Diuers are of opinion, that it is an inchanted Iland, and
haunted with strange Spirits; for the people there, once euery Moone,
are either starke mad, or else loose their owne shapes, and are transformed
into Beasts, yet within twelue houres, recouer their wittes
and shapes againe. The Pimlyconians are most of them Malt-men,
and exceeding good fellowes, all their delight beeing in Eating and
Drinking; they liue not long, for a man can hardly star amongest
them two dayes: if he doe, he is in great danger, by reason of a certaine
disease, (which the Iland naturally breedes) called the Staggers,
through which, many of them come to their Downe-fall, or
if they scape that, then are they in feare to be made away by Smallshot,
in discharging of which, the Pimlyconians are very actiue
and cunning.
            
               
The Iland begins now to be as rich as it is populous: fish hath bin
s
                  •
               ldome taken there, but flesh is better cheape then Mackrell here.
Wilde Duckes and wilde Geese flie there vp and downe in aboundance:
you may haue a Goose sowe'd in Pimlyco, for the value of
twelue pence sterling. Woodcockes (in many moneths of the yeere)
are to be catched there by whole dozens. It is full of fatte pasture,
and thats the reason such multitudes of young Colts runne there.
A hot Climate it is, and by that meanes the people are subiect to infection,
which takes them first in the Head, and so falls downe into
their legges, and those fayling, they are (in a maner) gone. The
Gouernour of the Iland hath much adoe to keepe himselfe vpright,
so that he is compelled to giue those that are vnder him, often
times very Hard measure, yet are they so vnruly, that euery houre
one or other goes to the Pot.
            
            Thus haue I giuen you a taste, both of the People and of the
Countrie; if you sayle thither, you may drinke of deeper knowledge.
But take heed you take a skilfull Pilot with you; be fraighted with
as much wit as you can carry aboord, for all will be little enough to
bring you from thence, and take heede what Lading you take in
there, for the commodities of Pimlyco haue suncke many
Merchants. Pay thankes for my Councell,
and thinke well of my Pimlyconian
Discouerie.
            
            Farewell.

            The Vernall Gates are set wide open,
            And strew'd with Flowers and Herbes, in token
            That May (Loues Queene) is comming in,
            Who 12. full Moones hath absent bin.
            In this Swéet Season, from my bed,
            I earely rose, being wakened
            By'th beating of a Golden-flame,
            Which (to me) in at window came.

            And as the Chariot mounted higher,
            The Sun-god seem'd to ride in fire,
            Forth came he in this braue adorning,

            The wonders (of vn-valued worth,)
            Which these two wrought, intic'd mee forth;
            Weary with walking, downe I threw
            My bodie, on a bancke where grew
            The pretty Dazie, (Eye of Day,)
            
            The Prime-Rose which does first display
            Her youthfull coloors, and first dies;

            Might I see wrastling on the Grasse,
            Shee swore shee would not fall, and yet
            Shee fell, and did a Greene-Gowne get,
            (A Greene-gowne, but no Gownè of Greene.)
            At length (in Couples) more were séene:
            Som ran, some walked, and some sat kissing,
            Nothing was lost, but what was missing.
            So close they ioynd in their Delights,
            
            That they all seem

            Her sboone smeard with tallow,
            Greased vppon dirt,
            That danbeth the Skirt.

                  Being entred, all the ayre was rent
                  With a most strange confused noyse,
                  That sounded nothing but meere voyce.

                     My Friend, Tis Pimlyco (hee cryde)
                  And no worde could I get beside.
                  This made me madder then before,
                  I ask'd another, and hee swore

                  What Pimlyco should meane I wondred,
                  Because so lowd, that word still thundred
                  From all their throats through all their eares,

                  Only by that fond, senceleffe Name.

                  My Iug brought in; a draught or twaine
                  Made such hot boyling in my braine,

                  That will nothing spare,

               And sometimes she blens,

               And floure the more quicker,

               I learned it of a Iew,
               
                  
When I began to brew,
               Drinke now while it is new.
               And yee may it brooke,
               It shall make you looke
               Yonger than you bee
               Yeeres two or three.
               For yee may proue it by me,
               Behold she said, and see,
               How bright I am of blee,
               Ich am not cast away,
               That can my husband say,

               In lust and in liking,
               He calleth me his whyting,
               His Mulling, and his Nittine
               His Nobbes and his Cunny,
               His sweeting and his honny,

               For after all our sport,
               Than will hee ront and snort,
               Then sweetly together we lye,
               As two Pigges in a stye.
               But we will turne playne,

               In stead of coyne and monny,

               And some a pot with honny,
               Some a salt, and some a spoone,
               Some their hose, some their shoon.
