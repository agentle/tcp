            AT LONDON, Printed by H. L. for Thomas Man, 1612.
         
         
            
            
            TO MY REVErend and worthy Brother, Mr. Doctour HALL.
            
               THe wise Marchant, that after long trauel vvith much searching and aduenturing, dooth thinke that he hath found som rich treasure, although he doe much reioyce in it, yet will not trust himself; but will vse all meanes of trial of it, by the most skilfull and expert, before he will aduenture his

estate, vpon an vncertaine commodity, or offer any way to vent the same. Blame mee not then (my reuerend and dearest Brother) if after triall of this kinde of translation, by my selfe and others, I craue of you to bee in stead of many, for bringing it vnto the touch; to trie, whether it be in all things, according to the worth, which I haue conceiued of it, for carrying-on the little ones in so plaine and so pleasant a way to all good learning. For, whom can I finde more meet then your selfe? And first, in regard of that right noble Hope, to whom I haue Dedicated my first assay in this kinde, being as yet vnable to iugde thereof; considering your louingest affection so duely and publikely testified to that honorable House. Secondlie, in regard

of the generall sort, to whom you haue not more approued your loue, in your painfull and woorthy labours, then they in their glad imbracing of the same. And for me, Who hath euer witnessed more true and sound affection, first in comforting and supporting your faithfullest sister, in that her long and weary combat of so many yeeres together, against the manifolde terrours, assaults and tortures of the bloody Enemy? and that not only priuately by your tenderest Letters, but publikelie in that most sweet Epistle, which hath been for the comfort of many a fainting soule. Wherein, you did not leaue her destitute of your brotherlie consolations, vntill the Lord who strengthned her, to be faithfull vnto the death, had

vouchsafed vnto her a most glorious victorie; and translating her into his throne, from all the malice of the Dragon, gaue vnto her the Crowne of life. Also for mine owne selfe, sith, as I haue acquainted you, and some other of chiefe note and place, with all my Schoole-trauells, from the time that I thus sette my selfe more earnestlie vnto them, so with this kinde of Grammaticall translation in particular, from my verie first entring into them; and more speciallie of late with the controuersie concerning the same: so that you are fulli
                  •
                able to satisfie any, as I hope; and by your wisedome to compose it in peace. That th
                  •
               re may bee still a ioynt vnion in this labour, which I trust will proue so profitable

to all. And moreouer, for that you haue not refused to put-to your helping hand to the vvorke, perusing, and adding some of your owne experiments; and haue also seene some little triall of my beginnings, and by all meanes incouraged mee heerevnto. Lastlie, for that you haue now vouch
                  •
               afed to grace my weake indeuours, with your louing though vndeserued testimonie. VVherefore, my kindest Brother, as you haue witnessed all this loue; so let mee intreate you especially, amongst others, in these and all other my studies for our poore Coun
                  •
               reyschooles, to help (as your greater occasions shall permit) to seuer all the drosse, that nothing may remaine, but onelie

that vvhich is pure and will abide the touch; That in the ende, that which is approoued maie come footh as the gold, vvhich hath seuen times passed the fier. The Latine Commentarie of Corderius, which I latelie mett withall, hath much confirmed mee in the course; though the English translation, ioyned to it, doth verie oft translate the exposition, not the text. Notwithstanding, Feare least I should deceiue my selfe or any other, or least I should faint in the way, leauing the work vndone, together with the good experience of your tender loue, so carefullie supporting me, and so brotherlie censuring and directing in such mildenesse, and also accepting my willingnesse, makes me thus to presume.

The fruit, I trust, shall be for yours, amongst others. And in this hope, that you will esteem of so meane a gift, according to mine affection, not the worke, I commend it vnto your loue, and to the blessing of our most wise and holy GOD whose it is; remaining euer,
            
               Your thankfull though vnworthiest Brother, I. B.
            
         
         
            
            
            TO THE IVDIcicus Reader.
            
               LEarned Reader, if you perceiue the benefit of this kinde of translating, help louingly to amend vvhat is amisse. Future editions (God willing) shall supply what is wanting, and bring to more perfection.
            
               To the Learner.

                   to be ready in the Grounds of your Accidence and Grammar, at least to haue the perfect vnderstanding

of them; and to bee very cunning in the examples of Nounes and Verbes, also to haue very readily the Rule of construing. For your better direction heerein, see the questions of the Accidence and Grammar, called The Posing of the Parts, gathered of purpose to help thereto.
               2. In vsing these translations, labour euer, first, to vnderstand fully the matter of euery sentence which you would construe, by oft reading ouer the English, to get it (as it were) without book.
               3 Then learne to construe the Latin according to the rule of construing, vsing the book where you doubt, and to the end to goe surely and speedily.
               4 Next, to parse as you construe, being helped by the Latin and English together.
               
                  5. After, trie to construe and parse out of the English alone, looking only on it: whereby you continually make Latin.
               6. Lastly, prooue whether by oft reading-ouer the Latin out of the English (first, according to the order of the translation; after, according to the order of the Authour) both Latin and matter will not most speedily bee made your owne.
            
            Vnderstand the matter perfectly; and the Latin will flow most easily, as of the owne accord.
