The .xvii. of Auguſt▪
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            FIrſt it is to be noted, that all
Sacramentes aſwell of the
olde lawe as alſo of the newe
lawe: were inſtituted and ordeyned
of God to put vs in remembraunce
of his moſt louing benefites
and moſt mercifull kyndnes
ſhewed and done vnto vs. Which
benefites, theſe ſacramentes thorough
gods worde doe offer vnto
our mindes and not to our ſenſes
and we receyue the ſaid benefites
by faythe, into oure ſoules, and
not wyth our ſenſes into our bodyes.
Sacramētes be of ſuch cō
               ditions
and nature, that they haue
in them two thinges to be conſidered,
the one is an outward viſible
thinge which perteyneth vnto
the bodyly ſenſes and is alſo-receiued
therby. The other thing
is not perceyued nor receyued wt
any bodily ſenſes, but as a pure
and mere ſpiritual thing, a benefite

done by God vnto mā, perteinyng
only vnto the ſoule, whyche
ſpiritual benefite is geuen & done
by god vnto man: becauſe it ſhold
be had & reteyned in cōtinual memorye
of the chriſtiā man. Theſe
outward & ſenſible thynges, were
inſtituted and ordeined to ſygnifie
& repreſent the ſame, hauing
in nature a propertie and condicion
ſomewhat cōfirmable & lyke
to expres, and repreſent the thing
which thei declare and ſingnifie.
As bread hath a natural properti
to fede, cōfort, and ſuſtain the natural
bodi: ſo Chriſtes bodi betraied
and his bloud ſhed for the remiſſion
of our ſinnes: feadeth, cō
               forteth,
and ſuſteyneth, the ſoule
of the chriſtian man, borught into
greate feare and ſorowe, with
the ſyght of the multitude and
greuoſnes of his ſinnes. Which
hungreth and erneſtlie thriſteth

for the iuſtice of God, and remiſſion
of hys ſayed ſynnes. And if
theſe thynges be well noted and
pondered, it wyll cauſe to ceaſe
contencion moued about the maner
of receyuyng of the ſacramēt
for all chriſtean mē muſte condeſcend
and agre, that euery faythfull
Chriſtian, (thorough Gods
word in ye ſacramēt, dulie to him
exhibited and miniſtred) doth eat
and receyue bi faith in Gods promyſe,
Chriſtes fleſhe and dryncketh
his bloude. So that ye thing
is not in contencion. Whether
we eate Chriſtes fleſh, or dryncke
hys bloude or no in ye Sacramēt
but the forme & maner of eatyng
Chriſtes fleſhe and drynkyng his
bloude is in cōtēciō. For ſome of
the clergie ſtriue ſtowtly, and teache
vngodlie that we ſhould eate
and receyue Chriſtes naturalle-bodye
wyth our teth, drynke and

ſwallowe hys bloude wyth oure
mouth and throte affirming veri
groſſely Chriſtes natural bodie
ſo to be naturally reallye, and bodeli
preſent, in the ſacrament therof,
and that euerie man whych receyueth
the ſacrament, receyueth
alſo the natural bodie of Chriſt:
be he neuer ſo wicked & vnfaythful.
An other ſort of teachers, preach,
ye receiuing of the ſacrament,
with our mouth and chewing it
wyth our teth: we eate not nor receyue
Chriſtes natural bodi: and
drinking and receiuing the wine
with our lippes & throt, we drink
not Chriſtes bloude, except we
faithfully and conſtantlie beleue
Chriſtes bodie to be betrayed for
vs: and his bloud to be ſhed for ye
remiſſion of oure ſinnes, For the
mouth (ſaye they) receyueth not
nor taſteth, anie other thing then
breade and wyne. But Chriſtes

body ſlaine & his bloud ſhed for
the remiſſion of our ſinnes (which
is the ſpirituall gyfe and grace of
God geuen to vs in the ſacramēt)
the ſoule eateth and receyueth by
fayth to his great ſpiritual comfort,
cōmoditie, and profit: and the
mouth: cannot receiue, nor taſt it.
For cōfirmacion wherof, thei ſay
that man conſiſteth and is made
of a bodie and of a ſoule, the bodi
is a natural and a materiall ſubſtance,
which is fed with natural
and corporal ſuſtenaunce, & noryſhement.
And the ſoule of man,
(which we cal the ſpirit & mynde)
is a ſpiritual ſubſtaūce which cā
               not
eate nor receiue anye bodelie
meat & ſuſtinaūce. For the ſoule
being a ſpiritual ſubſtaūce, hath
no teth mouth nor ſtomacke, to receyue
or degeſt anie ſuche bodelie
ſuſtinaūce,Math. xv. for that which entreth
into the mouthe defileth not the

ſoule (which is in the inward mā)
ſaith Chriſt. So in lykewiſe, that
whiche entreth into the mouthe
profiteth not the ſoule (beyng the
inward man) which cānot receiue
it So that the ſacrament, which
ye vngodlie ſai) bi vertue of gods
word ſpoken by the prieſt, is turned
into the natural, reall, and
corporal bodie of Chriſtes natural
ſubſtaunce, leauyng ye nature
of bread, is yet ſuch a natural ſubſtaunce
that cānot enter into the
ſpiritual ſoule, by bodelie eatyng
and receyuynge therefore with ye
mouth. For our ſoule is noriſhed
fed, & liueth bi the ſpirit of Chriſt
and not by the bodeli eatyng of
his body with our teeth. For in ye
maner of eatinge with the teeth,
Chriſtes fleſh profiteth not (ſaith
Chriſt) It is his holy ſpirit that
quickeneth and maketh vs aliue,
for ſpirit liueth not but bi the ſpirit

of Chriſt. For whoſoeuer hath
the ſpirit of Chriſt, ye ſame is Chriſtes
ſaith Paul And as touching
this bodeli eating of Chriſtes bodie,
with the teeth of men, it differeth
not from the fond & vngodli
opinion of the Caperna
                  ••
               es reherſed
in the .vi. of Ihon. Which
hearyng Chriſt ſay: I am ye bread
of lyfe and the bread which I wil
geue you is my fleſhe. And further
he ſayd, excepte you eate my
ſleſh, & drink my bloud you ſhal
not haue life in you. They ſayde,
this word and ſayng is veri hard
Who can heare hym? how can he
geue vs his fleſh to eate? For thei
thought that he woulde haue geuen
vnto thē, perceles, and gobbettes
of hys tural, and bodily
fleſh to eate with their teeth, and
to haue let out part of hys natural
bloud for them to drink. Euē
lyke as ſome of our clergie groſelie

(and no leſſe fondlie) imagyne
and without any feare of God, or
worldlie ſhame preache, the ſame
And althoughe Chriſt louyngly,
myndyng and wyllyng to teache
them, the profitable and ſpiritual
eatyng and drinkyng of his fleſh
and bloude, ſayde: doo theſe my
wordes offende you? what and yf
you ſhall ſee the ſonne of manne
aſcēde where he was before? The
ſpirit quickneth, the fleſhe profiteth
not. Yet this his anſwer, did
nothyng teach theym the godlye
and ſpiritual eatyng & drinking
of his naturall fleſhe and bloude
becauſe as Chriſt ſayd there were
ſom of them which did not beleue
So that without true belefe no
man can eate Chriſtes fleſhe and
drinke his bloud,Iohn. vi. and then he eateth
and drynketh it ſpirituallie
to his godli profite. Alſo if the ſacramēt
be turned into Chriſtes

tural and real bodie (as the moſt
part of oure cleargie vntrulie do
preache, & teache.) then it weare
alſo reaſon, that the ſame natural-and
reall bodie ſhould alſo be receiued
and perceiued with our ſē
               ſes.
For Chriſtes natural bodie
al though it be nowe glrified and
immortal, yet it is not ſo ſpirituall
that it is inuiſible, and that
proued Chriſt, when after his reſurrectiō
he appered vnto his diſciples,
Luke. xxiiii. ſaiyng. Fele and ſe a ſpirit
hath not fleſhe & bones, as you ſeme
haue. Wherfor doubtles if his
real, and natural bodie, were corporally
preſent in the ſacramente
it ſholde be both felt, and ſene. Becauſe
ſelynge, and feinge, be two
naturall properties, declared by-Chriſt,
whereby a naturall bodie
is perceiued and knowne to be viſible
and to occupie place. For as
ſaint Auguſtine ſayth to Dardanum.

That doubtles Chriſtes natural
bodie is in heauē. For ſaith
he, take from bodies the roume &
ſpace of places: and they ſhalbe
no where, and if thei be no where,
thē thei ſhall not be. Wherfore, if
his naturall bodie were in the ſacrament:
it muſt nedes occupie
roume and place in the ſacramēt,Hebru. iiii.
euen aſwell as it doth in heauen
or aſwell as anye other naturall
ſubſtaunce occupieth place. And
thē Chriſtes bodie, beyng and occupiyng
place in heauen: cannot
alſo in one tyme, occupie place in
the ſacrament. For hys naturall
bodie cannot occupie two places
bothe at one tyme. For Chriſt is
like vnto vs his reaſonable creaturs
in all thyngs (except onlie
in ſyne) But our bodies after our
reſurrection ſhalbe viſible: wherefore doubtles Chriſtes bodie ſhal
alſo be viſible, wherſoeuer it be

preſēt. Or eleſe he hath no natural
bodie But a ſhadow, or fantaſticall
bodi which is Marcians-hereſye.
Iohn. xvi Chriſt alſo ſaith, you ſhal
haue pore folkes alweis with you
but me you ſhal not haue alwais
wyth you. Alſo Ieſus knowynge
that his howre was come, that he
ſhould go to his father. How ſhal
he go to hys father (excepte in his
humanitie) which euer was preſent
with his father in hys Godhead?
Act. iii. Alſo S. Peter in the Actes
ſayth, repent and turne you, that
your ſynnes may be done awaye.
That when the tyme of reſt ſhall
come from the ſyght of the lorde,
& he ſhal ſend him which is preached
vnto you Ieſus Chriſt, whō
the heauens muſt receyue, vntyl
all thynges whiche were ſpoken
bi the mouth of the prophetes be
fulfylled. Alſo Paul ſayth, as often
as we ſhall eate of the breade
                  
                     •
                  . Cor .xi.
               
and drynke of the cuppe,
                  
                     •
                  . Cor. xi. we ſhall
ſhewe the death of the Lorde vntyll
he come, whiche wordes (vntyl
he come,) declare to be ſpoken
of one that is abſente, and not of
one that is preſente. Wherefore,
doubtles Chriſtes naturall body
is abſente, in heauen, and not preſent
in a corporall preſence in the
Sacramēt of the aultare: which
is no dyſcomeforte, nor hurie to
vs, that hys naturalle bodie is
preſēt in heauen. For as the ſone
in ſommer whē he is moſt higheſt
and diſtant from vs workethe in
the earthe moſt effectuouſli, and
yeldeth hys vertue moſt feruentlye
and aboundantlye vpon all
earthelie thynges: ſo in likewiſe
Chriſtes natural bodie although
he be in heauen moſt diſtaunt frō
vs, yet not with ſtanding he workethe
in hys people moſt effectuouſlie
& geuethe hys grace moſt

abundauntli to vs as he himſelfe
wytteneſſeth to hys apoſtles ſaiyng,
it is expedient and neceſſarie
that I go from you to my father.Ihon. xvi
For yf I ſhoulde not goo to my
father, the hollye ghoſte ſhoulde
not be ſent to you. Therfore ſeing
that ſo many holi ſcriptures wytnes
that Chriſtes naturall bodye
is in heauen and alſo that it is
no dyſcōmodie nor hurt to vs yt
it ſo be I truſt euerie good chriſtian
man, wyll holde hym content
and ſatiſfied. And on ye other partie
yf we ſhoulde graunt chriſtes
naturall bodie weare ſo preſente
in the ſacrament that the breade
were chaunged into hys natural
bodie and the wyne into hys naturall
bloude leauynge ye nature
of bread: then bothe the godlie &
wycked, the faythful and alſo the
vnfaythfull ſhould eate Chriſtes
naturall bodie & drynke hys naturall

bloude which is agaynſte
all the aunciente wryters,Auguſtin vpō the .xx▪ vi. treatiſe of Iohn. that
make a diuerſitie betwyxt, the eatyng
of the ſacramēt, & the receyuing
of the thynge repreſēted by
the ſacrament. The godlie and ye
vngodlie receyuethe ſacramente
ſaye they, but the thynge repreſented
in and bi the ſacramēt, which
is Chriſtes bodie broken and his
bloude ſhed out for the remiſſion
of our ſynnes: no man cā eate excepte
the faytheful by fayth. Alſo
Chriſt ſaythe that he is the bread
of lyfe whych came from heauen,
yf a mā eate of that bread he ſhall
lyue euerlaſtynglie.Iohn. vi. And he that
eatethe my fleſhe and drynkethe
my bloude, hathe eternalle lyfe.
Whych wordes cannot be verified
nor trulie ſpoken of the eating
of the ſacramente. For many eate
that to their eternal dānacion.

by Chriſtes wordes of his promiſes
made vnto vs, they could not
do, if the breade were chaūged into
Chriſtes naturall bodye. Alſo
if the bread & wyne be not chaunged
into Chriſtes naturall body
and bloud, bi the word (as in ded
they be not but the ſubſtaunces
remayne in their nature) yet, yf
we hearing ye promes of GOD
declared vnto vs, that his bodye
was betrayed for vs, & hys bloud
ſhed for the remiſſion of our ſynnes,
beleue the ſame, and receiue
ye ſacramēt: we then eate Chriſtes
naturall body and bloude in ſpirit
and fayth to our euerlaſtinge
lyfe, although, we beleue not any
maner of tranſubſtancion of the
bread into Chriſtes natural bodi
and the wine into Chriſtes natural
bloude. But by ſuch tranſubſtancion
the receyuer of the ſacrament
ſhould alſo receiue Chriſtes

body and bloud. If the bread and
wyne were chaūged into Chriſtes
natural bodi & bloud, And thē as
I haue ſayd, the moſt wicked Infidels
myght, (eating the Sacrament)
eat alſo Chriſtes fleſhe and
drink his bloud which is not onli
againſt the ſaiynge of the bleſſed
martyrſ. Ciprian, Hillarius, and
ſaint Auguſtine: but alſo againſt
the ſaieynge of Chriſte, whyche
ſayth, he that eatethe my fleſhe,
and drinketh my bloude, he dwelleth
in me, and I in hym, whyche
no vnfaythfull can dooe. For as
Chriſt ſayth the ſeruaunt dwelleth
not in the houſe for euer.
            ¶Therfore the faithful beleuer
in Chriſt is ſure to eate Chriſtes
fleſhe and dryncke hys bloude, to
hys eternall health, although he
neuer beleue any ſuch groſſe trā
               ſubſtanciacion:
And the vnfaythful,
can neuer eate hys fleſh (as

Saynt Auguſtine ſaieth) he whyche
eateth my fleſhe,Auguſtin xxv▪ treateſe vpon Iohn▪
                and drinkeeth
my bloude, he dwelleth in me
and I in hym. Thys is therefore
to eate that breade, and dryncke yt
dryncke, to dwell in Chriſt, and to
haue Chriſt dwelling in him. And
therfore he which dwelleth not in
Chriſte: & in whom Chriſt dwelleth
not, doubtles eateth not Chriſtes
fleſhe nor drinketh his bloud
although to his iudgmēt, he eate
the ſacramēt of ſo great a thing.
Alſo ye ſame doctour ſaint Auguſttine
again ſaith, truly this bread,
requireth the hongre of ye inward
man.Auguſtine. xx▪ vi. treatiſe vpon Iohn▪
                For bleſſed be they whych
hungr and thyrſte for rightuouſnes,
verily to beleue in hym, that
is to eate the liuing bread: he whiche
beleueth in hym, eateth inuiſibli
and is filled becauſe he is inuiſibly
borne againe.
            ¶Wherfore doubtles, the ſpirituall

eatynge of Chriſtes bodye,
(which is to beleue in him) is only
ye godli eating of Chriſtes, fleſh
and drinkyng hys bloud, and not
thys outwarde bodilye eatynge
wyth theyr teeth, fayne they neuer
ſo craftelie. This falſe tranſubſtantiacion
which repugneth
agaynſt all the auncient writers,
and alſo agaynſt the holie ſcriptures
whyche be declared by the
mouthe of Paule,

                     •
                  . ſaiyng, I wyll
not brethren yt ye bee ignoraunt,
that all our fathers were vnder
a cloude, and all paſſed the ſea,
and all were baptiſed in Moſes,
and in the cloude, and in the ſea,
and all dyd eate one ſpirituall-meate,
and all dranke one ſpirituall
drynke, they drancke of the
ſpirituall rocke, whiche folowede
them, the rocke trulie was Chriſt
And if our fathers before Chri,ſtes
incarnacion, and we that be

leue nowe: do eate one ſpiritual
meate & drink one ſpiritual drink
(but oure Fathers dyd not eate
Chryſtes naturall, and reall bodie,
nor dryncke hys reall bloude,
whych, two thouſande yeares after
was not incarnated, nor had
any naturall bodie) therefore we
do not nowe eate hys reall bodie
in hys bodelie preſence, in the ſacrament,
as theſe by ther trāſubſtantiacion
pretende. For we eate
the ſame that our fathers did eate
which eating was by faith. Ergo
euen ſo muſte we eate by faythe
Chriſtes fleaſhe and drynke hys
bloude in the ſacrament, and not
wyth our teeth reallie, if we wylbee
ſaued by the eatynge of Chriſtes
fleſhe & drynkyng his bloud
as they were.
            ¶All the auncient writers writ
and teach that we eate Chriſtes
bodie and drinke his bloud in the

ſacrament, in a myſterie, that is
in a ſimilitude, whych cannot be
eſtemed reallye, for they be contraies
For to eate a reall thing is
with the mouth to eate naturallie
the ſubſtaunce, but al miſteries be
receyued & eaten wyth the mynde
and not bi anye bodelie meanes
And therfore the ſacrament is called
of moſt auncient writers, Panis
miſticus, A myſticall breade
which was ordeyned to feade and
comforte the ſoules, and not for ye
bodie.

vertue of the worde ſpoken bi the

Chriſtes naturall fleſh and bloud

            NOw Chriſten reader, I
truſt thou perceiueſt, that

be two thinges to be conſidered,
the one is the viſyble ſubſtance,

It can not be otherwiſe receyued,

we muſt be circumſpecte & welware,
yt we defile not oure ſelues
wyth any fylthy luſtes & ſynnes
wherby we ſhoulde be become a
               
                  •
               ylthy,
croked, and roten, member
wherof our head Ieſu Chriſt
ſhoulde not reioyce, but rather be
a ſhamed, and ſo worthi to be cut
of from the body. And then euen
as ye braūch of ye tree whē it is cut
of from the tre, receyueth nor taketh
any more ſappe iuyſe or naturall
moyeſtnes of the tree, and
therfore widdereth, dryeth and
becometh deade, apte only for the
fyer. In like maner if we thorow

oure obſtynate perſeueraunce in
ſynne, be deuided from god, as ye
prophets Eſai & Hieremy ſaith &
be no myſticall mēbre of Chriſtes
church his myſticall body:Hieremy. v. then
can we receiue, no more fauoure
grace nor lyfe, from Chriſte, but
ſhal widder, die, and be apte only
for the Hell fier vntyll it pleaſeth
god of mere mercy and grace, Euen
as it were by his grace and
infinyte power, & no leſſe by hys
myracles, contrary to our nature
to graffe vs newly into Chriſtes
myſticall body, & endeue vs with
his, new and heauenly ſpirite. Of
the other parte if we be faythfull
warriars of Chriſt, and ſtriue cō
               ſtantly
againſt the deuel, ye world
and the fleſhe, and beleue faythefully
that by and thorow Chriſte
we ſhall ouercome the ſame, we
ſhall doubteles be accepted and
reputed and taken before god as

his naturall mēbres, euen fleſhe
of his fleſhe & bones of his bones
Such as he cā not but loue, cheriſhe,
and fauoure, for who dyde
euer hate his owne fleſhe, but did
noriſhe & cheriſhe it?Epheſ. vi. ſaith Paule.
Seing than that we be his naturall
membres euen fleſhe of hys
fleſhe and bones of his bones: as
Sinne hell and death could not
preuaile, agaynſt Chriſt: So cā
they not preuaile agaynſt vs, no
wythholde vs from Chriſte, fowe
be one wyth Chriſt, & we muſt
nedes be where he is, accordynge
to the prayer of Chriſt in the xvii
of Iohn ſaying.Iohn. xvii. Holy father kepe
thē in thy name whome thou haſt
geuen me, that they maye be one,
as we be, father whom thou haſt
geuen to me I will, where I am
that they be with me, that is to be
in heauen, & to haue eternall lyfe
as Chriſt there ſaythe, father the

houre cometh, claryfy thy ſonne,
that thy ſonne may claryfi the, as
thou haſt geuen to hym, power ouer
all fleſhe that all, that thou
haſt geue to him: he may gyue to
them, eternall lyfe. If we be one
wyth our head Chriſt, and in heauen
wyth hym to whome alſo he
hath geuen eternall lyfe: Howe
can ſynne hell or deathe preuayle
agaynſt vs, his liuely membres?
Doubtles it is Impoſſible, wherfore
let oure earneſt ſtudy, prayer
& laboure, be aboue all thynges,
to kepe vs in his myſticall body,
that we may be, lyuely members
of the ſame, according as we profeſſe
vs to be, by this holy cōmunyon
in this bleſſed ſacrament of
his bodye and bloude. Yea moſte
diligently and circumſpectly beware
what thou doeſt loke that
thou diſſemble not, nor lye to the
holy goſt, ther can be no greatter

ſhame nor offence for the, than to
profeſſe before thy friendes & the
hole cōgregatiō, wyth thy mouth
countenāce and behauiour to be
a faithfull Chriſtian, And vtterly
to deny the ſame in thy herte,
wordes, & deades, And although
thou canſte, thus colourably diſſemble,
and falſelye diſceyue, the
Chriſten congregation, yet canſt
yu neuer deceyue Chriſte, whyche
knoeth ye inward & ſecret thoughtes
& fayned imagynaciōs of thy
hert. Therfore I coūſel ye Chriſtē
reader, that thou Iuſtely truely,
and diligently, examen thy lyfe,
and conſider well wyth thy ſelfe,
whether thou be, a conſtant warry
it agaynſt ſynne. Proue whether
thou purpoſe erneſtli, and cō
               ſtantlie,
ſo to continew vnto the
death, & alſo whether thou haue
vnite peace and herty vnfayued
loue, towardes al ye congregaciō
               
whych is moſt manyfeſtly expreſſed
& ſignyfied by this ſacramēt

thē laſt, try thy ſelfe whether thou
beleue fayethfully to haue remiſſion
of thy ſynnes and eternall
lyfe thorow Chriſtes paſſion and
death onely, and not by any other
merits of ſayntes, prayers, or holy
workes of thy owne, or of any
other creature lyueyng or deade.
If thou be fullye perſwaded and
determyned in all theſe thinges
before wrytten, then mayeſt thou
boldely come to this holy table, &
to confirm thy fayth, receiue this
