               To the noble Knight, Sr HORRACE VERE, Generall of the English-forces in the Low-countries. AND To the most worthy Lady, the Lady MARY VERE his Wife, my most respected and religious Parishioners.
            
            
               THere are three things incite me, to Dedicate this little direction to your Lordship and my Lady:

The first is to testifi
                  •…
                hereby vnto the world my vnfained estimation of those sauing grace and the true religion that dwels in you both The second is, to ex presse hereby my great desire to shew my thankefulnesse, for the many fauours I haue receiued, but especially for all the incouragements wherewith I haue beene refreshed in obseruing your loue to my Ministerie,

aad care in your selues and your familie to shew the profit of it. The third is, because it pleased your Lordship and my Lady heretofore, to desire and accept directions of this kinde from me, in writing.
            I haue beene the willinger to suffer this copy to come into publike view, because I haue beene vrged by many friends from diuers places

of late, to giue them Directions of this kind: and I haue long obserued that in the most places the godly that are vnlearned, are at a great want of a setled course herein. If it may please your Lordshippe and my Lady to afford this little worke, your acceptation and countenance, I shall be richly satisfied. My hope is that the Lord that hath as it were called for it by

the request of many well disposed, will bee pleased to giue a blessing to it: if any thing be now wanting, by the intimation of my friends, I may make further supply in after Editions, if God will.
            The Lord multiplie grace & ioy with righteousnesse and peace in both your hearts and liues, and prolong with increase your Lordships honour and good successe

in your militarie calling, in which you haue beene hitherto a speciall ornament to this Nation. I end and rest
            
               Yours in the seruice of my ministery to be commanded,
N: BIFEILD.
            
         
         
            
            The Preface.
            
               THESE directions for reading the SCRIPTVRES containe three things. First Analyticall tables, concerning the order of the whole SCRIPTVRES, and the seuerall bookes and Chapters gathered to this end, that the Reader might before hee reads, marke the drift of each booke and Chapter, and when hee hath read, might with singular ease and

delight remember, what hee hath read. The second is a Calendar, shewing what number of chapters are to be read euery day, that so the whole Bible might bee read ouer in a yeere. The number of Chapters, while you are reading the olde Testament is for the most part three a day, and when you come to the new Testament, it is but two: Sometimes where the matter is Historicall, or Typicall, or the chapters short, I haue set downe a greater number. The third thing is the Rules for obseruation of profitable things in reading. Many complaine of their not profiting in reading, and some weake Christians afflict their

hearts maruellously with griefe and feare, because they cannot read with more comfort and profit, when the fault is not in their affection to the word, so much as in their want of direction for their reading.
            Concerning these Rules I consider both the matter, and the maner of vsing them. For the matter, hee that comes to read the Scriptures, should especially set himselfe to obserue two things: First the most needfull places to enlarge his owne knowledge, and further his owne growth in the true grace of God. Secondly such places, as might warrant his practise in the things, the world vsually cauills at and reprocheth

his profession for: as if hee did not what were necessary to doe. There are some things in all places obiected against the godly. Now it is a thing of admirable vse in our reading to gather vnder the seuerall heads such places, as may establish our hearts with abundance of assurance, that we do nothing out of precisenesse and curiositie in those things: but meerly at the commandement of God. And the Scriptures are so apparant, and easie to bee discerned, and so many in number, that the simplest Reader may gather great store of testimonies.
            Now for the first of these, that is, such places as might most profit me in my particuler reading:

I would bring this minde to the Scriptures. (I will but giue a tast here.)
            First it were a thing of admirable vse all my life long, if I did set downe all the places of Scripture, that in the reading I finde sensible comfort and rauishing of heart in: It may be in the whole Bible I may finde 20. 40. 50. &c. of such places, as I was sure in the reading did wonderfully fill my heart with secret refreshing, and sensible ioy: Now these places so noted, not onely serue for present vse, but while I liue, in any distresse, I may haue recourse to these, as so many wells of ioy, and if in my griefe one, or two, or tenne of them did not comfort mee:

yet a thousand to one some of them will haue spirit and life in them to refresh me againe in any sorrowes: Besides, it maruellously establisheth my faith, when I remember, in how many distinct places of Scripture the Lord was pleased to comfort me in particular. This is one thing now wee should obserue.
            Secondly would it not be exceeding profitable; If I did note all the places of scripture which in reading of them did sensibly smite my heart, and reprooue some fault in mee, so as I felt my heart troubled within mee? Certainely by that time I had gone through the Scriptures, I should see the Anatomy of my

corruptions, and plainely perceiue, what things there were in my nature, that God had a quarrell against: and so might bee guided by the very finger of God to know the faults, I should set my selfe most against in mortification.
            Thirdly, in reading one shall finde sometimes certaine rules or counsells giuen, which one sensibly is affected withall, and hath an inward desire, Oh that I could but remember this counsell of the holy Ghost, Now I would note all those places, that the holy Ghost made me in loue withall in the reading, that might concerne my own particular direction either at home, or abroad.
            
               
Againe, the most people in the midst of these extreame differences of opinions on all sides, feele sometimes a wonderfull desire, such as this, O that I could tell but some certaine way what to beleeue, and then let all the world contend, if they will: Now for this I would marke all those apparant places, that containe euident ground of truth, against which there can be in my conscience no cauill, but I could liue and die in the assurance, that that is the wil of God. It is incredible, how the simplest may settle themselues herein, in all the fundamentall points of religion. If thou finde of these but 20. 30. 40. or 50. places in the whole Bible; thou

canst not now beleeue, how it will settle thee: As for example, 1. Ioh. 5. he faith, There are three in heauen, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, and these three are one. All the world now should neuer make me doubt of the Trinitie in vnitie. When I had gotten those grounds, those I would sticke to
                  •…
               , and for other questions, let them wrangle while they will, I would receiue further light when I saw it cleere, but their quarrelling should not much trouble me. And thus I might go on with the particulars of the first sort of rules, but these shall suffice to giue light to the course.
            Now for the second sort of

Rules one may finde in euery place certaine things, strongly obiected against the practise of the godly: As for example, that they deserue to bee hated, because they will not keepe company with their neighbours, and because they stand so precisely vpon small matters, as lesser othes, and doing slight workes vpon the sabbath day, and such like: and besides, many men are afraide to enter vpon such a course of life, because it is a way so euill spoken of, and reproched in the world &c. Now for my owne establishment I would marke, where my course differed from other men, and in reading I would gather euident places, that might warrant my

practise: As for example, places that iustifie the auoiding of the company of the wicked, and so againe places, that shew, that the sincere practise of godlines hath beene euer liable to the scornes, reproches, and slaunders of the world. And so of the rest.
            Now for the maner of vsing these rules, I thinke, thou maist profitably follow these directions. First make thee a little paper booke of a sheete or two of paper, as may be most portable: then write vpon the toppe of euery leafe the title for that that thou wouldest obserue in reading. Chuse out only six or eight titles out of the whole number of such at for the present

thou hast most neede to obserue: or onely so many as thou art sure thy memory will easily cary to thy reading, whether more or fewer. In reading obserue onely such places as stare thee in the face, that are so euident, thy heart cannot looke of them. Trouble not thy selfe with that obiection, that there are many things which thou canst not discerne, take thou onely such as thou canst not passe ouer, they are so cleare and euident. In noting the places, set downe vnder each title only the booke, Chapter, and verse, and not the words, for that will tire thee in the end: As for example, would I obserue all the hard places, which

in reading I haue a desire to know the meaning of, that so when I come into the company of Preachers or able Christians, I might haue profitable questions to propound: I would set it downe thus,

                  Hard places,
                  
                     Malach. 4. 5.
                  
                  
                     Malach. 2. 6.
                  
               
And so of other places: for I giue these on the suddaine but for instance sake. Now when thou hast done thy quarters taske, or thy yeeres taske, then thou maist write out the th
                  •…
               isest things, as thou thinkest good, and in the meane time hast the vse of the places for turning to. And if thou shouldest in reading, of thy selfe

remember some title, which thou hast not in this direction, and yet hast a great desire to obserue places of that kinde, by any meanes write it downe, whilest thou thinkest of it, and custome in obseruing will make thee able to bee thine owne Directour hereafter. Looke not at the profit of this course the first weeke, or month: but consider, how rich it will make thee at the yeeres end. I am perswaded, if thou feare God, thou wouldst not sell thy collections for a great price, after thou hast gathered them, if it were but for the good, they may doe thee in the euill day, when it shall come vpon thee.
            Farewell, the Lord giue

thee a blessing, and pray thou for mee, and remember before thou read to lift vp thy heart to God in some short eiaculations, to beg his blessed assistance, and take heede thou be not vnthankefull to God for the successe.
            By all meanes striue to keeepe a delight in thy course, and let not thy heart bee too apt to discouragement: but reioyce in the Lord. Againe farewell: the Lord keep thee till the day of Christ.
         
      
      
         
            
               
               
               The order of the Bookes, and of reading the whole SCRIPTVRES.
               
                  
                     THe Booke you are to read is the Bible: your Bible is diuided into 2: parts, the old Testament, and the New.
               
               The olde TESTAMENT containes the Law and the Prophets.
               The Law is expressed in the fiue bookes of Moses, called the Pentateuche.
               
               The PROPHETS, comprehend three kindes of writings:
               
                  
                  1. History (principally) from Iosua to Iob, called the anterior Prophets.
                  
                  2. Doctrine (principally) from Iob to Esay, called the Hagiographa.
                  
                  3. Prophesie specially taken (principally) from Esay to the end of Malachy, called the posterior Prophets.
                  
               
               
                  The new Testament containes:
               
               
                  1. History (principally) in the foure Euangelists, and the Actes.
                  
                  2. Doctrine (principally) in the Epistles.
                  
                  3. Prophesie in the Reuelation.
                  
               
               That, which you are first then to read, is the Law in the fiue bookes of Moses: which bookes intreate,
               1. First of the originall and

state of the Church, in the beginning (to whom the Law was giuen) in Genesis.
               
               2. Secondly of the promulgation or publication of the Law, which was giuen either generally, the lawes Ecclesiasticall, and Politicall together, and so in Exod. 9. or specially and apart, and so the Lawes Ecclesiasticall are giuen in Leuiticus, the Lawes Politicall are giuen in Numbers.
               
               3. Thirdly the repetition of the Law in Deuteronomy.
               
               
                  
                  GENESIS.
                  IN Genesis you shall read:
                  
                     1: First of the creation of the Church, chap: 1. 2. 3.
                     2. Secondly of the constitution of the Church. from Chapter 4. to the end.
                  
                  In the creation obserue the making,
                  
                     First of the World, in which the Church was to liue, Chap. 1.
                     Secondly of Man, of which it was to consist: in whom consider

                  The constitution of the Church must bee considered as it was in the two worlds: the olde world before the floode, from chap. 4. to 8. and the new world after the floode, of which chapter 8. to the ende of the booke.
                  In the old world consider.
