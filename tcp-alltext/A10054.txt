AND EXCELLENCIE
OF VVOMANKYNDE.
            
               
                  ALMYGHTY God
the maker & nouriſher
of all thynges,
the Father
and goodneſſe of
both male and female,
of hys great bountyfulnes,
hath create mankynde lyke vnto
hym ſelfe, he made them man and
woman.Gen. 1. The diuerſitie of which
two kyndes, ſtandeth onely in the
ſondry ſituation of the bodily partes,
in whiche the vſe of generation
requireth a neceſſary differēce,
He hath giuen but one ſimilitude
and lykenes of the ſowle, to bothe
male and female, betwene whoſe
ſowles there is noo maner dyfference

of kynd. The woman hathe
that ſame mynd that a man hath,
that ſame reaſon and ſpeche, ſhe
gothe to the ſame ende of blyſfulnes,
where ſhall be noo exception
of kynde.Luc. 20. For after the euangelicall
truthe,Marc. 12. they that ryſe in theyr
owne proper kynde,Matt. 22. ſhall not vſe
the offyce of theyr kynde, but the
lykenes of angelles is promyſed
vnto theym. And thus betwene
man and woman by ſubſtance of
the ſoule, one hath no higher preemynence
of nobylytye aboue the
other, but both of them naturally
haue equall libertie of dignitie
and worthyneſſe. But all other
thynges, the which be in man, beſydes
the dyuyne ſubſtance of the
ſowle, in thoſe thynges the excellente
and noble womanheed in a
maner infynytely dothe excell the

rude groſſe kynd of men, the whiche
thyng we ſhall playnly proue
to be true, not with counterfayte
and fayre flatteryng wordes, nor
alſo with the ſubtyll ſophimes of
Logike, wherwith many ſophiſters
were wont to blynde and deceyue
men, but by the auctorytye
of moſte excellent auctours, and
true writers of hiſtorys, and with
manifeſt reaſons, yea with the teſtimonies
of holye ſcrypture, and
by the ordynances and conſtitutions
of lawes.
            ¶Fyrſt to enter into this matter
the womā is made ſo muche more
excellent than man, in howe moche
the name that ſhe hathe receyued,
is more excellente than hys.
For Adam ſoundeth Erthe, but
Eua is interpretate lyfe: and as
moche as the lyfe doth excel erth.

ſo moche the woman is to be preferred
aboue the man. Nor there
is no cauſe why this ſhulde be called
a feble argumēt, to gyue iugement
of thynges by the names.
            For we knowe, that the hyghe artyficer
and maker of thinges and
names, fyrſt dyd knowe the thynges,
before he named them, which
for as moch as he could not be deceyued,
for thys purpoſe he made
the names, that it myght expreſſe
the nature, propertye, and vſe of
the thynge. For the trouthe of
antyque names is ſuche, as the
veraye Romayne lawes teſtyfye,
that the ſelfe names are conſonāt
to the thinges, and manifeſt ſignifications
of them. Therfore an argument
of the names of thinges
amonges dyuynes and lawyars,
is of greate weyghte. As we rede

written of Nabal, after his name
is a fole, and folyſhenes is with
him. Of this Paule in hys Epiſtle
to the Hebrewes,Hebr. 1. purpoſynge
to ſhewe the excellency of Chryſte
vſeth this argument, ſayeng: that
he is made as moch more excellēt
than the aungels, as he hath enherited
a name more excellente than
they. And in an other place, God
hath gyuen hym a name,Phil. 2. the whiche
is aboue al names, that in the
name of Ieſu, euery knee ſhall
bowe both of thynges in heauen,
of thynges vpon earth & of thynges
vnder theearth. Further (this
thynge to approue) there is no
ſmal ſtrengthe of lawes, comprehended
and conteyned in the bondes
of wordes, in ſignification of
wordes, in conditions and demonſtrations,
in conditions annexed,

and ſuche other kyndes of dyſputations,
and highe poyntes, and
tytles of the lawe, as in the ſame
tytles, and other lyke, a man may
perceyue. For ſoo we make argumente
and reaſons in the lawe of
the interpretation of the name, alſo
of the ſtrength of the word and
vocable. Moreouer, of the interpretation
of the name, and alſo of
the dyfynytion, and compoſition
and order of the worde. For the
lawes theym ſelfes do quyckelye
and ſharpely conſyder the ſignifications
of the names, that of thē
they myghte ſome thynge interpretate.
            ¶Alſo Cyprian againſte the Iewes
argueth,Cyprl. de montibus Syna et Syon that the fyrſte man,
Adam, receyued hys name of the
iiii. princypal partes of the world,
that is, Eaſt, weaſt, North, and

Southe, and in the ſame boke he
dothe expound the ſame name, Adam,
becauſe erth was made fleſh,
althoughe ſuche expoſition dothe
dyffer from the tradition and teachyng
of Moſes, ſens among the
Hebrewes it is not wrytten with
foure but with .iii. letters. Yet for
all that, this expoſition in ſo holy
a man is not to be dyſprayſed, for
as moche as he was not lerned in
the Hebrewe tongue, the whiche
verye many ſaynctes and expoſytours
of holye ſcrypture, to theyr
ſmall blame knewe not. But if I
can not haue lyke leaue and liber
tye for the prayſe of womanheed,
after my mynde and iugement, to
vſe lyke etymologie and declaration
of the word and name of Eue,
at the leaſte lette me be ſuffered to
ſpeake this one thynge out of the

miſticall decrees, and agreeable
wylles of the Cabaliſtis, the very
name of a woman to haue more
affinitie with the ineffable and in
enarrable name of the diuine power
almyghtye, called Tetragrammaton,
than the name of man, the
whiche with the name of god, neither
in letters nor in figure, nor in
nombre doth agree.
            ¶But nowe we wyll leaue theſe
thynges, for they be redde of few,
and of fewer vnderſtande & they
requyre a longer proceſſe than is
mete to be ſpoken of here. In the
meane ſeaſon, we wol ſerche oute
the excellencie of womanheed, not
of the name onely, but of the very
thynges, dueties, and merites.
            Therfor let vs (as they ſay) ſerch
the ſcriptures and takynge oure
grounde at the fyrſte creation, let

vs diſpute and reaſon, what dignitie
woman obteyned aboue mā,
whanne ſhe was fyrſte made. We
knowe, that whatſo euer god almyghty
made, do chiefely differre
in this point, that certain of them
ſhuld abyde and remayn for euer
more incorruptible and withoute
putrifaction, and certaine ſhuld
be ſubiecte vnto corruption, mutabilitie
and change. And in creatynge
thoſe thynges, god proceded
forwarde, after thys order he
beganne at the more noble and excellente
of one thynge, and ended
at the moſt noble of an other. And
thus he created incorruptible angels
and ſoules: for ſo doth ſaint
Auguſtyne diſpute & reaſon,Aug. ſup. Gen. li. 7. that
the ſoules of our fyrſte parentes,
were created with angels, before
the bodyes were made. Furthermore

he created incorruptible bodies,
as the heuēs, the ſterres and
the elementes incorruptible, but
ſubiecte to dyuers mutations: of
the whiche he made al other thinges
that be ſubiecte vnto corruption.
From the more vyler by ſeuerall
degrees and orders of dignitie,
agayne aſcendynge and goinge
vp vnto the perfection of the
hole worlde. Firſte he made minerals:
thanne thynges vegetable
plantes and trees: after that thinges
lyuinges,Gen. 2. than brute beaſtes,
ſome crepynge, ſome ſwymmyng,
ſome fleynge. Fynally he created
two creatures lyke to hym ſelfe,
fyrſt the male, and laſt the female:
in whiche female, the heuens, the
erthe, and al the goodly ornament
of the ſame, were perfeyted and
fully finiſhed. For the maker commynge

to the creation of woman;
reſted at her, as hauynge before
his handes nothynge more honorable
to be made, and in her al the
wiſedome and power of the creator
came to concluſion and ende:
after the which there can no creature
be found or imagined. Than
ſeing a woman is the laſt of creatures,
the full ende, moſte perfect
of all goddis workes, and of the
ſame the very perfection: who woldeny
a woman to be the moſt worthy
& moſte excellent of all creatures?
without whom ye very world,
nowe beynge fyniſhed, and in all
thynges moſte perfectely accomplyſſhed,
ſhulde haue ben vnperfecte,
the whiche coude none other
wyſe be perfyted, thanne with the
mooſte perfecteſt of al creatures.
For it were ageynſt reaſon and a

thynge, vnſemely to thynke, that
god wold finiſh ſogret a worke in
any vnperfect thing. But bicauſe
the world it ſelfe, as the abſolute,
hole, and moſt perfect cyrcle, was
created of god, the ſame cyrcle
muſt nedes be ended in that lyttel
parte, whiche myghte couple and
ioyne within it ſelfe the fyrſte of
all thynges with the laſte of all
thynges with one knotte. So a
woman, whanne the worlde was
made, was the laſte in tyme, and
laſte made: and the ſame woman
partly in auctoryty, but chefely in
dignitie, was the fyrſt of all thinges,
conceyued in the mynde of
god as it is wrytten of her by the
prophete: Before the heuens were
made, god dyd choſe her, and he
choſe her, before all other creatures.
For this is a common concluſion

among philoſophers (if I
maye vſe theyr wordes)Ariſt. vl. 8. de auditu. The ende
alway is in the fyrſt entētion, and
in the dede is the laſte. So a woman
was the laſte worke of god,
formed into thys world as quene
of the ſame, into her prepared palayce,
garnyſhed with all pleaſures
plentyfully. Therfore euerye
creature worthely loueth reuerenceth
& ſerueth her, and worthyly
is ſubiect, and obeyeth vnto her,
which is of al creatures the abſolute
quene, ende, perfeccion, & glory
by al ways and meanes. Wherfore
the wyſe man ſaythe,Sapi. 8. Who ſo
hath god with him, reioyſeth, and
in harte cōmendeth the gentil nature
of woman, ye and the lord of
all thynges hym ſelfe loueth her.
            ¶By reaſon of the place alſo, in
whiche the woman was created,

howe farre ſhe paſſeth man in nobleneſſe,
holy wrytte doth witneſſe
vnto vs mooſte plentifullye. For
where the woman was made in
Paradyſe, a place mooſte noble
and pleaſaunt, amonge aungelles:
the man was made withoute
Paradyſe, in the wyelde fyelde amonge
brute beaſtes. Afterward,
to thintent, that woman ſhuld be
created, he was brought into Paradyſe.
And therfore the woman,
endowed with the peculyar gyfte
of Nature, as ſhe were accuſtomed
to be in the hygheſt place of
her creatiō, though ſhe loke down
ward from neuer ſo high a place,
yet ſhe neyther ſuffreth nor feleth
any whitling or ſwimming in her
heed, ne her eies dafyl not, like as
it is wonte to chaunce to men.
            ¶Furthermore, if it chance a woman

to be in lyke peryll of drownynge
with a man, ſhe without any
outwarde helpe, ſwymmeth a
lofte longer than the man, whiche
ſoner synketh, and goth downe to
the bottom.
            ¶And that the dygnytie of the
place maketh moche to the nobylitie
of manne, the ciuill lawe and
humaine conſtitutions do playnly
affirme, and the cuſtome of all
nations doth chyefly obſerue this
thynge, not onely in men, but alſo
in other beaſtes, yea and in the
eſtimation of thynges hauyng no
lyfe: For the more worthye place,
that any thing is born or brought
vp in, the more noble it is iudged.
Wherfore Iſaac commanded his
ſonne Iacob, that he ſhoulde not
take a wyfe of the lande of Canaan,
but of Meſopotamie in Syria,

beynge of better eſtymation.
And vnto this, is not moche vnlyke,
whiche is ſpoken in the goſpell
of Iohn,Io. 1. where Philip ſaid:
We haue founde Ieſus the ſonne
of Ioſeph of Nazareth. And Nathanael
ſaid to hym: What good
can come oute of Nazareth? But
now let vs speke of other matters
¶A woman doth paſſe a man in
the materiall ſubſtance of her creation.
For ſhe was not made of any
creature wantyng lyfe & ſoule,
or of the vyle clay or dyrte, as the
man was, but of a matter purified
and lyuely, hauyng a reaſonable
ſoule, and a godly minde. Furthermore,
god made manne of the
erthe, whiche naturally bryngeth
forthe all kyndes of beaſtes and
lyuely creatures, by the working
togither of the heuenloy influence:

but the woman, aboue al heuenly
influence and promptues of nature,
and without any other operation
& power, was onely made
of god, full ſtedfaſt and perfite in
all thinges, the man in the meane
ſeaſon loſynge one of his rybbes,
of the whiche ſhe was made, that
is to ſay, Eue of Adam ſleping, and
that ſo ſoundly, that he could not
fele his ribbe plucked away. And
thus, man is the worke of nature,
and womanne the worke of god.
And therfore the woman is many
tymes more apt and mete then the
man, to receyue the heuenly light
and bryghtnes, and is ofte replenyſhed
thet with: whiche thyng is
eaſy to be ſene, by her clenlyneſſe,
& marueylous faire beautye. For
ſeyng that beautie it ſelfe is none
other thyng, but the clere brightnes

of goddes viſage naturallye
ſette in thinges, ryght fayre ſhynynge
in the beautifull bodies of
creatures: he therfore hath choſen
women before men, to be far more
endowed, and moſte abundantly
repleniſhed therwith. The propre
body of a woman in ſyght and felynge,
is moſte delicate and pleaſant:
her fleſhe ſofte and tender:
her colour faire and clere: her ſkin
ſofte and ſlyke, her head comelye,
and decked with heare ſofte lyke
ſylke, long, and ſhynyng lyke the
golde wyre: her countenaunce ſobre:
her loke and chere merye and
pleaſaunt: her face moſte fayre of
all creatures, her necke white as
milke: her forhed large and high:
her eies rollyng and ſhyning like
criſtall, verye amyable gladſome
and gratious: her browes aboue

them, wel ſette togyther in propre
thyn circles, with a comely playnneſſe,
deuided equally with a feate
diſtaunce, betwene the which, out
of the middeſt, diſcendeth the noſe
ſtrayghte and treatiſe: vnder the
which is her ruddy mouthe, with
ſoft and tender lyppes, ful proprely
proporcioned: within the whiche,
whan ſhe ſmyleth, her teeth
do ſhyne forthe, beinge but lyttell
ones, and ſette in egall order, as
white as the yuory, and not ſo many
in numbre as a man hath, for
ſhe is nother greatte eater, bytar,
nor gnawer: And rounde aboute
them ryſe vp her iawes, & chekes,
with tender ſoftnes, as ruddy as
roſe, and replenyſhed with ſhamfaſtnes:
her chynne rounde, with
a prety pyt therin. Under this ſhe
hath a ſmall necke, ſomwhat long

and ſtreighte vpryght frome her
rounde ſhulders, with a delycate
weſande, whytely, and meanlye
thicke and bigge: her voyce ſmal
and ſhrylle: her ſpeche lowe and
ſwete: her breaſte brode and well
ſette out, clothed with euen fleſhe
and hardnes of her pappes, whiche
are round and euen as her bely
is: her ſydes are ſofte and tender:
her backe playn and ſtreyght
her armes long and ful: her handes
white and ſofte, with fingers
longe and ſmall, ſtretched forth a
length from the ioyntes, and proprely
ſet and knytte to gither: her
hyppes, thyes, and legges, well
brawned fleſhy and full: her fingers
endes and toos are propre &
rounde, lyke a lyttel circle, and al
the partes of her body well furniſhed
with humour. More ouer,

her pace and going is right comely:
her mouynge honeſt: her port
and chere very cōmendable: and
in the order of al the body, in ſhap
figure proportion and diſpoſition
aboue al other ſhe is farre the faireſt
creature. In al the hole heape
of creatures, there is noo thynge
ſo wonderfull to ſee, ne noo miracle
ſo maruaylouſe to beholde. In
ſo moche, that there is no man, excepte
he be ſtarke blynde, but he
maye ſee, that god hym ſelfe conieſted
and heaped togyther in woman,
what ſo euer was beautiful
in all the holle world: which cauſeth
euery creature to be aſtonyed
and amaſed at her: yea and many
wayes they louen and worſhyppe
her: in ſo moch that we ſe it chance
ofte tymes, that the bodiles ſpirites
and diuels are ardently taken

and rauyſhed with the beautie of
women, out of al meaſure: which
opinion is not falſe, but the truth
by many experyences is notablye
knowen. And to paſſe ouer thoſe
thynges, that the poetes haue left
to vs in wrytynge, of the loue of
the goddes, and of theyr louers &
coneubines, as of Apollo, Daphnes,
Neptunus, Salmonea, Hercules,
Hebe, Iole, Omphale, and
of the other goddis louers, ye and
many of Iupiters him ſelf: This
gyfte of beaute ſo diuine, ſo beloued
of god and man, holye wrytte
in many places doth hyghly commende
and prayſe, aboue al other
gyftes and qualities.Gen. 9. For it is red
in Geneſis, That the chyldren of
god, ſeinge the daughters of men
that they were faire, did choſe and
toke vnto theym wyues, ſuche as

they liked. We rede alſo of Sara,
the wyfe of Abraham,Gen. 12. that ſhe
was fayre, yea the faireſt of al women
on the erthe. Soo whan the
ſeruant of Abraham,Gen 24. had ſene Rebecca,
a maide of excellēt beautye,
he ſaid ſecretly to hym ſelfe, This
is ſhe, whiche god hath prepared
for Iſaac the ſonne of Abraham.
And Abigail, the wyfe of the wicked
churle Naball, was prudente
wyſe and fayre: wherby ſhe ſaued
the life and goodes of her huſbād
from the furye of kynge Dauid.1. Reg. 15.
and the yuell man was ſaued by
the fayre woman, for Dauid ſayd
to her theſe wordes: Go peaſably
into thy houſe: loo, I haue harde
thy voyce, and honoured thy face.
For ſeynge that all beautie is, eyther
ſpirituall, vocal, or corporal,
Abigail was all fayre, in prudency

of ſpirite, in eloquēce of ſpech,
and beautie of body: whiche cauſed
Dauid, after the dethe of Naball
her huſbande, to take her to
his wyfe.2. Reg. 11. And Bathſaba, was a
womanne of ſo excellent beautie,
that Dauid, beinge rauiſhed and
taken with her loue, after the deth
of her huſband, exalted her aboue
all other, to be his wyfe & queene.
Alſo Abiſag,3. Reg. 1. a Sunamite, by reaſon
ſhe was a mayden moſt faire,
was choſen out, to lye with kyng
Dauid, waxinge very olde, to reſtore
his naturall hete. Wherfore
the aged kynges wyll was, highly
to aduance her in honour. And
alſo after the dethe of this mighty
kynge, ſhe was enterteyned as
a queene.Heſter. 1. et. 2, We rede of the excellent
beautie of queene Vaſti and alſo
of Neſter, which was preferrid before

the other, bycauſe ſhe was
more goodlye and fayre of face.
We rede of Iudith,Iu. 8. et. 10. whoſe fayreneſſe
god ſo moche encreaſed, that
all that behelde her, were wonderfully
amaſed.Dan, 13. And ſhortly to ſpeke
we rede that Suſanna was very
delycate goodly and beautiful.
We rede alſo,Iob vlt. in fine. that after Iobs dyuers
temptations, vexations, and
greuous troubles finyſhed, beſydes
all other thynges, whiche his
gret pacience deſerued, god gaue
vnto hym three daughters fayrer
than the three Charites, yea there
were found no where ſo fayre women.
More ouer, we maye rede
hiſtories of holy vyrgins, doubtles
to our gret wonder, howe far,
howe beautyfull they were aboue
al other the childrē of men, whoſe
laude and prayſe the catholyke

churche dothe ſolempnely ſynge:
but ſpecially the prayſe of the immaculate
and vndefiled princeſſe,
the mother of god, the virgin Marie:
whoſe fayre beautie the ſonne
and moone wōder at, from whoſe
moſte fayre viſage, ſo great clerenes
of beautie, with chaſtitie and
holynes dyd ſhyne, that although
ſhe moued the myndes, and lykewyſe
the eies of all men, yet for al
that, no mortall man at any tyme,
was allured or inticed by her beutie,
ones to thynke amyſſe.
            ¶Thoſe thynges (all thoughe
ſome what at lengthe) I haue reherſed
vnto you, and that almoſt
the very ſelfe ſame wordes out of
holy ſcripture, where mention of
beautie is ſo ofte made: to the intent
we ſhulde playnely perceyue,
that the beautie of women is not

onely among men, but alſo of god
hyghly eſtemed and honoured.
            ¶In an other place of holy ſcripture
we lyke wyſe rede,Num. 31. that god
commanded all the men, and men
children, to be ſlayne: but the faire
women to be ſaued.Deut. 21. In the booke
of Deuteronomy it was permytted
to the chyldren of Iſraell, eche
to choſe hym a fayre womanne to
wyfe, of thoſe that were taken pryſoners.
            ¶And beſydes this wounderfull
beautie, woman is endowed with
a certaine dignitie and worthines
of honeſtie, whiche is not gyuen
to man: for the heare of her head
hangeth downe ſoo lowe, that yt
wyll couer and hyde all the pryuy
partes of her body. Farther, it is
not nedefull for a woman, to handle
theſe partes of her body, in the

workes of Nature, whiche man
cuſtomably vſeth to doo. Finally
Nature hathe ſoo wounderfullye
wrought for the comelynes of woman,
that her priuie partes nr not
ſo apparant as mans, but ſet in a
place more ſecretely. And nature
hath gyuen more ſhamfaſines to
woman than to man. Wherfore it
hath ofte chanced, that a woman,
greuouſely dyſeaſed in her prime
partes, hath choſen rather to dye,
than to abyde the ſyght and hand
lynge of the ſurgian, to be cured
and healed. And this ſhamefaſte
honeſtie they obſerue and kepe,
both in dyenge, and after they be
dead: as it appereth by them that
be drowned. For as Plinie and experience
witneſſen, a woman lyeth
grouelyng whan ſhe is deade
by the fauour that nature bereth

to her ſhamefaſte honeſtie: but a
man ſwymmeth vpryghte on his
backe. Farther, the moſt worthye
parte of man, wherby we chiefly
differre from other brute beaſtes,
and doo repreſente the dyuine nature,
is the heade, and in it chiefly
the countinaūce. Truely a mans
heade is deformed with baldnes,
and contrary, a womanne by the
great pryuilege of nature, is not
bald. Moreouer, the countinaūce
and face of man is (by the bearde
to hym hateful) ſo oft defiled and
hyd with filthy heares, that ſcarſe
from brute beaſtes he may be diſcerned,
in woman contrary wiſe,
the face doth alway remayn pure
and comely. Wherfore it was decreed
in the law of the .xii. tables,
that women ſhuld not ſcrape nor
ſhaue theyr chekes, leaſte at any

tyme the bearde ſhuld growe out,
and ſhamfaſtenes be hyd. Alſoo
of the clennes and puritie of woman,
this maye be to all men the
moſte euydent argumente and token:
That a woman ones waſhed
clene ouer, as ofte as ſhe is waſſhed
afterwarde in cleane water,
that water receyueth no ſpotte of
vnclenneſſe: but a man, be he neuer
ſo clene waſſhed, as ofte as he
waſhethe agayne, troubleth and
fouleth the water. Furthermore,
Nature hath ſo ordeyned, that women
auoid ſuperfluous humours
by ſecrete partes, that men auoide
by the face, the moſte worthy part
of mannes body. And where it is
graunted to man aboue all other
beaſtes to haue the face and continaunce
lokynge vppe to heuen:
Nature and fortune haue prouyded

ſo wonderly for woman, and
ſhewed ſo great fauor, that if ſhe
chaunce to fall, ſhe ſeldome or neuer
falleth on her head or face.
            ¶Shall we ouer paſſe, the preferrement
of nature to woman aboue
man, in the procreation of
mankynde? Whyche thynge is
thus very well perceyued. For only
the womans ſeede (as wytneſſen
Galen and Auicen) is the matter
and nouriſhment of the chyld,Galē. 2. de Sparmate &. 14. de vtilitate particularum. Aui doc. S Fen. 1. primi.
and not the mans, whiche is but
an accident to the ſubſtance. For
as the lawe ſayth, the greatteſt &
chiefeſt offyce and duetye of woman,
is to conceyue, and to ſaue
that is conceyued. For which cō
               ſideration
we ſe very many to be
lyke theyr mothers, by reſon they
be begotten of their bloudde: and
this lykenes is very oft well perceyued

in the proportion and makyng
of their bodies, but it is alwayes
in their maners. For if the
mothers be foolyſhe, the chyldren
proue foolyſſhe alſo. If the mothers
be wyſe, the chyldren ſhall
haue a ſent thereof. But contrarye
wyſe it is in the fathers. For
thoughe they be wyſe, ye manye
tymes they gette folyſhe children.
and foolyſſhe fathers gette wyſe
chyldren, ſo that the mothers be
wyſe. And there is none other reſon.
why mothers more than the
fathers, ſhuld loue theyr children,
but that the mothers perceyue,
that theyr chyldren haue, and ſoo
they haue in dede, in theym more
of theyr mothers ſubſtance, than
of theyr fathers. For this cauſe,
that I haue ſhewed you: I ſuppoſe
it naturally grafte in vs, to

be more kynde and louyng to our
mothers, than to our fathers. In
ſo moch, that we ſeme to loue our
father meanely, and to loue oure
mother hartelye. And for this
cauſe, Nature hathe gyuen vnto
women, milk of ſo great ſtrength
and vertue, that it not onely nouriſſheth
infantes and babes, but
alſo reſtoreth ſuch as ar brought
lowe by ſycknes, and is a ſufficiente
foode, to preſerue the lyfe of
thoſe, that are of perfecte age.
            As we rede an example in Valerius
Maximus,Val. li. 5. cap. 4. of a certain yong
woman, whiche with the mylk of
her breaſtes noriſhed her mother
in priſon, that otherwyſe ſhoulde
haue famyſſhed for hunger. For
the whiche pietifull dede, her mother
was deliuered out of pryſon,
and vnto them bothe a perpetual

lyuynge was gyuen. And of that
priſon, they made a Temple, and
called it, The temple of Pitie.
            ¶It is well knowne, that for the
more parte, a woman hath alway
more pite and mercy than a man.
Whiche thynge Ariſtotle doth attribute
to womākynd,Ariſt. de anima. as a thing
appropried therevnto.Eccle. 36. Wherfore
Salomon ſayth: Where as is no
woman, there the ſycke man waileth:
eyther bycauſe, that in ſeruynge
and helpynge the ſicke, ſhe
is full diligent, orels by reaſon of
her mery chere, ſhe is full comfortable:
or els bycauſe that womās
mylke is the chiefe and principall
reliefe for ſuch as be feble & weke,
yea beynge broughte to deathes
doore, they are therby reſtored ageyne
vnto helthe. And the phiſitions
ſay: That the heat of a womans

breaſtes and pappes, layde
and ioyned to the breaſtis of feble
olde men, conſumed a way by age
ſtyrreth vp encreaſeth, and conſerueth
in them lyuely heate.
            Whyche thyng was well knowen
to Dauid, that in his olde aege
choſe the mayden Abiſag, a Sunamite,
with her collynges & clippinges
to hete & kepe him warme.
Alſo woman is rather redye and
more prompt to the holy offyce of
generation, than man, as it is wel
knowen.
            ¶Further it is a wonderful myracle
of Nature, that a womanne
bredynge chylde, ſore longyng for
it, hathe eaten rawe fleſhe, rawe
fyſhe, coles, erth, ſtones, mettals,
poyſons, & many ſuche other lyke
thynges, which without hurt ſhe
doth digeſte, conuerte, and turne

into the holſome nutrimente and
ſubſtance of the body. Now great
myracles and maruailes, that nature
hathe endowed woman with,
ſhal he fynd, that redeth throughly
the volumes and bokes of philoſophers
and phiſitions: whiche
for brefenes we here ouerpaſſe.
            ¶Nowe let vs ſpeake of ſpeche
and langage, whiche is the gyfte
of god, and by whiche one thing
we paſſe and are better than all other
brute beaſtes: Triſmegiſtus
Mercurius iudgeth it to be of as
great pryce, as moch worth, and
as good a thynge, as immortalitie.
And Heſiodus nameth it the
chiefeſt treaſure of Mankynde.
And is not a womā better ſpokē,
more eloquent, more copious and
plentyfull of wordes than a man?
Do not all we, that be men, lerne

firſt to ſpeke of our mothers, or of
our nources? Truely nature her
ſelfe, the former of thinges, ſagely
prouidyng for mankynde, gaue
this gyfte to womankynde, that
ſcarſe in any place ye ſhall fynde
a dumme womanne. Is it not
right faire and cōmendable, that
women ſhulde excelle men in that
thing, in whiche men chiefly paſſe
all other beaſtes? But from prophane
mattiers, lette vs retourne
home agein to holy ſcripture, and
begynne at the verye fountaynes
of our relygion.
            ¶We know ſurely, that god bleſſed
man for womans ſake whiche
bleſſynge the vnworthye man deſerued
not to haue, tyll the womā
was created and made, wherwith
Salomon in his prouerbes agreeth:Pro. 18.
Who ſo fyndeth a good woman,

fyndeth a good thinge, and
receyueth an holſome benefite of
the lorde. And it is written Eccleſiaſtici.
26. Happy is the man, that
hathe a vertuous wyfe:Eccle. 26. For the
number of his yeres ſhall be double.
And no man may be compared
to him in dignitie, that for his
worthynes hathe a good woman.
For as Eccleſiaſticus ſaythe:Ibidem. A
good woman is a gyfte aboue all
other gyftes. And therfore Salomon
in his prouerbes calleth her,Pro. 12.
the crowne of her huſbande: and
Paul,1. Cor. 11. the glorie of man. For glorie
is defined to be the accompliſhment
and perfection of a thinge,
reſtyng and delytyng in his ende:
that is to ſay, when nothing more
may be added, to encreace or amēd
the perfection thereof. A woman
therfore is the ende, perfection, felicitie,

benediction, and glorye of
the man: and as Auguſtin ſayth:
the fyrſte ſocietie and company of
mankynde in this morall lyfe.
Wherfore of neceſſitie euery man
loueth her, whome who ſoo euer
wyl not loue, but hate, is a ſtranger
not only to all humanitie and
gentylneſſe, but alſo to all vertue
and grace. And to ſpeake agayne
of the Cabaliſticall myſteries,Gene. 17. Abraam
was bleſſed of god by the
woman Sarah, and takynge the
letter H, from the womans name
and puttynge it to the mans, called
hym Abraham.Gene. 17. &. 28. Alſo the bleſſynge
of Iacob was gotten hym,
by a woman, his mother. There
be many ſuche examples in holye
Scripture: but not to be ſhewed
in this place.
            ¶Thus bleſſyng was gyuen for

the woman, and law for the man:
The lawe I ſay,Gen. 2. of anger and of
curlynge. For why, the fruyte of
the tree was forbydden to the mā.
but not to the woman: which was
not than created. For god wolde
her to be fre from the begynning.
Therfore the manne ſinned in eatynge,
not the woman. The man
gaue vs deathe, not the woman.
And all we ſynned in Adam, not
in Eua. And we toke orygynalle
ſynne of oure father the man, not
of our mother the woman. And
therfore the olde law commanded
all the malekynde to be circumciſed,
but the females to remayne
vncircumciſed: that is to witte, he
ordeyned the originall ſynne to be
punyſhed onely in that kind, whiche
had treſpaſſed. Furthermore,
god rebuked not the woman, for

that ſhe had eatē, but bicauſe ſhe
gaue occaſion of yuelle vnto the
man, and that dyd ſhe vnwarely,
intyced therto by the dyuell. The
man knew well he dyd amiſſe: but
the woman being deceyued, erred
ignorātly. For ſhe was fyrſt tempted
of the dyuell, whom he knewe
to be moſte excellent of all creatures.
And as Bernarde ſaith: The
dyuell, ſeing her wonderful beautie,
and perceyuynge her to be ſuche
one, as he had knowen before
in the godly lyght, whiche aboue
all aungels, ſhoulde reioyce with
the ſpeche of god: conceyued enuye
onely ageynſt the woman for
her excellencye. Wherfore Chriſte
borne into this worlde moſt humble
and lowe, to thende he woulde
with his great humilite make ſatisfaction
for the ſynne of pryde,

cōmitted by our forfather: he toke
vpon hym manhode, as the more
humble and lower kynde, and not
womankynde, the more hygher &
noble. Furthermore, bycauſe we
were condemned for the ſynne of
the man, and not of the woman,
god wolde, that in what kynd the
ſynne was committed, in the ſame
ſhulde be the purgation of ſynne:
and by the ſame kinde, whiche ignorantly
was deceyued, we ſhuld
alſo be reuengid. Therfore it was
ſaid vnto the ſerpent, that the woman,
or more truly, the ſede of the
woman, ſhoulde breake his head,
and not the man, nor the ſeede of
the man. And perchaunce, hereof
it came, that the order of prieſtehode
is of the churche rather committed
to the man, thā to the woman,
bycauſe euerye prieſte dothe

repreſent Chriſte, and Chriſte, the
fyrſt man, that is to wite, the ſynner
Adam. To this purpoſe, we
vnderſtande the Canon, that begynneth,
Haec imago, whiche ſayth
that a woman was not made to ye
ymage of god, but to the ſimylitude
of Chriſte. Yet for all that I
ſay, that he beynge verye god) I
ſpeake of Chriſte (wold not be the
ſonne of man, but of a woman,
the whiche he ſo hyghly honored,
that of a womanne onely he toke
fleſhe and bloudde. For onely for
the woman, Chriſt was called the
ſonne of man, and not for the mā.
            ¶This is that great myracle,Hier. 31. at
the whiche the prophete ſo moche
meruayled: that a woman comprehended
manne, whan a virgin
conceyued mankynde, and bare
Chriſte in her body.
            
               
¶Alſo Chriſte riſynge vp ageyn
from deth to lyfe,Ioan. 20. appered firſt vnto
women, not to mē. And it is not
vnknowen,Mat. 16. that after the death of
Chriſte, men fell from the faythe:
but it was neuer knowē, that women
ſlypte and fell from Chriſten
fayth and religion. Farther, there
was no perſecution of the faythe
at any tyme, no hereſye, no errour
in the faythe, that aroſe and came
by women, but by menne. Chriſte
was boughte and ſolde, accuſed,
condemned, ſcourged, hanged on
the Croſſe, and at the laſt putte to
cruell deathe onely by men. Yea,
he was denyed of his owne Peter,
forſakē of his other diſciples,Luc. 24.
and only accompanied wayted vpon
and folowed of women vnto
the croſſe and graue.Matt. 27. Alſo the very
wyfe of Pylate, an hethen woman,

went aboute, and laboured
more to ſaue Ieſus than any mā,
yea any of theſe men, that beleued
in hym. Furthermore almoſt the
hole ſchoole of diuines afferme &
ſay, that the churche dyd than remaine
only with the woman, that
is to ſay, with the virgin Marye.
And therfore woman kind is worthyly
called relygyous, deuoute,
and holy. But yet if any man wolſay
with Ariſtotle,Ariſt. de anima. that among al
beaſtes and lyuyng creatures, the
male kynd is more valiāt, ſtrong,
wiſe, and noble: Vnto him, a more
excellent man, the great doctour,
the holy apoſtel ſaint Paule woll
anſwere and ſay:1. Cor. 1. Thoſe thynges
that be folyiſhe before the worlde,
god hathe choſen, that he myghte
confounde wiſe menne: and thoſe
thynges that be feble and weake

in this worlde, he hathe choſen to
confounde the mighty: & the vile
and diſpiſed before the world god
hath choſen: yea & thoſe thynges,
which be nothing, & of no reputation:
that he myght deſtroy thoſe
thinges, which be in price & moch
ſet by.Gene. 2. For who amonge men, in
all gyftes of nature and of grace
was higher than Adam? yet a woman
brought him low.Iudic. 14. &. 16. Who was
ſtronger than Sampſon? A woman
ouercame his ſtrength.Gene. 19. Who
was more chaſt than Loth? A woman
inticed hym to inceſte. Who
was more religious than Dauid
A woman diſturbed his holynes..2. Reg. 11 3. Reg. 11.
Who was more wyſer than Salomon?
a woman deceyued hym.
Who was more paciēt than Iob.
whom the dyuell ſtryped out of al
his goodes, kylled all his family,

and chyldren, and filled al his body
full of boyles and ſoores, and
yet for all that he coulde not prouoke
hym from the olde ſymplicitie
of his mynde: but the woman
intyced hym (and in that ſhe was
more hygher and conſtaunt than
the dyuell) and ſo vexed hym, that
he curſed god. And if it myght be
leful to make any cōpariſon with
Chriſte, who is moſt myghtyfull
and moſte wyſe, for he is the eternall
and euerlaſtynge wyſedome
and power of god:Matt. 15. dydde he not
ſuffer hym ſelfe to be ouercome of
that poore woman of Chanaan?
ſayinge hym ſelfe. It is not good
to take the chyldernes breade, and
caſt it to dogges. She anſwered
and ſayde, Trouthe lorde, neuer
the leſſe, the dogges eate of the
crommes, whiche fall frome their

maſters table. Now whan Chriſt
perceyued, that he could not ouer
come her with that reaſonne, he
bleſſed her, ſayenge: Be it vnto
the as thou deſyreſt.
            ¶Who was more hotte and feruent
in the faythe of Chriſte,Ioan. 18. than
Peter?Matt. 20. A woman made hym,Marc. 14. ſo
greatte a Mynyſter of Chryſtis
Churche,Luc. 22. to denye Chriſte.
            Lette the Canoniſtes crake what
they wylle,Plaut. 8. that theyr Churche
can not erre, a woman pope moked
her by a goodlye impoſture
and deceyre.
            ¶But nowe ſome men wyll ſay,
that thoſe thynges redounde rather
to the dyſprayſe than prayſe
of women. Vnto whome women
ſhall make this aunſwere: If it
were ſo, that one of vs two, muſt
nedes loſe eyther goodes or lyfe,

I had leauer to loſe the, than to
be loſte my ſelfe: And that by the
example of Innocētius the thyrd,
whyche in a certayne piſtle decretall,
writen vnto a cardynall ambaſſatour,
ſent frome the See of
Rome, ſayth: If one of vs twain
muſte nedes be confounded, I
wold rather choſe to haue the confounded.
            ¶Moreouer, it was prouyded
by the Cyuile lawes, that women
might lawfully loke to their own
profit, to other mens hinderance.
And in holy writ, is not the iniquitie
of a woman prayſed more then
a mans wel doing? is not Rachel
preiſed,Gene. 31. whiche by a proper ſleight
deceyued her father ſekynge vnto
ydols?Gene. 27. Was not Rebecca lauded,
whyche by crafte gotte her ſonne
Iacob the bleſſyng of his father?

And afterward by polycie cauſed
him to eſcape the anger of his brother.
The harlotte Raab deceiued
thoſe,Ioſue. 2 whyche ſoughte for the ſerchers
and ſpies of Ioſue: and it
was imputed vnto her for ryghtuouſnes.
Iahel went out to mete
Siſar,Iudic. 4. and ſayde vnto hym: My
lorde, come into me. And aſkynge
water, ſhe gaue hym to drynke of
the bottell of mylke, and couered
hym, as he laye ſleapynge. And
whyle Siſara laye and ſlepte, ſhe
entred in priuyly, & ſtrake a nayle
in his head, and ſlewe hym, which
had put his truſte in her promyſe
and fidelitie, to be ſaued. And for
this notable treaſon, the Scripture
ſaith: Bleſſed is Iahel amōg
women, and Iahel ſhalbe bleſſed
in her tabernacle.
            ¶Rede the ſtory of Iudith, and

marke her wordes vnto Holofernes.
She ſaid: Syr take and vnderſtande
the wordes of thy hand

brynge thy mattier to proſperous

I pray you, what wyckedder coū

And yet holy Scripture bleſſeth,
praiſeth, and extolleth her, and the
iniquite of the woman is reputed
farre better, than a mans wel doinge.
But nowe lette vs retourne
to our pourpoſe.
            ¶Of the excellency of ſo happy
a kynde of women, this alſo may
be to euery man an argumēt moſt
euident, that the moſt excellent of
all creatures, than whyche neuer
was, nor neuer ſhalbe a more worthy,
I meane the moſt bleſſed virgyn
Mayre, was conceyued with
out originall ſynne: and ſhe was
not inferiour to Chriſte, touching
his humanitie.
            ¶This is a ſtronge argumente
of Ariſtotle: Of what kynde the
beſte is nobler thanne the beſte of
an other kynde, that kynde muſte
needes be nobler thanne the other.

In the Femynyne kynde,
the beſt is the vyrgyn Marye, in
the Maſculyne, there aroſe none
greatter thanne Iohn Baptiſte:
but howe farre doothe the holye
vyrgyn excelle hym, whiche (as
euerye Catholyke man knoweth)
was exalted aboue all the orders
of aungelles. Lykewyſe a man
maye reaſounc. Of what kynde
the worſt is warſe than the worſt
of an nother kynde, that kynde is
lower than the other.
            Nowe we knowe, that the moſt
vyciouſe and worſte of all creatures,
is a man, whether it be Iudas,
that betrayd Chriſt, of whom
Chriſte ſayth: It had bene good
for that man, yf he had not bene
borne: or whether any Antechriſt
ſhal come herafter, warſe than he,

whyche ſhall be endowed with all
the power of Sathan. More ouer,
holy writ ſheweth many men
to be condemned to euerlaſtynge
turment: but we rede in no place,
of any womanne ſo condemned.
Farther, as a witneſſe to our purpoſe,
there is a certayne pretogatiue
gyuen to the brutalle nature.
For the queene of all birdes, and
the moſt noble, is the Egle, whiche
is alway found of the female
kynde, and not of the maſculyne.
Alſo this is clere, that the byrd of
Egypte, calid Foenix, wherof there
is neuer but one at oones, is a female.
But contrary wyſe, the ſerpent
Regulus, called alſo Baſiliſcus
the moſt peſtilent of al venimous
beaſtes, is only maſculine, of whiche
kynde it is not poſſible to find
& female. Farther the excellencye

of this kynd, the vertue & innocē

is by theſe argumentes and reſons
abūdantly inough declared.
For the begynnynge of all yuelle

Certaynely the fyrſt man Adam,Gene. 3.

For al we haue ſynned (and muſt

We rede in euery place, that
menne, for theyr taſſhe voluptuouſe
pleaſure, hadde two wyues,
manye wyues, many lemmans:
they were aduouterers and fornicatours.
Of this ſorte, that hadde
many wyues, many concubynes,
were Lamech, Abraham, Iacob,

Eſau, Ioſeph, Moſes, Sanſon,
Helcana, Saul, Dauid, Salomon,
Aſſur, Roboam, Abia, Caleph,
Aſſuerus, and innumerable
other, the whiche had euery oone,
many wyues, harlottes, and concubines.
Nor beynge contente to
marye many, to fulfull theyr luſte
& pleaſure, but alſo medled with
their maydens. And we rede not,
that any woman (except only Batſabea)
was contente to haue any
mo, but alway one huſband. Nor
ye ſhall not fynde, that anye woman
maried two huſbādes. if ſhe
had a childe by her fyrſt huſband.
For women in clenneſſe of liuing
and chaſtitie, are farre more continct
than men: the which (as we
rede) bycauſe they were bareyne,
haue abſtyned from lyenge with
theyr huſbandes, & haue brought

in other, to lye with their huſbandes,
as Sara, Rachel, and many
other vnapt to generation, which
brought in their hande maydens,
that their huſbandes myghte get
chyldren to ſuccede thē. But what
man I pray you, were he neuer ſo
olde, colde, bareyn, and vnapt for
generation, was euer of ſo greate
pitie or myld ſtomake toward his
wyfe, that he wolde ſubſtitute another
manne in his place, to ſowe
fruitefull ſede in his wyues plentifull
gardeyne? And althoughe
we rede, that kyng Lieurgus and
Solon made lawes in olde tyme,
that is to wyte, if any man beinge
ouer aged, vnmeete for mariage,
or otherwiſe vnluſty to do the dedes
of Venus, had maried a maiden,
it ſhoulde be laufull for his
wyfe, to choſe a goodly, and a tall

younge manne, to dalye and play
with her, and the chylde gotten
betwene theym, ſhoulde be aſcribed
to her houſbande, and not to
be called a baſtarde: and though
thoſe lawes were made and eſtablyſhed,
yet we rede not, that they
were kepte, not ſo moche through
the ſturdyneſſe of the men, as by
the chaſtitie of the womenne refuſynge
thoſe lawes.
            ¶There be innumerable excellent

ſo greatte a multitude were murtherers
& robbers, that they were
able to make princes capytaynes
ouer theyr companies. Yea and at
this day there is an infinite number
of them. For all priſons be filled
with men, and al the galowes
in euerye place be loded with the
carcaſes of men. But contrarye

wyſe, womenne were the fyrſte inuentours
of all honeſt craftes, of
all vertue and benefittes. Whiche
thyng the very names of ſciences
and vertues, beinge of the femynine
gender, do playnly ſpecifye.
Whereof this is a notable profe,
that the circuite of the hole world
is callyd by the names of women:
that is to ſay of the Nymph, Aſia.
of Europa, the doughter of Agenor,
of Libia, the doughter of Epaphus,
the whiche is alſo callid
Aphrica. And finally to recite all
kyndes of vertue, a woman ſhall
euery where obteyne the hygheſte
place. For the vyrgin Mary was
a woman, the whyche fyrſt dydde
vowe her vyrginitie to god, and
thereby deſerued to be the mother
of god. The womenne prophetes
were euermoore inſpyred with a

more diuine spyrite, than the men,
Whiche thynge is welle knowen,
by that Lactātius,Lactā. lib. inſti. Euſ de p̄p. Euangel. Auguſt de ci. dei. Euſebius, and
Auguſtine wytneſſen of the Sibylles.
            ¶So Mary, the ſyſter of Moſes
prophecied: And whan Ieremye
was taken pryſoner, his vncles
daughter Olda,Exod. 15. roſe vp and
prophecied beyonde mans reache,4. reg. 22.
to the people of Iſraell,2. Para. 34 atte the
poynte redy to peryſhe. Lette vs
ſerche holy ſcripture, and we ſhall
fynde, that women in conſtancye,
in feythe, and in other vertues ar
commended farre aboue men, as
in Iudith, Ruth, Heſter, the whiche
with ſo great glory and praiſe
were celebrate and honored, that
holy bokes beare their names.Rom. 4.
            
            And all though Abraham,Geneſ. 15. &. 21. for the
ſtedfaſtnes of his fayth, is called

in ſcripture a iuſte man, by cauſe
he ſurely beleued in god: yet for al
that, he muſte ſubmyt hym ſelfe to
his wyfe Sara.Gene. 25. For by ye voyce of
the lorde he was cōmanded thus:
What ſo euer Sara ſaythe to the
here her voyce. So Rebecca, beleuyng
ſtedfaſtly, went to aſke god
certayne queſtions, and ſhe being
reputed worthy, harde this oracle
or aunſwere of god. Two maner
of folke are in thy bealy: and two
maner of people ſhall be deuyded
from thy bealy. And the wydowe
Sareptana gaue credence to Helias,
all thoughe it were harde to
beleue that he tolde her. So zachary,Luc. 1.
rebuked of the aungell for
his incredulitie, was dumme: and
his wife Elizabeth, with her wōbe
and voyce prophecied: & is prayſed,
bicauſe ſhe beleued faithfully.

and ſhe afterwarde, prayſed the
moſt bleſſed virgin Mary,Luc. 2. ſaying:
Bleſſed art thou, whyche dyddeſt
beleue thoſe thynges, that were
ſpoken to the of the lord. So Anna
the propheteſſe, after the reuelation
of Simeon cōfeſſed god, &
ſpake of him to al that wold here,
whyche loked for the redemption
of Iſrael.Act. 21. And Phylip had foure
vyrgins to his doughters,Ioan.. 4. which
dyd prophecy.Matt. 15. What ſhall I ſaye
of her the ſamaritan,Marc. 7. with whom
Chriſte ſpake at the well:Mat. 9. and beinge
fedde with the faythe of this
beleuing womā,Mar. 5. refuſed the meate

theſe may be ioyned the faithefull
woman of Chananee,Ioan. 11. and the womanMatt. 16.
dyſeaſed with the blouddyeLuce. 7.

confeſſyon of Martha,Matt. 27. lyke theMar. 16. & 17.
               
confeſſyon of Peter?Luc. 23. & 24. The Goſpell
wytneſſeth,Act. 18. howe greate conſtācy
of faith was in Mary Magdaleyn.
For whyle the priſtes and
Iewes crucyfyed Chriſte, ſhe wepeth,
ſhe bringeth oyntmentes vnto
the Croſſe, ſhe ſeeketh in the
Tombe, ſhe aſketh the gardyner
for hym, ſhe aknowledgeth god,
ſhe gothe to the apoſtles, and ſheweth
them, that he is ryſen. They
were in doubte therof, but ſhe beleued
it verily. Ageyn, what ſhall
I ſaye, of that holy woman Priſcilla,
the whiche inſtructed Apollo,
apoſtolycke man, perfitely lerned
in the lawe, and byſhoppe of
the Corinthians? Nor it was no
ſhame for a poſtell, to lerne of a
woman, what he ſhulde teache in
the churche.
            ¶Moreouer, they that haue ſhewed

the ſtedfaſtnes of theyr faith
by ſufferyng of Martyrdom, and
by the diſpiſynge of deathe, be no
fewer in number than men.2. Mach. 7. Nor
that wonderfull mother ſhuld be
lefte vnſpoken of, ſo worthy to be
remembred, the whiche not onely
behelde her .vii. ſonnes putte to
deathe, by moſt cruell martyrdom
but alſo ſhe boldly exhorted them
ſtedfaſtlye to dye. And ſhe aboue
all thynges truſtyng in god, was
after her chylderne cruelly put to
deathe, for the mayntenaunce of
the lawes of her countrey.
            ¶Dyd not alſo Theodelina, the
doughter of the kynge of Bauarians,
conuerte the Lumbardes
to the fayth? And Greiſilla, the
ſyſrer of Henry the fyrſte Emperour,
conuerte the Hungarians?
& Clotildis, the daughter of the

kyng of Burgundia, conuert the
Frenche men? And a certayn woman
called Apoſtola, of a lowe degree,
conuerted the Hiberians.
            Eche of them turned innumerable
people vnto Chriſtis faythe.
And fynally, this is the onely and
ſpeciall relygious kynd, in whom
vnto this day the catholike faith,
and the continual workes of vertue
and goodneſſe doo flouryſſhe
and ſhyne.
            ¶But to the ende that noo man
ſhuld doubt women to be as able
to doo all thoſe thynges that men
can, let vs handle the matter with
examples: and we ſhal fynd, that
there was neuer noble nor worthy
acte, in any kynde of vertue,
doone by men, but that as noble
hath ben done by women. In doinge
ſacrifyce, as the paynyms in

olde tyme vſed, Melyſſa Cibeles
was the Mynyſter, after whoſe
name, the other Goddeſſes, that
vſed the prieſtes offyce, were callyd
Melyſſae. Alſo Hypeccauſtria
was Mineruas mynyſter, Mera
of Venus, Iphiginia of Diana.
And the mynyſters of Bacchus,
were very notable, as Thyades,
Menades, Bacche, Eliades, Mimallonides,
Eonides, Eubiades,
Baſſarides, Triaterides. Alſo amonge
the Iewes, Mary Moſes
ſyſter, entred with Aaron into the
Sanctuarie,Sanctuary, a place conſecrate or halowed. and was taken as a
mynyſter or prieſt. And although
women be forbydden in our religion,
to vſe the order of preſthod
yet it appereth by hyſtories, that a
woman on a tyme by counterfaitynge
her kynde, was biſhoppe of
Rome. There haue bene in Chriſtis

churche, many abbaſſes and
nunnes, whiche in olde tyme men
diſdayned not to calle holy myniſters.
There haue bene among all
nations, that excelled in prophecienge,
as Caſſandra, the Sybilles,
Mary Moyſes ſiſter, Delbora,
Holda, Anna, Elyzabeth, the
foure doughters of Philip, & many
other holy womē of later time,
as Brigida and Heldegardis.
            Furthermore, in the inuyncible
arte magyke, whether it came of
good ſpirytes or bad. Circes and
Medea wroughte farre greatter
wonders than Zoroaſtes hym ſelf
whiche as many ſuppoſe, was the
fyrſte fynder of the ſayde ſcyence.
More ouer in phyloſophye, many
haue ben very excellent, as Theano
the wyfe of Pythagoras, and
Dama his daughter was ryghte

famous, in openynge and declaringe
her fathers obſcure & darke
sentences. Alſo Aſpaſia and Diotima,
Socrates ſcholers, & Mantinea
and Phileſia Axiochia, both
ſcholers to Plato. Finally Plotinus
highly prayſeth Gemina and
Amphiclea, Lactantius Themiſten.
Chriſtis churche reioyceth in
ſaynt Caterine, which being but
a lyttell mayde, dyd farre paſſe in
lernynge, the wyſe menne of that
tyme.
            ¶Let vs not forget in this place
the queene Zenobia, ſcholer to the
phyloſopher Longinus, whiche
for her great vertue and cunning
was called Epheniſſa, whoſe holy
workis Nichomachus tranſlated
into Greke.
            ¶Let vs ſpeake of the oratours
arte, and of poetrie, Behold here

commeth Armeſia, ſurna med Androgenea,
Hortentia, Lacera, Valeria,
Copiola, Sapho, Corinna,
Cornificia the Romayne, Erymna,
Telia, or Theſbia, whyche
was named an Epigrammatiſt,
in Saluſte Sempronia, in the
law ciuyl Calphurnia: And were
it not, that women in our tyme ar forbydden,
to gyue theym to good
lernynges, we ſhulde euen nowe,
haue women more excellēt in wyt
and lernynge than menne. What
ſhulde we hereof ſay, that women
onely by nature are ſene to excelle
the very artificers in all ſciences?
Doo not the Grammarians take
vppon theym, to be the mayſters
of eloquence? And that do we far
better lerne of oure nources and
mothers, than of the Grammarians.
Dyd not Cornelia fourme

and faſſhyon the tongues of her
moſte eloquent ſonnes Gracchi?
Dyd not Iſtrineus mother, teach
Syles the ſonne of Aripithus,
kynge of Scythia, the Greeke
tongue? Dydde not the chyldren
borne of theym that were ſente to
inhabyte in ſtraunge countreyes,
alway obſerue and kepe theyr mothers
tongue, amonge ſtrangers?
Surely for none other cauſe Plato
and Quintilian ſo diligentlye
ordeyned a mete and conueniente
nource for chylderne to be choſen,
but that the chyldernes tongue &
ſpeche myght be ryghtlye and diſcretely
fourmed.
            ¶But nowe, be not the poetes in
theyr trifles & fables, & the logitians
in their cōtentious talking ouercome
of women? Ther was neuer
oratour ſo good or ſo happy,

that in perſwaſyon coulde get the
vpper hande of an harlot? What
arithmetrician by falſe recknyng,
coulde deceyue a woman in payement
of her det? or what muſitian
can compare with a woman in ſingynge
and ſweteneſſe of breaſte?
Be not theſe Phyloſophers, theſe
aſtrologians, in theyr diuynatiōs
& forknowleges many tymes inferiours
to the coūtrey wiues? yea &
very ofttymes a ſely olde woman
excelleth the phiſitian: Socrates
hym ſelfe (aboue all other reckned
the moſt wyſe man) being very aged,
dyd not diſdain to be taught
of the womā Aſpaſia. Lyke as Apollo,
a man ſo wel lerned in Chriſtis
doctrine, was not aſhamed to
be taught of the womā Priſcilla.
            ¶Nowe for prudency, you maye
take for examples thoſe women.

Opis for her wyſedome counted a
goddeſſe: Plotina wyfe of Troianus
themperour: Amalaſuntha,
the queene of Oſtrogottes: Emilia
the wyfe of Scipio: with whō
recken Delbora, the wyfe of Labidoth,Iudic. 4.
a meruaylouſe wyſe woman,
whiche (as we rede in Iudicum)
was a certayn tyme Iudge
ouer the people of Iſrael, and the
chylderne of Iſraell came vp to
her for iudgement in all cauſes.
            And whan Barach refuſed to go
ageynſte their ennemies, excepte
ſhe wolde go with hym, Delbora
was choſen capitayne of the hoſt
of Iſraell: and ſleynge and dyſcomfytynge
theyr foes, ſhe returned
home with vyctorie.
            ¶More ouer,4. Reg. 2. 2. Par. 22. it is redde in the
fourth boke of kingis, that quene
Attalia reigned, & was ſouerayne

Iudge in Ieruſalem ſeuen yeres
ſpace. And Semiramis, after the
deathe of kynge Ninus, iudged
the people .xl. yeres. And all the
quenes of Ethiope, called Candaces,
were moſte wyſe, and reigned
moſte myghtely: of whomit
is written in the actes of the apoſtels.Act. 8.
And meruaylouſe thynges
of them ſpeaketh the faithful writer
of antyquytie Ioſephus.3. Reg. 10. Alſo
Nicania,2. Paral. 9. the quene of Saba,Matt. 12. cam

as Chriſt witneſſeth, ſhe ſhall condemne

And there was a certain wiſe
woman of Thecoa,2. Reg. 14. whyche concluded
kynge Dauids demaunde
with a queſtion,1, Reg 25. with a ryddle ſhe
taught hym,3. Reg. 1. and by the exāple of
god, ſwaged his wrath. Nor here

we ſhulde not forget Abigail and
Bathſaba, of whiche two Abigail
delyuered her huſbande, from the
wrathe of Dauid, and after the
deathe of her huſbande ſhe was
queene and wyfe of Dauid. The
other, the mother of Salomon,
by her prudēcy opteyned, that her
ſonne was kynge.
            ¶More ouer, in the Inuention
of thynges, Iſis, Minerua, Nicoſtrata,
be examples. In rulyng
of realmes, and buyldynge of cities
women excelle: Semiramis
was the ſouerayne gouernour of
the vniuerſall worlde: Dido was
the buylder and queene of Carthage:
the Amazones were moſte
worthy in warre and polytyke in
peace. In the bolde byckerynges
of battayle, what a woman was
Thomiris the queene of Maſſagetaries?

She ouercame Cyrus
the gret conquerour and puiſſant
kynge of Perſians. Alſo Camilla,
of the Volſcians, and Valiſca
of Boheme, were two moſt mighty
queenes. We rede of many other
moſte noble women, whyche
by theyr wonderfulle power and
polycie, in moſt extremytie, and
whan there was no hope of helpe
loked for, recouered theyre countrey,
and reſtored it to wealthe ageyne.
Amonge whome is Iudith,
whyche ſaynt Ierome hyghlye
prayſeth with theſe wordes:
Take Iudith the wydowe, the example
of chaſtite, declare her with
triumphant prayſe and perpetual
commendation. For god gaue her
to be an example, not only for women,
but alſo for men to folowe,
whiche for a rewarde of her chaſtitie,

armed her with ſuche vertue,
that ſhe vanquiſhed him that
was inuyncible to all menne, and
ſubdued hym, that no man coulde
ouercome.
            ¶Further,1. Reg. 20 we reade, that a certayn
wiſe woman called vnto her
Ioab the capitayne, and delyuered
into his handes the heade of
Siba, the ennemye of Dauid, to
the intente to ſaue the citie Abela,
from diſtruction, whiche was the
chiefe citie of Iſraell.Iudic. 9. And a certayne
woman, threwe a piece of a
myl ſtone vpon Abimelechs head
and brake his brayne panne, executynge
the vengeance of god vpon
Abimelech, bycauſe he hadde
done yll before god agaynſte his
father, in ſleinge .lxx. of his brether
vpon one ſtone.
            ¶So Heſter,Heſt. 7. 8. the wyfe of kynge

Aſſuer, not only deliuered her people
from the moſte ſhamefull deth
but alſo made theym ryght honorable.
            ¶Whanne Coriolanus with the
Volſcians, had beſieged Rome, &
ſoo ſharpely aſſayled it, that the
Romaynes were not able to defende
them ſelues agaynſte hym:
an auncient woman Veturia his
mother, ſoo handled the mattier,
that ſhe ouercame his rage and
furye, and reconcyled hym ageyn
to the Romaynes. Arthemiſia,
whan the Rhodians came fierſly
vpon her, both diſapoynted them
of theyr nauye of ſhyppes, and
conquered that Ilande, and ſette
vp her Image within the citie of
Rhodes, as a perpetuall note of
infamye vnto them.
            ¶Howe moche doo the Frenche

men prayſe a yonge damſell,Anno d̄ni 1428. whiche
beinge deſcended of a lowe linage,
toke vpon her after the maner
of the Amazons, to leade the
forward of the army: & ſhe fought
ſo valiantly, and hadde ſoo good
chaunce, that the French men beleued
verily, that by her proweſſe,
they recouered the relme of Frāce
out of the Englyſſhe mens handes:
And therfore, to the perpetuall
remēbrance of her, they made
an ymage of a mayden to be ſette
vp in Orliaunce on the brydge ouer
the ryuer of Liger or Loier.
I coulde yet reherce out of the hiſtories
of the Grekes, of the Latines,
and other barbarous natiōs
innumerable moſte excellent women,
but to the ende this worke
ſhulde not be to greate a volume,
I ſtudyed to be breefe. For Plutarche,

Valerius, Bocatius, and
many other haue writtē the praiſe
of noble women: And therfore I
haue ſpokē but lytel of their praiſes,
but ouer paſſed verye manye
thynges. For why, I am not ſoo
preſumptuous, to thynke my ſelfe
able, to cōprehend in few wordes,
ye infynite nobylities & vertues of
womē. For who is able throughly
and perfectly to recyte the infinite
prayſes of women, of whome we
take all oure lyfe and ſubſtaunce,
and in whome is all the conſeruation
of mankynde, the whyche els
ſhulde peryſhe and decay in ſhort
tyme: on whome alſo euery familye
and common welthe dependeth?
This thynge was well knowen
to the buylder of Rome, whiche
bycauſe he lacked women, rauy
ſhed and caried away the Sabines

daughters, not doubtynge
the cruel warre that ſhuld folowe
thervpon. For he knewe, that ſuche
an empire wolde in ſhort time
periſſhe, yf they wanted women.
And at laſte, whan the Capytoll
was taken by the Sabynes, and
that in the myddes of the market
place, they foughte moſte cruellye
hande to hande, with the ſodayne
runnynge of the women betwene
bothe the hoſtes, the battayle ceſſed:
and at the laſte a peace being
made, and a truce taken, they concluded
a perpetual amitie. For the
whych cauſe Romulus regeſtred
theſe womens names in the courtes
and courte rolles. And it was
by the Romaynes aſſente decreed
and wrytten in the common tables,
that women ſhuld not grind
at the quyrne, nor drudge in the

kitchen: nor the huſbande ſhulde
not ſay: Wife, I giue the this: nor
the wyfe: Huſbande, I gyue you
this: bycauſe they ſhulde knowe,
that euery thynge betwene theym
was cōmon. And hereof at length
grewe a cuſtom, that whan ye new
wedded wyfe was brought home,
ſhe wolde ſaye: vbi tu, ego, that is
where you be lorde, I am ladye:
where you be maiſter, I am mayſtreſſe.
Moreouer, great honours
tokens of high reuerence and dignitie
were done to women by decree
of the Senatours, as theſe:
that in the way they ſhulde go on
the vpper hane: and that men
ſhuld ryſe on their fete vnto them
& gyue them place. Furthermore,
it was graunted theym, to weare
purple garmentes, embrowdred
about with gold, ornamentes deeked

with precyous ſtones, rynges
at theyr eares, & chaynes of golde
about theyr neckes. And it was at
the laſt decreed by the emperours
lawes, that as ofte as any ſtatute
was made in any place, forbydding
ornamentes or apparayle to
be worne, women ſhoulde not be
comprehended vnder that lawe.
Alſo it was granted theym, to receyue
herytage and ſucceſſion of
goodes, & the funerals of women
to be celebrate and honourablye
kepte, as the funeralles of noble
men were. For why on a time whā
a gyfte ſhoulde be ſente to Apollo
Delphicus, as Camillus had vowed,
and that there was not ſoo
moche golde in the cytie: the women
of theyr owne good wylles,
brought in the iewelles and ornamentes
of theyr bodies.
            
               
¶And in the warre that Cyrus
made agaynſt Aſtiages, the Perſians
armye was by the caſtygation
of women reprehended, and
being newely reſtored againe, opteyned
a right worthy vyctorye.
For the whiche dede Cyrus made
a lawe, that kynges of the Perſians
entrynge into the cytie. ſhuld
paye to euerye woman a piece of
golde. The whiche thynge alſo
kynge Alexander, entrynge twyſe
into that citie payd twyſe. Ye and
more ouer, he commaunded the
gyft to be doubled to women with
chylde. So from the moſte auncient
kynges of the Perſyans and
Romaynes, yea from the very begynnyng
of the citie of Rome and
empire, women were hadde in all
hygh honour and reuerence: and
the very emperours theym ſelues

eſtemed theym moſte highly. For
Iuſtynian the emperour, in makynge
of lames, thoughte it conueniente,
to haue the counſaylle
and aduyſe of his wyfe. And in
an other place, the law ſayth, that
the wyfe ſhyneth in the honour of
her huſbande, and the brightnes
of his dignitie beautifieth her, for
the higher the huſband is aduanced
in honour, the higher is his
wyfe. Soo the Emperours wyfe
is callid empreſſe, the kingis wife
quene, the princis wyfe, the princeſſe:
and is therby enobled, howe
lowe ſo euer ſhe be of byrthe. And
Vlpian the lawyer ſayth. A prince
that is to ſaye, the Emperoure or
kynge, is aboue the lawes, and although
the empreſſe is bonde by
the lawes, yet the emperour frely
granteth her as great priuileges

as he hath hym ſelfe. Wherfore it
is permitted vnto noble women,
to iudge, to arbytrate and decyde
matters, to doo and take homage
and fealtie, to keepe courtes, and
mynyſter Iuſtyce amonge theyr
tenauntes. And for this pourpoſe,
the woman may haue couenant
ſeruauntes of her owne, as
well as the man may: and a womanne
may be iudge, yea amonge
ſtraungers. She maye alſo gyue
name to her familie and kynred:
ſo that the chyldren ſhalbe named
after their mother, and not after
their father. And in dyuerſe places
of the lawe cyuyle, womenne
haue, touchynge theyr doweries,
many great priuileges graunted
them. Where amonge other thynges
it is ordeyned, that a woman
of good name and fame, ſhall not

be impryſoned for dette, and the
Iudge, that commytteth her to
pryſon, ſhall loſe his heed. If ſhe
be ſuſpected of any faute, ſhe ſhal
be putte into a monaſterye or ſecrete
place, or elles be delyuerid to
womē, to be impryſonde by them.
For the lawe ſaythe, A woman is
of better ſtate and condition than
a man: and alſo in one ſelfe kynd
of offence, the manne treſpaſſeth
more than the woman. Wherfore
the man taken in auoutrie, loſeth
his head: but the woman aduouterer
is put into a monaſterye.

            ¶Alſo the auncyente lawe makers

and ſtablyſhers of common
wealthes, the moſte graue, wyſe,
and prudent menne, Licurgus I
ſay, and Plato, knowynge verye
welle by the ſecretes of Phyloſophy,
that women were not inferiours
to men, neyther in excellencye
of mynde, nor in ſtrengthe of
bodye, nor in dygnitie of Nature,
but lyke able vnto all thynges,
decreed and made lawes, that women
ſhoulde exerciſe ſuche mayſtries
as men vſed, yea all feates
perteynynge to the warre, in the
bowe, in the ſlynge, in hurlynge
of ſtones, in ſhotynge, in fyghtynge
in armour, as well on hors
backe as on foote, in pytchyng of
tentes, in ſettynge men in arraye,
and couductynge of an hoſte: and
to be briefe, they ordeyned, that
women ſhuld as cōmonly as men

vſe all maner exercyſes. Lette vs
rede writers of antiquitie, worthy
to be beleued, and we ſhall fynde,
that in Getulia, Bactris, and Galletia,
the maner was, that menne
gaue them ſelfes to eaſe and delicacy,
and the women to plow and
tylle the fieldes, to buylde, to bye
and ſel, to ryde, to go on warfare,
and to do all other thynges, whiche
nowe amonge vs the men do.
Amonge the Cantabrians, men
gaue dowerye to the women, bretherne
were gyuen to mariage by
theyr ſyſters, doughters were appoynted
to be heires. Amonge the
Scythians, the Thracians, and
Frenche menne, all worthy dedes
were as cōmonly done by women
as by men, and in matters concernynge
warre and peace, women
were called to councelle, to gyue

theyr aduyſe and ſentence. Which
thynge the Truce that the Celtes
made with Hanniball, dothe well
declare to be trewe, by theſe wordes:
If any of the Celtes complayne,
to haue had wronge of any
of the Carthaginences: of that
thing let the rulers & officers of ye
Carthaginences, or els the capytaynes
which ſhal be in Spayne,
be iudges: If any of the Cartha
ginences hath hadde any wronge
done hym, by anye of the Celtes,
lette the women of the Celtes be
iuges, and determyne that thyng.
But by the great tyranny of men,
preuaylynge ageinſt the lawes of
god and nature, ſuch libertie was
gyuen to women.
            ¶Thou wylte ſaye, that is nowe
forbydden by lawes, aboliſhed by
cuſtome, extincted by education.

For anon as a woman is borne euen
from her infancy, ſhe is kept
at home in ydelnes, & as thoughe
ſhe were vnmete for any hygher
buſyneſſe, ſhe is pmitted to know
no farther, than her nedle and her
threede. And than whan ſhe commeth
to age, able to be maried, ſhe
is delyuered to the rule and gouernance
of aielous huſband, orels
ſhe is perpetually ſhutte vp in a
cloſe nounrye. And all offyces belongynge
to the common weale,
be forbydden theym by the lawes.
Nor it is not permitted to a woman,
though ſhe be very wiſe and
prudent, to pleade a cauſe before
a Iuge. Furthermore, they be repelled
in iurisdiction, in arbiterment,
in adoption, in interceſſion,
in procuration, or to be gardeyns
or tutours, in cauſes teſtamētary

and criminall. Alſo they be repelled
frome preachynge of goddes
worde, agaynſt expreſſe and playn
ſcripture, in whyche the holy goſt
promiſed vnto them by Iohel the
prophet,Iohel. 8. ſaieng: And your daughters
ſhall prophecie and preache:
lyke as they taught openly in the
tyme of the apoſtles: as it is well
knowen, that Anna the wydowe
of Symeon, the daughters of
Philyp, and Priſcilla, the wyfe of
Aquila dydde. But the vnworthy
dealyng of the later lawe makers
is ſo great, that breakyng goddes
commaundemente, to ſtablyſſhe
theyr owne traditions, they haue
pronounced openlye, that women
otherwyſe in excellency of nature,
dignitie, and honour moſt noble,
be in condicion more vyle than all
men: And thus by theſe lawes,

the women being ſubewed as it
were by force of armes, are conſtrained
to giue place to men, and
to obeye theyr ſubdewers, not by
no naturall, no diuyne neceſſitie
or reaſon, but by cuſtome, education,
fortune, and a certayne tyrannicall
occaſion.
            ¶Furthermore, there be ſomme
men, whyche by relygion, clayme
authoritie ouer women, and they
proue theyr tyranny by holy ſcripture:
the whiche haue this curſed
ſayenge, ſpoken to Eue, contynually
in theyr mouth:Geneſ. 2. Thou ſhalt
be vnder the power of man, and
he ſhall haue lordeſhyp ouer the.
But yf it be anſwered vnto them,
that Chriſte toke awaye that curſed
ſayenge: they wyll obiecte ageyne
the wordes of Peter,
                  
                     •
                  . Pet. 3. with
whome Paule agreeth,Ad col. 3. ſayenge:Ad eph. 5
                     •
                  
               
               
Lette women be in ſubiection of
theyr huſoandes. Lette women in
the churche kepe ſylence. But he
that knoweth the dyuers fygures
of Scripture, and the effectes of
the ſame, ſhall ſoone ſe, that theſe
thynges be not repugnant but in
the rynde.Rom̄. 2. For this is the order in
the churche,Act. 10. that men in miniſtration
ſhall be preferred before women:
lyke as the Iewes in promyſſion
are before the Greekes:
yet neuertheleſſe God is not accepter
of perſones. For in Chriſt neither
male nor female is of value,
but a newe creature. And manye
thinges were permitted vnto mē,
for the hardeneſſe and crueltie of
theyr hartes ageynſte women: as
in times paſt diuorces were granted
vnto the Iewes, whiche for al
that nothyng hurteth the dignitie

of women: But whan men commytte
offence and erre, the women
haue power of Iudgement ouer
theym, to the great ſhame and rebuke
of menne. And that quiene
Saba ſhall iudge the men of Ieruſalem.
Therfore they, whyche
beynge iuſtifyed by fayth: are become
the ſonnes of Abraham, the
chylderne I ſay of promyſſion, be
ſubdewed to a woman, and bounden
by the cōmandement of god,
ſayenge to Abraham: what ſo euer
Sara ſaith vnto the, folow it.
            ¶Nowe at laſte,Gene. 21. brefely to recollecte,
Fyrſte, I haue ſhewed the
great excellency of womankynd,
by her name, order, place, and matter,
and what greate dignitie ſhe
hath obteined of god aboue man:
Farther I haue declared it by relygion,
nature, humayne lawes,

by diuers authorities, reaſon and
examples, myngling one with an
other. And yet haue I not ſo moche
ſayd, but that I haue left moche
more vnſpoken. For neyther
Ambition, nor the cauſe of myne
owne commendation, but my dutie
and the very truthe moued me
to wryte: leſt that I, as one commyttynge
ſacrilege (holdynge my
peace) ſhuld ſeme priuyly to ſteale
and bribe away by a certayn wycked
ſilence, from ſo noble a kynde,
the laudes and preyſes due to it,
as it were, burienge in the groūd
the talente that god hathe gyuen
me. But yf anye man more curyous
than I, ſhal fynde any argument
or reaſon, that hath eſcaped
me, whyche he thynketh worthye
to be added to this my booke, I
woll not recken my ſelfe blamed,

but rather holpen thereby, in that
this my worke, by his wytte
and counnynge, he wolle
make better. Therefore
leſte this
worke ſhuld
growe to
ouer
great a volume, here
I make an ende
            FINIS.
