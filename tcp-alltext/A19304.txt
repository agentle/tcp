               TO THE MOST MIGHTY AND VICTORIOVS PRINCE, AND HIS moſte redoubted ſoueraigne lorde, Henry the .viii. by the grace of god kyng of Englande, Fraunce, and Irelande, defender of the faith, and of the churche o

                England and alſo of Irelande in earthe the ſupreme head: his right humble ſubiecte and ſeruaunt Antony Lope, praieth and wyſſheth all honour and perfecte felicites.
            
               THat all humain actes ought to be meaſured by tyme, mooſte excellent prince, and my moſte redoubted ſoueraigne lorde, we are ſufficiently taught by nature, by reaſon, by learnyng, and by experience. The firſt is declared by the ordinate courſe of the heauens, and the ſterres, aſwell fixed, as alſo the planettes mouable, in the ſame heuens placed, with their ſundry diſpoſicions: by whoſe dyuers operacions, the earthe bringeth foorth hir fruites of all kyndes in due ſeaſon, whiche fyrſt growe to a ripeneſſe, and than foloweth the decaie of the ſame. So that all thynges varie accordynge to the tyme. Nowe pleaſaunt ſommer, thanne wythered wynter. Nowe plenty full aboundance of thynges, an other tyme baraine ſcarcitie. &c. Reaſon alſo affirmeth the ſame: in ſo muche that wyſe philoſophiers put, that the generation of one thyng is the corrupcion of an other: and that nothynge maie longe endure in one ſtate, but either encreaſeth, or is empeired. Of learnyng we haue authoritees manifold. Emonge others Salomon ſaieth, that all thynges haue tyme. There is (ſaieth he) tyme of peace, and tyme of warre: tyme to be mery, and time to be ſadde. By experience alſo it is manifeſt, that who ſo doth not take tyme in tyme, and accordyng therto tempre diſpoſe and conueigh all his procedynges, ſhall noo more brynge theim to effecte, with proſperous ſucceſſe, thanne the ſonge ſhalbe allowed, wherof the ſyngers kepe not theyr true tyme, but ſome dooe runne awaie therewith, makyng ouermuche haſte, while ſome other dragge, comyng ſlowly after. The mutabilitie of tyme is ſo variable, it paſſeth awaie ſo ſwiftely,

And as it deuoureth and conſumeth all thynges by long proceſſe: euen ſo it manifeſteth all thynges, be they neuer ſo hydden and ſecrete. Wherefore VERITIE is called the doughter of tyme, He hath alſo a ſiſter called OCCASION, whom the ſaied ſage poetes (vnder whoſe woordes, as vnder a vaile are hidden many depe miſteries) wyllynge to deſcriue, dooe feigne to haue wynges on hir fete, to declare therby her ſwift paſſyng awaie. And alſo they feigne hir to haue all hir heare growing and hanging long downe on the forpart of hir hedde, the hynder part being ſmothe bare and

               alde: ſignifiyng therby, that as ſhe cometh towarde a man, he may take ſure holde of hir, by hir longe heares. But in caſe he myſſe to take than his holde, ſuffryng hir to paſſe by hym: than is there no holde to be taken of hir behynde, but that ſhe runneth awaie without recouerie. There is alſo iuigned vnto hir a compaignion called REPENTANCE, whiche is nothyng ſo lyght of foote as is the other, whom Occaſion after hir eſcape from a man, leaueth behynde hir, to kepe hym compaignie. Whereby is ment, that if occaſion be not taken, whan ſhe offereth hir ſelfe to any manne: the partie that refuſeth hir offre, ſhall after not ceaſſe, duryng his lyfe, to forthynke his folie, in ſuffryng hir departure. Wherfore ſens it is apparent, that the obeiyng to tyme is ſo neceſſary, whā I behold the manifold iniuries, doen to your maieſtee, and to your ſubiectes of this your realme, by your vnnaturall and vnkind enemies on ſundry parties, diuerſe & many waies, whiche ye haue longe ſuffred, and neuertheleſſe dayly they are renewed: it is manifeſt and euident, that youre hyghneſſe is dryuen to geat by the ſwoorde that, whyche by force is deteyned from you, and with power to reuenge wronges wroughte of malice and vntruthe, oneleſſe ye ſhoulde be thought, not to regarde the honour due to the imperiall maieſtie of ſo high a prince, where Salomon in his booke entitled Eccleſiaſtes, vpon conſideracion (as I ſuppoſe) of ſuche lyke matier as this, ſaieth: There is tyme to loue, and tyme to hate, tyme of peace, and tyme of warre: whiche ſentence

the ſaied wyſe man, endued by god with ſapience▪ would neuer haue lefte vnto vs, if warre had not in ſome caſe ben both laufull and expedient. Wherefore well ponderyng the tyme of warre to be nowe in hande, as a thynge ſo muche nedefull for many conſideracions, I (for my poore part) thought, that I ſhould dooe, not onely to your hyghneſſe acceptable ſeruice, but alſo to all noble men, and ientilemen of the realme greate pleaſure and cōmoditie, if gatheryng to gyther out of Titus Liuius, and other autours, the lyues, the policies, and the marciall actes of two the moſte woorthie capitaynes, of the two moſte renoumed empires of the worlde, that is to ſaie, of Anniball of Carthage, and Scipio of Rome, I woulde brynge the ſame into our englyſhe toung: whereby, beſyde the pleaſaunt beſtowyng of tyme, in the readyng therof, men alſo may learne bothe to dooe diſpleaſure to theyr ennemies, and to auoyde the crafty and daungerous baites, which ſhall be layde for theim. The one of theſe capitayns, after many countreis of Spayne brought vnder ſubiection, to ſeeke honour, and to exercyſe hym ſelfe, with his men, in feates of warre, paſſed the terrible mountaines to entre into Italy, through many peryllous ſtreightes and vnknowen paſſages, there vexyng and ſpoylyng the countrey with contynuall warre, by the ſpace of xvi. yeres. Duryng whiche tyme he had many noble victories ſleyng many Romaine legions with theyr valyant capytaines. The other, that is to wete, Scipio the Romain conſull, being a man of no leſſe courage than his ennemie, leauyng hym with his power in Italy, ſailed ouer into Affrica: where vanquyſhynge many friendes of the Carthaginenſes, at the laſte he brought Carthage to ſuche extremitie, that the princes therof were dryuen (for theyr onely refuge) to call Anniball home agayn to ſuccour them: where in battaile ſore foughten, Scipio ouercame Anniball and all his power, put hym to flyght, & made the empire of Carthage to be vnder tribute to Rome. The one of theſe capitaines was crafty, politike, peynfull, and hardy: and by ſubtil traines wrought his enmies muche diſple ſure: The other was wiſe, chaſte, liberall, and valiant: and by his vertuous courage, mixed with temperaunce, raiſedvp the banner of fame & honour of Rome, which before was brought lowe, and almooſte to vtter deſolation. And as theſe notable princis, with many other men of noble hertes, haue heretofore

               e: euen ſo, many learned menne, wyllynge to auaunce theim to theyr deſyres, haue in wrytyng ſette forth theyr noble actes, to theyr immortall fame, and to the comfort of all that ſhall here or rede the ſame. yea the peinters haue not forgoten nor omitted on their partes, to ſette foorth before mennes eies, their noble actes, thereby to ſtiere and to enkendle the hertes and myndes of the beholders. For who is he, that doeth not muche reioyce, in beholdyng Hercules peinted on a walle, cl

               thed in a lyons ſkynne, by his mighty hande ſpoyled, and drawynge after hym Cerberus that hell hounde, with iii. hydous heddes, whome he had brought from the dominion of Pluto? Who doeth not reioyce to heare the conqueſt of the golden fliece, by Iaſon in the Iſle of Colchos? Thus it appereth, that who ſo doen vertuouſely enbrace honourable trauaile, deſerue to haue immortall fame. Emong whiche moſte victorious conquerours, although your moſte excellent maieſtee maie without all controuerſie or doubte moſt worthily chalenge and take the chief place, yet would not I, before your maieſties owne face, offre my ſelfe to be a ſetter out thereof, oncles the expreſſe veritee of your graces procedynges dyd ſo manifeſtly publyſſhe and declare the ſame, that I maie not by my ſo doing poſſybly encurre any maner ſuſpicion of flatterie or adulation, as by comparyng the noble dedes of the forenamed great princis, vnto your moſte woorthy actes, ſhall appere manifeſt. Anniball, by the helpe of the frenchemen, paſſed the mountaines, and after in Italie fought three or fower notable battailes, to the great ruine of the Romaines: but they were achieued rather by crafty ſleightes and policies, than by ſtrength. In theim alſo he had the aſſured ayde of the frenche men. The citie of Tarent he wanne by treaſon. Capua, and many other cities, wyllyngly yelded vnto hym, whoſe aſſiſtence after, was muche his auauncement. On the other part, Scipio arryuyng in Affrica, founde there kynge Maſſaniſſa his olde frende, by whoſe helpe, valiantneſſe, and conduite, he preuailed againſt the Carthaginenſes, and ſubdued kyng Sypbax. Theſe thynges ſeemed than to men ſo notable, that emong others, my chief authour Titus Liuius, to auaunce the renoume of them, wrote thereof a noble and goodly hiſtorie. But who ſo beholdeth the conduite of your gracis warres, in Spayne, Fraunce,

Britayne, & Scotland, and in euery of theſe more then ones or twiſe achieued without the aide of any forain prince, the dangerous and ſtronge cities and caſtelles ſcaled, the power of Fraunce in one daie ouerthrowen: And about the ſame tyme a lyke victorie of Scottes inuadyng this realme, with theyr kyng ſlayné in playne fielde: ſhall fynde the triumph thereof muche more woorthy of glorie, thanne any that euer Liuius wrote vpon. For it is not vnknowen, that thynges nowe be muche harder to be achieued, than they were in thoſe dayes: the artillary more perillous, the armour more ſure, and the caſtelles more ſtrong: In ſo muche that the winnyng of Ti
                  •
               
               wyn or Morlace, is muche more to be eſtemed, than the winnyng of Capua or Carthage. I wille omitte to reherſe, that the emperour Maximilian, hearyng the fame of your hyghneſſe power and excellence, deſyred to be of youre maieſties bande, and vnder your baner in the fielde agaynſt the frenchemen. I wyll alſo leaue to reherſe the wyſe and woorthy conqueſt of the realme of Irelande, wherof at this preſent your maieſtee weareth the Diademe. Neither will I tary to declare the ſundry and moſte lucky victories, that your hyghnes hath of late had agaynſt the promiſſe breakers the double dealynge Scottes. Furthermore, partely for breuitie, and partely for that the thyng beeyng ſo lately dooen, neither the bruite nor the memory therof can not but be ſo freſhe, that it were much ſuperfluous here now to recite the ſame, I haue thought beſt wholly to omitte the long recitall of your late moſt noble, politike, and myghty conqueſt of Bollayne, neuer heretofore by any prince ſubdued, no ſcarcely by any approched vnto, but lefte as a thynge inuin

               ible, and therefore called the mayden towne, the hyſtory wherof requireth the lengthe of a longe volume, if it ſhall be fully chronicled. But ſens of all others that euer wer, Hercules is accoumpted mooſte woorthy the crowne of honourable prayſe, as the chief daunter of monſters: I will nowe with his conqueſtes compare your moſte famous ſubduynge of the Romayne monſter Hydra, whoſe heddes wer ſo many, and the leſt of theim ſo peſtylent, that it is to be thought, he could neuer (without the great aſſiſtence of the diuine power) haue been ſubdued. Thoſe his heddes, by the moſte circumſpect wiſedome and prouidence of youre highnes, be almoſt cleane cutte of, and mortified, the venomons

ſtyng of ignorance plucked awaie, and his power ſuppreſſed: ſo that the walles of his denne of Rome tremble, beholdyng your criſtall ſhielde of prudence: whiche conqueſt I maie well calle ſo muche more woorthie of renoume, than thoſe of Hercules, by howe muche the ſoule of man is to be eſtemed aboue the bodie, or any earthly gooddes. Hercules onely delyuered countreys from the bodily vexation of monſters and tyrantes: your maieſtie dooeth eaſe your ſubiectes bothe in bodie and goodes, but chiefly in their ſoules, by the true knowlege of god and his moſte holy woorde. So that in my hert I wyſhe Liuius to be on lyue agayn, not doubtynge, but he that toke ſuche peyne to deſcriue the actes of your inferiours, Anniball and Scipio, would muche more nowe trauaille, to blowe foorth your mighty magnificence and vertuous enterpriſes with the loude trumpette of immortall fame and memorie. Furthermore the actes of Hercules be moſte ſette forthe by poetes, who (as it is thoughte) haue feigned many thinges more than the trueth was: but of your highnes actes, that

Wherfore I truſte, whan tyme ſhall come, god will not faille to prouide an excellente chronicler, to ſette foorthe the moſte glorious actes of your roiall maieſtie, that are his verie true champion: rewarding your worldly conqueſtes here, with perpetuall renoume and glorie, and after this lyfe (which almyghty god graunt for our benefite, to be veraie longe) remuneratyng your graces godly mynde, intent, and trauailes in his cauſes, with the incorruptible crowne of immortalitie and felicitee eternall bothe of ſoule and bodie.

               THE DESCRIPTION OF HANNIBAL, and of his fyrſte exercyſe in warre. Cap. 1.
            
               
                  AFTER MANY GREAT AND PFrillous batailes fought betwene the Romaines and the Carthaginenſes, at the laſt a peace was taken for certaine yeres: duryng whiche tyme Amilcar than capitayne of the army of Carthage, warred fiue yeres continually in Affrica, with the cities and countreyes adioynynge to Carthage. And from thens he paſſed the ſea with his army into Spayn: where he abode .ix. yeres, in whiche tyme he meruaylonſely increaſed and inlarged the dominion of Carthage. This Amilcar was father to Hanniball, whyche at his ſaylynge into Spayne, was but .ix. yeres of age: but yet his hart and courage was ſuche, that he neuer ceaſſed, tyll he had with fayre and pleaſant wordes opteined lycence of his father, to goo with hym into Spayne. And at his departyng on a ſolemne day whan his father dyd ſacrifice in the Temple, accordynge to the vſe and ceremonye than vſed, yonge Hanniball beinge there preſent, layinge his handes on the holy aultar of the Temple, ſware and auowed, that from thensforth he wolde become a deadly ennemy to the Romayns, and that he wolde vtter the ſame his malice on them as ſoone as he were able. This othe and vowe pleaſed wel his father Amilcar. For his intent was ſhortly after to moue the Carthaginēſes to warre with the Romaines, but he dyed ſoone after: whoſe deathe, with the tender age of his ſonne Hannibal ſtayed that enterpryſe, and cauſed the peace to endure betwene them .viii. yeres longer. Duryng whiche tyme one Aſdruball, that maried the daughter of Amilcar, gouerned the army, a man of great wyſedome and policy. For he by his gentyll entertainyng of princis, and frendly handlyng of his neighbours, more than by batayle, brought many cities vnder the obedience of Carthage. Whoſe facion, in gettyng of frendes, whan the Romaynes perceiued, they ſent vnto hym: and renewyng their olde amitie, entred into a newe league, for the more ſure and ſtable conſeruation wherof, they determined to ſet metes and boundes of both their empires. Wherfore they agreed, that

the ryuer of Iberus 
                  〈◊〉
                depart their two ſeig
                  •
               lories. Further, that the Saguntines (a people that dwelled betwene both theyr dominions, and were then in amitie and league with the Romaines) ſhulde continue in peace and be at libertie, not troubled nor oppreſſed by warre of nother partie. This peace beyng concluded, Haſdruball, that hartily loued Hanniball, ſent his letters, and for his ſake, cauſed the counſell of Carthage to be moued, to lycence Hanniball, beyng than a freſhe yong man, to exerciſe him ſelfe in warre to the intent, when he were of lawfull age, he myght optayne, both the rule and richeſſe, that were his fathers. Wherevnto the mooſte parte of the Senatours agreed. Whervpon Hannibal was incontinent ſent into Spaine, to be Capitaine there vnder Aſdruball. At his fyrſt commyng he gate the fauour of al the armie, and ſo reſembled his father in al pointes, that the olde ſouldiours ſuppoſed Amilcar that was dead, to be reſtored ageine to them aliue. And in ſhort ſpace he brought to paſſe, that his father was not to be compared vnto him, in wynnyng the hartes of people. He excelled ſo in wiſedome, policie, and feates of warre, that whan the Capitayne wolde haue any weighty matier enterpriſed, he wolde to him aboue all other cōmitte the charge therof. He ſo ordred hym ſelfe, both in obeying his capitayn, and rulyng his ſouldiours, that it was harde to knowe, whether he was better beloued of his capytayne or of his hooſte. He was of an hyghe courage in icopardynge on any peryll, and of noo leſſe counſaile in auoyding the ſame. His body and mind coulde with no labour be weried or ouercomme: he coulde as well ſuſteyne heate as colde: of meates and dryakes he vſed none exceſſe, but that wolde ſuffice nature: he preſcribed no tyme to reſte or ſlepe by nyghte nor by daye. And whan he myght from buſynes conueniently reſt, he deſired neyther ſoft beddes, nor quiet ſlepes, but being couered with a ſhorte cloke or ſouldiours garment, he wolde repoſe him vpon the harde earthe. He was not curious in garmentes: In pleaſant horſes and ſure armour was alwayes his delite. Among all the army on horſe backe and on fote he was founde the beſt, he wolde be euer the fyrſt and the laſt in battail: Which his noble vertues lacked not dyuers vyces to accompany theym. For inſtede of mercie and pitie, he vſed extreme crueltie, mixte with vnfeithfulnes,

he regarded not the obſeruyng of his othe, whiche was to his great diſhonour.
         
         
            ¶ Of Hannibals fyrſt warres and victory. Cap. ii.
            
               
                  VVHAN THIS YONG capitayn had thus exercyſed hym ſelfe vnder Aſdruball the ſpace of .iii. yeres, it chaunced that one of that countrey (whoſe mayſter Aſdruball before had ſlayne) ſodeynly ranne on hym, and ſlewe hym. Whervpon beinge taken he nother changed countenance nor feared any punyſhement that ſhuld come to hym therfore: but with ſmilyng countenance receyued his deathe. Than the ſouldiours of the army after the loſſe of Aſdruball immediately by one conſent choſe Hanniball to be theyr gouernour. And he appoynting to warre agaynſt the Romayns, and Italy to be his prouince, thought he wold not long ſtay or tracte the tyme in ouermoch deliberating theron: leſt therby it myght chance vnto hym, as it dyd vnto his father & Haſdrubal, to be oppreſſed by ſome other myſchance, intēded to moue warre to the Saguntines before reherſed. And to colour his intent, he fyrſte led his army into the coſtes of Olcades, a people of Spayne beyonde the ryuer of Iberus, neighbour to the Saguntines, to thende it ſhuld ſeme, that he of purpoſe or by any pretence of warre dyd not ſeke to inuade the Saguntines, but wynning the countreys adioynyng togyther, he ſhulde alſo take Sagunt with hym as it laye in his way in order with the other. Amonge theſe he wanne the citie called Carteia that was very riche, whiche citie beinge ſubdued, the ſmalle townes adiacent wyllyngly ſubmitted them ſelues to be vnder tribute. This done he for the wynter tyme withdrue his armye to a citie in Spayne called newe Carthage. And with diſtributing largely to his ſouldiours the pray before gotten, and welpaying of euery mans wages that was behynde, he wonne the hartes of all the hoſte. So that they holly agreed the nexte ſommer folowynge to warre vppon the Vacceis. Whiche warres brought to paſſe and ended, as they retourned, not farre from the ryuer of Tagus, the banyſſhed people of the countreys

aforeſayde, aſſembled togyther, and reyſed the Carpetanes, by whoſe helpe they were to the numbre of a hundred thouſande, and truſtyng to theyr great multitude, came newly vpon the Carthaginenſes. Anniball perceyuing that great power commyng vpon hym, abſteyned from batayle, and priuily in the nyght conueyed his 
                  〈◊〉
                ouer a fourde, and from thenſe withdrue his people a good ſpace of: ſo that his enemies myght haue place to come ouer the ryuer. Than ſet be xl. elephantes alonge the ryuer ſyde, that they myght be redy to oppreſſe them at the entryng of the water. Alſo he cō
               maunded his horſemen, that as ſoone as the footemen were entred the water, they ſhulde fierſly aſſayle them. The Carpetanes with the Vacceis and Carteians thynkyng theyr ennemies for feare to be fledde from theym, and intendynge to purſue them, without any foreſyght or order, with all ſpede, makyng great clamour, euery man raſhely toke his next way through the water. Hannibals horſmen perceyuing that they were entred the fourde, violently ranne on them, and with litell peyne ouerthrewe a great number of their fotemen in the water, whiche thyng was eaſy to doo, for a footeman in the ſtrength of the ſtreame coulde in no wyſe ſuſteyne the force of a horſeman, onely the ruſhe of the horſe, though the ryder be vnarmed, is able to ouerthrowe any foteman: ſo feble is the ſtay of his fote in the water. Thus ſome were drowned, and ſome other that paſſed ouer the ryuer, were oppreſſed with the elephantes, ſo that in ſhorte ſpace they were all vtterly diſcomfyted and ouercome. For before that thoſe, whiche laſt entred the ryuer (though they eſcaped the danger of the horſemen) coulde recule backe agayn tolande, and aſſemble togyther, and ſet them ſelfe in aray, Annibal with a freſhe band of men entred the water, and ſo quyckly folowed and chaſed them, that fewe eſcaped. Whervpon ſhortly after he conquered al the Carpetanes, and broughtthem vnder ſubiection of Carthage. And thāall the borderers beyonde the water Iberus, holly became tributaries to Carthage, ſauyng only the Sagūtmes, with whom as thāthey had not medled, but diuers quarels were pycked by their neyghbours, to get ſome occaſion to warre ageyuſte them. And that perceiued well the Sagantines. Wherfore to preuent the matter, they ſent meſſangers to Rome, to require ſuccours in the warres that they vndoutedly loked for.
         
         
            
            ¶ Anniball beſlegeth the Saguntines, and howe he was there ſoorewounded. Cap. iii.
            
               THe ſame yere that the Ambaſſadours were ſent to Rome, Publius Cornelius Scipio, & Titus Sempronius Lōgus were conſuls, and whā this matter was waied in the ſenate hous with many other, cōcerning the cōmon welth, Publius Valerius Flaccus, and Quintus Fabius Pamphilus, were choſen ambaſſadours to go to Anniball, with gentyl perſwaſions to withdraw him from warres with the Saguntines theyr frendes: whiche if they coulde nat do, that than they ſhulde go to Catthage to Haſdruball the capitayne, chargynge hym vpon peyne of the truce breakyng, to ceſſe and take vp the warres.
            ¶Whyles the Romaynes prepared theyr legacies, and ordered theyr affayres, Anniball forſlowyng no tyme conuenient to his buſynes, with his army ſpoylyng and waſtynge the countreye, approched and fierſely aſſayled the citie of Sagunt on thre partes. This citie was named the rycheſt that was beyonde the ryuer of Iberus: It ſtode not paſſynge a myle from the ſea: and was in ſhort ſpace ſo mightily increaſed by reaſon of the commodities of the water, the fruites of the lande, and multitude of people, that they excelled all the cities and countreyes aboute theym bothe in number and rycheſſe. Whan Anniball hadde cyrcumſpectly viewed the walles, he founde a corner, from the whyche dydde extende a fayre playne valeye, vnto the whyche corner he layde his ſiege, reyſynge vp certayne engyns of defence, for the ſafegard of his people, tyll they myght approche the walles, and caryenge other ingyns to gyue aſſaute and to beate downe the walles. But bycauſe the fayre playne without that corner, made that ſyde to be in mooſte ieopardye: the citezens therfore had buylded the walles on that parte hygher than the other ſydes. There was alſoo buylded at that coruer a myghty high towre, the ſtrength wherof letted Anniball to lay his ſiege to the towne as he wold haue done: Hot withſtandyng he by reaſon of his engyns, gaue ſo ſharpe aſſaulte, that the cytezens beinge vppon the walles were greately abaſſhed, who at the ſame aſſaulte, not onely defended theyr

walles manfully, but alſo couragiouſly iſſued out of the towne and aſſayled their ennemies, and breakyng downe theyr munimentes and fortifications, entred the towne ageyn welnere to as great loſſe of their ennemies as of their owne people. Whyche thynge whan Anniball perceiued, he ſodaynly with out aduyſement approched to the walles, and was ſtryken with a barbed iauelyn in the thygh, ſo that ſoore wounded he felle to the grounde. Whan his people ſawe hym falle, there was ſuche feare and clamour amonge them, that they cleane gaue ouer the aſſaute, ſo that they ſuffred the towne to be in reſte tyll theyr capitayne was healed. Durynge whiche time of reſt from battayle, the citizens were not vnoccupied. For they fortified them ſelfe the more ſtrongly, for that they perceyued the aſſautes to come ſhulde be more fierce and perillous. Whan Hanniball was cured of his wounde, the ſiege and warre became more deadly and terrible than before. The Carthaginens dayly increaſed, they were to the noumber of Cl. M. who with theyr engins bet downe the walles of Sagunt to the ground in dyuers partes: ſo that they ſemed ſundry tymes to haue won the citie: but they within, where the walles lacked, with ſtrengthe of men defended it. And thus ſometyme hope, and ſometyme diſpayre enforced bothe partes to do theyr vttermoſt.
         
         
            ¶ The commyng of the Romayne ambaſſadours to Hanniball and Carthage, and what anſwere they had of hym and theym. Capit. iiii.
            
               IN the meane ſeaſon of this longe contynued warre, very doubtful and variable on both partes, worde came to Hannibal, that the Romain Legates were come: Vnto whome he ſente a meſſanger, to ſhewe theym, that there was ieopardy in paſſing through ſo perillous and doutfull battayles of ſtraunge and wylde nations: And hym ſelfe was ſo intricate with buſyneſſe, that he coulde not attende to ſpeake with them, or to here their legacy. The ambaſſadours heryng this anſwere departed towardes Carthage, as they were commaunded. Whiche thyng Hanniball perceyuynge, ſent letters to the ſenate and princes of Carthage, that were

frendes, wyllynge theym ſo to induce the people, that they ſhulde in no wyſe ſhewe fauour to the Romaines. So that it came to paſſe, that as they coulde not be receyued of Hanniball, euen ſoo theyr ambaſſage was voyde at Carthage. For whan Hanno, a man of great authoritie, had opened in the ſenate, the peryll and ieopardy of the truce breakyng, and the vengeance whiche might folowe vpon the ſame: and perſwaded, that it ſhuld be neceſſary, that Hanniball, ſhulde be yelded to the Romaynes, for amendes of the truce breakynge: His oration being fyniſhed, the hole ſenate, more inclynynge to the vniuſte enterpryſe of Hanniball than to any reaſonable perſwaſion to the contrarye, eſtemed hym to haue ſpoken more vnfrendly than the legates of Rome. Whervpon they anſwered the ambaſſadours, that Hanniball had done nothing but iuſtely, and that the Romayns dyd wronge in takyng part with the Saguntynes agaynſt theym of Carthage, beynge theyr olde frendes. And thus whyles the Romaynes ſente theyr ambaſſadours to and fro, Hanniball ceaſſed not, but whan his weary ſouldiours releued them ſelfes of theyr peines and trauayle, to encourage his men againſt his ennemies, ſometyme with hope of victory, ſometyme with hope of the ryche pray: ſo that they were in ſuche wyſe encouraged and ſtered, that they thought nothyng able to reſyſte them. And contrarywyſe the Saguntines were no leſſe carefull and diligent to repayre their broken walles, and to prouide thinges to make reſiſtence. Hanniball, who neuer ceſſed, but beinge ſtyll occupied with inuention of ſubtiltie and crafte, commanded a hygh towre of tymber ſo to be made, that it myghte be remoued to euery part of the walles at his pleaſure. Whiche whan it was fyniſhed, he furnyſhed with croſſebowes and other ordynance, wherwith he bette the defenders frome the walles. Than incontinent he ſent .v. C. Affricanes, with pike

               xes and inſtrumentes to vndermyne and breake downe the walles, whiche was very eaſye to brynge to paſſe with ſuche tooles. The walles were of the olde rude makyng, not layde with lyme and ſande, but with clay and blacke morter. Wherfore they had ſoone ouerthrowen a great part of the walles, at whiche breache the Carthaginenſes entred, and came to a hygh place of the citie, whiche they garnyſhed with all kyndes

of ordynances, and made a wall about the ſame, makynge it as a caſtell or fortreſſe for them within the citie. Not withſtandinge the Saguntines, with as great ſhyfte as myght be, made countermures in the towne, and defended theym ſelfe: and ſaued thoſe partes that were not gotten as it myght be. But in ſhorte ſpace they were ſo beaten, that they wyſte not where to defende. Thus the Saguntines defendyng the inwarde partes of theyr towne, loſte dayely more and more of theyr citie. Vitayles alſo fayled theym ſore, by reaſon of the longe ſiege. Agayne, the expectation of theyr ſuccours was in vayne, bycauſe the Romaynes, theyr onely hope, were ſoo farre of. Not withſtandyng they were alyttell comforted, by reaſon that Annibal was ſo ſodaynly ſent for to go againſt the Oretanes and Carpetanes, whiche than were raiſed agayne, and beganne to rebelle, but their warre in the meane tyme ſemed nothing the leſſe, by reaſon of one Maharball, Himilcos ſonne, who kepte the ſiege ſo ſtreightly, that it ſemed the capitayne was not abſent.
            ¶ Whan Anniball was retourned from the Carpetanes and Oretanes warre, the battayle beganne more ſtrongely than before. Duringe whyche tyme, two ſouldiours, one named Alcon a Sagūtine, and the other called Alorcus a Spaniard, hauyng ſome hope of peace, determined to moue Anniball to the ſame. Alcon the Saguntine was brought before Annibal, who ſhewed vnto hym, what they ſhulde do, if they intended to haue peace. Whiche conditions of peace ſemed vnto Alcon very vnreaſonable. Wherfore thinkyng that the Saguntines wold in no caſe agree vnto the ſame: he remained there ſtyll, and wolde not retourne agayne to his citie, affirmynge, that he were worthy to dye, that vnder ſuch couenātes wold treate of peace Whan Alcon had denied, that the Saguntines wold receyue any ſuchetruce, Alorcus aforeſayd, beinge a ſouldiour of Annibals, and an olde frende to the Saguntines, ſuppoſyng that theyr myndes myght be perſwaded to receyue the conditions of peace, ſeing their walles ſo weake, and their towne ſo eaſy to be wonne, promiſed to declare vnto them the contentes of the truce. He deliuering his weapon to the capitaynes of theyr ennemies, was brought to the Pretor Saguntine: and ſo into the ſenate, where, whan the multitude of the commons was a lytell withdrawen, thus he

beganne his oration.
            ¶ If your citezyn and meſſanger Alcon, that came to Anniball to require peace, had lykewiſe broughte from hym vnto you the conditions of the ſame, my cōmyng nowe had ben in vayne. Which thing if he had done, I ſhuld nother as Annibals oratour, nor as a fugityue, haue come vnto you at this tyme. But ſeing that he, either through his owne defaute, or els by yours, tarieth with your ennemies (leſt you ſhulde be ignorant, that there are certayne conditions offered bothe of peace and ſafegard) I for the olde frendſhyp and hoſpitalitie that hath ben betwene vs am come to you: and fyrſt I wolde ye ſhulde perſwade your ſelues, that for your welth and none other cauſe, I ſpeake to you thoſe wordes, which I wyl declare, and this you may well perceyue. For as longe as you were able with your owne power, to make reſiſtence, or truſted to haue ſuccour from the Romayns, I neuer made mention to you of peace. Nowe ſeing there is no hope of ſuccour from the Romains, and your own ſtrēgth and walles do fayle you, being vnable any longer to reſiſt: I bring to you peace more neceſſary than ryghtuous or iuſte. Of the which peace there is yet ſome hope, yf, as Anniball beinge conquerour, doth ſende it, ſo you as people ſubdued, wyll receyue it. For you muſt conſyder, that you beinge conquered, muſte of the conquerour receiue that whiche of his goodnes he wyl giue you as a reward. The conditions of peace are theſe: He wyl take the citie (whyche he hath broken for the moſt parte, and almoſte wonne) from you. He wyll leaue to you the fieldes, and alſo aſſigne a place, where you ſhall buylde a newe citie. He commaundeth alſo your golde, ſyluer, and other goodes, publike and priuate, to be brought to hym. He is contented to ſuffer your ſelues, your wyues and children to paſſe in ſafe garde, if ye go out of the citie vnarmed, takyng with you only double apparell for your bodies. Thoſe thynges your victorious enemy Anniball dothe commaunde you, the whyche your ſorowfull chaunce and fortune dothe perſwade you to accepte. Truely I doubt not, whan ye haue accomplyſhed all theſe his requeſtes, but that ſome of theſe conditions ſhalbe remytted vnto you. I thynke better, you ſhulde rather ſuffer theſe iniuries, than your ſelues to be ſlayne, your wyues and chyldren taken & violently led away before your faces, by the extreme lawes of warre.

               Vhan Alorcus hadde ended his oration, the chiefe rulers of the citie departed ſodaynely from the reſte of the multitude, and gathered all theyr golde and ſyluer frome the publyke and priuate places, into the market place: and before any anſwere was gyuen vnto Alorcus, towchynge his meſſage, they caſte it all into a fyre, that was quyckly made for the ſame purpoſe, and many caſt them ſelfe headlonge after. Whan the feare the trembling and the quakyng for this buſynes had paſſed through the citie, annother rumour was afterward heard. A towre of the citie, that had longe tyme be bruſed and ſhaken, fell downe to the earthe: at which place a company of the Carthaginenſes entred. Anniball in ſuche a chance thynkyng not mete longe to deliberate, with great violence entred the town, and incoutinent cōmanded, that all the youth ſhulde be ſlayne, a cruelle victory, notwithſtanding it was knowen in that caſe almoſt neceſſary. For whiche of thoſe ſhulde be ſpared, that eyther being incloſed with their wyues & children burned theyr houſes ouer them: or els being well armed, wold determine no end of the warre but by deathe? The citie was taken with a great praye: of the whiche moche goodly houſeholde ſtuffe was ſent to Carthage. Some write, the .viii. moneth that the warre began, the citie was won, and that Anniball for the wynter, returned agayne to newe Carthage. Duryng which tyme the ambaſſadours that went to Carthage, brought worde to Rome, that the Saguntines were ouercome and diſtroyed, and their citie taken: Whyche tydinges hearde and knowen for trouthe, brought ſuche heuynes and ſorowe togither to the Romans, What for pitie of theyr frēdes vnworthily loſt, and for ſhame that they had not ſuccoured thē in due tyme, that therby they conceyued as great diſpleaſure toward the Carthaginenſes, and alſo feare of loſſe of their owne countrey and goodes, as though the hole power of theyr ennemies had bene preſente at hande. Thus being troubled at one tyme with dyuers motions of the mynde, they ſeemed rather to quake and tremble than to take counſayle: and good cauſe why. For there neuer warred agaynſte theym a more cruell ennemy, nor more

vehementely gyuen to all kyndes of warre: nother theyr citezens neuer ſoo ſluggyſſhe and vnmeete to warfare as then. Whan they hadde longe bewayled this ſorowfull chaunce, they prepared all thynges as meete and neceſſarye for the warres as they coulde. Some were ſent into Fraunce, ſome into Affrica, and lykewyſe into all other places, where they hadde warres.
         
         
            ¶ Howe the Romayn ambaſſadours ſent to Carthage, and from thens into Spayne, ſpedde. Cap. vi.
            
               AL the foreſaide buſyneſſes prepared and ſet in good order, Quintus Fabius, Marcus Liuius, Lucius Aemilius, Caius Lucinius, and Quintus Bebius were ſent into Affrica, to in quere of the Carthaginenſes, whether Hanniball diſtroyed the citie of Sagunt, by the aſſent of the publyke counſayle or noo. And yf they wold graunt and defende, that it was done by the holle counſaile, than to declare vnto them, that they wold reuenge their wronges in battayle. After the Romans were come to Carthage, and that Quintus Fabius had in the ſenate enquered of the ſenatours of Carthage, accordyng to his cōmaundement, a prince of Carthage anſwered on this wyſe.
            ¶ Oye Romaynes, your fyrſt legacy (whan ye came and required Anniball to be delyuered vnto you, as one that hadde beſieged Sagunt of his owne mynde without our counſayle) was voyde and of none effecte: Howe than ſhulde this your cruell legacy take place, wherin ye requyre of vs a confeſſion of the treſpaſſe, and amendes for the ſame? I thinke it ought not to be inquired, whether Sagunt was diſtroyed by our publike or priuate counſayle, but whether it was done ryghtfully or wrongefully. For your queſtion and conſyderation, as concernynge our cytezen is, whether he enterpryſed the ſyege and battayle by his owne mynde, or by our accorde: and our controuerſy with you is, whether it myght be done, the truce beynge obſerued, or no. Therefore ſythe it muſte be determyned, what rulars maye doo by the common counſaylle, and what of theyr owne wylle: Ye muſte vnderſtande, that the truce that was taken betwene you and vs,

was gyuen by Luctatius, than being your conſull: in whiche it was conteyned, that bothe our frendes ſhuld be ſpared, no mention being made of the Sagūtines, for as th
                  •
               n they were not your frēdes. But verily in the truce, that was taken with Haſdruball, the Saguntines were excepted, againſt which I wyll ſay nothyng, but that I haue learned of you. Truely ye refuſed to obſerue the truce, that C. Luctatius your conſull dyd decree and make with vs, bycauſe it was not done by auctoritie of the fathers conſcripte of your ſenate: than yf you do not obſerue and kepe your bandes and truce, oneleſſe they be conſtitute and made by your auctoritie and cōmandement: We alſo wyll not obſerue the truce takē by Haſdrubal, wherof we were ignorant. Wherfore leaue now to ſpeake of Sagunt and Iberus: and declare boldly that whyche you haue longe tyme conſultynge, deuiſed. Than the Romayn Legate aduaunced forthe hym ſelfe, and ſayd: Here we brynge vnto you peace or warre: take whether you wyll. Whervnto they fierſely anſwered, that he ſhulde giue whether he wold. And whan he agayn ſettyng forth his commandement, had ſhewed theym that they ſhulde haue warre, they aunſwered all: that they wolde accept it, and with no leſſe courage proſecute the warre, than they had receyued it.
            ¶ Whan the Romain ambaſſadours had propoſed the warre as it was commaunded theym, they wente from thenſe into Spayne, with fayre beheſtes to wynne and allure the chiefe cities therof to their fauour, and to tourne from the Carthaginenſes. Fyrſt they came to Barguſies, who receyued them gentilly, bicauſe they were wery to be vnder the dominion of Carthage, ſturring moch people with deſyre of the new warres. From thenſe they came to the Volcians: whoſe wyſe and quicke anſwere ſhortly knowen through Spayne, turned the reſydue of the people from the frendſhyp of the Romaynes. Thus the eldeſt of them in counſayle anſwered.
            ¶ Dye Romaynes, how may ye for ſhame requyre vs to accepte your frendſhyp before the frendſhyp of the Carthaginenſes, whan they that ſo did (the Saguntines) ye more cruelly betrayed than theyr ennemies dyd deſtroy. Therfore I wold counſayle you, to go ſeke your frendes, where the deſtruction of Sagunt is not knowen. For as theyr deſtruction was an heauy and pitiefull thing to the Spaniardes: ſo is the

ſame a great warnyng and teachyng, that no man ſhulde truſt to the promeſſe and frendſhyp of the Romaynes. With this anſwere they were commaunded ſhortly to depart frome the Volcianes, nother coulde they after gette any better frendeſhyp of any of the counſayle of Spayne. And ſoo whan they had in vayne trauailed through Spayn, they cam into France where whan they had before the nobles and great multitude of the people, magnified and extolled the renoume and power of the Romaynes, they deſyred, that the Carthaginenſes ſhulde haue no way through Fraunce, to leade theyr army into Italy. At which requeſt there aroſe ſuch a laughing amonge them, that (as it was ſayd) ſcarſely the youth coulde be pacified of the auncient men and rulers. Their deſyre was thought very folyſhe and vnreaſonable, that the frenchemen ſhoulde not ſuffer the Carthaginenſes to leade theyr armye through Fraunce: but they for other mens pleaſure ſhoulde tourne the warre to them ſelues, and haſarde theyr countrey to be diſtroyed. Whan the noyſe was appeaſed, anſwere was made, that the Romaynes were at noo tyme ſo frendly vnto them, nor the Carthaginenſes ſo great foos, that they wolde eyther holde with the one, or warre againſt the other. They ſayd more ouer, that the Romaynes hadde dryuen dyuers of theyr countrey men out of Italy, and cauſed other to pay tribute, with many other iniuries. Suche anſwere for the moſte parte they receyued through all Fraunce, nor other newes of peace or frendſhyp they ſcarſely hearde before they came to Maſſilia: There they had knowledge by certayne of theyr frendes, that Anniball had obteined the hartes of the frenchmen before, and that he had corrupted the princis and rulers with money, wherof they were moſt couetous and deſirous of all nations. So whan the Romains had wandred through Spayne and Fraunce, at laſte they came to Rome, not longe after the Conſuls were gone to the prouinces, & they founde the citie holly bente on the expectation of warre. For it was euidently knowen, that the Carthaginenſes were paſſed the riuer Iberus.
         
         
            
            ¶ Howe Anniball renewyng the warre, conducted his army into Fraunce to paſſe the mountaynes. Cap. vii.
            
               AFter Sagunt was wonne, Anniball (as afore-is ſayd) went to newe Carthage for the wynter, and there heryng what was done and ſayd both at Rome and Carthage, and that he was not only the capitayne of the warres, but alſo the chief cauſe therof: partyng and deuidyng the reſidue of the pray, and thynkyng to loſe no longer tyme, called the ſouldyours of Spayne togyther, and exhortynge them to warre, ſayde on this wyſe:
            ¶ I ſuppoſe that you my frendes do knowe, ſeingal Spayne is peaſyble and at reſte, that eyther we muſte fynyſſhe the warfare and ſende home our ſouldiours, or els begyn warres with ſome other nation. If we ſeke renoume and victory in other countreys, our owne nation ſhall not onely flouryſhe in goodes, tranquillitie, and peace of theyr owne at home, but alſo enioy the rycheſſe, the iewelles of the ſpoyle at our conqueſt. Wherfore ſeing ye muſt trauayle farre from home, and vncertayne it is, whan ye ſhall retourne agayne to ſe your houſes, and thoſe whome you loue, yf any of you wyll go ſe his frendes, I ſhall gyue hym ſpendynge for a ſeaſon, but I warne you all, that ye be here ageyne with me at the ſprynge of the yere, at whyche tyme I intende to begynne the warres, by the goddis fauour, with great hope of wynnyng and prayſe. Euery man was gladde of the libertie that Anniball of his fre wyll had gyuen them, to go ſe their countreys and frendes. The reſt from trauaile whiche they had all the winter ſeaſon, made them ſtronge and luſtye in theyr bodies and couragious to endure the labours and peynes that were to come. And at the begynning of ver they aſſembled togither, as it was commaunded.
            ¶ Whan Anniball had taken the muſters of all nations that came to ayde hym, he departyng from Gades, accompliſhed his vowe made to Hercules: and bounde hym ſelfe with new vowes, if his other enterpriſes dyd proſperouſely ſuccede. Wherfore prouydyng as well for to withſtande inuaſions, as to inuade by warre, leſte whyle that he iourneyed by lande, through Spayne and France towarde Italy, he ſhulde leaue

Affrica open and naked to the Romayns from Sicilia, he determyned to leaue there ſtronge garriſons in all places. And for that cauſe he ſent for a bend of Affricanes, namely of thoſe that vſe to throwe dartes, and were lyght harneyſed: whiche number of Affricanes he leſte in Spayne, and than ſente he a great number of Spaniardes into Affrica to kepe that countrey, to the intent they beinge eche of them farre from theyr countreys and frendes, ſhuld (as though they were pledges eche for other) play the good ſouldiours, and ſtickyng together, defend in that they myght the one cuntrey of the other. After he had ordered and aſſigned ſtrong garriſons to euery part and region, as to Carthage, Spayne, and Affrica, remouyng his army from Gades to new Carthage, led them from thens to the ryuer of Iberus, and to the ſea coſte. There (it was ſayd) he ſawe in his ſlepe a yong man of a heuenly ſhape, whiche ſayd he was ſent from Iupiter vnto Anniball, to conducte hym into Italy, ſhewyng to him before the deſtruction of Italy: and that he ſhuld procede in his vyage, & ſerche no more? for the deſtenies were hid & ſecrete. Whan he had ſene and herde theſe thinges, he conueied his hoſte, deuided into thre partes, ouer the riuer of Iberus. Diuers of his frendes he ſent before hym, to wyn the hartes of the frenchemen with giftes, through whoſe cuntry he muſt nedes paſſe: and alſo to viewe the paſſages ouer the mountains. He conducted .lxxx. and .x. M. fotemen, and .xii. M. horſemen ouer the foreſayd water of Iberus. Than ſubdued he diuers townes & dominions therabout, which lay at the fote of the mount of Pyrene, and there he appoynted Hanno with .x. thouſande footemen, and a thouſande horſemen to remayne to kepe thoſe paſſages and ſtraites, whiche lay betwene France and Spayne, whan they began to approche nigh to the foreſaid high and dangerous mountayns, and that it was openly knowen, that the war was taken againſt the Romains, thre thouſande of the Carpetanes footemen, ſodainly departed from the hoſte, and forſoke him: not for feare of the warre, but for the longe iorney, and perillous paſſage ouer the mountayns, almoſte vnable to be paſſed. Anniball ſeing he coulde not change theyr mindes, and that it was doutfull to kepe them by violence, leſt it ſhuld ſtere the fierce myndes of the reſydue and make them wery, ſent after thē aboue .vii. M. other more, ſuche as he ſuppoſed

to be wery of the warfare: fay

               ing that he had alſo licenced them that were fyrſt ſtolen away, to depart home, bycauſe of the tedious iourney: this dyd he to thintent the reſte ſhulde haue none occaſion to leaue or forſake hym. And than leſt by prolongyng the tyme, he ſhuld hynder the myndes of the reſydue, he ledde his hoſte forthe with ſpede, and paſſyng the mountaynes of Pyrene, pitched his tentes before a towne, called Illiber. The frenchmen although they herde that the Carthaginenſes were come to warre vpon Italy, yet bicauſe the fame went, that the Spaniardes on the other ſyde of the hyll of Pyrene, were by them ſubdued, and ſtrong garriſons therfore there lefte, being afraide of ſeruitude, armed them, and moche people aſſembled at a towne called Ruſcino. Whiche thyng whan Anniball herde, fearyng more delay of tyme, than warre, with as great haſte as myght be, he ſent oratours to theyr rulers, deſyryng to ſpeake with them: ſhewyng that he came not as an ennemy, but as a gueſt or frende to France, and that he wolde not, if it pleaſed theym, drawe his ſworde, before he were paſſed France. The frenchemen hering this, incontinent remoued to Illiber, and with good wyll came to Anniball, whiche wan

               THus Annibal either with feare or with money wynnynge the countreys as he wente, brought his hoſte to a fielde of the Volcanes, a ſtronge kynde of people, which inhabyted on both ſydes the water of Rhodanus, who doubtyng the power of the Carthaginenſes, and myſtruſtynge theyr owne ſtrengthe, conueyed all that they hadde ouer the ryuer, and formoſte kept the parte therof, that the ryuer ſhulde be as a munyment or defence to them: The reſidue of the inhabitantes, that remained there (bycauſe they were gladde to rydde the countrey of ſuche a huge numbre of men of warre) were ſuche

contented to be reteyned by Anniball for rewardes to make botes nd ſhyppes, to paſſe ouer the ryuer: ſo that in ſhorte ſpace they hadde gotten and newe made a greatte nauye of ſhyppes, and of ſmall cockebotes. The frenchemen beganne to faſſhion botes, hewynge trees and makynge theym holowe, after the ryghte faſſhion: And than the ſouldyours theym ſelues, bothe for the plentye of tymber and alſo the eaſynes of the crafte, euery man hewed his tree, and made a bote to carye hym ſelfe and his ſtuffe ouer. Whanne all thynge was made redye to paſſe ouer, the great companye of ennemies on horſebacke and o

Certayn frenchemen were appoynted to guyde and conuey them vp alonge the ryuer ſyde: Who conducted them the ſpace of .xxv. myles vp the ſtreame to

The Spanyardes throwyng theyr clothes vpon botels, and ſittynge on their ſheldes faſtned aboue theron, paſſed the ryuer, the reſt of the hoſte, ioynyng botes togyther, paſſed ouer, and pitched their tentes on the other ſyde of the riuer, where after their nyghtes iorney, and wery days labour, they reſted all that day and nighte to refreſhe them. The nexte day they remoued from thens, and with bournyng made a ſmoke, to ſignifye that they were paſſed the ryuer, and they were not farre of.

Publius Cornelius Scipio, beinge conſull and capitayn of the Romaine army, loked for none other thynge but that Anniball ſhulde gyne hym battayle. And like it was, that he wold ſo haue done, had not the legates of the Boios, and the ruler of Fraunce (whyche offered them ſelfes as cō

            ¶ Whan he had with theſe exhortations incouraged them, the next day he remoued from Rhodanus, and toke his waye through the myddell of France, not bicauſe that was his next way, but for that he wolde not mete the Romanes before he came into Italy. Wherfore he wente the further frome the ſea, and brought his hoſte into a lyttell Ile. The inhabitauntes wherof were called Allobroges, a kynde of people, that in honour and rycheſſe myghte not lyghtely be matched in Fraunce. Amonge them was great diſcorde, by reaſon of two bretherne that ſtroue for the lande.

Whyche done, the ſayde lande ayded hym with men, vitayles, clothes, to defende them from the colde of the mountaynes, and other neceſſaries, and ſo he departed to go to the mountaynes, not holdyng the ryght waye, but helde on the lefte hande ſtylle without interruption vntyll he came to a floudde called Druentia, this was in all Fraunce the daungerouſt ryuer to paſſe ouer.

And whan he vnderſtoode, that there was no going that way, he pitched his tentes in the playneſt valey that he could fynd among the

And perceyuyng by the Frenchemen, who knew almoſt their language, that the beſert paſſages were kept on the day time, and that on the nyght euery of them wolde repayre to theyr cotages or houſes. The nexte mornyng he gatte vp on the hylles, makyng ſemblance as though

               pent the hole day, diſſemblyng to do one thing, and intendyng an other, tyll it was nyght: than he withdrue hym to his campe, where he before reſted. But ſo ſoone as he wyſt, that the mountayne men, and thoſe that watched the paſſage, were gone to their reſt: he made many great fyres, and leauyng all the cariage and ſtuffe, with the horſemen and moſte part of the fotemen in his cāpe, hym ſelfe with a great numbre of lyght and valiant men, quikly paſſed the ſtraites, and gate the ſame hylles, that the other kepte before: The nexte day the hoſte and ſtuffe beganne to come after. In the mornyng the mountayne men aſſembled to go to their places as they were wont to doo. But whan they ſawe their enemies had gotten their caſtels and places aboue their heades, it feared them ſore, and cauſed them to ſtay for a ſeaſon. Afterwarde, whan they ſawe ſo great feare amonge the hoſte in the ſtreites, and that they were almoſte confounded with theyr owne noyſe and trouble, the horſes trembling for brede: they thought to put them to further trouble, and to worke them more diſpleaſure. Wherfore they came down by the hylles ſyde along the rockes, being vſed therto, where none other coulde eſcape: And nowe here, nowe there, inuaded the army, ſo that what for the dangerouſnes of the paſſage, and alſo by their ennemies they were meruaylouſly encumbred. But aboue al other troubles the greateſt was, that whan thay ſawe them ſelues thus in danger by reaſon of their ennemies and of the paſſage: than ſtroue the one with the other, who ſhuld fyrſt eſcape the daunger therof, by paſſynge fyrſt the ſayd ſtraites, fyghtyng more with theyr owne company than with theyr ennemies. Theyr cattell being alſo ſtriken and hurt by the derth of the mountayns, roryng and yellyng, hurt and ouerthrewe many of the hooſte, ſome armed, ſome vnarmed downe the hygh mountaynes, with ſtuffe and baggage, that pitie it was to beholde. Whan Anniball was in formed therof, he deſcended with a greate number with hym and at his fyrſt commyng, he diſparkled and put his enemies

to flight, ſo that afterward he had not only leiſ

               n he toke the caſtell the chiefe place of all that region, and other theyr villages. And with the captiues cattell he founde his army thre dayes. Departyng from thenſe he came to an other ſorte of mountayne people, whyche not by battayle, but being taught by the deſtruction of theyr neyghbours, with crafte ſubtilty and wyly deceytes, wrought hym moche diſpleaſure. Certain of the eldeſt and chiefeſt of the caſtelles came to Anniball, ſhewynge hym, that they beyng admonyſhed with the harme of theyr neyghbours, wolde rather haue his frendſhyp and amitie, than prouoke the wrathe of the Carthaginenſes, offeryng to obey his commaundementes, and to ayde him with vytailes, and to conducte hym and his people on theyr way, and for the aſſuraunce thereof, they offered to delyuer hym pledges. Anniball as wyſe and taught in ſuche ruſynes, neyther gaue to theyr wordes ouer haſty credence, nor deſpyſed theyr gentyll offer: leſt therby he ſhulde haue made them his manyfeſt enemyes, but ſobrely receyued theyr hoſtages, and vſed theyr ayde vpon the way: whoſe guides he folowed not neglygently, but in good order and araye. The elephantes and horſemen were ſet before, and Anniball hym ſelfe came after with the ſtrengthe of his footemen in good aray, wyſely ouerlokyng all thynge. Wh
                  •
               n they came to a more narow waye, hauyng an hygh hylle on the one ſyde, the ſayd barbaryke people ſodaynly ſet vpon them bothe behynde and afore, rollyng downe great ſtones among the hoſt: The rerewarde was by them ſoore troubled: ſo that yf it had not ben ſurely defended, many of them had bene deſtroyed. In this trouble and peryll remayned they all the day: tyll the nyght cauſed the ennemyes to withdrawe. On the morowe they were nothyng ſo vexed as the day before. For theyr aſſaultes were but ſkyrmyſhes, ſometyme before, ſomtime behynde. Wherfore they paſſed the ſtreytes, and came to the toppe of the mountaynes, within the ſpace of .ix. days, not without great ieopardy and ſlaughter, but more of the beaſtes than of the men. There Anniball cauſed the army, beinge weryed with labour, trauayle, and fyghtynge, to reſte theym the ſpace of two dayes. Duryng whiche tyme there fell ſuche abundance of ſnowe, that it reuewed theyr ſorowes, for the ſnowe fyllyng

euery place as the armye ſhulde paſſe in the mornynge, made them almoſte deſperate. Anniball perceyuynge theyr great diſcourage, gotte before the ſ

               anders, and went vp on a hylle, from whence he myghte ſee farre and wyde, where cauſyng his army to ſtay a lyttell, he ſhewed to them Italy, and the fayre fieldes that lay aboute the ryuer of Padus, adioynynge to the mountaynes: and he ſayde vnto theym, that after they had paſſed theſe mountaynes, they had alredy ſcaled the walles not onely of Italy, but alſo of the verye citie of Rome, ſhewing them, that all other paſſages were plaine, eaſy, and nothynge daungerous: and that within two or thre battayles at the moſte, they ſhoulde attayne Rome, whyche was the head of Italy. With that the hoſte beganne to ſette forewarde without any interruption, except it were by ſmall inuaſions, as it were of robbers, and ſuch ſmall ſkyrmyſhing: But the way to deſcende was than more daungerous than it was at the aſcendyng vp of the ſame: for it was ſo narowe, ſtipe, and ſlyppy, that they coulde not ſaue them ſelues from fallyng. And whan one ſlode, he ouerthrewe hym, that went before hym, ſo that men and cattell were in ieopardy of theyr lyues. After that came they to a moche more ſtrayte rocke, the clyſſes therof were ſo hygh and ſtype, that with greatte peyne, the ligier ſouldyours, by takynge holde of the ſhrubbes and trees, that grewe on the rocke ſyde, coulde deſcende downe. The place, whyche was before of his owne nature pytchelonge, by ſodayne breakynge downe of the earthe, was made a thouſande foote ſtype ryght downe to the bottome. The horſemen ſtayed there, as thought they hadde bene at theyr iourneyes ende. Whan Anniball inquired, what cauſed theym to tarye, it was ſhewed hym, that noo manne coulde paſſe the daunger of the rocke. Than wente he to ſee the place hym ſelfe: and it ſeemed to hym, that by the pathes and wayes, whyche appeered to haue bene vnvſed, by leyſure and longe compaſſe, he myght well ynoughe conuey his armye aboute the rocke, but all was in vayne, for vppon the olde yſe and froſen ſnowe there was the nyghte before newe ſnowe fallen of a ſmall thyckeneſſe, whyche after a lyttell goynge vppon, thawed and gaue ſome what agayne, and became ſoo ſlyppy, that ſkarſely vppon theyr handes and knees could they ſuſtayne theym ſelues.

After this maner they came into Italy, the fyft moneth after they ſette forthe from newe Carthage: And as ſome writers ſay, they paſſed the mountaynes in .xv. dayes.

               AT Anniballes commynge to thoſe parties, he found moch for his purpoſe, the Taurines and Inſubres warryng one agaynſte the other, but he coulde not arme his hoſte to helpe the one parte, for their bodies were ſo wery of labour, theyr clothes ſo foule and fylthy, that ſome deſyred to reſt after theyr trauaile, ſome ſought for vitayles after theyr hunger, ſome taried to chaunge their apparayle and make cleane theyr garmentes: they were ſo ſoore handled in paſſynge the mountaynes. Which thyng P. Cornelius Scipio the conſull perceyued well, and that cauſed hym to make the more ſpede with his army to the ryuer of Padus, that he myght fight with them er they were refreſhed of theyr great labour, or could haue time to furniſhe their army. Scipio had receiued of Manlius and Attilius, an hoſt of newe ſouldiors, not moch exerciſed in warres, and ſuch as were ſtraungers to him. Whan he was come to Placentia, Annibal was remoued and had taken and deſtroied the chiefe citie of the Taurines, bycauſe they wold not willyngly yelde them: and had wonne to his amitie all the dwellers about Padus, had not the comming of the conſull feared them. By that tyme that Anniball was a litel remoued from the Taurines, the two hoſtes were almoſt mette, and alſo the capitaynes. And as nother of them was as than knowen to the other, ſo they were ſtryken with a certayne admiration the one of the other. For Anniball, by the wynning of Sagunt was drad of the Romayns: and like wyſe he ſuppoſed Scipio to be of no leſſe fame and worthyneſſe, for that he was choſen of the Romayns to be capytayn agaynſt hym. Than Scipio paſſed ouer Padus, and remoued his campe to a ryuer called Ticinus: Where before he wold gyue battayle, to exhorte and encourage his men, this he began his oration vnto them.
            ¶ If I had (louyng ſouldiours) the ſame armye, that I had in Fraunce with me, I wolde not ſpeake vnto you that, which I intende at this preſent tyme to ſay. For what ſhuld it nede to ſtere and incourage thoſe horſemen, whyche at the ryuer

of Rhodanus ſoo valyantly ouerthrewe theyr ennemies: or thoſe legions, with whom I folowed this our fugitiue ennemye. Nowe for bycauſe that hoſte was ſent by the ſenate of Rome into Spayne, there to make warre vnder my brother Cneius Scipio, to the intent you ſhulde haue bothe a conſull and capitayne agaynſte Anniball and the Carthaginenſes, I wyllyngly toke vpon me this warre. A newe capitayn to new ſouldiours ſhuld vſe fewe wordes. Notwithſtandyng leſt ye ſhulde be ignorant in this kind of warre, and not knowe with whome ye ſhall fyght: ye ſhall vnderſtand, that with theſe ye ſhall haue a do, whom in your laſte warres, ye ſubdued bothe by lande and ſea, of whom ye toke truage perforce the ſpace of twenty yeres: from whom alſo you wonne Sardinia and Sicilia as a prey of warre. Therfore in this battayle ye muſt haue the ſame hartes and myndes, that is wont to be in conquerours: and in your ennemies muſte nedes be ſuche hartes as happen to men ouercome. And they do not now gyue batayle of theyr owne hardyneſſe and courage, but bicauſe they can not choſe: oneleſſe you thynke, that they, which hauyng theyr hole army freſhe and luſty, withdrewe them and durſte not encounter with vs in battayle beyonde the mountaynes, and whyche loſte two partes bothe of horſemen and footemen in paſſynge ouer the ſame mountaynes: ſhulde haue nowe more hope and truſt than before. And thoſe fewe that be left of them, haue loſte both hartes and ſtrength: ſo that they are nowe ymages, yea rather ſhadowes of men, than men in dede beinge clonged together with hunger and colde, feynte and febled emonge the rocky hylles. Beſydes this, theyr ſynewes and veynes are ſhronke togyther with colde of the ſnowe, theyr membres wythered with froſte and yſe, theyr harnies ſhaken, ruſty, and brokē, theyr horſes feble and lame. With theſe enemies you muſt fyght, ye they ar the leuynges of your ennemies, and not your ennemies. And I feare nothynge more, than before you ſhall fyght with your foos, it ſhalbe thought, that the mountayns haue fyrſt ouercome thē, and taken the honour from vs. But ſo it is perchance neceſſary and mete, that the goddis without mans helpe, and without battayle, ſhulde ouercome them, that are truce breakers. And we that be violated and diſceyued, ſhulde next after the goddis (as theyr myniſters) bryng them to vtter confuſyon.

Peraduenture many of you wyl ſuppoſe, that I ſpeake theſe wordes proudly and hyghly, onely for your exhortation and comfort, and that I ſhulde thynke otherwiſe my ſelfe: Therfore ye ſhall vnderſtand, that I was ſent into Spayn to myne owne prouince, whether I was nowe going with myne hoſt, where I ſhulde haue vſed bothe the felowſhyp and counſayle of my brother in all peryls and ieopardies, and ſhoulde haue fought rather with Haſdrubal being leſſe of power, than with Hanniball: and ſo ſhuld I haue had leſſe to do. Not withſtandyng whan I arriued with my ſhyppes beyonde the coſteo of Fraunce, landyng I hearde great bruite of Anniball, and ſendyng a certayne horſemen before, pitched my tentes at Rhodanus: and there my company ouerthrewe and put to flyghte thoſe, with whom it was theyr chaunce to mete in battayle. Than bycauſe I could not with footemen ouertake myne ennemy, whiche fled before me, I returned to my ſhippes, and with as good ſpede as I could make, ſayling a great compaſſe about, arriued here, to mete hym in the front of the mountaines, to the intent to gyue hym battayle: And to proue whether the earthe hath brought forthe ſodainly, within the ſpace of theſe .xx. yeres, other Carthaginenſes, than were wonte to be bredde there or no.

Therfore ſouldiours, I wolde haue you fyghte not onely with ſo good a courage as ye were wonte agaynſte other ennemies, but alſo with ſuche an indignation and diſpleſure, as though you ſawe your ſeruantes armed to fyght agaynſt you.

               WHyles Scipio the conſulle in this maner exhorted the Romaines, Anniball thynkyng fyrſt to encourage his men with dedes, before he wolde exhort theym with wordes, diſpoſed his army in compaſſe as it were to beholde a fyght, and thanne he brought in the middes of them the mountayne men

Whan they all hadde deſyred armour and battayle, he cauſed lottes for them to be caſte, and accordyng to the lotte loſed a great number of them, who with leapyng and ſkypping after theyr maner, euery of them ſhortely toke his armour, beinge as ioyfull and glad to dye with honour, as to lyue with ſhame and in capti

               itie. Than incontinent he called his ſouldiours aboute hym, and made to them an oration in maner and forme folowynge.
            ¶ If ye haue any mynde or remembrance of the example of the ſtrangers fortune not longe paſſed, ye ſhuld haue the ſame euen nowe, in wayinge your owne fortune and chaunce. We haue ouercome in battayle thoſe our captiues. Wherfore ye muſt thynke, that all theſe your priſoners, nowe ſhewed before you, were not ſhewed as a ſpectakle for you to beholde, But as a certayn reſemblance of your owne chaunce and condition, in caſe ye be nowe ouercome and taken? And I can not tell, whether fortune hath gyuen greatter bandes, and more vrgent neceſſitie to you, than it hath gyuen heretofore to theſe captiues. Two ſeas doo compaſſe you bothe on the ryght hande and on the lefte: and ſhyppes haue you none to eſcape awaye withall. The water of Padus is all aboute vs, more violent than the ryuer of Rhodanus, and at our backes are the hygh mountayns, which ye paſſed with ſo great peyn and peryll. Wherfore louing ſouldiours, ye muſt eyther ouer come your ennemies at the fyrſt encounter, or els be ſlayne. And the ſelf fortune, which hath brought you now into ſuche neceſſite, that nedes ye muſt fight or die: the ſame fortune ſhal giue you ſuch rewardis, if ye ſubdue your enmies, as no mortall men can deſire greatter of the immortall goddis. If we ſhuld by our valiantnes recouer agayne but onely Sicilia and Sardinia, whiche were wonne from our forefathers, it might be thought a ſufficient reward. But in caſe we ſpede wel now what ſo euer the Romains haue goten with ſo many victories and triumphes, and all the dominions, which they nowe poſſeſſe, ſhall be all ours, with the princis, lordes, and rulers of the ſame. To wynne ſo ryche a preye with fauour and helpe of the goddis, arme youre ſelfe, and ſette forthe boldely.

Nowe it is tyme to get your ryche prays meaſuryngly our great rewardes accordynge to the deſertes of your trauaile, enterpryſing this ſo great a iourney, paſſing ouer ſo many mountayns and ryuers, and by ſo many kyndes of armed people. Here fortune hath gyuen you an ende of your trauayle: Here fortune wyl rewarde you accordyng to the coſtes and charges that you haue ben at. Nor ye ſhuld not ſuppoſe the vyctory to be ſo harde, as the battayle is of great name. Oftentimes a ſmall hoſt hath made a great and a doutful battayle: agaynl noble people yea and kynges haue ben ouer come in a lytel moment. For take away the terrible ſound of the name of Rome, and what are they to be compared to you? Your great warres this .xx. yeres, with your manhod with your good fortune I ſpeake not of: I wyl only remembre thynges of late done. Ye are come hyther from the pyllars of Hercules, from the Occean ſea, frome the furtheſt parte of the worlde, paſſyng through and conqueryng ſo many fierce and cruell nations of Spayne and France. You ſhall nowe fyght with yonge and vntaught ſouldiours, of late beaten and ouercome by the Frenchemen, and as yet vnknowen to theyr capitayne, and he vnto theym. Shall I that was born and brought vp in the noble hous of my father, that hath ben the chaſtyſer of Spayne and France, that haue conquered not onely the people of the mountaynes: but alſo all the paſſages, whiche is moche more: compare my ſelfe with this weake capytayne of a fourtenyght olde, wandrynge frome hoſte to hooſte: to whom yf a man this day wolde ſhewe the army of Carthage and the army of the Romains togyther: he can not tell of whyche hoſte he is gouernour, but only by the banners and badges. Surely worthy warriors, I eſteme not this a lyttell, that there is none of you, before whome I haue not done ſome worthy feate of warre. At that tyme ye dyd extolle and laude me, and thought me worthy of gyftes and preferrement. And nowe I ſhall more lyke a father than a capytayne, before you all enter into battayle agaynſte theſe people, that nother knoweth vs, nor any of theym knoweth other. Where ſo euer I caſte myne eyes, I ſee nothynge amonge you but hardyneſſe and ſtrength, the moſte aunciente and famous footemen, the mooſte noble armed and vnarmed horſemen, and you moſte faithfull and hardy Carthaginenſes

We brynge warre and banners dyſplayed into Italy noyſome to the Romaynes: And ſo moche more boldly we may fyght, in how moche the hope and courage of vs that inuade, is ſtronger than theyrs that onely defende. Beſydes all this theyr wronge, and vnworthy dealyng towarde vs, bothe kendle and encourage our myndes. For fyrſt I beinge capitayne was requyred, and than all you that were at the deſtruction of Sagunt, were in lykewyſe requyred to be delyuered to the Romayns to be put to deathe. This moſte cruell and proude nation dothe all thynges after theyr owne brayne and iudgement: they wyll determyn with whome we ſhall haue warre or peace. All thing that they do, they thynke it ryghtefull. They wylle appoynte hylles and fluddes to be boundes and meres, whyche we may not paſſe, yet wyll not they obſerue the places and termes, whych they haue ſette and preſcribed them ſelues. Thou ſhalt not (ſaye they) paſſe Iberus, leſt thou make the a do with the Saguntines, Sagunt is at Iberus: Therefore you ſhall not moue thyther from your appoynted place. They eſteme it but a litell to haue taken from vs our moſt auncient prouinces, Sardinia and Sicilia, but they woll haue Spayn alſo. And if they wynne that, than they wyll haue Affrica. I may well ſay Affrica alſo, For they haue ſent two conſuls this yere, one into Affrica, and an other into Spayne. There is nothynge lefte to vs, but that that we muſte be fayne to wynne agayne with the ſworde. If feare compelle theym, lyke cowardes to flee here from vs, they haue places ynoughe to receyue theym, they knowe the countreys and wayes wherby to eſcape: It behoueth you to play the valyant men, and ſettyng all at ſix and ſeuen, eyther to vanquyſhe, or elles yf fortune frowne, rather manfully to dye in battayle, than to be ſlayne in fleyng away, If this that I haue ſayd, be faſt fixed in your myndes, I ſay to you for certayne, you haue all ready the vyctorye.

But in a whyle the Romain fotemen fledde backe to their battayle, where beinge myngled with the horſemen, they cauſed great confuſion: but whan the Numidian horſemen, whiche were on the wynges, came on theym alſo, than fledde they on all partes to their campe. In this conflict was the conſul Scipio ſoore wounded, whom with great peyn his horſemen caried out of the fielde to theyr great diſcomforte. Wherfore the nyght folowyng, the Romanes, makyng as litell noyſe as myght be, that theyr ennemies ſhulde haue noo knowledge, remeued from Ticinus to Padus: and came to Placentia, before that Anniball wyſt that they were departed from Ticinus.

               DVryng this tyme was Sempronius the other conſull going to Sicilia with his army, but in his iourney he receiued letters from the ſenate, of the entring of the Carthaginenſes into Italy, requiring him to aide the other conſule as ſone as he might. Which whan he perceiued, he layd garriſons in diuers places, to defend the prouinces, and came him ſelfe with a ſtrong power into Italy, to kepe the coſtes.

               ted by his fyrſt battayle and ſore wounde, wold rather prolong the matter than fight. But the other being freſhe and luſty, and therfore more fierce, wold haue no delay, thinking it great honour vnto him, if he might recouer agayn that the other conſul had loſt. Wherfore he ſayd, that there was no man wold deferre the battaile, but only he, who being more weaker in his harte than in his body, for the remēbrance of his wound, did refrain to fighte. And alſo that the tyme ought not to be prolonged with ſicke folkes. Shal we tary and loſe time? For what third conſull, or what other army ſhall we abyde? The Carthaginenſes haue pitched theyr tentes in Italy, and weluere in the citie of Rome: who ſeeke nowe neither Sicilia, nor Sardinia, that were afore conquered from them, nor Spayne beyonde Iberus, but they are come to driue and expell the Romaynes out and from their owne lande and natiue countrey. O (ſay the he) howe moch wold our fathers, who were wont to warre before the walles of Carthage, lament, if they ſawe vs their children, ye and two conſuls, with their two hoſtes, tremblynge and quakynge in Italie within our owne campe, and that the Carthaginenſes had wonne al the feldis betwene the Alpes and Apenni

And alſo the choſynge of offycers at Rome, prouoked hym to make haſte, leſte that the taryinge for his felowe beyng hurte, myght be occaſyon of theyr loſſe of preyſe and victory: and leſt the warre myght be cōmytted to new conſuls, whoſe election was than at hand. Which thin

ges conſydered, they prepared for the batayle in haſte. Annibal although he thought, that nothyng ſhalde be done vnwarely, ſens the two cōſuls were mette together, and that the warre ſhulde be cruell and ſtrong: yet dyd not he myſtruſte good fortune, bycauſe of his fyrſt battayle. He was alſo the more buſy and intentiue to do battayle, whyles he thoughte the ſouldiours his ennemies were yong and rawe in the warres, and whiles one the beſte conſull was yet not hole of his woundes: and whiles the Frenchemens hartes of his armye (of whom he than had a great numbre) were ſtronge and hardy, whoſe courage he thought and knewe well wolde rather dyminyſhe than increace, whan they ſhoulde be brought any further from theyr owne countrey. Theſe thynges conſidered, he ſent certayn Frenchmen abrode the cuntrey as ſpies, who ſhewed hym, that the Romayns were all redy to fyght. Than Anniball wente to ſee and prouide a place for diſceyte. There was in the myddes betweene the two hoſtes, where the fielde ſhuld be, aryuer whiche was cloſed on both ſides, with greatte and hygh bankes, be ſette aboute with the wiedes of the fennes, whiche almoſte couered all the grounde, with yonge wyllowes and ſhrubbes, and alſo with hygh buſſhes and thornes: whyche whan he had ſerched and perceyued it to be a place obſcure and darke ynough, to hyde an inbuſſhement of horſemen in, he ſayde to his brother Mago: This place ſhalt thou kepe, and thou ſhalte (ſayde he) choſe vnto the one thouſande of horſemen, and oone thouſande of fotemen, of the beſt of myn army, to lye here in theſe couert places: and whan tyme ſhal requyre, to do as I ſhal ſhew you what therto appertayneth: and be ye ſure, that ye ſhall haue ennemies blynd in theſe feates of warre. Whan Mago had a M. horſemen, and a. M. fotemen deliuered to him, Anniball commaunded the Numidian horſemen, the nexte mornyng to paſſe the water of Trebia, and ryde vp and downe before the gates of his ennemies campe: and whan they hadde with caſtyng and throwyng into theyr tentes and ſtations, prouoked them to iſſue out to batail, alluring them to purſue after, that then they ſhuld by litell and litell recule backe again ouer the ſaid riuer. The reſidu of the capitayns he cōmāded, that they ſhuld cauſe al their men to dyne & refreſhe them ſelfes, & after to be in a redynes, againſt they ſhuld be called to the battaile.

Sempronius bearyng the rumour of the Numidies, brought all his army (beinge very deſyrous of battayle) to the ryuer, whervnto the other reculed backe, as was appointed by Anniball. The weather was extremely colde, and it ſhowed faſt. The ſouldiours hadde taken no ſuſtenance before, nor made any prouiſion to ſtrength and kepe theyr bodies warme from the colde froſt and ſnowe. But in all haſte folowyng the Numidians, theyr crafty ennemyes that fledde before theym, entred into the ryuer. Nowe was the water ryſen that nyghte, by reaſon of that ſnowe, as high as theyr breſtis. Whan they cam out of the water, theyr bodies were ſo ſtark and benommed with colde, that ſcarſely they could holde theyr armour vpon them: and alſo towarde the myddes of the daye, they beganne to faynt for hunger. In the meane ſeaſon Anniball cauſed great fyres to be made before his ſouldiours tentes, that euery man might warme him: and alſo to put oyle in their gloues, whyche ſhoulde ſouple their ioyntes and membres. Whan they hearde that theyr ennemies were paſſed the ryuer, beinge luſty bothe in body and harte, euery man toke his weapon and went to battayle. Anniball ordred his battayles circumſpectly: fyrſt he ſette forthe his throwers of dartes, whyche were of the yles called Baleares, than his light harneyſed fotemen, to the numbre of .viii. M. and after them the other footemen: he alſo beſtowed in the .ii. wynges .x. M. horſemen, in whom reſted the great ſtrength of his battayle, and into theſe wynges alſo he departed his elephantes, puttynge them craftily before the fyght of his ennemies horſes, whyche were not wont to them, ſo that for ſtrangenes of the ſyght, and the vnaccuſtomed ſauour of them, they ſcattered abrode, and than the battayle by the footemen was maynteyned for a ſeaſon: But 
                  •
               none, what by reaſon of the horſmen and elephantes, and alſo through the ſodayne commynge of Mago with the Numidians, that fierſely aſſayled the Romaynes at theyr backes, they were ſtryken with ſuche feare, that they fledde on all partes: Some ieoparded to take the water ageyne, and eſcaped to theyr tentes, but of them were but fewe, for either they were drowned in the depe water, or els ſlayne of theyr ennemies in the chaſe at the water ſyde. Many toke the ryght way to Placentia, and therby were ſaued. On the other ſyde the Carthaginenſes were ſoo beaten

with the rayne myxte with ſnowe, and with the intollerable colde, that the beaſtes, elephantes, and men, were almoſt peryſhed. The ryuer of Trebia cauſed them to retourne from the purſuite of the Romans: ſo that almoſte deade for colde they came to theyr campe, with very ſmall ioy of theyr victory. The next night Scipio conueyed his hoſte ouer the ryuer of Trebia, and ſo to Placentia, vnware to the Carthaginenſes: who by reaſon of the vehement ſtorme of rayne that felle that nyght, coulde not here the remouyng: or elles for peyne of theyr woundes and werynes of labour, dyſſembled the matter and toke no hede ther of. Thus were the Romans conueyed peaſibly to Placentia, and from thens they paſſed ouer Padus to Cremona. Whan the chance therof was knowen at Rome, there aroſe ſuche ſo dayn feare among them, as though theyr ennemies had ben come alredy with baners diſplayde before the gates of Rome: Neyther had they hope of any further ſuccours, wherby they myght defende theyr enemyes from their gates and walles: The one conſul being ouercome at Ticinus: and the other called frome Sicilia to helpe hym: and nowe bothe beinge togyther ouercome, and their two hoſtis.

Than the conſull in the next morning, with his horſemen before, and his legions in good order folowyng after, came thither, and gaue them battayle, in the whiche Anniball was wounded: Wherby the Carthaginenſes were in ſuche feare, that they gaue backe, and the peace laſted whyles Anniballes wounde was in healynge. And ere he was fully cured, he went to a place called Vicunuias. That place was ſurely kepte by the Romanes, who being a great numbre, what of the garriſon, what of the townes mē, alſo by reaſon of the aſſemble of the people of the countrey, who beyng afrayde of the Numidians, whiche roued abrode: fledde thither for ſuccour: theſe people (I ſay) being many in numbre, hering of the noble defendyng of the caſtell, adioynynge to Placentia, thynkyng to do a great feate, with a great route of people, without any order, ranne to armour, and came forth to encounter with Anniball. But bycauſe they were an vnruly company, without a capytayne or good order, the other, being but a fewe in nū

Theſe were Anniballes vyctories durynge the wynterſeaſon, after whyche they reſted the deepe of the wynter: And as ſoone as ſprynge tyme of the yere came, Sempronius the conſull, who was than returned from Rome, prepared to gyue battayle to the Caathaginenſes, & the firſt day that they met, the Romans had ſo good for tune, that they not only wonne the victory in playn fielde, but alſo draue them to their tentes, and indeuored them ſelfes to wynne their campe. But Anniball, ſetting certayn of his fotemen to defend their gates or entrees of their campe, and cauſing the reſt, as well fotemen as horſemen to recule, dyd ſette them in aray within the campe, to the intent to be in a redines to ruſhe out vpon their enemies, ſo ſone as he made to them a ſigne. The Romans ſeing they coulde not wynne the campe,

blewe the retreite. Whan Anniball ſawe, that the bataile was ſlakid, and the Romans began to recule back from his campe: he ſet forthe the horſemen, ſome on the ryght hand, and ſome on the lefte, and hym ſelfe with the fotemen, came after from the campe, and gaue theym a ſtronge battayle, puttyng them to moch dyſpleſure. But anon the nyght departed them with lyke loſſe and ſlaughter on bothe ſydes.
            ¶ Whyles theſe thynges were doone in Italy, Cn. Scipio, being ſent into Spayne with his hoſte, partely by force, and partly by amitie and olde frendſhyp, he brought all the countreys from Luſitania, to the riuer of Iberus, vnder the obedience of the Romans. And alſo the fame of his gentil entertayning of people broughte the inhabitauntes on the mountaynes, and the wylde nations to be his aſſured frendes. So that they were all redy with theyr armour & ſuccours to aide the Romans to the beſt of their powers. Hanno, whom Anniball hadde left for the defence of theſe regions, knowynge theſe actes of Scipio, after his arryuall, and fearyng leſte he ſhuld be by hym put from the poſſeſſion of all that countreye: appoynted to fight with hym before the matter were ouerfar gone, and pytched his campe not farre from the hoſte of the Romans. Scipio knowyng that yf he did long tary from batayle, he ſhulde haue to do with hym, and alſo with Haſdruball, who were bothe lefte for the defence of the countrey, thought it better for hym to mete with theym and theyr hoſtes ſeuerally, thanne to matche with bothe the hoſtes togither. Wherfore he made ſpede to mete fyrſte with Hanno and his company. In whyche battayle there were ſlayne .vi. thouſand of the Carthaginenſes, and .ii. M. taken with their capytayn Hanno, and all their tentes, with a certain town alſo nere vnto the campe called Stiſſus. Haſdruball, before he herd of the diſcom

               yre cauſed hym to loſe one of his eies. And of the haſte that Flaminius the Conſule maketh to gyue hym battayle. Cap. xv.
            
               AS ſoone as the ſprynge of the yere dyd appere Annibal goinge from the place, where he wintred: bycauſe it was ſayd that Flamminius the conſule was come to Aretium: not withſtandyng that there was a more eaſy & better way: Yet bycauſe it was further aboute he toke the nexte waye ouer the greatte peryllous fennes, where as at that tyme the ryuer of Arnus hadde ouerflowed more hygher than in tymes paſt, he commanded the Spanyardes with the Affricans, and the moſte part of the olde ſouldiours with their ſtuffe to go before, leſt whan they were conſtrayned to ſtay in any place theyr neceſſaries ſhulde be wantyng: next theym he ſet the Frenchemen, bycauſe he wolde haue that hoſte in the myddell, in whom he had leſt truſte: laſt of all he commanded the horſemen to come, giuing in charge to Mago with certayne of the beſte Numidians, to come behynde, and to brynge forth the army, ſpecially the Frenchemen, leſt that other wearynes or feare of the long way, ſhuld cauſe them to ſtay or to ſlyp away, as they are very faynt and fearefull people in ſuche buſynes. The fyrſt company walowyng in the thycke mudde and the depe waters, ſkarcely ſauyng them ſelues from drownyng, folowed theyr ſtandardes and guydes. The Frenchemen that folowed theym, coulde nother ſaue theym ſelues from fallynge: nother whan they were downe well aryſe agayne, nother coulde their hartes comfort their bodies, nor hope comforte their hartes: ſome drewe their weary membres with peyne after theym. Some

other, where they ones fell, theyr hartes being ouercomme with wearynes, were conſtrayned to dye. The watche that they ſuffred .iiii. days and .iii. nyghtes, without any ſlepe, was the chiefe cauſe of theyr confuſyon. Whan they could fynde no dry place, where they myght reſt theyr weary bodies, the water coueryng al the erth, they heaped theyr ſtuffe and baggage in the water, one packe on an other, whervpon they reſted and ſaued them ſelfes. The heapes of dead cattell, whiche were dead in all the way, was in ſtede of beddis to many that were faint and feble, whiche eaſed them for a lytel ſpace. Anniball hym ſelfe hauynge ſore eies, by reaſon of the intemperate ſprynge tyme of the yere, that chaunged now to heate and nowe to colde, being caried vpon an elephant (which only remained) bicauſe he ſhulde be hyghe from the water: yet through his great watche and colde, and by reaſon of the fenny ayre beinge noyſome to his heade, and bycauſe there was no place nor tyme to heale him, he loſte one of his eies. And whan he had paſſed the fennes, not without great loſſe bothe of men and of beaſtes, as ſoone as he came to dry ground, he pytched his campe, hauing certayne knowlege by his eſpies, that the Romane hoſte was about Aretium, a cuntrey as pleſant and fertyle as was in all Italy.
            ¶ The conſull was than fierſe and cruell, for the ioy and the pride of his newe office. And he not onely lyttell feared the lawe and dignitie of the fathers of the ſenate, but alſo he wanted the feare of the immortall goddis. Fortune alſo had nouryſhed this his foolyſhe hardynes with proſperous ſucceſſe, as wel in the ciuile buſynes and affayres at home, as in certain foreyn batayles: ſo that it appered, that he wente aboute all thynges cruelly and ouer haſtily: nother counſaylynge with the goddis, nor with men. And howe moche more redye he was to folowe his owne foly, ſo moche the buſyer was Anniball to prouoke and ſtere hym to the ſame. Wherfore leauing his ennemies on the left hande, he went towarde Feſſula, intendyng to diſtroy the fieldes of Hetruria, where he ſhewed the conſull as great waſte, deſtruction, and ſpoylynge of his frendes as he myght, bothe by robbynge, ſlaughter, and burnyng: to thintent he ſhulde therby the rather be prouoked to battayle. Flamminius of his owne nature was gyuen to be buſy, although his ennemy wolde haue ben quiete and in reſt,

but whan he ſawe the goodes of his frendes caryed awaye: and his neyghbours bourned before his face: thynkynge it diſhonour vnto hym, to ſee Anniball wander throughe the myddes of Italy, taking his pleaſure without any reſiſtence, he determyned incontinent to gyue battayle, although many of his men perſwaded hym, that he ſhuld tary the commynge of his felowe the other conſul, ſo that they ſhulde with both their counſayles and hooſtes togyther, procede vnto theyr enterpryſe agaynſte Annibal: and in the meane tyme with the horſemen, and lyght harneyſed footemen, to lette hym frome his robbynge and deſtroyinge the countrey. But he contrary to the aduertiſement that was gyuen hym, beinge angrye, ruſhed forth of the counſel howſe, & quikly cauſed the baners and ſtanderdes to be dyſplayde, and lepte hym ſelfe vpon his horſe: but incontinent the hors ſodainly fell, and caſt the conſull to the earthe: whyche vnlucky begynnynge cauſed thoſe that were preſent, greatly to feare the ſucceſſe therof.
         
         
            ¶ Of the battayle of Traſimenus, with the deathe of the Conſul Flamminius, and many other Romayns. Cap. xvi.
            
               ANniball this whyle diſtroyed and waſted, by cruell warre, all the fieldes that were betwene the citie of Cortona, and the lake of Traſimenus, thynkynge the hartes of his enemies the ſooner to be moued to redreſſe the iniuries of theyr frendes: And they came to a place meete for treaſon and diſceyte, where as the great lake or fenne of Traſimenus dydde almoſte ioyne vnto the hylles of Cortona. There was at that place one onely ſtrayte and narowe waye to enter in, but afterwarde the fieldes waxed a lyttell broder and larger: Ouer that playne the hylles aroſe of a great heyght. In the ſame fayre and playne place Anniball pytched his campe, where he onely with the Affricanes and Spanyardes dyd reſte. The reſt of the lyght harneyſed men of the army: he brought about the backe of the hylles. And he diſpoſed the horſemen nere to the mouthe of the narowe entre, where the hylles myght ſecretly couer and hide them:

commaundyng, that as ſoone as the Romans were ones paſſed the ſtraytes, the horſemen ſhuld appere at theyr backes, ſoo that they ſhoulde be incloſed and hemmed in on all partes, hauynge no waye to eſcape, by reaſon of the hylles and greatte lake.
            ¶ Flamminius folowynge his ennemies, was come aboute the ſettyng of the ſonne to the lake: And the next day early in the mornynge, whan it was ſcarcely day lyght, he with his hoſte were paſſed the ſtraytes. And whan his people began to ſtray abrode into the larger felde, they ſaw al the place before them occupied with theyr enemies: And than they aper ceyued treaſon bothe behynde them, and ouer theyr heades. Whan Anniball knowyng: his ennemies to be encloſed with the lake and hylles on the one ſyde, whyche he deſyred, and alſo compaſſed about with his army on the other ſide, he gaue a ſigne to his men ſodeinly, to inuade their ennemies: which his commandement they anon with all diligence executed, rū
               nyng downe from the hylle and aſſaylyng the Romanes on all partes. One thyng moche amaſed the Romaynes by the ſodayne and ſtraunge chaunge thereof: there aroſe frome the brode lake a myſte thycker and darker than the hylles in apparence, whyche letted theym of the ſyght and true knowledge of the maner of theyr ennemies inuaſyon. The noyſe of the ſodayne affraye aroſe amonge theym, before they perceyued theym ſelues to be betrayde and hemmed in: And the battayle was begonne bothe before and on bothe ſydes, before that they coulde be put in good aray, or take theyr armor and drawe theyr ſwerdes.
            ¶ The Conſull Flamminius, whan all his people were thus oppreſſed with feare, he hym ſelfe as a man of great courage and lyttell affrayde, ordered his troubled company, and ſette them in order as well as the tyme and place wolde ſerue him, ſtyll exhortyng them by all the meanes he myghte, to abyde and to fyghte, ſhewynge theym, that it booted theym not to praye and call on theyr goddis, or to make vowes theym for theyr delyuerance: There was nowe no waye to for theym to eſcape but by ſtrengthe and hardyneſſe, there was no way than to be made, but with the ſwerd: and the leſſe feare they dydde take, the leſſe ieopardye and perylle ſhoulde they be in. But the noyſe was ſoo greatte, that the wordes and

counſaylle of their Capitayne coulde not be hearde: And they were ſo diſmayde, that they ſkarſely knewe theyr ſtanderdes and places to repayre vnto. They hadde ſcante hartes to drawe theyr weapons: theyr harneis was rather a burthen to them than a defence, They myght heare moche noyſe and clamour of thoſe that were wounded, but lyttell coulde they ſee. Some fled, and in the fleing hapned to fall into companies of Romanes that fought earneſtly, and by them were ſtayed from further fleinge. Some were commynge towarde the battayle, and by the diſcomfyture of ſuche as they mette, whyche fledde away, were diſcouraged and fledde alſo. But at the laſte, whan they perceyued no way to eſcape, than felle they earneſtly to fyghtyng, not kepyng order oraray, but by companyes, as it happed theym to falle togyther. Than beganne the battayle to be fyerce in all partes, and endured almoſte thre howres, and euery where very cruell, but moſte daungerous about the conſull. For the ſtrengthe of the hoſte folowed hym: And on what ſo euer parte he ſawe his men in daunger, quyckly and diligently he reſcued them: And he beinge very valiant, bothe myghtyly aſſayled his ennemies, and defended his citezens, vntyll one of Inſubria, called Ducarius, knowyng bothe his horſe and his face, ſayd to his company: Here is the Conſu
                  ••
               
               ▪ that not longe agone confounded our legyons, and diſtroyed bothe our cyties and fieldes: nowe ſhall I ſende his ſowle to the company of our frendes, that he all redy hath ſlayne: and hyttynge his hors with the ſpurres, he ranne violently through the thyckeſt of his ennemyes route, ſleinge a ſquyre, whyche mette hym vnhappyly in the way. And afterwarde with his ſpeare, ranne the Conſull through the body, and hadde ſpoyled hym, had not the ſtronge company of the Romayne knyghtes withſtande hym. After his deathe beganne the Romans to flee on al partes, and than nother hylles nor lake coulde lette theym: they wandred as blynd men through the ſtraites and ouer the rockes, ſome fallyng one ouer an other. And whan they coulde fynde none other waye, they toke the next way through the fennes, runnynge into the water ouer head and ſhulders, and were for the moſte parte drowned. Thus was the daungerous battayles at Traſymenus .xv. M. Romans were ſlayne in the bataile, and .x. M. ſparkled abrode by diuers ways, cam

came to Rome. A. M. and .v. C. of the Carthaginenſes were ſlayne in that battayle, and many died after by reaſon of theyr woundes, whiche they had. Anniball deliuered all the pryſoners of Italy without raunſome, but the Romans he kept in priſon. Than commanded he the bodies of his company that were deade, to be diſſeuered from the other, and buried. He ſought the body of Flaminius with greate diligence, to haue buried it, but he coulde not finde it. Whan the newes of this great ſlaughter was firſt knowen at Rome, the people aſſembled with great feare and rumour in the market place, gatheryng into companies, to knowe the trouth therof. And a litel before the ſonne ſettyng, Marcus Pomponius pretor ſaide: With great bataile wear ouercome: and although the people herd him ſay no more of certainty, yet by receiuing the newes one of an other, they filled the hole city with tidingis, that the conſul, with a great part of the hoſt, was ſlayne, and that fewe were left on lyue, but were other chaſed abrode, or taken of theyr ennemies. The women chiefely made eyther great ioy for theyr frendes that eſcaped, or elles great ſorowe for the deth and captiuitie of them that were ſlayn and taken. It was ſayd, that one woman whan ſhe herde ſodeinly, that her ſonne came home eſcaped from the battaile, for ioy dyed at the gate of the citie. And an other, to whome it was ſhewed falſely, that her chyld was ſlayne, ſhe abode in her houſe very ſorowfull, but whan he came home to her ſodaynly, ſhe at the fyrſt ſyght of hym for great ioye dyed. The Pretours kepte the Senate for certayne dayes frome the ſonne ryſynge, to the ſonne ſette, counſaylynge what capytaynes, and what hooſte they myght haue to withſtande the Carthaginenſes: but before they had made any certayne determination of theyr buſynes, they had tydynges of an other newe ſlaughter, which was, that .iiii. thouſand horſemen, which were ſent by Seruilius the other conſull to flamminius, vnder the gouernā
               
                  •
               e of one C. Centronius. After they herde of the battaile of Traſymenus, they returned backe, and in Vmbria were betrayed by Anniball, and diſtroyed. Which thyng troubled the myndes of the people meruaylouſly. They were in great trouble and feare, the conſulle and head officers beinge abſent, vnto whom they ſcarſely durſt ſende theyr letters for feare of the Carthaginenſes, who were almoſte ſpredde ouer all Italy.
            
               
Wherfore they made Quintus Fabius Maximus Prodietator, that was ruler of the commons, and Marcus Rufus Minutius mayſter of the horſemen, to theſe it was gyuen in charge by the Senate, to eſtablyſſhe and make ſure the walles and towers of the cytie, and to fortifye ſuche places, as they ſhoulde thynke conuenient. Alſo to breake the bridges, that were ouer the waters, and to prouide for the keping of theyr horſes and citie, ſeing they coulde not defend Italy.
         
         
            ¶ Howe Anniball by a crafty deceyte eſcaped the ſtraites of Formiana, wherein he was encloſed by Q. Fabius Maximus. Cap. xvii.
            
               ANniball came in the meane ſeaſon by Vmbria to Spoletum, diſtroyeng and burnyng all before hym. Than began he to lay ſiege to the towne but he was driuen thenſe with great ſlaughter of his men. Wherfore ſuppoſynge the citie of Rome to be of a great ſtrength, ſeing that lytell towne was ſo ſtronge, whoſe ſtrength and power he than not very proſperouſly hadde aſſayde, he withdrewe his armye to the plentyfull countrey of Picenus, and from thens to Pelignes, to Arpos, and to Luceria, a countrey adioynyng to Apulia, ſtyll robbynge and ſpoylynge the countreys abrode in the way as he went.
            ¶ Whan Fabius, whom the Romanes had choſen hygh officer, had ſet all thynge at a ſtay in Rome, he (takyng with him the army, that before was with Seruilius the conſull, and alſo .ii. other newe Romayn legions for the encreaſyng of his army) went with the mayſter of the horſemen Minutius, to mete with Anniball, and to ſtay hym from the deſtruction of the countrey. Fabius committing nothyng raſhely to fortune by eaſy iourneis and good eſpies, came into the feldes of Arpos, pytchyng his campe not farre from his ennemies. Anniball ſoone after his cōminge, brought his people into the fieldes in good aray redy to fyght: but Fabius al that day kepte his men in their campe, whervpon Anniball rebuking the feble courage of the Romans, withdrew his people into their tentes, fearyng in his mynde the ſobrenes of Fabius: whiche was a capitayne choſen, farre vnlyke to Sempronius or Flā
               minius.

Neuertheleſſe to proue the faſcion and conduicte of Fabius, Anniball very oftentymes remoued his campe, and euer ſpoyled the countreys of the frendes of the Romanes as he went: Sometyme he wolde ſodeynly conuey his army: and than ſecretely tourne out of the way, and lye in awayte, yf by chaunce he myght take his ennemies at auantage: but Fabius euer ledde his hoſte by the high places of the countreis ſtyll kepynge his ennemies in ſyghte, ſo that he wolde not be farre from theym: yet intended he not to giue them battayle, his men went neuer out of theyr campe, but only for the prouiſyon of thynges neceſſary. And whan they lacked vytailes forage, or woode, he ſent a great numbre togyther, that they myght walke ſurely. And alſo thoſe that wente therfore, he ſuffered not to ſtray farre from the hoſte. He hadde euer his horſemen and lyght harneyſed footemen in a redyneſſe and in aray, for feare of ſodayne inuaſions of his enemies. And alſo to thintent they ſhulde be redy to oppreſſe his foes, that at any tyme ſhulde roue abrode for ſpoyle or for vitailes, he mynded neuer to ieoparde the hole eſtate of the empire in open battayl, but he remayned ſtyl as a ſtay to weary his enemies. Whiche his ſobrenes was no leſſe diſpleaſant to Anniball, thā it was to Minutius, the maiſter of the horſemen. For he beinge raſhe, and deſyrous to put all in auenture, fyrſt pryuily, and than openly dyſprayſed the ſlacknes of Fabius, callynge hym bothe ſlowe and fearefull. Anniball often remouing, cam from Arpos to Samnium, waſtyng the fieldes of the Beneuentanes, and there he toke the towne of Tileſia, truſtyng by the ſhewe of ſoo moche diſpleaſure, to cauſe Fabius to gyue hym battayle. There camme to hym the ſame tyme thre gentylmen of Italy, whome Anniball hadde before at the bataile of Traſimenus taken pryſoners, and delyuered to lybertie without raunſome. Theſe men ſhewed hym, that in caſe he wolde conuey his army into Campania, they wolde helpe him with ſmalle peyne to wynne the noble citie of Capua. To this their motion Anniball at length agreed, ſendyng them to Capua before hym, to ſtere the myndes of the rulers and of the communes therto, and to retorne, bryngyng him the certaintie of their ſpeede. Than commanded he his guyde to leade hym the next way to the fielde of Caſſinus, hauyng knowlege by diuers expert men of the ſame countrey, that yf he were

ones mayſter of the hyll and ſtrayte there, he ſhulde ſtoppe the Romanes from bryngyng any ſuccours to theyr men, but that he ſhuld at his pleaſure diſtroy them. But the guide miſtaking the name of the countrey, toke Caſilinus for Caſinus. Wherfore leadyng hym a wronge way, he conducted hym by the countreys of Alifinus, Calatinus, and Calenus, to the fieldes of Stellates. Whan Anniball behelde that countrey to be on all partes encloſed with mountaynes and ryuers, he inquired of his guyde, in what region he than was? He anſwered agayn, that the ſame day he wold bring him to Caſilinus. Wherat Anniball being diſpleaſed, cauſed him to be ſore beaten with roddes, & after hanged for the example of other. Than ſeing that he was ſo farre frō his purpoſe, he thought in reuengyng of his malice, to bourne and ſpoile that plentyfull countrey about the ryuer of Vulturnus.
            ¶ By this tyme was Fabius come by the hilles, to the toppe of Maſſicus the mountayn: where the Romayns myght beholde the Carthaginenſis lodged in the fayre playnes vnder them, who ceaſſed not to ſpoyle the fieldes of Falernus, and to burne the houſes of Simeſſa. This diſpleaſure entred erneſtly into the hart of Minutius: who aboue other maligned at the cowardiſe of the dictatour Fabius. And by an oration full of great inuectiues, ſet the hartis of the moſt part of the hoſt agaynſt hym. But all theyr murmurynge Fabius lyttell eſtemyng, contynued the reſte of the ſommer in his olde faſcion, euer kepyng Anniball from battaile, the thyng that he moſt deſyred. Whan the wynter began to draw nere, Fabius perceiuyng the countrey not to be able to ſuſteyne the hoſt of his ennemies any long ſeaſon, and that there was none other way for them to paſſe out of the fieldes of Falernus, but only by the ſame ſtrayte wayes, by whych they before had entred, he ſendyng ſufficient power of Romans to the hyll of Callicula, and the towne of Caſilinus: hym ſelfe, with the mayſter of the horſemen, kept the narowe way, by whyche Anniball muſt nedes paſſe. Anniball wylling to proue the maner of kepyng of that ſtrayt, came thyther, and there made a ſkirmiſhe with the Romanes, ſomewhat to his loſſe, and was fayne to recule backe. And he perceyuynge the Romans to haue the Samnites and the Campanes their frendes at theyr backes, redy to ſuccour them with all neceſſaries, and that he and his

hoſte were ſo encloſed, that he was like to winter among the ſtones of Formiana, and the ſandes of Linterni: he forgatte not than to renewe his accuſtomed ſubtiltie and craft. He inuented a deceyte and mockery, very fearefull to mens ſyght, wherby he myght paſſe the ſtraites by ſtelthe in the nyght. he cauſed rotten ſtyckes and drye pieces of woode, to be gathered togither in the fieldes, and fagottes of yong roddes and bowes to be made, whych he cauſed to be tyed to the hornes of oxen and kyne, whiche he had before taken at a pray in the countrey, ſome being wylde, and ſome tame. There were .ii. thouſande beaſtis, that ſhuld be thus ordred. And the charge was committed to Haſdruball, that he ſhuld in the beginnyng of the darknes of the nyght, ſette the faggottes on fyre, that were on the hornes of the beaſtes: and than to dryue theym to the hylles and ſtraytes, ſpecially aboue the way, which the Romans kept. Than in the begynnyng of the nyght, ſecretely he cauſed his men to remoue their campe, driuing the oxen a lytel before the ſtanderdes. but whan they came to the fote of the hyll, and to the narowe way, he commanded the fagotes on the beaſtes hornes to be ſet on fyre. Whiche done, the feare of the flamyng fyre aboute theyr heades, and the heate commyng to the quicke and lower parte of the hornes of the beaſtes, cauſed them to runne, as though they had bene mad. With whyche ſodeyne running the yong roddes toke a burnyng, euen as though the woddes and hylles had ben on fire: and the mouing of their heades, cauſing the flame to ſprede abrode, ſhewed like as it had ben men rūning abrode with fyre. Whan thoſe that were ſet at the entryng of the paſſage ſawe the fyre on the hygh hylles aboue them, ſuppoſyng that they had ben betrayde, lefte the place aſſigned theym to kepe, and fiedde to theyr ſuccours, ſekyng theyr beſt way by the toppe of the hylles, by whiche the great flame and blaſe dyd ſhyne, where they chaunced vpon certayne oxen ſtrayed from theyr flocke. And whan at the fyrſt they ſawe as it were liuing thinges, breathynge fyre and flames, they ſtode as aſtonyed with the ſyght. But after, perceyuynge the crafte to be made and conueyd by men, than ſuppoſing that there was treaſon, with great noyſe and rumour they toke them to flyght. Fabius alſo, ſeinge this mockery, fearynge deceyte, kepte his people within his campe tyll it was day. Thus in the nyghte, whyle

they were aſtonyed with this ſtrange 
                  •
               yght, Anniball paſſed the ſtraite paſſage with his hoſte without danger, and pitched his campe in the fielde of Alifanus.
         
         
            ¶ Cneius Scipio fyghteth with Haſdruball and Himilco on the ſea, vppon the coſtes of Spayne, dryueth theym to lande, taketh and diſtroyeth fyue and twenty ſhyppes, with a greatte noumber of the Carthaginenſes. Capitu. xviii.
            
               AFter this hard eſcape out of daunger, Anniball ledde his army as though he wolde haue gone towarde Rome, by the fieldes of the Samnites, robbing and burning vnto the Pelignes, and from thens returned towarde Apulia. And Fabius ſet his tentys betwene the citie of Rome and his ennemies, nother goyng from theym, nor gyuinge them battayle, tyll in ſhort ſpace after he was called to Rome, for bycauſe of the ſacrifice that ſhulde be doone to the goddis. Before his departyng, he not only exhorted Minutius, mayſter of the horſemen, whom he lefte with his army, but alſo ſtreyghtly commaunded hym, that he ſhuld in no wiſe haue to do with his ennemies, for any occaſion that ſhulde be gyuen him: and that he ſhuld better truſt to counſayle than to fortune: and that he ſhuld rather folowe his aduiſe, being his capytain, than vſe the trade of Sēpronius and Flaminius, ſhewyng the dangers of it by examples. Alſo he declared to him 
                  •
               e diſceite of theyr ennemies. And whan he had gyuen hym theſe exhortations in vayne, he departed to Rome.
            ¶ In the begynnyng of ſommer, whyles thoſe thinges were done in Italye, great warre begunne in Spayne. Haſdruball deliuered vnto Himilco .xl. ſayle, wel furniſhed for the warre, and hym ſelfe with a great numbre of ſhyppes, alſo departed from Carthage, and ſayled into Spayne, where after he was arryued and landed his hoſte, he ſet his ſhyppes at the ſhore, nere to the lande, and pitched his campe on the lande, beinge redy to fyght with his ennemies, where ſoo euer he founde them on lande or water. Scipio, after he came from the wintrynge,

thought to haue gone on his enemies vpon the lande, but whan he hearde of theyr ſuccours, that were comme to them, he durſte not mete them on lande, but choſe a noumbre of good ſowldiours, and made redy .xxxv. ſayle for to meete them on the water, thynkyng to aſſayle them ſodeinly, er they ſhulde be able to ordeyne all thyng for their defence. Whan Haſdruball had knowlege of theyr commynge, by reaſon of hygh towers made in dyuers places of Spayne, from whens they may ſee farre of on the ſea, there aroſe a great noiſe and feare amonge his hoſte in theyr tentes. for ſuche as were on the land, and thought lytel to haue had battaile that day: He commaunded to make haſte to theyr ſhippes, whiche they did obey, and hym ſelfe came haſtyly after. And whan they came to the water, the ſowldiours ſo troubled the ſhipmen, and the ſhypmen the ſouldiours, that none of them coulde aray them ſelues, and ſette in order thynges neceſſaryly for theyr buſynes. Whyles this rumour laſted, the Romans not only were at hande, but alſo redy to fyghte. The Carthaginenſes noo more troubled with theyr enemies than with theyr owne rumour, were ſhortly ouercome and fledde: and at the firſt conflyct the Romans toke two ſhyppes, and drowned .iiii. And although the Romans ſawe all the ſhoore occupied with men of armes, yet were they not aferde, but folowed their ennemies ſhyppes fleynge, in ſoo moche that of .xxx. ſayle they toke and diſtroyde .xxv. And with this great pray went again to the ſea, and landed at Tarracon, where Scipio taryed not longe, but that his brother P. Scipio arriued there alſo, ſent by the ſenate with a great nauy, to the numbre of .xxxv. ſhyppes, and .viii. M. ſouldiours, with great ſtore of ſtuffe and ordynance.
            ¶ Whan the two bretherne were aſſocyate togyther, there was nothynge that dydde withholde the wylles and hartes of the people of Spayne from the frendſhyppe of the Romans, ſauing they feared the treſpas ſhuld be reuenged on theyr chyldernes bloudde, whyche were lefte as pledges by Anniball at Sagunt.

               ed them to the Romans. Ca. xix.
            
               THan was there in Sagunt a noble ſpanyard, called Acedux, who before that tyme had ben very faythfull to the Carthaginenſes: but than (as it is the facion of many of the common ſort of men) whan fortune fayled, his faith lykewyſe chaunged. He imagined with hym ſelfe, what way he myght beſt attayne the frendſhyp of the Romans. After many ſundry imaginations, he thought ſooneſt to brynge it about, if he might finde the meanes, to delyuer them thoſe noble mens children, whiche were left at Sagunt as pledges and ſuerties. For by that meanes he thought the Romans myght beſte wynne the hartis of the pricis of Spain. But this enterpriſe he thought he coulde not compaſſe, onleſſe he myght obteyne the fauour of one Boſtar, who lay encamped without the citie vpon the ſhoore of the ryuer, with a good numbre of Spaniardes, for the ſure kepyng of the citie, and to ſtoppe the Romanes the entre that way from the hauen, without whoſe cōmandement he knewe well the kepers of the pledges wolde nothyng do. Than Acedux thought with crafte to aſſay Boſtar, and went to the campe where he lay, deſyryng ſecretely to ſpeake with hym: And fyrſt he beganne to ſhew hym the daunger that the countrey was in, conſyderyng the ſtronge armye of the Romans, whiche was than at hande. He ſhewed hym alſo, that the Spaniardes had ſo longe continued in the frendeſhyp of the Carthaginenſes, for feare more than for loue. And all by cauſe the Romane army was ſo farre from theym: but nowe ſyns they were come ouer Iberus, it was to be feared, leſte they wolde all yelde them ſelues vnto Scipio. Wherfore he deſyred hym to worke wyſely therin.
            ¶ Whan Boſtar demaunded of him, what he wold haue him to do for remedy therof, he anſwered: I wold aduyſe you, to ſende the children of the noble mē, whom ye haue as pledges in this towne, to their parentes frendes and cities: ſo ſhal ye get all theyr hartes and loues by this kyndnes ſhewyng, whiche ye can neuer get with feare. For whan they fynde, that ye

put truſt in them, ye ſhall the more bynde them to be faithful. And I my ſelfe wyll gladly take the peyne to delyuer agayne the pledges to theyr frendes: and ſo worke, that I wyll get theyr hartes to you moche more than ye nowe haue. Boſtar, meanynge all truthe and playnnes, was anone perſwaded to the ſame purpoſe, and graunted hym the conduite of the ſureties. Than went Acedux priuyly to Scipio his tentes, and there declared vnto hym the good wyll that he bare towarde hym and the Romanes: And appoynted with hym the tyme and place of delyuere of the pledges. Than went Acedux agayn to Boſtar, of whom he receyued ſpeciall cōmandementes and tokens to the kepers of the pledges, to go with him, takyng with them the pledges, whan he wold requyre theym. Than ſhewed he the kepers of the chyldren, that he wolde depart from the citie in the nyght, to thintente the better to eſcape the danger of the watches of the Roman hoſte. Wherfore he wylled theym to be redy to ryde with hym, whan he called on theym at an howre certayne in the night folowinge: They as innocentes in the matter, made all thynges redye to departe at the howre appoynted, at whyche howre he fayled not to come. Thus departed he from the cytie, both with the chyldren and alſo their kepers, and 
                  •
               re they were ware, he ledde theym amonge a numbre of Romaynes, that by his crafty appoyntement were layde in imbuſ

               hementes for the ſame purpoſe: where they were all taken, and brought to Scipio, who delyuered the pledges to theyr cities and frendes: wherby he gate the loue of the more parte of the cities in Spayne: ſo that they were redy to take armour to the ayde of the Romans, whan ſo euer Scipio commaunded them. Theſe thynges were doone in Spayne, the ſeconde yere of the battayl betwene the Carthaginenſes and the Romaynes.
         
         
            
            ¶ Fabius being at Rome in diſpleſure. Minutius maiſter of the horſmen fighteth with Annibal, putteth him to the worſe, & therfore is made halfe rular of the hooſte with Fabius, he fyghteth with him again, & is put to flight, & reſcued by Fabiꝰ, Ca. xx.
            
               NOwe let vs returne to Fabius, who by his wyſe abſteining from battayl had ſaued many of the Romans from death: Neuer the leſſe it was thought at Rome by many, that his hart failed him, and that he trifled forth the tyme, onely to thintent his empire and rule myghte the longer contynue, and that he cared not, what coſte the citie were at, infyndyng ſo great an army, ſo that he myght be at reſt with honour. Thus had he gotten many enemies at Rome. And to encreaſe their malice towarde him, Anniball wrought a meruaylous ſubtyltie: he ſente a numbre of his men to ſpoyle the cuntrey, and commaunded them in any wyſe to do no hurt to the landes of Fabius: of whiche he gate the knowledge by certayne that were fledde to hym from the Roman army. This did he, to the intent it ſhuld be thought, that ſom ſecret bargayn or conſpiracy was made betweene hym and Fabius. Whyche crafty act of Anniball cauſed Fabius to be the more ſuſpect tothe ſenate of Rome. But to take awaye that ſuſpection from hym, Fabius ſent his ſonne, and ſolde the grounde or feldes, whiche were not violated by Anniballes ſubtiltie. Nowe fortuned it alſo to encreaſe Fabius euyll wyll at Rome, that after his departing from the hoſte, Minutius, the mayſter of the horſemen, beinge lefte to guyde the armye, cauſed the campe and tentes, whiche were by Fabius ſette ſafe in the hyghe hylles, to be broughte downe and pytched in the lowe valeys: And there they were diſpoſed after the diſcretion of the capteyn, thynkyng eyther to make a ſkyrmiſhe with them that went abrode to robbe, or els to inuade thē that were left behind in the tētis
            ¶ Anniball, knowing that he ſhuld kepe warre with a captein moche vnlyke the other, and that his ennemies wolde order their buſynes more quyckly than wyſely, and perceyuyng his enemies to draw more nere vnto him: he ſent the thyrd part of his ſouldiors to robbe and waſt the cuntreys, the other .ii. partes he kept within theyr tentes. Than remoued he his campe

more nere to the Romās, & abode vpō a certain hyll, where as the Roman hoſt might pceiue, that they were redy to ſuccour their robbers, if any aſſaut were made on thē. This did he of purpoſe, to entiſe the Romans to batail. Than could Minutius no lōger forbere, but ſent a good nūber of horſmen, to aſſaile the robbers, who diſtroid many of them that were ſparkled abrode ſeking theyr pray. Than cam Annibal to the reſcue of his men. But fortune ſo ſerued the Romanes, that as they wer
                  •
                moſt buſy in fighting: One Numerius Decimus, a capytain of the Samnites cam to the ſuccour of the Romans with viii. M. fotemen, & .ii. C. horſmen, by whoſe help they bet Anniball to his cāpe & ſlew .vi. M. of his men. which glad tydinges Minutiꝰ (although he had loſt in the ſame batell v. M. of his owne men, ſent in his boſting letters to Rome, wherwith the citie was moch cōforted. Not withſtanding Fabius (whan all the citie was mery, wold nother beleue the newes, nor the letters. At the laſt he ſaid, if al were trewe, he rather feared their proſperous aduenture, than reioyſed therin. Whyche ſaying cauſed him greatly to be hated of the citezens, & Marcus Metellus openly rebuked Fabius therfore, ſayinge, that he kept his men in theyr campes, more lyke captiues and priſoners, than men of warre. Specially it was not to be ſuffred that he being preſent, wold not only ſuffer nothing to be done valyantly agaynſt his enemies, but now alſo being abſent, held againſt the thing that was well done by his maſter of horſmē. Fabius anſwered but fewe wordes, for he thought they ſhuld be euyll harde: but he ſayd, that where .ii. yeres paſt, the citie had ſuſteined great harmes and loſſe through the foliſhe hardyneſſe of the gouernours, he douted not, but yf he myght beare rule and haue his mynde, he wolde make it euident to all men, that fortune coulde lyttell do or worke againſt a good captain: but that wiſdom & reaſon ſhuld haue the dominion ouer al her chances. He ſaid further, that he had ſaued his hoſt from a cruel enmy, in al this perillous time without harme or ſhame: which he thought, ought more to be praiſed, thā to kyl a great nūbre of enmies. But in concluſion, the determination of the ſenate was, that M. Attilius Regulus ſhuld be conſull in the plabe of Flāminius: And that Minutius, the maiſter of the horſemen (who ſo nobly had gouerned his army) ſhuld be halfe ruler of the hoſte with Fabiꝰ, & the gouernāce therof to be parted betwene thē.
            
               
¶ With theſe diſpleſant actes of the ſenate Fabius returned to his army, truſtyng, that although Minutius ſhoulde haue halfe the rule with hym, yet ſhuld he want the policy and maner of ordryng his part of the army to him cōmitted: whiche policy by exercyſe and great tranayle he had obteyned. Minutius perceyuyng hym ſelfe to be had in ſuche eſtymation at Rome, as wel with the ſenators as with the commons, where he was before a lyttell proude, he than beganne to take moch more on hym, boſtyng hym ſelfe, that in theyr great calamitie, he alone was founde out a captayne able to matche Anniball. And than began he to diuiſe of the parting of their empyre or rule. He wold haue had it ſo parted, that one day or one weke he ſhulde haue ruled all: And one other day or weke, Fabius to rule al, and ſo to take the hole gouernance by tourne. That wolde Fabius none of: but wolde haue the army parted betwene them, with the ordynances and other neceſſaries. Sayyng, that in caſe he coulde not by his counſayle ſaue the hole hoſte: yet he wold aſſay to ſaue the halfe therof, as wel as he myght. And on that poynt they agreed, and thervpon deuyded theyr companies or legions, and alſo theyr campes. This debate and order of the Romayn capytayns was knowen to Anniball by eſpyes, as were all other thinges that were done in the tentes of his ennemies, whyche tydynges brought to hym double ioye. One was, for that he thought to vanquiſhe the foolyſſhe hardynes of Minutius euen as he wolde hymſelfe. The other was, for that halfe the ſtrengthe of Fabius was dymynyſſhed, by reaſone of the partynge of the hoſte. Thanne was there a hylle betweene the hooſte of Anniball, and the hoſt of Minutius, which hyll who ſo euer had goten, ſhuld be able to do moche diſpleaſure to his enemies. Annibal deſyred not ſo moche to take it without batayle (although the occupation therof ſhuld be to hym very neceſſary) as to make it an occaſion of batail to Minutius: whom, he wiſt wel, wold euer run to withſtande his enterpriſe in the attaining therof. A fielde there was in the myddell betwene hym and the ſayd hyll, whyche fielde was very playne and fayre, and appeered moche vnmete for treaſon, to hyde any embuſhement in, bycauſe it was nother couered with woode, ſhrubbes, nor buſſhes. It ſemed therfore a place rather mete to deſcry treſon than to hyde it, for that in a plaine and bare valey no ſuche deceyte

myght be feared. But than Anniball eſpied, that in the bottome of the ſayd hyll were diuers caues and holowe places in the rockes, of whiche ſome were able to receyue and hyde .ii. C. ſouldiours armed. In theſe darke caues Anniball hydde .v. M. footemen and horſemen: not withſtandyng leſt the noyſe or the bryghtnes of the harneys myghte happen to diſcouer his diſceyte, he ſent a fewe in numbre the next mornyng to take the foreſayd hyll, wherby he withdrew the eies of his ennemies from lokyng to that place of embuſſhement. Whan the company that went to the hyll, were apperceyued by the Romanes, to be ſo fewe in numbre, they ſet nought by them, and euery man coueted to go to dryue theyr ennemies from that hyll. And alſo the Capytayne no leſſe foolyſhe than they, called his men to harneys, thretenynge his ennemyes with vayne wordes. Fyrſt he ſent lyght harneyſed yong men: than he ſent forthe horſemen, whiche were a great company: laſte of all, hym ſelfe commeth with his hole armye. And as Anniball ſawe occaſion, and the battayle encreaſe, he ſent euer of his men bothe fotemen and horſemen, to ſuccour his people, ſo that the battayle was furnyſhed on bothe partes, and waxed very ſtronge. The Romans were thought to be of a great boldnes and courage, and ſhulde haue done well, yf the battayle had ben equally handled, they were ſoo encouraged with theyr late victorye: but ſodeynly came thoſe that were hydde in the caues forthe on them, making great clamour and rumour on theyr ſides and backes, ſo that they ſurpriſed with feare, had nother hartes to fyght, nor hope to flye. Than Fabius fyrſt hearyng the noiſe, and after ſeing the hoſt troubled afarre of: Fortune (ſayd he) hath caught theyr foly, no ſoner than I feared it wolde: nowe he that is ioyned with Fabius in the empire, hath found Anniball ouerhard for hym, both in power and alſo in Fortune. But it is not now tyme (ſayd he) to chyde, I wyll referre that, tyll more oportunitie. Than cauſed he his men to diſplay theyr baners beyonde the valey, and in good aray came forwarde to the helpe of his felowes, that ſome were fledde, and ſome redy to flee, ſo that they all thought, that he cam as it were one ſent from heauen to their ſuccours. And before he ſhulde come to the caſting of dartes or to handeſtrokes, Anniball called backe his men from chaſyng any further theyr ennemies that fled, and ſodeinly withdrewe

hym to his campe, ſaying, that he had ouercome Minutius, but that he was alſo ouercome of Fabius. Than many of the Roman army, that by fleing were ſcatered and ſparkled abrode, ranne to the hooſte of Fabius: many other that dyd flee before theyr ennemies, tourned agayne to their company: ſo that there was almooſte one battayle of them that were ouercome, and of them that ranne to theyr ſuccours. Whan the moſte part of the day was ſpent vnder the variable ſtanderde of Fortune, and that the hoſtes were come to theyr owne tentes, Minutius (his ſouldiours beynge gathered about hym, ſayd:
            ¶ I haue oftentymes, louing ſouldiours and frendes, hearde Minutius oration. ſay, that he is moſte wyſe, that can gyue counſell, and tel what is to be done in his buſynes. And that he is next wiſe, that can obey hym that gyueth good counſayl: but he that can not her gyue good counſaile hym ſelfe, nor obey other mens counſail, is of all other moſte abiecte and fooliſhe. Nowe therfore, ſeing that the fyrſt of theſe giftes fortune hath denied vs, let vs kepe the ſeconde, and whyles we lerne to rule, let vs purpoſe with our ſelfes to obey theym that be wyſe. Wherfore let vs ioyne our tentes with Fabius: And whan ye ſhall here me ſalute hym as my parent and father, you lykewyſe ſhall ſalute his ſouldiours as your noble patrons, by whoſe ſtrength and hardynes this day ye were preſerued.
            ¶ Thus incontinent they remoued theyr campe, and went to the campe of Fabius, whereof he marueyled not a lyttell. Whan the two legyons were mette togither, and ſalutations had, after longe proteſtation made by Minutius to Fabius, they toke eyther other by the handes, and the ſouldyours lykewyſe entertaynynge gentylly the one the other. There Minutius ſubmytted him and his men to be vnder the protection of Fabius, reſigning cleane the authoritie of the empire and rule into his handes, whyche he accompted to be to hym a burthen rather than an honour: deſyryng him that he might be agayne in the office of the mayſter of horſemen, as he was before. Whan this was knowen at Rome, and affirmed to be true, not only by the letters of the capitaynes, but alſo of the ſoudiours of both partis, the praiſe of Fabius was eleuate to the heauens, and he had no leſſe praiſe of Annibal and his hoſt who as than felt, that they had to do with the Romanes, and

that they kept warre in Italy. For the two yeres paſt, they ſo lyttell dyd eſteme bothe the capytayne of Rome, and alſo the ſouldyours, that they could ſcarſely beleue, that they fought with thoſe people, whome they had hearde of theyr fathers, were ſo moche to be doubted. And it was ſayde, that Anniball going from the battayle dyd ſay, that than at the lengthe the cloude, whyche ſatte ſo longe on the hyghe hylles, ſente downe his peryllous ſtorme.

a good numbre of men to gettethem come and cattall. but as they roued abrode vnauyſedly, the Romans inuaded theym, and ſlewe a. M. and .vii. C. of them, with the loſſe of .C. of theyr men. Than wolde the Romanes haue folowed the reſt in the chaſe, had not Paulus the conſull commanded the contrary, whoſe turne was to rule the hoſte that day. For it was before agreed betwene them, to gouerne the armye, the one, one day, and the other, the next day, and ſo by tourne. Than were the ſouldyours very angry towarde Paulus, ſayinge to Varro theyr capytayne, that if he had not letted them, they had not fayled to haue beaten Anniball frome his campe, and alſo oute of Italye. Anniball was not ſo ſorye for the loſſe of his men, as he was gladde, that the Romaynes were in ſuche delite and ioye of theyr ſmalle vyctorye. Wherfore he eſtemed the angry conſul to beredy to take any bayt that he wold laye for hym.
         
         
            ¶ Of the peryllous battayle of Cannas, and the vyctory that Anniball had there of the Romans. Cap. xxii.
            
               THe next nyght he remoued his hoſte on the further ſide of a great hyll, nere adioyning, There he ſette his footemen in aray on the left hande: on the right he ſet his horſmen: al the cariage he put in the middes betwene them. He left his campe ſtored with moche ſtuffe and baggage, to the intent that whan the Romans were buſy in ſpoylyng the tentes, he wolde ſodeynly and vnwares oppreſſe them. And to couer his crafte the better, he made great fyres aboute the campe, before he went, that it ſhulde be thought, that they wolde not haue the Romans ware of theyr ſtealynge away, tyll they were paſſed farre out of their daunger. And as he thought to begyle, ſo had it happed in dede, had not Paulus ſtaied his men from rū
               nyng thyther in ſuche haſte: and alſo had not two pryſoners, whyche were taken before by the Carthaginenſes, eſcaped the ſame mornynge, who came to the Conſuls, and declared vnto them, that the holle army of the Carthaginenſes abode in arraye on the other ſyde of the hylle, redye to battayle.

Whan Anniball perceyued his diuyſe to be knowen, he retourned agayne to his tentes, where he taryed but a ſhorte ſpace for lacke of vytailes, and for bareynnes of the cuntrey. Wherfore he retourned towarde the countrey of Naples, a more warme and plentifull cuntrey, pytchyng his campe nere vnto Cannas. In pytchyug of whyche his campe, he wyſely conſydered the wynde to be in the northe eaſt, that naturally in drye grounde dryueth the powder and duſte into the ayre, makyng it troublous darke and cloudy. Wherfore he ſoo incamped hym ſelfe, that his backe was towarde the wynde, to the intent whan he ſhoulde haue to do with his ennemyes, the duſte ſhoulde blynde theyr eyes, ſo that they ſhoulde be moche hyndered therby. The conſulles folowyng the Carthaginenſes were comme to Cannas: And whan they apperceyued theyr enemyes in theyr ſyght, they pytched their campes, euery Conſull by hym ſelfe, and dyuyded theyr armyes to euery conſull his parte. There was a ryuer called Aufidus, rounnynge beſyde bothe Campes, at the whyche bothe the hooſtes, not without fyghtynge and ſkyrmyſſhyng as they hadde tyme and ſpace watered theyr horſes and cattall. Anniball lykynge the place welle for the horſemenne to fyghte in, wherein reſted his moſte truſt and chiefe ſtrength, thoughte to prouoke the conſulles to battayle, and to ſtyrre theym therto, he came towarde theym in good arraye, and cauſed the horſemenne to rounne to and fro almooſte to the tentes of the Romaynes, byddynge theym baſe. By reaſon whereof, there aroſe greatte dyſcorde amonge the Romayne hoſt, and the Conſulles alſo. For Paulus, not myndynge to fyghte with theym at theyr pleaſures, dydde obiecte vnto Varro, the foolyſſhe hardyneſſe and lacke of diſcretion of Sempronius and Flamminius. Varro contrarye wyſe layde vnto hym the exaumple of Fabius, whome he reckened amonge the fearefull and ſlowe Capytayns, profeſſynge to the goddis, and alſoo to menne, that it oughte not to be layde vnto hym, yf Anniball ſhoulde take Italye, and holde it as his owne: Seynge that he, and alſoo his ſowldyours, beynge mooſte deſyrous to fyghte, were wythholden therefrome by his felowe. Paulus lykewyſe profeſſed, yf any euyll dyd happen to them and to theyr ſouldyours, that he wold be clere and innocent of the treſpaſſe, ſaying

on fote, the wynge of the Numidian horſemen, wherof Haſdruball was capytayne, ioyned alſo with the Romans ryghte wynge of horſemen. The battayle was ſtronge on both partes, but the Carthaginenſes vſed greate ſubtyltie, for at the firſt encounter about .v. C. of the Numidian horſmen, hauing ſwerdes ſecretely hydde vnder theyr harneys, beſydes thoſe that they dyd vſe to occupy, tourning theyr targettes behind theyr backes, makyng as though they had forſaken their hoſt and fledde from theyr company, ranne to theyr ennemies, and leapynge beſydes their horſes, caſte theyr ſwerdes and other apparant weapons at the fete of the Romans, as yelded perſons, whervpon they were receyued firſt into the myddell of the Romane hoſte, and anone they were brought to the vtter and hyndermoſt warde, and there cōmanded to ſtande tyll the ende of the batayle. And whan the battayle began on all partes, they ſtode ſtyll without fyghtynge, but after whan they ſawe that euery man was buſyed and occupied with fighting, than drawyng forth theyr ſwerdes from vnder theyr harneys, they toke the ſheldes of them that were ſlayn in the field, and ruſſhed on the backes of the Romaynes, and ſo hewynge on theyr backes and hammes behinde, they made a great ſlaughter. And whyles that ſome parte conceyued feare and fledde, and ſome other maynteyned the batayle with ſmal hope of victory, Haſdruball ſente a greatte parte of the Numidians to chace and diſtroy the Romanes as they fled. Paulus the conſull, althoughe he was deadly wounded before, yet many tymes with his company reſtored and renewed the battayles, with the helpe of the Romane horſemen, who at length alighted from theyr horſes, and foughte on foote, the Conſulle for feblenes and bledynge, beinge not able to gouerne his horſe. Than the Carthaginenſes, ſeinge that theyr enemies had rather dye in the fielde, than flee: incontinent ſlewe thoſe that they coulde not make to flee: ſome they toke, and the other that were ouercome, being than ſparkeled abrode, toke ſuche horſes as they coulde get, and beganne to flee. C, Lentulus a Tribune, leadyng an empty horſe in his hande, as he fled ſawe Paulus the conſull, fyttyng on a ſtone, all couered with blud, to whome he ſayde: Lucius Aemilius, whome the goddis ſhoulde take and eſteeme as innocent of this cruell ſlaughter, take this horſe, whyles any ſtrengthe is lefte within the, And

I beinge thy frende, ſhall lyfte the vp, and kepe the on, leſte thou make this battayle dolefull and ſorowfull throughe the deathe of a conſull, without whyche veryly there is cauſe of weping and mournyng inough. Whervnto the conſull anſwered: C. Cornelius, be thou increaſed in vertue, but beware leſt whyles thou doeſt bewaile this chaunce, thou haue ſmalle tyme to eſcape thy ſelfe: Go thou therfore, and bydde the ſenate, that they make ſtrong the walles of Rome, and ſtrength it with ſuccours, before the conquerour come: And ſecretly ſhewe vnto Quintus Fabius, that Lucius Aemilius Paulus doth fyrmly remembre his preceptes, ye and lyueth in them, and fynally dyeth in them. And I pray the, ſuffer me to paſſe the lyfe amonge theſe companye of my deade knyghtes, leſt by lengar lyuynge, I become an accuſer of my felowe, defendynge myne innocency by the treſpas of an other, and yet at length dye, taken as fauty of this dede.
            ¶The company of them whych fled, trode the Conſull vnder foote, and after his enemiſe, not knowynge who he was, dyd ouerpreſſe hym. There was ſlayn at that battayle fortye thouſande footemen, and two thouſande and ſeuen hundred horſemen, in whyche company was ſlayne one of the conſulles, with foure ſcore Senatours, and ſuch as had borne great offyce in the cytie, whyche voluntaryly gaue theym ſelues to that battaile. Furthermore .xxi. that had borne office of Tribunes, beſydes that in that batayle were taken .iii. thouſande footemen, and .iii. hundred horſemen. Of the Romans that eſcaped by fleinge .vii. thouſande came into the ſmaller campe, and .x. M. fledde to the greater campe. And whan the bataile was fynyſhed, thoſe Romaynes that were retourned to the greatter campe, ſente to the other, whyche were in the leſſe campe, to repayre vnto theym in the nyghte, whyle theyr ennemies, beinge weary of trauayle, and ioyfull of theyr victory, were gyuen to take theyr reſte, but they doubted to take on theym that enterpryſe, ſayinge, that it were as meete that they of the greatte campe ſhoulde come to theym: but that for the daunger of paſſynge the hoſte of theyr ennemies they were afearde ſo to doo. Thus the moſt refuſed to goo out of the campe, not withſtandyng ſuch as were hardy and valiant, by the great & noble exhortatiō of P. Sēpronius Tuditanus, a tribune, iſſued out, & came through their enmies in the night

with their ſheldes on the ryght ſyde towarde the hoſt of the Carthaginenſes: wherby they paſſed by them, receyuing the arowes and dartes that were ſhotte at them, vpon theyr ſaide ſhieldes: and ſo came to the great campe, to the noumber of iii. M. vi. C. and from thens, takyng with them mony of the other of that company, eſcaped at theyr pleaſure to Cannuſium. The other conſul, with .l. horſemen, fledde to Venuſia.
         
         
            ¶ Howe Anniball ordered his buſynes after the battayle, and howe yonge Scipio vſed hym ſelfe, for the ſauynge of the commen wealthe. Capit. xxiii.
            
               THe battayle thus ended, diuers of the army came to Anniball, and wylled him to reſt all that day, and the nyght after his greate labour: but Maharball was therewith nothinge contented, ſaying: You ſhuld nowe incontinent with your horſemen, folowe the Romans to Rome in ſuche ſpede, that they ſhall knowe ye be alredy come, before they heare of your cō
               myng: And thus doing, the concluſyon wyll be, that within fyue dayes ye ſhall lyke a conquerour dyne in the capytoll of Rome. Than ſayd Anniball: The way is longe, and we had nede of counſayle or we vndertake ſo great an enterpryſe. At lengthe he allowed the harte and noble courage of Maharball: but he ſayd, he wolde deliberate vppon that enterpryſe. Than anſwered Maharball: The goddis haue not gyuen all thynges to one man: thou canſte well ouercome thyne ennemies, Anniball, but whan the vyctorye is gyuen to the, thou canſte not vſe it. And it was thought, that the ſame one days reſte and ſlacknes, was the cauſe of the ſauegarde of the city of Rome, and alſo of all the whole empire.
            ¶ Anniball, after that he had reſted the fyrſt nyght, ſente his people to the fielde, to ſee whether any of theyr ennemyes ſhulde reuyue agayne, and as they ſawe or perceiued any like to recouer, he was incontinent ſlayne: and he proceded and toke the campes, and all theym that were in them. Wherein was a great numbre of men, for beinge afrayde to folow their company, they remayned ſtyll in theyr campes. And he was contented, that the captines ſhulde be raunſomed, euery one

after his degree, the Romans .iii. C. peces of ſyluer: other that came to theyr ſuccours and of Italy. ii: C. and theyr ſeruantes for .i. C. Whiche money beinge ones payde for theyr redemption, they ſhuld haue libertie to go to theyr cuntreis. This done, he cauſed the deade bodyes of his owne hoſt to be ſearched and buried, whyche were to the numbre of .viii. M. amonge whyche he cauſed the body of the Conſulle to be buryed.
            ¶ There was a certayn woman of a noble kynred called Buſa, whyche ſuccoured the Romans that were fledde to Cammuſium, bothe with meate, drynke, clothe, and other neceſſaries, for whyche dede, the warre beynge fynyſſhed, ſhe was had with the Romaynes in great honour. There were that timein Cannuſium .iiii. Tribunes, whiche were Fabius Maximus the yonger, and Lucius P. Bibulus. P. Cornelius Scipio, and Appius Claudius Pulcher, they al, by the aſſent alſo of the other ſouldyours, gaue the whole rule and gouernance of the whole company of the Romanes, whyche were there, to P. Scipio, beyng than very yonge, and to Appius Claudius: To whome, whan they were conſultyng amonge other for the profyte of the common welth, P. Furius Philius ſayd, that theyr counſell was but in vayne, for to reſtore and brynge agayne that, whyche was vtterly loſte: And that the common wealthe was deſerte and cleane ſubuerted: aduyſyng the noble yonge men to folow the purpoſe of Lucius Cecilius Metellus, and to take hym as theyr gouernoure, who was redy, with many other with hym, to depart the city in haſte, takynge theyr ſhyppes, whiche were purpoſely ordeyned for theym, and by the ſea to flee ouer to ſome prynce or kyng for ſuccour. Whyche cruell counſell ſodeynly gyuen after theyr great loſſe and myſfortune, made them very fearefull and in great doubte what they ſhulde do: in ſo moche that many, beinge there preſent, thought to deliberate on the matter. Whyche deliberation yonge Scipio (elect by deſteny to fynyſhe the ſame warres agaynſt the Carthaginenſes) denied and diſpiſed. We muſt (ſayth he) be bolde, and valyantly enterpryſe thynges in ſo great a myſchiefe, and not ſtande longe conſultyng vpon them. Wherfore he commaunded, that ſoo many as wolde haue the common welthe ſafe, ſhulde go with hym armed. And than he with a fewe folowyng hym, went to

Metellus lodgynge, where fyndynge an aſſemble of yonge men in coniuration vppon the dyuiſe of Furius Philus, before declared, he helde his naked ſwearde ouer theyr heades, and ſayde: With my whole mynde and wyll, I ſweare that I ſhall neuer leaue the common wealthe of the cytie of Rome, nor ſhall ſuffer any citezen of Rome to leaue it. And if I wyllyngly be falſe, than I pray the mighty and omnipotent Iupyter, to diſtroy my houſe, my familye, and all my goodes, with mooſte vyleſt deſtruction. Whiche othe I requyre of the Lucius Cecilius, and of all other that are here preſente. And he that wyll not ſweare the ſame, lette hym knowe, that my naked ſwerde ſhall paſſe through hym. All they beyng no leſſe feared with his wordes, than yf Anniball had bene preſent, toke the ſame othe, and commytted theym ſelues to the tuition of Scipio.
            ¶ While theſe thinges were done at Cannuſium, there were gathered togither about .iii. M. horſemen and fotemen, and were come to Venuſia, where the conſulle Varro was, with whyche company the conſul came to Cannuſiū, and hauyng ſo great a numbre about hym, thought hym ſelfe able to defend them ſelues and the citie from Anniball.
            ¶ Of this great loſſe in the batayle newes was broughte to Rome, without any mencion of ſauyng of the ſayde number, that were with the conſull: but that euery man was ſlayn, and no Roman left on lyue. Whyche newes cauſed as great feare and rumour in the cytie, as euer was hearde there before: In ſoo moche that it was bruted abroode, that nother capitayn nor ſouldiour was left in the Roman campes, and that almooſte all Italy was yelded to Anniball. Wherefore they loked euery howre, whan theyr ennemies wolde come to beſiege the cytie of Rome. Whervppon the ſenatours prepared at Rome all thynges neceſſary for the ſuccours of the citie. Than they ordeyned theyr legyons and offycers. Marcus Iunius, by the whole conſent of the Senate, was choſen Dictator, and Titus Sempronius mayſter of the horſemē. There was alſo by the ſame auctorite choſen. 4. legions, and a thouſande horſemen of yonge men, of the age of .xvii. yeres, beſydes that they ſente to theyr frendes in other places of Italye, that they alſo ſhoulde prepare ſowldyours of the ſame ſorte, with horſe, harneys, and all other neceſſaries.
            
               
¶ The cytie thus beinge in extreme feare, letters came from the Conſull Terentius to Rome, certifyenge the Senate of the loſſe of the battayle, and of his felowe the other Conſul. And howe he with the leauynges of the hooſte, that eſcaped at the battayle, were at Cannuſium, to the noumbre of tenne thouſand men. Whych newes ſomwhat comforted the hartes of the citezens.
            ¶ Howe lette vs retourne to Anniball, who beynge buſyed about his pryſoners, ſuffered tenne of the Romayn captiues, in the name of all the other, to go to Rome, to ſee yf the fathers conſcript, or any of theyr frendes wolde redeme them, and theyr company that were pryſoners: deſyrynge of theſe tenne meſſangers none other ſuerties for theyr retourne, ſauynge theyr othe. With whom he ſent a noble baron of Carthage, to the intent, that yf it ſhulde happe theym to intreate of peace, he myghte brynge the condycions thereof with hym: The pryce of the redemption of a Romayne horſeman was fyue hundred peces of ſyluer, called Quadrigati, ſo named for that the coygne bare in it the prynt of a charyote: The pryce of a Romane cytezen was thre hundred: the price of a ſeruaunt was one hundred. All other pryſoners of Italy, that camme to the helpe of the Romayns, he lette go free to theyr countreys without raunſome. And whan it was ſhewed the councell, that they were come to Rome, a meſſanger mette this baron of Carthage, whoſe name was Carthabo, and ſhewed hym, that the Dictator commaunded, that he ſhulde depart from the boundes of Rome, before the nyght.
            ¶ Sone after the Senate or parlyament was holden for the captyues meſſangers, where one of theym, that was of moſt authoritie, thus began to ſay & openly pronounce his oracion.

               IT is not vnknowen to you all (Fathers conſcript) that there was neuer more wretched & vyle priſoners to any citie, thā haue ben to this our citie. Hot withſtandyng vnles we ſtand very moch in our owne conceit, there were neuer Romans takē pryſoners in warre, which were

leſſe worthy to be diſpyſed vnto you than we be nowe. For truely we dyd not yeld vp our harneys and wepons in battel, for feare as cowardes, but whan it drewe towarde night, ſtandyng vpon heapes of deade bodies, we withdrewe from the battayle, and went to our tentes, where as we beinge bothe weary with labour, and ſoore wounded, kepte our ſelues in ſauegarde the reſidue of the day and nyght folowynge. The nexte daye, whanne we perceyued that we were incloſed and conſtrayned with the hooſte of our ennemies, wantynge alſo water, and ſeinge no hope of eſcapyng through the thycke hooſte and companye of oure ennemyes, and conſyderynge that it were wyſedome, and not ſoundynge to diſhonour, ſeing that fifty thouſand were ſlayne of our company, that ſome ſhulde be lefte of our ſouldy ours at this battayle alyue: We than in concluſion agreed with them for our raunſom, that we myght be delyuered. And than we yelded vp our weapons, whiche coulde lyttell preuayle vs. We haue hearde, that our elders were redemed from the frenchmen, ye and our fathers being moſte fiers and hardy, were gladde to ſende to Tarent for conditions of peace, bycauſe of redeming their captiues, but in Italye with the Frenchemen, and at Heracleam with Pyrrhus, bothe the batayles were accompted wretched and full of infamy, bicauſe of the cowardiſe and fleing of our people, but ſo was it not with vs. The deade bodies doo ouerſprede the fieldes at Cannas, nother hadde we eſcaped the death, but that for our enemyes, for wearynes in kyllyng and ſleinge, lacked both ſtrength and weapons. There be many of vs, whiche neuer came to battayle, but beinge left to kepe the campe; whan the tentes were yelded, they likewiſe came vnder ſubiection to theyr ennemies. Verily I doo not enuye the eſtate or fortune of any citezen, or of my felawe in warre nother wolde I, that my fame ſhoulde be extolled and rayſed by the infamy of other: but truely they ought to haue lyttell rewarde or prayſe, vnleſſe it be of the agilitie and ſwyftenes of theyr fete, whyche being vnarmed for the moſte parte fleinge from battayle, neuer ceaſſed tyll they came to Venuſia or Cannuſium: yet do they preferre them ſelues before vs iuſtly and not without a cauſe, as they thynke. Ye and they reioyſe and boſte, that there remayneth in theym more ſuccour and helpe to the common welthe than in vs. But we wolde ye

ſhulde receyue and take them as good and ſtronge men. And alſo to thynke vs to be hereafter more prompt and wylling to maynteyn our countrey, by howe moche we may be redemed and reſtored into the ſame by your benefytes. Ye haue taken the muſter of all your people of alages and ſortes, and I here ſay, ye haue choſen .viii. thouſande of your bondemen to the warre, and there is of vs no leſſe a numbre, nother wylle our redemyng coſte any more than theyr bying wyll coſt. Truely yf I ſhulde compare theym, beinge ſeruauntes and bonde, vnto vs citezens and free, I ſhoulde greately diſhonour the name of Rome. But this I wold ye ſhuld remembre fathers conſcripte, in ſuche a councell, yf ye wyll be ſo hard harted, as to refuſe vs (whiche yf you doo, you ſhall doo withoute our deſeruyng) to whiche of our enemyes wyll ye commytte vs: to Pyrrhus? or elles to Anniball? in whom it is harde to be iudged, whether dothe remayne more crueltie or auarice. If ye dyd ſee the bandes and chaines, with which your citezens are bounde, the filthynes and deformitie that they are in: certes it wolde no leſſe moue and pitie you, than yf ye ſaw your legions lying deade, coueryng the feldes of Cannas. Ye may beholde the ſorowe, the heuynes, and the teares of our frendes and kynsfolke ſtandyng at the porche of the ſenate, tarying for your anſwere. And ſens they be ſo ſorowful for vs and for them that be abſent in priſon, what myndes wold you ſuppoſe thoſe priſoners to haue, whoſe life and libertie is in dout, and hangeth nowe in balance? Certainly if Anniball, contrary to his owne nature, wold be meke and gentyl to vs, yet neuer the leſſe wolde not we deſyre to lyue, in caſe we ſhall be thought of you, our noble fathers, vnworthy to be redemed. Shulde I deſyre the retourne into my countrey, yf beinge a citezen I ſhulde not be eſtemed by you worth .iii. C. peces of ſyluer? Lette euery man do as he wyll fathers conſcripte, I knowe my body and lyfe to be in doubt: but the ieopardye of our name and fame bothe more moue and greue me, that we ſhoulde be reckened vnto you as abiectes and caſtes awaye. for there is no man that wyl ſuppoſe you to ſpare our redemtion for coſte.
            ¶ Whan he hadde made an ende of his oration, there aroſe a great noyſe and wepynge amonge the people, both men and women, that were frendes vnto the ſayd captiues, who helde

After many and dyuerſe contrary opinyons hadde in the ſenate: ſomme ſuppoſynge it mete, that they ſhoulde be redemed with the common treaſure, and ſome contrarye. T.

               IF the legates, that were ſent hyther for the redemption of our captiues, had all onely made petition for thoſe, who are taken pryſoners, that they might be reſtored, I wold haue ſhewed my mynd brefely, without reherſall of any of theyr feates, for of what ought you rather to be admonyſſhed, than to obſerue the cuſtome, left by your fathers, as concernynge buſynes of warre by example neceſſary. But nowe, bycauſe they almoſt reioyſe and glory, that they yelded theym ſelues to theyr ennemies, and thynke it meete they ſhoulde be preferred not onely before thoſe, whyche were taken pryſoners in batayle, but alſo before thoſe that eſcaped to Venuſia and Cannuſium, ye and before Terentius Varro the conſulle: I ſhall declare vnto you fathers conſcripte all that was doone there, ye and I wolde to the goddis, that theſe thinges, whiche I am about to ſhewe vnto you, myght ſpeake at Cannuſium before the hoſte. Whiche wolde be a ſure wytneſſe of euery mannes cowardyſe and ſluggyſſhenes, and alſo of theyr hardynes and vertue: or els I wold that Publius Sempronius were here preſent, whom yf they had folowed, they had be now in ſaue garde in the Romane tentes, and not captiues with theyr ennemyes. For whan theyr enemyes were weery of fyghtynge, and alſoo reioycynge of theyr vyctory, and the mooſte parte of theym retourned to theyr tentes: they myght haue hadde the nyghte free without interruption to

haue eſcaped. Veryly .vii. thouſande armed men myght than haue eſcaped through theyr ennemyes, takyng ſo lytell hede to them, but truely nother wolde they enterpriſe this thynge theym ſelues, nor folowe them that wolde take on them that aduenture. All the nyght longe almoſte Sempronius ceaſſed not to admonyſhe and exhorte them, that they ſhould folowe hym as theyr capytayne, whyles there were but fewe of their ennemyes about theyr tentes, whiles euery man was at reſt & ſcilence, and whyles the nyght dyd couer and hide theyr purpoſe: Shewynge theym, that they ſhoulde come into ſauegarde, and to theyr frendes before the day, as by the memory of our grandfathers, Publius Decius dyd in Samnio, and as Calphurnius Flamma, whan we were but yonge men, dyd in the firſt warres Punicke, to .iii. hundred that wyllyngely folowed hym. Whan he hadde brought them to take a hylle whyche was in the myddell of their ennemyes: Let vs here dye ſowldiours (ſayde he) and let vs throughe our death delyuer our legyons and army, whyche are incloſed and beſiged by our ennemies. If Publius Sempronius had ſpoken ſuche wordes to you, and yf none of you had ben of ſuche hardynes to conſent to him, he myght haue ſuppoſed you neyther to be men, nor Romaynes: but he ſhewed you a moche more eaſye way, whyche wolde brynge you as well to glory and prayſe, as to health and profyte. He made hym ſelfe a capytayne and guyde to bryng you to your cuntrey to your fathers, to your wyues, and chyldren: But you lacked audacitie to folowe hym, what wolde you haue done, yf he wolde haue moued you to haue dyed for your countrey? Fifty thouſande citezens, and of your frendes laye deade about you that daye in the fielde. If the examples of hardyneſſe and vertue of ſoo many noble menne, wolde nat moue you, there is nothynge that euer ſhall moue you? If ſuche ſlaughter of your frendes dothe not cauſe you to haue ſmalle eſtymation of youre owne lyues, nothynge ſhall euer moue you thereto? You ſhoulde haue deſyred youre countreye, whyles ye were free, ſafe and ſounde, yea you ſhoulde haue deſyred it, whyles it was youre countrey, nowe doo ye deſyre it to late. Ye be cleane ſeparate from it. ye are vtterly alienate frome the ryght of the Cytezens. Ye are nowe made ſeruauntes vnto the Carthaginenſes. Wylle ye be redemed ſrome thenſe

whither you wyllyngly went with cowardyſe, ſlowenes and wyckednes? you wolde not here Sempronius your citezen commaundynge you to take harneys and to folowe hym. but ſoone after you hearde Anniball, commandynge you to yelde your armour and your tentes? Why doo I accuſe (Fathers conſcript) theyr ſlouthfulnes and cowardiſe, whan I may rather accuſe theyr wicked and abhominable facte? they dyd not onely refuſe his counſaile which was profitable: but alſo they went about to withſtande hym, and to conſtrayne hym to forſake the common welthe: vnles noble men with theyr naked ſwerdes hadde put them from their purpoſe. Publius Sempronius was dryuen (I ſay) fyrſt to eſcape by manful courage through thoſe his felowes and citezēs, and after through the myddell of his ennemies. And ſhulde this citie and countrey deſyre the reſtitution of ſuche citezens, whom yf the reſidue of their felowes, who were at Cannas, had folowed and bene lyke there had no citezen ben lefte vs of thoſe, whiche were at the battell? of .vii. M. men there were .vi. C. that aduentured to eſcape and retourne free with armour to theyr countrey, nother dyd the hoſte of theyr ennemyes, whyche were xl. M. men lette or hynder them: howe ſafe than myght the two armyes being ioyned togyther haue paſſed thynke you? whiche yf they had done fathers conſcript, ye ſhoulde haue had nowe .xx. M. ſtronge and hardy ſouldiours at Cannuſiū. but nowe howe can theſe be accompted for good and faythful citezens (as for bolde they wyll not call them ſelfes) whyche had rather to lye lurkyng in theyr tentes, and tary bothe the day and theyr ennemyes, than to endeuour them ſelues with theyr company to eſcape awaye in the nyghte? but ſeing that theyr hartes wolde not ſerue theym to auoyde theyr tentes, was it lyke (trowe ye) that they ſhulde haue hardynes to cō
               ſerue & kepe the ſame tētes? They ſay, that where they were beſyeged for certayne days and nyghtes they defended them ſelues, and at the length, whan they had ſuffered the extremitie, whan all the neceſſaries to their lyfe dyd fayle theym, than they being ouerpreſſed with hungre, coulde noo longer ſuſteyn battaile. And they ſay they were rather ouercome for lacke of humayne neceſſities than with batayle. This greate warre that ye ſpeake of, laſtyng two days, was ended in two howres. Annibal came to the tentes before the ſonne aroſe to

whome without any battayle gyuen or reſiſtence made, they yelded vp theyr weapons and them ſelues. Whan they ſhuld haue fought in the battayle, they fiedde to theyr campe, and whan they ſhuld haue defended theyr campe, they nother profitable in the battaile nor in theyr tentes, yelded vp campe and all. Shuld ſuch a ſorte be redemed? I thynke them (fathers cōſcript) no more worthy to be redemed, than I thynke them worthy to be yelded to Anniball, whiche eſcaped from theyr tentes through the myddell of theyr ennemies: And through theyr great hardines reſtored them ſelues to theyr countrey. Whan Manlius had fynyſhed his oration, al though many of theym were of the kynrede and alyance to the ſenatours, yet the anſwere was gyuen them, that they ſhuld not be redemed. And that for two cauſes, the one was for the olde exaumple of the citie, that had euer lyttell fauoured the redemption of captiue pryſoners. An other was, the greate ſumme of money that muſte be payde for them. wherof theyr treaſure had ben before made bare with manyfolde charges of warre. And alſo they were loth that Anniball, than being nedy of money, ſhulde with theyr ſubſtance be ſo greatly enryched. Than beganne a newe mournyng for the loſſe of the cytezens. They folowed the legates with greate wepynge and ſorowe to the gates. One of thoſe tenne Romayne meſſangers, that were ſent from Anniball, after that his company departed towarde Rome, fayned that he had lefte ſome thynge behynde hym, and ſo returned to his tentes, and in the nyght ouertoke his company, by whiche fraudulent retourne, thynking him ſelfe quytte and diſcharged of his othe, wente home to his owne houſe. And there remayned ſtyl, not returnyng to Anniball: but whan his vntruth was knowen, he was taken & ſent to the tentes of the Carthaginenſes, to do with hym theyr pleaſure.
         
         
            ¶ Howe Pacuuius by crafte became chiefe ruler of Capua, and of the yeldyng of that citie to Annibal. Cap. xxvii.
            ANniball after the battayle at Cannas, with as greatte ſpede as he myght, went from Apulia to Samniū, and to Coſſa, and ſo to Naples, but the ſtrengthe of that towne made him afrayde to gyue aſſaut therto. Wherfore he went from thens, and came to Capua, whiche as than flouryſhed

in pleaſure and abundance by long felicitie & fauor of fortune. Than was there in Capua one Pacuuius, a noble mā, ſauing that he gat not his goodes and riches by honeſt meanes. This Pacuuius bare gret office in the city the ſame yere that the Romans loſt the bataile at Traſimenus: And now thynkyng to make a diſcord betwene the ſenate and the cōmon people, who long had vſed great licence and liberty without reaſon, and therby to increaſe both his authoritie and ſubſtāce, deuiſed a great and perillous enterpriſe, which was, that ſo ſone as Anniball ſhuld come thyther with his army, he wold cauſe the commons to ſlea the Senatours: After whoſe death, he myght at his pleaſure yelde the citie to the Carthaginenſes. Yet at the laſt he conſydered, that better it were for hym to rule and gouerne a cōmon welth floriſhing in all thinges than to rule a citie, that were vtterly ſubuerted and diſtroied (whiche he accompted to be, yf the noblemen and ancient counſellers therof were ſlayn) he than imagined a way, that he might both ſaue the ſenate and counſel of the citie, and make the coū
               ſell of the ſame, to thinke them ſelues bound to him and to the commune people. Whervpon he called a counſayle, wherein he ſhewed the ſenatours, that to receiue the Carthaginenſes, and to leaue the Romans frendſhip, dyd nothyng pleaſe him, conſyderynge that he had maryed Appius Claudius doughter, and alſo that Liuius hadde maryed one of his doughters: ſauynge that neceſſitie dydde requyre it, bycauſe there was other matters in hande moche more to be doubted, whiche was, that the commune people were pourpoſed fyrſte to ſlea theym all that were of the Senate howſe, and after to yelde vp the citie to Anniball. Neuer the leſſe he ſayde, he wolde vndertake that he wolde ſaue theym frome daunger, yf they wolde commytte theym ſelues wholly to hym: wherwith he made theym greatte aſſurance by othes. Whan they all, beinge ouercome with feare, had conſented to hym, I wyll ſhut you (ſaith he) into the ſenate houſe, as thoughe I were of the cōmons councell, and dyd alowe their dedes and purpoſe: but after I ſhall fynde a waye to conſerue and ſaue you. And whan they were agreed to the ſame, he encloſed them in the capitoll, ſo that none could come to them, nother they gette furthe, vnleſſe it were by his licence. And than he called the common people togyther, and ſayd: My frendes,

nowe haue you power ouer the deteſtable and wycked ſenatours, whoſe death ye haue ſo longe deſyred, and that ye haue nowe without ſtroke ſtryking. For beholde, I haue theym encloſed in yonder howſe aboue vnarmed: And what ſentēce ye wyll gyue of them, or any of them, that ſhall they ſuffer, accordyng to theyr deſertes. but before all thynges, I wolde you ſhulde haue reſpect to your helth and profite, before the executiō of your wrath. For ſenatours I am ſure, ye wil haue to gouerne the citie. Therfore nowe haue we two thinges to be done togither, that is, to put downe the old ſenatours, and than to choſe newe. I wyll wel, that you ſhall iudge what puniſhment the olde ſhall haue: but firſte you ſhall chuſe a newe valiant wiſe ſenator in euery of their places. Thā ſet he down and cauſid their names to be put togither in writing into a pot and as their names were ſeuerally drawen forth of the pot, he cauſed them to be called in order, and he that was fyrſt named he cauſed to be fetched out of the ſenate houſe, wherin they were incloſed. And whan the cōmons herd his name, they all cried, that he was wicked, & worthy of puniſhment. Than ſaid Pacuuius, I here well what you ſay, lette him be caſt out for 
                  •
               ought, & an other choſen in his place. Than were they at the firſt put to ſilence, bicauſe they wanted a better to be choſen in his place. And whan any man wolde take vpon hym to name any other man: there wold ariſe a greater rumor and noyſe at his naming. Some ſaying, they knew him not, and ſom reprehending his birthe, ſome his maners, ſome the vilenes of his craft and liuing, with ſuch other like obiections: & moch more the noiſe was for choſing of the ſecond and third: ſo that they al agreed, that it was rather better for them to ſuffer the olde noughty ſenatours to remain, which they knewe, than to haue ſuch new, as were worſe and vnknowē. ſo that they cōmanded to let the old ſenatours go free, and vſe their romthes. After this maner Pacuuius gat the rule of the cōmon welthe, peaſybly makyng the ſenators moche more bounde to him for ſauinge their lyues, than to the commons of the citie. And by this meane by al mens conſent he had the hole gouernance of the citie. Of this cam the loſſe of the dignitie to the ſenators, forgetting their liberte, doing nothīg in the coūſel hous with out the cōmons aduiſe. The citie was always prone & gyuen to luſt & pleſure, not only by the noughtynes of their myndes,

but alſo by the abundance of pleaſures, ryches, and other delytes, and of all fruitefulnes bothe on ſea and lande, and wared want on through the flattery of pryncis, and ouermoche libertie of the people, folowyng theyr pleaſures and luſt beyonde all meaſure, ſo that they diſpiſed both the ſenate and other magiſtrates, and alſo all rule and lawe. And than after the battayle of Canuas, they that had a lyttell ſhamefaſtneſſe before, were not aſhamed to diſpiſe the empire of Rome. And in ſhort tyme after, they conſented to yeld vp the citie to Anniball, and to leaue the amitie of the Romans: yet before they wolde ſende theyr legates to Anniball, they ſent meſſangers to Rome, to deſyre that one of theyr citie myght be euer one of the conſuls at Rome, yf they wolde that they ſhuld helpe them in theyr buſines. Whervpon there aroſe great indignation and angre, for that they that were before in amitie and as ſubiectes, ſhulde requyre ſuche equalitie of honour with the Romans. Wherfore they cōmaunded, that the legates ſhuld be brought out of the ſenate houſe, and further they ſente an officer, who ſhoulde conueye theym oute of the citie, and to charge them to departe oute of the limyttes and boundes of Rome. The ſame legates incontinent vppon theyr retourne home, were ſent to Anniball, who receyued them, and granted them all the conditions of peace, accordynge to theyr aſkyng, ſo that no ruler or magiſtrate of Carthage ſhulde hereafter clayme rule or dominion ouer any citizen of Capua, nother ſhulde any of them be enforſed to go in the warres, but at his owne pleaſure. Agayne, that they myghte kepe ſtylle theyr owne lawes, with theyr rulers and magiſtrates. Amongeſt whyche requeſtes, they deſyred .iii. C. Romane captiues to be delyuered vnto them, whiche ſhulde be chaunged for other .iii. C. of theyr horſemen, that kepte warre in Sicilia, whiche was not denyed theym. To this agreement, Decius Magius, a man of great authoritie (ſauing that the commons were not agreable to hym) dydvtterly withſtande: fyrſt willynge that no legacy ſhulde be ſent to Anniball. And as ſoone as he hearde, that the agreement was made, and that Anniball wolde ſende his men of armes to Capua▪ be ſhewed them for an example, the proude raygnynge of Pyrthus: and the myſerable ſeruitude of the Tarentines, crying alowde, that if they wolde here hym, Anniballes army ſhulde in no wyſe be

receyued: And yf they were all redye receyued, that they ſhulde be put furth agayne.
            ¶ As ſoone as theſe thynges were ſhewed to Anniball (as they were not ſecretely ſpoken) he cōmanded, that Magius ſhulde be taken and ſent vnto hym: but than he fearynge the diſpleaſure of the people, ſent worde to Marius the Pretor, that he wold be at Capua the next day folowyng. Marius incontinent aſſembled the people, and ſhewed all men of Anniballes commynge, commandynge them to be redy with their wyues to meete hym. And whanne he was commynge, and all the citie went to mete hym, onely Decius, with his ſonne, and a fewe of his frendes, wolde not go with them: but walked openly and ſtubburnely in the market place. As ſoone as Annibal came to the citie, he called a counſayle, myndynge in his angre to do cruell execution of his aduerſaries, not withſtandyng the rulars of the citie deſyred hym, that he ſhuld do nothing as that day, but be mery and celebrate the ſame in the worſhyp of his commynge. To whoſe requeſt (although he was of a ſodayne inclination to wrath and angre) he was conformable: and ſpent that day in vewyng the citie.
            ¶ Pacuuins Calauius, of whome we ſpake before, who was chiefe of the citie, and chiefe cauſer of the yeldynge thereof to the Carthaginenſes, brought his ſonne, being a yong mā, thyther, whom he toke from the companye of Decius, with whom the yonge man ſtode fyrmely agaynſte the bandes and frendſhyp made with the Carthaginenſes: nother coulde the citezens, being enclyned to that parte, nother the auctoritie of his father, moue the yonge man to the ſame: vnto whome his father, with great interceſſion, made Anniball good lorde and frende. Anniball being ouercome and appeaſed with the requeſt of his father, cauſed the yonge man, with his father, to be ſent for to ſupper: at whiche ſupper there was none of Capua, ſauyng thoſe that were lodged in that howſe, and one Iubellius Taurea, a noble warriour. The ſouper was begun before the nyght, the feaſt was ſumptuous, and not after the maner of fare in warre tyme. This yongeman, nother by the prouocation of the rulars, nor by the chering of Annibal him ſelfe, coulde be perſwaded to be mery, but he ſhewed his father, that he was diſeaſed, and that his minde was ſoore troubled. And whan his father hearde that, he departed oute of

the feaſtynge chaumbre before the ſonne was ſette: whome his ſonne folowed. And whan they came to a gardeyn, at the ende of the houſe, whiche was ſecrete: Father (ſayth he) I haue diuiſed nowe away, wherby we ſhall not onely purchaſe our pardon of the Romanes, for that we haue forſaken them and choſen Hanniball to be our gouernour, but we ſhall ſtande nowe from hensforth in moche more dignitie and grace with them, than euer we were before. Whan his father (meruaylyng what it myghte be) had inquired of hym that diuiſe: he caſte his gowne from hym, and ſhewed his ſyde beinge gyrte with a ſwerde: Nowe wyll I (ſayde he) eſtablyſſhe and ſanctifye the bandes betwyxte the Romaynes and vs, with the bloudde of Anniball: Of this counſayle father, I thoughte to make the priuey before, for bycauſe I knewe not, whether thou haddeſt rather be preſent, whyles the deede were doinge or not. Whyche diuyſe whan the olde manne hearde (as thoughe he hadde be preſente at the doynge of that whyche was ſpoken) with greatte feare he beganne to adhorte and perſwade his ſonne to the contrary: layinge fyrſt the greatte othe and promyſe made to Anniball by all the whole citie: and alſo ſhewynge the daunger of the acte to be ſuche, that he coulde neuer eſcape alyne. I beynge thy Father (ſayde he) haue wonne Anniball to be thy good lorde, and ſhall not I wynne my ſonne to be frende to Anniball? And after that he hadde with longe prayer, wepynge, and great interceſſion ouercomme his ſonne, and diſſwaded hym frome his enterpriſe: the yonge manne ſayde theſe wordes: O countreye, receyue thou this ſwerde, with whyche I beynge armed, wolde haue defended this citie and caſtell, ſparyng nothyng, nor Fearynge myne owne deathe, but onely beinge ouercome with my fathers perſwaſyons. And whan he hadde ſo ſayde, he caſte his ſworde into the playne ouer the gardeyne walle, and than bycauſe he ſhulde not be ſuſpecte, he wente agayne to the feaſt.
            ¶ The next day the ſenate was holden, in the whiche Annibals fyrſt oration was very gentyll, gyuyng thankes vnto the citezens, for that they preferred his amitie and frendſhyp before the Romanes: and among other hygh promiſes, he promyſed theym, that Capua ſhulde in ſhorte ſpace be the heade of all Italye: And that the Romaynes, with other cities of

Italy, ſhoulde ſeke vnto Capua for theyr ryghte and lawe: but he ſayde, that there was amonge them one named Magius Decius, who was noothynge agreable vnto the amytie betweene the Carthaginenſes and them of Capua: who (he ſayd) was no citezen, nor ought to be ſo called nor reputed. Wherfore he requyred, that he myghte be yelded vntohym, and that alſo in his preſence his cauſe myght be debated before theym of the counſaylle. To whyche requeſte euery manne graunted, althoughe ſomme thoughte he was a manne moche vnworthy to ſuſtayne ſuche myſerye, and that theyr lybertie beganne to mynyſſhe not a lytell in the beginnynge. The ſenate was holden in the temple. Magius was commaunded to be taken, and brought to ſhewe his mattier, and he anone denyed it to be lawfull for theym, to breake the truce taken with the Romaynes. Wherefore he was commaunded to be bounde with chaynes, and ledde to the campe of the Carthaginenſes. In this leadynge thyther, as longe as his face was not couered, he wente cryinge to all theym, whyche were gathered togyther to ſee hym: Nowe haue ye, menne of Capua, your lybertie, whiche you deſyred: In the markette place, and in the day lyghte, and in the preſence of you all, I beinge chiefe and moſte auncient of Capua, beinge bounde, am drawen to deathe. What coulde haue bene done more cruell and violente, yf Capua had be taken? whan he coulde not be ſtayed, but contynued crienge after this maner, bicauſe the commune people were thoughte to be moued with his wordes, his face and head was couered, and he was ledde quyckely out of the gates into the tentes of Anniball, and from thenſe in haſte ſente towarde Carthage by ſhyppe, leſte there ſhoulde be anye ſedytion moued for the ſame amonge the Cytezens: but in ſaylynge thyther, the ſhyppe was dryuen by tempeſte to Cyrenas, where Magius fledde to the pycture of Ptholomeus the kynge for his ſauegarde. Wherevppon he was broughte by the kepars of the towne to Alexandria, before Ptholomeus. And whan he hadde declared vnto the kynge, that Anniball hadde ſente hym bounde, contrarye vnto the league and bandes of the truce taken with the Cytezens of Capua: he was delyuered from his bandes, and hadde lybertie to goo whyther he wolde to Rome, or to Capua. To the whyche he made aunſwere,

that Capua was not a place very ſafe for hym: and he ſayde, that Rome, whyles there was warre betweene the men of Capua and it, was rather an habitation of vacabundes than of frendes and olde gueſtes. Wherfore he ſayd, he had not ſoo great deſyre to liue in any place, as in his kyngdom, by whom he was reſtored to his libertie.
         
         
            ¶ The newes that Mago brought to Carthage of Annibals victories in Italy, and the oration of Hanno a ſenatour of Carthage m
                  ••
               e vnto the ſame. Cap. xxvii.
            
               WHyles theſe thynges were done in Italy, Mago the ſonne of Amilcar, not ſent from the army by his brother, but ocupied a certayn ſpace, in receyuynge the cities of the Bruſians, whiche yelded them ſelues willyngly to the Carthaginenſes, brought tydinges to Carthage of the victory at Cannas. Whan the ſenatours were for him aſſembled, he declaryng the actes done by his brother in Italy, ſayde: that he had foughten with ſix capitayns, of the whych iiii. were conſuls, the fyſte Dictatour, that is chiefe rular in the common welthe of the citie, and the ſyxte mayſter of the horſemen. He ſayd alſo, that he had ouercome .vi. conſulles hoſtes: ſo that there was ſlayne by hym .ii. C. M. and aboue fyfty. M. taken. and alſo he had ſlayn .ii. of the foure conſuls, and the thyrde was ſore wounded: and the fourth hauing loſt all his hoſte, fledde ſcacely with .l. men. And that the maſter of the horſemen was ouercome and put to flyght: ſo that the Dictator, whiche at no tyme durſte come to batayle, remained only their head and capitayne. Furthermore, that diuers places in Italy were tourned to Anniball, as the Brucians, the Apulians, part of the Samnites, and the Lucanes. In ſo moche as Capua, whiche was not onely the head of Campania, but alſo of all Italy, euer ſens the Romaynes were ſo ouerthrowen at Cannas, had yelded theym ſelues to Anniball.
            And for the more credence of theſe ſo ioyfull newes, he cauſed rynges of gold to be powred before the ſenatours, which of many men were reported to be to the quantitie of thre buſſhels, and a halfe: but moſte authors wryte (and that ſemeth

to bemoſt agreable to veritie) that they were aboue the meſure of a buſſhell. And moreouer bycauſe it ſhuld be a token of a more notable ſlaughter, he ſayd: that no man dyd weare any of the ſaydiewels, but horſemen, and men of iiobilitie.
            The ſumme of his oration was, that the greatter the hoope was of the wholevyctory, ſo moche rather Anniball ſhuld be ayded with great helpe and ſuccour, ſignifying to theym, that the warre was far from thens, in the myddel of theyr enmies lande: and that a great quantitie of grayne and moche money was ſpent. He ſayd alſo, that as the numbre of their enemies with ſo many battailes were ſlayne and diminyſſhed, ſo theyr hoſte alſo was partly mynyſhed and ſlayne. Wherfore it was mete (he ſayde) to ſende money grayne and other neceſſaries to ſowldiours that ſo well had ſette furthe the name and honour of Carthage.
            ¶ For theſe tydinges of Mago, euery man being mery, Himilco, a man of the faction of the Barchins, thought to finde an occaſion to checke Hanno. What nowe Hanno (ſayth he) dothe it forthynke the of the begynnynge of the warre with the Romans? Commaunde Anniball to be delyuered nowe vnto them: or forbydde in this ſo fortunate tyme thankes to be giuen to the immortall goddis. Nowe lette vs here a ſenatour of Rome ſpeke in the ſenate houſe of Carthage. Whervnto Hanno anſwered.
            ¶ I was determined fathers conſcripte, at this time, in your ſo great and cōmonioy, to haue holden my peace, and to haue ſpoken nothyng, whiche ſhulde haue bene diſpleaſant to you: but I can nowe no leſſe do, but anſwere the ſenatour that inquired of me, whether it forthinketh me of the warre enterpriſed agaynſt the Romanes, or no. Therfore myne anſwere ſhalbe this to Himilco, that I forthynke me yet of the warre taken, and ſhall ſtylle repent it, nor ſhall at any tyme ſeace to forthynke it, and blame our victorious capytayne, vntyl I ſee the warre taken vp and ended by ſome tollerable way and cō
               dition, nother ſhall any other thynge cauſe me to ſeaſſe frome the deſyre of the olde auncient peace, ſaue only a newe peace made. Theſe goodly newes, whiche Mago hathe blaſed abrode, are very ioyfull to Himilco and other Annibals frendes and ſeruantes: yea they may be alſo ioyfull to me, for our proſperitie in warre, yf we take our good fortune whan it cō
               meth,

ſhall cauſe vs to haue better and more profitable peace. But if we let paſſe this time, in the which we may be thought rather to graunt peace, than to craue it: I doubte, leſte this ioye wyll deceyue vs, and come to nothynge. Nowe lette vs diſcuſſe this matter ſeriouſly, and ye ſhall perceyue what this greate ioye is. He ſayth, the army of our ennemies is ſlayne: yet he commaundeth ſouldiours to be ſent hym. What other thynge wolde a man deſyre, yf he were ouercome. He ſayth alſo, that the Campes and tentes of bothe hoſtes of our ennemyes are taken, with a ryche praye and ſpoyle: yet he commaundeth, that we ſhall ſende hym grayne and money. What other thynge coulde a manne deſyre, yf he were robbed and dryuen frome his owne tentes? But nowe I haue aunſwered Himilco to his demaundes, I wolde that other Himilco or Mago wold anſwere me vnto that I ſhall aſke of them. If the fielde fought at Cannas was to the vtter ſubuertion of the Roman empyre, and deth of the hole hoſt, and all Italy like yeld them, and forſake the Romans? Fyrſt whether any of the people of Rome come fleinge to vs, and forſake the Romans? Moreouer, whether any of the .xxxv. tribes haue fledde, and come to Anniball? Which both thinges whan Mago had denied to be done: It muſt than folow (ſaid he) that we haue many enmies yet left at Rome. But I wold faine knowe, what courage and hope that multitude of our ennemies hath? Whan Mago had ſayd, he could not tel. There is nothyng more eaſy (ſayde Hanno) to be knowen. Dydde the Romaynes ſende any legates to Anniball for peace? or whether hadde ye any knowledge, that the Romayns made any mention of peace at Rome? Whanne he alſo hadde denyed that: Than haue we (ſayde he) as greatte warre euen nowe in hande, as we hadde the fyrſte daye that Anniball entred into Italye. There be many of vs alyue, that doo remembre yet, howe varyable the vyctorye was in the fyrſte warres that were betwyxt Carthage and Rome. Our warres and buſynes (bothe by ſea and lande) were thought neuer to be more proſperous, thanne before Caius Luctatius, and Appius Poſthumius were Conſuls: But yet in theyr tyme we were ouercomme at the Iles of Egates. Lykewyſe nowe, yf Fortune do tourne (as ſhe is always varyable) whiche I praye vnto the Goddis maye not happen: Wolde ye

than hope to haue peace, whan we are ouercome, the whiche nowe we can not gette, although we vanquyſſhe and ouercome the Romaynes? If any mention of peace were made, eyther to be gyuen to oure ennemyes, or elles to be taken of theym: I coulde telle thanne ryght well what to ſaye. But in caſe ye wylle onely commen of the demaundes of Mago, I thynke, yf our people haue ſoo vanquyſhed our ennemyes as hathe bene declared, it is not nedefulle to ſende theym that whyche Mago deſyreth. And yf they wolde mocke vs with theyr vayne reporte of vyctorye, whanne none ſuche is hadde in dede: I thynke than they oughte leſſe to be ſuccoured at our handes.
            ¶ With this oration of Hanno very fewe were moued to be of his opynion. For the enuye and hatrede, that they bare vnto hym, and alſoo the greatte kynrede of the other, cauſed hym to be the worſe heard. Agayne, they were ſoo reioyſed with the ſodayne and preſente ioye, that they wold heare noothynge, that ſhoulde hynder the ſame: Suppoſynge the warres ſhoulde ſoone be fynyſſhed, yf they dydde ſende any helpe nowe at this tyme into Italye. Wherefore by the hole conſente of the Senate it was concluded, to ſende to Anniball forty thouſande Numydians, to his ſuccours, and fortye elephantes, and a greatte ſumme of money. And the Dictatoure of Carthage was ſente into Spayne, with Mago, to hyre twenty thouſande footemen, and foure thouſande horſmenne, whyche ſhulde fournyſhe agayne the armyes both in Spayne, and alſo in Italy. But theſe thinges were forſlowed and done by leyſure (as commonly it happeth in proſperitie. But beſyde the naturall induſtry of the Romaynes, Fortune alſo wrought moche for them: for they hapned that yere vppon a Conſull, that ſought all meanes poſſible, to further all ſuche thynges as ſhulde be thought neceſſary to be brought to paſſe by hym. And Marcus Junius, beyng Dictatour, beſydes the Legyons, whyche were appoynted before, and the bondemenne of the Cytie, with other ſuccours ſuche as he coulde gather togyther of dyuerſe countreyes adioynynge, to fournyſſhe the armye: He lepte than beſydes his horſe, ſayinge: All ſuche as haue commytted any maner of cryme worthye of deathe, and they that are condempned to pryſon for money, yf they wolde be ſowldyours with hym,

and go to the warre, he wold pay theyr dettes, and loſe them from theyr handes and punyſhement. Thus hadde he of that ſort .vi. M. ſouldyours, whom he armed with the armor that C. Flamminius toke from the Frenchemen, and than he went out of the citie with .xxv. M. harneyſt men.
         
         
            ¶ Of the battayle betwene Marcellus and Anniball before the citie of Nola, and of Annibals wyntryng in Capua, the delycate pleaſures, wherby he withdrewe the hartes and courages of his men from all warrelyke faſcion. Cap. xxviii.
            
               AFter Anniball had taken Capua, he aſſayed many and dyuers ways to haue gotten Naples, whiche whan he coulde not brynge to paſſe, he went from thens to the fieldes of the Nolans, aſſayeng by many ways to wyn the towne of Nola. The ſenate, and namely the chiefe, ſtacke ſurely to their olde frendes the Romaynes: The cōmunes being (as they are wont) deſyrous of newes, inclyned all to Anniball. Wherfore the ſenate, fearyng to ſtryue with the commons openly (agaynſte whoſe power, yfnede requyred, they were not able to reſyſt) priuyly diſſemblyng, founde meanes to prolong the time, ſaying, they were cōtent to be yelded to Anniball, but they knew not after what maner and condition they ſhuld yelde. During whiche tyme of delay, they ſent ambaſſadours to Marcellus the pretor of Rome, being than at Cannuſium, ſhewyng hym the circumſtance of the matter: wylling him to come to them yf he intended that they ſhuld kepe the towne. Who perceiuyng theyr ſtedfaſtnes, greately prayſed the ſenate of Nola, deſyrynge them to perſeuere in theyr purpoſe: and vſe ſuche ſubtiltie in prolonging of tyme, as they before had done, vntill his commyng to them, whych ſhuld be ſhortly: In the meane ſeaſon, he willed them, not to be aknowen of any ſuccour that was commynge. Than ſtreyght he made hym redy, and with his army toke the way to Calacia, and ouer the riuer of Vulturnus, and ſo to Nola.
            ¶ Anniball before the Pretors comming, went from Nola to Naples, very deſyrous to wynne ſome towne that laye on the

ſea coſtes, to whyche the ſhyppes myght haue free and ſafe paſſage from Affrica. But whan he vnderſtode Naples was defended by a Romane capytayne (the Neapolitans had gotten thyther M. Iunius Syllanus) and ſhulde as well be kept out there as he was at Nola: he went and layde ſiege to Nuceria, whyche at laſt, vſynge many wayes, he cauſed them by famyne to yelde. Marcellus was by that tyme in the towne of Nola, and was no ſurer of his owne ſouldyours thanne he was of the pryncis of Nola: but he feared the commons, and aboue all other he dradde a yonge man, very hardye, and of a noble lygnage, whoſe name was Lucius Bantius, who was moche deſyrous to yelde the towne to Anniball. for beynge founde amonge a heape of dead bodies and ſoore wounded in the battayle at Cannas, Anniball cauſed hym to be healed, and ſent home with large gyftes: for which gentyll dede, he wold fayne that Nola ſhuld be yelded to Anniball. Marcellus perceyued this Bantius to be troubled in his mynde with ſuche ſtudy, ſo that he muſt eyther with punyſhement be refrained, orels by benefit reconciled: he ſent for hym, and ſo beninglye with wordes, promyſes, and gyftes entertayned hym, that there was none in the citie ſo ſure after to the Romans as he.
            ¶ Whan Anniball was come from Nuceria (which he of late had taken) before the gates of Nola, Marcellus was entred the citie, not fearyng to kepe his campe abrode: but leſt his taryinge without ſhulde be an occaſyon of betraying and yeldyng vp the citie. Than beganne ſmall ſkyrmyſhyng betwene the citie and the Carthaginenſes: at whiche time the pryncis of Nola ſhewed Marcellus, that the common people hadde ſecrete metynges and communication in the nyghte, with the Carthaginenſes: in the whiche it was purpoſed, that whanne the Romans were gone out to fyght, they wolde take theyr ſtuffe and cariage, and ſhutte the gates: and ſo whan they had gotten bothe theyr ſtuffe and goodes, they wold receyue the Carthaginenſes into the town in ſtede of the Romans. Whā they had ſhewed theſe conſpiracies to Marcellus, he praiſed theyr fidelitie greatly, and thought to aſſaye what he myght do by battayle, before any ſuche trouble ſhoulde be within the citie. Firſt he ordered his hoſte being diuided in thre partes, at the .iii. gates, whyche opened agaynſte his ennemyes. He commaunded the ſtuffe and baggage to folowe a prety ſpace

after. And at the middel gate he ſet the ſtrēgth of the Roman legions, the newe ſouldiours and other that cam to their ſuccours, he ſette at the two other gates, ſtraightly commaundyng, that the Nolans in no wyſe ſhulde come on the walles, nor nere the gates. He ſent alſo certayn ſouldiours to awaite on the cariage and ſtuffe, leſt whan they were buſy in battaile, the Nolanes myghte ſpoyle and take it. Whan all thynges were thus put in good order, they ſtode ſtyll within the walles, without makyng any ſhewe.
            ¶ Anniball ſtanding in aray in the fieldes a longe ſpace, as he was wont, meruailed that he ſawe nother the hooſte come to the fieldes, nor no man armed on the walles: Than he ſuppoſed, that theyr counſayle was knowen, and that for feare the cōmons of the towne were conſtrayned to forſake their promyſe. Wherfore he ſent part of the ſouldiours to the tentes to fetche ordynaunce and all thynges neceſſary to aſſault the walles, thynkyng that if he went on them, whiles they abode in this ſtay, that the common people of the citie wolde make ſome rumour on the walles. Incontynent whyles euery man, as the cōmandement was, ranne to his buſines, touchinge the aſſault, and the hoſt wente to the walles: the gates were ſodeinly opened. Marcellus cōmanded to ſpreade the baners, and the trumpettes to blowe, and the footemen fyrſt, and after the horſemen to runne on theyr ennemies. Some authors ſaye, that there were ſlayne at that ſkirmyſſhe .ii. M. iii. C. Carthaginenſes, & but one man of the Romans: whetherthe victory were ſo great, or whether it were leſſe, the acte was great, and the conduicte noble. Anniball hauynge no hope of opteynyng the towne, went than to Acerras, and Marcellus ſtreyght cauſed the gates of Nola to be ſhutte, leſt any manne ſhulde paſſe furthe: and made anon ſtrayght and dilygent examination, who they were, that wolde haue betrayed the towne. He beheaded .lxxx. of them, and cauſed their goodes to be dyſtributed amonge the commons. And after he had committed the charge of kepyng of the towne to the ſenate, he remoued with his hole hoſt beyonde Sueſſala.
            ¶ Anniball, after he hadde wonne Acerras, came to Caſſilinum, where they ſo valyantlye defended theym ſelfes, that Anniball, beinge halfe aſhamed, left the ſiege, and wente to wynter at Capua. And there he kepte his hooſte in houſes

for the moſt part of the wynter, who of long tyme before had endured agaynſt all kyndes of peynes and trauayle, hauynge ſmalle knowlege of pleaſure or eaſe. And they that could not before be ouercome with any kynde of miſery or peyne, were than loſte with vnmeaſurable pleaſures: wherein they were wholly drowned, ſo gredy they were therof, after theyr accuſtomed peynes. Thus toke they al theyr delite in ſlepe and wyne, in bankettes, hauntynge of harlottes and bathes, with dayly reſte and ydelnes, whiche delycate faſhion withdrewe bothe theyr courage, and alſo theyr ſtrength from theyr bodies and myndes: ſo that afterwarde theyr ioye comfort and ſtrength was more by remembrance of the victories, whiche they had opteyned before, than in theyr preſent ſtrength: In ſo moche that to lette his ſouldiours thus folow theyr luſtes, was thought amonge expert warriours a greater hynderance vnto hym, than that he did not lead his hoſt to Rome ſtreight after the battayle of Cannas. For that tarienge and doubting was thought but only a prolongyng of the victorye, but this faute made theym vnable afterwarde to ouercome. Soo that whan he remoued from Capua after the winter, it ſemed that he ledde furthe a ſtraunge army, other than he brought thyther, they obſerued none of theyr accuſtomed ſort of warre, ſomme retourned to theyr harlottes: many other, as ſoone as they beganne to feele peyne, trauayle, and hardeneſſe of warre, and that they were fayne to be couered with ſkynnes, they were ſo werye, and the warre ſemed to them ſo tediouſe, that they wanted bothe theyr ſtrength of bodye, and hardyneſſe of mynde, whyche they hadde before. A greatte parte of the hoſte without theyr wages, ſtole from theyr capytaynes, nother hadde they any other denne or receptable but Capua.
         
         
            ¶ Of the longe ſiege and wynnynge of Caſſilinum, with the deathe and diſtruction of the conſull Poſthumius and his hoſt in the woode of Lytana by the craft of the Frenchemen. Cap. xxix.
            VVhan it drewe towarde the ſommer, Anniball remoued agayne to Caſſilinum, where without aſſaute gyuynge but only by contynuall ſiege kepynge, he broughte the

inhabita
                  •
               tes therof almoſte to extreme ponertie and famyne. The dictatour in this ſeaſon was gone to Rome, to ſerche by diuinations the fortune that ſhulde happen. Titus Sempronius was left as ruler of the army. Marcellus being at Nola wolde haue ſuccoured them of Caſſilinum, ſaue that the citezens of Nola wolde in no caſe ſuffer hym to go from theym, fearynge leſte after his departure, the inhabitantes of Capua wolde haue inuaded theym. The ryuer alſoo of Vulturnus was ryſen ſo hygh, that he coulde not well paſſe ouer, but in great ieopardy. Gracchus was lefte with a certayne men of warre, to lye about Caſſilinum, who moued not, nor brought them any ſuccour, bycauſe he hadde in commandement of the dictatour, that he ſhulde moue no battayle in his abſence: yet hearde he ſuche newes from Caſſilinum, whyche wolde haue moued a man to haue broken his commandement. For it was ſhewed hym, that ſome being not able to ſuſteyne the greatte hungre and famine, without aduyſement, diſtroid them ſelfes: And ſome deſyryng the death, wold ſtand on the walles without armour, to the intent they myght be ſlayn with the ſhotte of theyr ennemies. Gracchus ſeyng that he durſte not helpe theym by battayle, bycauſe of the contrary cōmaundement of his dictatour, And there was no remedy to brynge them ſuſtynance, for that in no caſe coulde be done without battayle. Than he gathered in the fieldes as many kyndes of corne as he could, and therwith fylled a great numbre of veſſels or barelles, and ſent a meſſanger to the rulars of the citie, certifying them, that he wolde the next nyght ſende the veſſels with grayne downe the water, warning them to be redy to receiue theym at the cōmyng of the tyde. The nyght folowyng, euery man went to the ryuer to tary the cōmyng of the grayn, accordyng to the promyſe of Gracchus, at the laſte they myght ſee the tounnes come ſwymmynge downe the myddell of the ſtreame, whiche they receyued gladly and diuyded it equally among them. Thus they continued by the ſpace of .iii. or .iiii. nyghtes, ſo longe they diſceyued the watchemen of theyr ennemies: but at the laſte the water aroſe moche hygher than it was wont, by the reaſon of a continuall rayne that fell, ſo that the ſtreame was more ſwyft than it was wont to be, whereby the veſſels were dryuen to lande on that part where the hoſt of Anniball lay, and many were founde ſtyckyng amonge the

wyllowes, that grew on the bankes of the ryuer, which was ſhewed vnto Anniball, who afterwarde, with greatter dilygence, watched the ryuer of Vulturnus, leſt he ſhuld by ſuch meanes be eftſones deceyued. Yet was there ſuche lyke deuyſe made by ſendyng of nuttes downe the ſtreame, in barels tyll it was alſo eſpyed. At length they were brought to ſuche pouertie, that they were conſtrayned to take ſkynnes, ſtrynges, and the couerynges of ſhieldes, whiche they made ſofte in warme water, and ſo eate them: nother refrayned they to eate myſe and ſuche kynde of vermyn, and all kynde of herbes and rootes, whiche grewe without in the fielde adioyning to the walles. Thus alſo perceyued Anniball: wherfore he cauſed the grounde to be plowed vp, where all ſuche herbes and rootes dyd growe to his ennemies ſuccour without the wall. In whiche newe plowed groundes the men of the towne ſowed paſnepſede, wherat Anniball cried, Shall I tary at Caſſilinum whyle theſe ſedes be growen vp able for theyr foode and ſuſtynance? Whervpon where before he wolde here of no cōmunication of truce, he than was contented to couenant with them for theyr redemption. The price of their redemption was .vii. ounces of golde for euery of theym. Whan the couenantes were made, they yelded them ſelues. And they were kepte in pryſon, vntylle all the money was payde. And after ſent with good leaue to Cumas. There came from Preneſte to the garyſon of Caſſilinū .v. C. and ſeuenty ſouldiors, of whiche the moſte part were ſlayne and famyſhed, the reſidue went to Preneſte with their capitayne Manicius: Caſſilinum was giuen to the citezens of Capua, and kept with .vii. C. of Anniballes ſouldiours, leſte whan they were departed from thens, the Romans ſhulde take it agayn. The ſenate of Rome appoynted double ſtypende to the ſouldiours of Preneſte, and alſo gaue them fiue yeres licence, to be abſent from the warres, for theyr great fidelitie. Than were the Romans buſy in choſyng newe ſouldiours, to ſupply theyr places that were ſlayne in the batayle before. Lucius Poſthumius, and Titus Sempronius were choſen conſulles. The dictatour, whan the offycers were choſen, went to Theanū, where the army wyntred: he left the maiſter of the horſemen at Rome: who anone after he had receyued the office, counſayled with the fathers, about choſing and ordeyning of their armies for

that yere. And whan they were mooſte diligent aboute theyr bulines, tydynges was brought to the citie of a newe ſlaughter and loſſe, that was than happed vnto theym, oone euylle chaunce that yere commynge after an other. The truth was, that Lucius Poſthumius and his armye was dyſtroyed in France by this meane. There was a great wyde woode, called by the Frenchemen Litana, through which he ſhuld leade his hoſte, of the whiche woode the Frenchmen had ſo cutte all the trees on bothe ſydes the waye, yf they were not moued, they wolde ſtande ſtylle: but beinge any thynge moued, they wolde anon fall. Poſthumius had in his hoſte fyue and twenty thouſande men. The Frenchemen hadde beſtowed their companye rounde aboute the compaſſe of the woode, and whan the armye of the Romaynes was welle entred the woode, they caſt downe the fartheſt part of the trees, growynge in the borders of the woode, which whan they were moued fell one vpon an other through the woode, hauyng no ſtay, throwyng downe and ſleing the Romans as they paſſed, bothe men and horſes, ſo that ſcarſely tenne men eſcaped, the moſte part were almoſte paſte breathe and deade of the hurtes of the trees fallynge on them, the reſidue, that eſcaped, & wolde haue fledde, beinge amaſed with the ſodeyne chaunce, were ſlayne by the Frenchemen, who beinge armed, beſet tho woode rounde about. There were a few taken, which ſought to goo ouer a brydge, whiche the Frenchemen kepte, but anone they were compaſſed and beſet about with the Frenchemen. There the conſull Poſthumius, who in no wyſe wolde be taken of his ennemyes, manfully and nobly dyed. They brought the ornamentes of his bodye, and his heade, beinge cut from the body, to the chiefe temple in that countrey, with ſyngyng and moche myrthe. They pourged and clenſed the ſkull within and without, and couered the brayne panne ouer with golde, vſynge it to drynke therin, whan they dyd ſacryfice at any ſolemne feaſt: and alſo it ſerued the prieſtes and biſhoppes of the temple, as a cuppe at the ſacrifice. The praye was no leſſe to the Frenchemen thanne the victorye, for although the moſt parte of the cattall was ſlayne, with the fallyng of the trees, yet they loſt nothyng of the ſubſtance that they had about them.
            ¶Whan this ſlaughter was knowen at Rome, the citezens

were in ſuche ſorowe and trouble for a great ſpace, that they ſhutte their wyndowes and ſhoppes, as though it had ben in the nyght: but within ſhort ſpace the ſenatours charged the officers, to go about the citie, and cauſe the ſhoppes and doores to be opened, & to cauſe the citezens to leaue their ſorow.
            ¶Than Titus Sempronius called a ſenate or courte, in the which he exhorted and counſailed the fathers conſcript, that they, whoſe hartes were not ouer come for the great diſtruction and loſſe of the battayle at Cannas, ſhulde not nowe ſuffer them ſelues to be vanquyſhed with this moche leſſe ſorow and calamitie: admonyſſhynge theym, that as concernynge the Carthaginenſes and Anniball, all was (as he truſted it ſhuld be) very well. And as for the warres with the Frenchmen it myght be deferred for a ſeaſon: for at all tymes the reuengynge of theyr harmes was in the power of the goddis and the Romayns. Furthermore he ſhewed theym, that they ought chiefly to counſayle and worke agaynſt Anniball circū
               ſpectly, preparyng with what numbre of men he might be reſiſted, and he fyrſte reaſoned what numbre of footemen and horſemen, of citezens and other theyr frendes of Italy, were in the hoſt of the dictatour. Than Marcellus declared what nūbre was in his army, that he had charge of: And thus after they had ymagyned and decreed, what numbre ſhulde ſatiſfye the two Conſuls hoſtes, they agreed, that the warre agaynſt the Frenchemenne ſhoulde be omytted vntyll an other tyme.
         
         
            ¶Of the victory of the Scipions in Spayne. Cap. xxx.
            
               VVhyles theſe thinges were done and prepared in Italy, the Romayne capytaynes in Spayne were not ydell, but as than had the vpperhande of their ennemies. P. Scipio and C. Scipio his brother parted their army betwixt theym, ſo that Cneius ſhoulde haue the lande, and Publius the ſea, There was great warre in Spayn betwene the Scipions and Haſdruball: but whan it was knowen in Spayne, that Haſdruball ſhuld go with his hoſt into Italy: a great numbre of them turned theyr hartes to the Romans. Wherfore Haſdrubal ſente letters to Carthage, certifieng the Senate, howe dangerous

his departyng out of Spayne ſhuld be: And how that before he were paſſed the ryuer of Iherus, the more part of Spain wold tourne to the Romans. Whiche letters although at the fyrſt they moued the ſenate moche, not withſtandyng bycauſe theyr hole myndes were gyuen toward the charge & buſines of the affaires of Italy, they chāged not their purpoſe, conferryng the ſendyng of Haſdruball into Italye: but in his place they ſent Himilco with an hoſte fournyſſhed to kepe the ſeas and the lande, and alſo the countrey of Spayne: who whan he had all thynge neceſſary prouyded for hym, with as great ſpede as myght be, paſſed the countrey of Spayne, vntyll he came to Haſdruball. And as ſoone as he had ſhewed hym the commaundement of the ſenate, and that Haſdruball had likewyſe informed hym, howe he ſhulde demeane hym ſelfe in the warres of Spayne: he retourned agayne to his tentes with ſpede. But Haſdrubal, er euer he remoued his campe, cauſed taxes of money to be rayſed of all cuntreys that were vnder his obeyſance: knowyng well, that Anniball had bought certayne paſſages of the Frenchemen, and that withoute theyr helpe, the entre into the Alpes or hyghe mountaynes, was harde to be optained. Whan he had gathered greate ſummes of money, he went downe with ſpede to the riuer of Iberus.
            ¶ And whan the purpoſe of the Carthaginenſes, and Haſdrubals iourney was knowen and ſhewed to the Scipions, they ſettyng all other buſynes aparte, with bothe theyr hoſtes togyther, ſet forwarde to mete hym, and prepared to lette his enterpryſe: ſuppoſynge, that yf Haſdruball, being a capitayn and that great newe hoſte of the Carthaginenſes, were ioyned to Anniball (whom alone Italy was ſcarſely able to withſtande) that than the empyre of Rome ſhoulde ſoone be at an ende. Thus they beinge troubled with care of this buſynes, brought theyr hooſte to Iberus. And whan they had paſſed the ryuer, conſultynge longe, whether they ſhoulde pytche theyr campe neere to theyr ennemies, or elles ouerrunne and ſubdue ſome of the Carthaginenſes frendes, therby to ſtaye and prolonge theyr ennemies purpoſed iourney. At laſt they determyned to beſiege the citie, called Ibera (of the water, whiche was nere it) the rycheſt of the countrey at that tyme. Whiche thyng whan Haſdruball knewe, in ſtede of bryngyng ſuccour to his frendes, he wente to beſiege a Citie, that was

lately yelded to the Romans: ſo than the Romans left their liege, and turned the battayle wholly to Haſdruball. There was betwixt the two hoſtes, for the ſpace of certayn dayes, the ſpace of fyue myles, duryng whiche tyme they were not without ſmall ſkyrmyſhyng. At length, as it were pretended of bothe partes, at one tyme bothe the hole hoſtes diſcended into the playne, redy to gyue battaile. The Roman hoſt was diuided into thre partes, part of the footemen were ſette before the ſtanderdes, and part behynd the horſemen, kept the ſydes or wynges. On the other part Haſdruball ſette in the myddell battayle the Spaniardes, and in the right wyng the Carthaginenſes, and in the left winge the Affricans, with the hyred ſtraunge ſowldiours: And he put the Numidians to the footemen of Carthage, the reſidue of the Affricanes he ſette before the wynges: nother dyd he ſette all the Numydians in the ryght wyng, but thoſe, whoſe qualities were ſuche in lyghtnes and nymblenes, that rydyng vpon one horſe, and leadyng a ſpare horſe in theyr handes, whan the one was wery, they wold among the thickeſt of their enemyes leape armed on the other freſhe horſe, theyr agilitie and quycknes was ſo great, and the horſes of kind ſo gentil and wel taught. Thus ſtode they in aray, and litel difference there was, other in the numbre or kyndes of ſouldiours of eyther hoſte. Not withſtandyng the ſouldiours hartes were not like. The Romane capitayns, although they fought farre from home, yet myght they eaſyly perſuade their ſouldiours, that they ſhuld fyght for theyr cuntrey, and for the citie of Rome. Wherfore by that doubtfull battaile they purpoſed, other to ouercome, or to dye, truſting therby to haue ſhort returne home to their cuntrey. The other hooſte hadde not ſo ſterne valiaunt and hardy men. for the more parte of theym were Spanyardes, whiche had rather be ouercome in Spayne, than wynnynge the victory, be conducted into Italy. Therfore at the fyrſte metynge, whan the dartes were ſcarſly throwen, the middell warde fledde, and gaue place to the Romanes: who came vpon them with great violence, not withſtanding the battailes were nothynge leſſe in the wynges, for on the one ſyde the Carthaginenſes, and on the other ſyde the Affricans came on them boldly, and fought egerly. but whan the Romane hoſte had gotten in to the myddell togyther, they were ſtronge ynough

to put away the wynges of theyr ennemies. Wherefore being in numbre and ſtrength beſt, they ſhortly put the other to the worſe. There was a great numbre of men ſlayne, and vnleſſe the Spaniardes had fledde away, ſo thicke before the battayle was begunne, there hadde ſcarſely any of theym remayned vnſlayne. There was no bataile betwene the horſe men. for as ſoone as the Mauritaynes and Numidians ſawe the myddell warde ouercome and putte to flyghte, they dryuynge the elephantes before theym, ſodaynly departed and fledde: leauynge bothe the wynges bare. Haſdruball remainyng tyll the laſt ende of the battaile, fledde with a fewe with hym. That battayle cauſed the hartes of the Spanyardes, whiche doubted before in the frendſhyp of the Romanes, to be wholly gyuen to them. And it dyd not only take the hope from Haſdrubal of leading his hoſte into Italy: but alſo that there was ſcarſe tarieng for hym in Spayne. Which thinges after they were certified to the ſenate at Rome by the Scipions letters, they were not ſo gladde of the victory, as that Haſdrubal and his hoſt were prohibited the entre into Italy.
         
         
            ¶ The oration of the Samnites and the Hirpines to Anniball, deſyrynge his helpe againſt the Romaines, with the order of Marcellus and Anniball about Nola. Cap. xxxi.
            
               VVhyles theſe thynges were done in Spayn, the Romanes ordered theyr buſines wyſely in Italy. Titus Sempronius and Quintus Fabius Maximus were choſen conſuls. Marcellus than laye at Nola, and he made dyuers out runnynges with his armye into the fieldes of the Hirpines and Samnites, and ſo dyſtroyed all with the ſwerde and fyre, that he renued the memorye of the olde diſtruction of Samnium: and than ſtrayght wayes bothe the nations ſente theyr meſſangers to Anniball at ones, who ſpake to hym after this maner.
            ¶ We were (O Anniball) ennemies to the Romayns of our ſelues, as longe as our weapons, our harneys, and ſtrengthe were able to maynteyne vs. Afterwarde whan we had ſmalle hope and truſte in theym, we fell into amitie with Pyrrhus,

of whome we were forſaken, beinge not able to defende vs, we toke truce and peace neceſſary, for that we were vnable to withſtande the Romaynes. And we haue endured in the ſame peace the ſpace of fyfty yeres, vnto thy commyng into Italy. Sens whyche tyme thy onely gentylnes towarde our cytezens (whiche beynge taken, thou ſendeſt to vs agayne) as well as thy vertue and fortune, ſo hathe wonne vs vnto the, that yf thou our frende be ſafe and in good helth, we not only wolde not feare the Romans, but alſo yf it were laufull to be ſpoken, we wold not feare the goddis. But verily not only thou being ſafe and ſounde, but alſo preſent where as thou mayſt alſo beholde our houſes burnynge, and here the waylyng of our wyues and chyldren, we are ſo ſpoyled, and our goodes waſted and dyſtroyed, that it may be thoughte, that Marcus Marcellus hath ouercome at Cannas, and not Anniball: and alſo the Romaynes may reioyce, that thou onely as it were at one battayle, art ſtronge and valyant, and at the next wethered and faynt. we kepte warre with the Romaynes the ſpace of one hundred yeres, beyng ſuccoured by no man, ſauyng that Pyrrhus the ſpace of .ii. yeres, did increaſe his ſtrengthe and power with our men, rather than defende vs by his power. We wylle not reioyſe of our proſperitie, whan we ſubdued .ii. Conſulles with theyr hoſtes at one time and brought them into our ſubiection: but omytting all ſuche proſperous chaunces that we had, we myghte ſhewe thoſe thynges that happed infortunately to vs at that tyme, yf there were any with leſſe ſhame than we maye nowe declare thoſe that be chaunced to vs. There dydde inuade the coſtes of our countreys at that tyme .ii. noble dictatours, the mayſters of horſemen, and two Conſulles, with two conſulles hooſtes, hauynge all thynge prouyded for theym neceſſaryly, or they wolde aduenture to robbe and dyſtroy our countrey. But nowe we be almoſte a praye to one lyttell hoſte, beynge lefte for the ſuccours of Nola. Nowe they beynge but a ſmalle noumbre, after the maner of robbers, ouercome our countreye with leſſe feare, thanne yf they were in the Romayne fieldes. The cauſe is, that nother thou doeſte defende vs, and alſo that all our luſtye yonge and valyaunt menne, whiche without doubt, yf they were at home, wolde

defende vs, are with the, and vnder thy baner: neyther had we knowen the, nor thyne hoſte, hadde not it happed, that through thy myght there were ſoo many Romans ſlayne and put to flyght, to whome we may ſuppoſe it but a lyght thyng to ſuppreſſe our robbers, ronyng abrode in the fieldes without order, runnyng whyther as foolyſſhe and vayne hope of a pray dothe leade theym, whome a fewe of thy Numidians wolde vtterly confounde. And I doubte not, but thou wylte ſende vs ſome ſure helpe and ſuccour, excepte thou iudge vs vnworthy to be defended and holpen, whan heretofore thou thoughteſt vs not vnworthy to be taken as thy frendes and companyons, receyuyng vs into thy amitie and frendſhyppe. ¶ To this theyr lamentable oration Anniball anſwered, that the Hirpines and Samnites dyd ſhewe their ruine and loſſe, requyryng helpe therein, and alſo dyd complayne, that they were lefte withoute ſuccour and vnholpen, and all at ones: where as they ſhulde fyrſt haue ſhewed theyr cauſe, aſkynge ſuccour in theyr myſchiefe, and afterwarde, yf they coulde not haue healpe, than to complayne, that theyr ſuite was in vayne. Neuer the leſſe he promiſed them ſuccours and helpe, not that his army ſhuld come into any of theyr groundes, but that he wolde inuade theyr neyghbours, whiche were frendes to the Romaines: wherby he ſhulde drawe the Romans from vexyng of them, makyng them gladde to defende theyr frendes. And as concernyng the warre betwene him and the Romaynes, yf the battayle at Traſimenus were nobler than that of Trebia, and the battayle at Cannas more noble than that of Traſimenus: he wolde make the fame and memorye of the victory at Cannas, but obſcure and nothyng to be eſtemed, in compariſon of a more noble and triumphant victorye, that he truſted to haue of them. With this anſwere and great rewardes he ſent them home: and leauyng a lyttell company at Tiſatis, he toke his iourney to Nola. At the ſame tyme Hanno came to hym from the Bruſians, with ſtuffe ſent from Carthage, and with elephantes.
            ¶ Whan Anniball had pytched his tentes, not farre frome Nola, he founde all thynges otherwyſe than it was ſhewed hym by the legates of the Samnites. For Marcellus ſo ruled hym ſelfe euer and all his men, that he cōmitted nothinge to fortune, nother left any thyng raſſhely in daunger of his

ennemyes: for whan he went about any ſpoyle of the countrey, or to gette any pray, he dyd it as prouidently, as though he ſhuld haue done it, Anniball beinge preſent. And whan he perceiued Anniball to become: he kept his hoſte within the citie. Whervpon Hanno approched nygh vnto the wall, callynge furthe Herennius Baſſus and Herius Petreius, who by the lycence of Marcellus went furthe to talke with hym. Than vnto them by an interpretour he beganne to extoll the vertue and fortune of Anniball, and diſpiſed the nobilitie of the Romans, which (he ſayd) decayed togyther with theyr power and ſtrength: whyche nobilitie and power yf it were lyke as it was in olde tyme, not withſtandyng knowynge the harde and cruell empire and gouernance of the Romans, and the great gentylnes of Anniball towardes all the captiues of Italy, the frendſhip and amitie of the Carthaginēſes was to be preferred before the amitie of the Romans. And yf both the Conſuls with theyr hooſtes were at Nola, they were no more to be cōpared to Anniball, than they were at the battell of Cannas: moche leſſe one pretor with a fewe new & vnſkilled ſouldiours, was able to defende Nola. And that they rather than Anniball, oughte to care, after what maner Nola ſhuld come to Anniballes poſſeſſion: other taken by violēce, or yelded. for there was no remedy but haue it he wold, as he had Capua and Nuceria. He ſayd further, that he wolde not diuine, what ſhuld happen to the citie being taken, but durſte rather promyſe and vndertake, that if they wold yelde Marcellus and the citie to Anniball, that no man, but they theym ſelues, ſhulde preſcribe the bandes and lawes of the frendeſhyp that ſhulde be betwene them.
            ¶ Whervnto Herennius Baſſus aunſwered: that the amitie betwene the Romanes and the Nolanes had continued many yeres, of the whiche nother of them dyd forthynke. He ſaid furthermore, that if they ſhuld haue changed or broken their faithes, whan theyr fortune fayled or chaunged, that nowe it were to late to chaunge: for that other chaunged a long time agone: And that it had ben foly for them to haue ſought ſuccour of the Romaynes if they had bene mynded to haue yelded the towne to Anniball. Wherfore theyr myndes were, that with thoſe, whiche came to theyr ſuccours, they were in all thynges ioyned and ſurely knitte togither, and to the deth

ſhulde be. Whiche anſwere toke from Anniball the hope of optayuynge the citie without battayle: Wherfore he beſette the citie rounde about, intendynge to gyue aſſaulte thervnto on all partes.
            ¶ So ſoone as Marcellus ſawe that hys ennemies approched the walles, he ordered his hooſte wyſely within the walles, and than ſodeynly iſſued out to batayle, makyng great noyſe. Some at the fyrſte encountrynge were dryuen backe and ſlayne: but whan the armies ioyned togyther, the battayle beganne to be very fierſe on bothe partes: And no faile it had bena ſoore ſyght, had not a huge tempeſt and raine departed theym: wherby hauynge bothe egre myndes, the one was dryuen into the towne, and the other to his campe or tentes, and lyttell hurt done, where (beynge bothe deſyrous of battayle) they abode all the next daye, ſo great was the violence of the ſtorme. The thyrde day Anniball ſent parte of his ſouldiours, to robbe and ſpoyle the fieldes: which whan Marcellus knewe, he ſtreight ways brought his hoſte furth to the battayle, and Anniball on the other ſyde was nothinge behynde. There was almoſte a myle betwene the towne and the campe, where the two hoſtes mette togyther. The crye that was rayſed on bothe partes cauſed the companye to returne to battayle, which were before ſent a ſpoyling, and the Nolans with their power were ready to increaſe the Romanes hoſte: whome Marcellus (greatly prayſynge for theyr good wylles and courage) commaunded to ſtande in aray redy to theyr ſuccour, and to conuey them, which were wounded, out of the battayle. And that they ſhoulde in no wyſe fyghte, vntylle he commaunded theym. The battayle was ſtronge, the ſowldiours fought with all theyr myghtes, and lykewyſe the Capytaynes prouoked theym to the ſame.
            Marcellus badde them boldely withſtande thoſe that were ouercomme not thre dayes before, and that not longe agone fledde from Cuma as vacabundes, and the yere before were dryuen from Nola, he beynge capytayne. And to comforte theym the more, he ſayde, that all theyr enemyes were not in battayle: ſome were a rouynge in the fieldes, and thoſe that fought in battayle, were wethered with the pleaſure of Capua, with wyne and hauntynge of harlottes. And that the

ſtrengthes, courage, and myghte of theyr bodyes and hartes, by the whyche they paſſed the greatte mountaynes called Alpes, and the hylles of Pyrenes, was cleane goone. He ſayde alſoo, that thoſe were the leauynges of the foreſayde ſowldyoures, ſcarſe able to beare and ſuſteyne theyr owne membres and harneys, ſhewynge, that Capua was as hurtfull and diſpleaſaunt vnto Anniball and his menne, as Cannas was to the Romaones. for there (ſayde he) they haue lefte all theyr ſtrongthe, vertue, and good feates of warre, yea and haue lefte there not onely all theyr glorye and fame of the tyme paſt, but alſo hoope of victorye in tyme to come.
         
         
            ¶ The exhortation of Anniball to his ſowldiours, the batayle betweene hym and Marcellus, and the victories of the Scipions in Spayne. Capitulo. xxxii.
            
               ANd whan Marcellus with ſuche wordes to his ennemies reproche had incouraged his ſowldiours, Anniball lykewyſe with no leſſe rebuke and blame to the Romanes called on his men, ſayinge, that he knewe theym to haue the ſame armour and ſtanderdes, whyche they hadde at Trebia, Traſymenus, and at Cannas: what meaneth it nowe (ſaythe he) that ye ſcarſely are able to withſtande one legate Romayne, and the battayle of one legyon or wynge: where two Conſulles hooſtes were neuer able to withſtande you? Shall Marcellus with his newe and vntaught ſouldyours, and the ſuccours of Nola yet agayne prouoke vs, and we not reuenged vpon them? where are my ſouldyours that drewe Flamminius from his horſe, and ſtrake of his heade? Where is he that ſlewe Lucius Paulus at Cannas? are your ſwerdes blunte? or are youre ryghte handes aſtonyed and wearye? What a monſtrouſe thynge is this? that you, the whyche were wonte, whanne that ye were but a verye fewe in noumbre, in ſhorte ſpace

to ouercome a great meyny, nowe you beinge many, ſuffer a fewe to ſtycke in your handes: you boſted as bolde men with your tongues, that you wold wynne Rome, yf any man wold bryng you thyther. Behold nowe your buſines here is moch leſſe. I wolde ye wolde proue your ſtrength and hardyneſſe here by wynnyng of Nola, a citie of the countrey, ſet in the playne fieldes, beinge compaſſed with nother fludde nor ſea, and than I ſhall other leade or folowe you, beyng laden with ſo ryche a pray, to what place ſo euer you wyll.
            ¶ Notwithſtandyng, neyther theſe reproches, nor his entiſynges coulde preuayle to ſtrength theyr hartes: they were beaten backe on all ſydes. The hartes of the Romanes dyd encreaſe, not onely by theyr capytaynes exhortinges, but alſo by the Nolanes ſteryng and kyndlyng theyr courage to batayle. At length the Carthaginenſes fledde, and were dryuen backe to their tentes. And Marcellus brought his ſouldiours to Nola with great ioye and thankes of the people, whoſe hartes before were moſt inclined to the Carthaginenſes. There were ſlayne that day aboue a. M. of theyr ennemies, and one thouſande .vi. C. taken, of ſtanderdes and baners .xx. and .iiii. elephantes ſlayne in the battayle: There were not a. M. Romanes ſlayne. The nexte daye truce was taken, whyche they ſpente in buryinge the deade bodyes. Marcellus made oblation to Vulcan with the ſpoyle of his ennemies. within thre dayes after, eyther for diſpleaſure, or hope of more wages. M. ii. C. lxxii. of Numidian horſmen and Spanyardes fledde from Anniball to Marcellus, whoſe faithfull ſtronge helpe and aide the Romanes vſed in that bataile often tymes after. Than Anniball ſent Hanno agayne to the Bruſians, with the hoſte which he brought before with hym from thens: and went hym ſelfe for the wynter to Apulia, and lay about Arpos.
            ¶ So ſoone as Quintus Fabius harde, that Anniball was gone to Apulia, and that he had brought corne as moche as he thought neceſſary to ſerue them for the winter, from Nola and Naples to the campe at Sueſſula, leauyng a ſufficiente garry ſon there, he moued his campe nygh vnto Capua, burnyng and ſpoylyng theyr fieldes: ſo that they of Capua were conſtrayned) truſtyng lyttel to theyr owne ſtrength) to come out of the citie, and encampe them ſelues before the walles,

fortifyeng them with munimentes without the gates. They had .vi. M. ſouldiours armed, they coulde better ſkylle on horſebacke than on foote. Wherfore the horſemen euer prouoked theyr enemies by ſkyrmyſhyng. Soone after Quintus Fabius the conſull remoued his tentes backe from the Campanes, that they myght tyll and ſowe theyr grounde; nother dyd he come thyther agayne to diſtroye any of the fieldes of the Campanes, before the new corne was come vp of a good height, and able to be fother for theyr cattall. Than he came thyther agayne, and cauſed it to be gathered and broughte to Claudius tentes aboue Sucſſula, where he prouided for the wynter, cōmaundynge Marcus Claudius, that he leauynge a neceſſary garriſon at Nola for the defence therof, ſhuld ſend the reſidue of the ſowldyours to Rome, leſte that they ſhuld be bothe a charge to theyr frendes, and a coſte to the common wealthe.
            ¶ In the ende of ſommer, whan all theſe thinges were done, came letters from the Scipions, what great and proſperous actes they had done in Spayne: but all theyr money grayne and clothynge for theyr ſouldiours, and ſea men was ſpente. Whiche beinge pondered in the Senate, all thynges neceſſarye were ordeyned and ſente to them. And whan theſe ſtipendes and neceſſaries were come into Spayn, the towne of Illiturgus was beſieged of Haſdruball Mago and Amilcar, the ſonne of Bomilcar, for angre that they had changed their hartes, and yelded them to the Romans. Neuertheleſſe thorough all theſe thre hoſtes the Scipions valiantly entred into the towne of theyr frendes, not without greate fyght and ſlaughter, bryngynge with theym of grayne good plentye, wherof they had great nede there, exhorting the citezens ſo valiantly to kepe and defende theyr towne, as they perceiued the Romaynes to fyght for them. Sone after they iſſued out to aſſayle the great campe, wherof Haſdruball was capitayn. Thyther came to his ſuccours the other two capitaynes of the Carthaginenſes with theyr two hooſtes, for there they knewe well ſhulde be the greatteſt battaile and moſt buſynes. And than ſodeynly runnyng out of theyr tentes, they mette togyther and fought. There were of the Carthaginenſes at that battayle .lx. M. And of the Romaynes aboute .xvi. M. neuertheleſſe the battayle was ſoo proſperous, that the Romanes

            ¶ Marcus Aemilius is one of the ſacred prieſtes, whom we can not ſende from the ſacrifice, but we ſhall want the ſeruice due and accuſtomed to the goddis. And you Octacilius haue maryed my ſyſters doughter, and haue chyldren by her: Neuertheleſſe your merytes and deſertes towardes me and my frendes are not ſuche, but that I haue more reſpecte to the common welthe than to my priuate buſynes. Euery maryner can in caulme wether rule the ſhyppe, but whan the ſharpe ſtormes aryſe, the ſea beyng troubled, and the ſhyppe toſſed with the wynde: Than is there nede of a man, and a gouernour. We ſayle not now quietly, but are with troublous ſtormes almoſt drowned. Therfore we muſt prouyde with great diligence, who ſhal gouerne the ſterne or helme: yea we muſt therof take hede before. We haue proued thy diligence T. Octacilius in leſſer buſynes, wherin truely thou dyddeſt not deſerue, that we ſhulde committe to the any greatter charge: For thre cauſes we ſent furthe a nauy the laſte yere, of which thou were gouernour. Fyrſt that the border of Affrica ſhuld haue bene waſted and diſtroyed: Seconde that the hauens or ſtrondes of Italy ſhulde haue ben kepte ſafe for vs: And before all thynges that no ſuccour, ſtypende or other neceſſaries, beinge ſent from Carthage to Anniball, ſhulde haue free paſſage. I am content that ye make T. Octacilius conſull, yf he can proue, that he dyd performe to the common welth any of theſe thynges to hym cōmytted. But yf thou being capytayn of the nauy, all that was ſent from Carthage to Anniball had as free paſſage, as though the ſea had bene open: And if the borders of Italy this yere were more indaungered than the borders of Affrica: what canſt thou alledge for thy ſelfe, that thou ſhuldeſt be choſen chiefe capytayne agaynſt Anniball? it appertayneth to no man more than to the T. Octacilius, to take heede that ſuche a burthen be not layde on thy necke, the weyght wherof wyll peiſe the downe. I do admonyſhe and perſwade you all, that in choſynge your conſuls at

this tyme, ye vſe the ſame circumſpection, that ye wolde vſe, yf ye were dryuen to choſe twayne to gouerne your bataile, whan ye beinge in harneys on the playne againſte your ennemies, were redy to fyght with theym. Traſymenus, and the example of Cannas, are very ſorowfull to be remembred: but they are ryght profytable, and a good document, to be ware of ſuche an other.
            ¶ After this oration, the prerogatiue of the yonge men was called in agayne: And than wente they to a newe election: in the which Quintus Fabius hym ſelfe was created the fourth tyme conſul: and Marcus Marcellus the thyrd time. Theſe were created without any variance: Nother did any man ſuſpect Quintus Fabius of couetouſnes of rule and gouernāce: but rather they praiſed the noblenes and courage of his hart. For that whan he ſawe, that the common welthe dyd want a good capytayne, and knewe hym ſelfe withoute doubte to be one: eſtemed the enuy, that he ſhulde haue (yf any ſhulde aryſe of that matter) leſſe than the profyt of the cōmon welth.
            ¶ Whan all thynges were ordeyned with great care and dyligence for the warres in all partes, the Campanes meruaylyng of the great and exquiſite ordynance of the Romanes, whiche was moche greatter than it was wonte to be, and fearyng greatly, leſte they wold that yere begynne warre vpon theym: they ſent legates to Anniball incontinent, deſyrynge hym to moue his army to Capua, ſhewyng hym, that the Romanes hoſte was choſen and proſcribed to beſiege Capua, for that the defection of them was more diſpleſantly taken of the Romanes, than of any citie in Italy. And bycauſe the matter was ſo fearefully pronounced vnto hym, he made the greater ſpede to come thyther before the Romans. Whan he hadde bene there a ſeaſon, he lefte certayne of the Numidians and Spanyardes to defende the citie, and wente hym ſelfe to the lake of Auernus, vnder the colour to make ſacrifyce. Not withſtandyng his pretence was to ſet on Puteolus, and them that were left there in garryſon.
            ¶ Whan Fabius Maximus hearde, that Anniball was gone from Arpos, and tourned agayne to Campania, without reſtyng nyght or day, he went to the heſt, and cauſed T. Gracchus to remoue frome Luceria to Beneuentum, and made Quintus Fabius his ſonne to abyde in his place at Luceria:

and hym ſelfe came to Caſſilinum, intendyng to beſiege it, and the Carthaginenſes that were therein. The ſame tyme (as it were a thynge appoynted) Hanno came from the Bruſianes with a great hoſt of horſmen and fotemen, to Beneuentū: but it chanced ſo, that Titus Gracchus came from Luceria thyther ſomwhat before hym, and entred the towne. And whan he hearde, that Hanno had pitched his tentes .iii. miles from the towne, at a water called Calor, and waſted the countrey, he went hym ſelfe out of the towne, and pytched his tentes a myle from his ennemy, and there he had an aſſemble of ſouldiours, wherof the moſte part were of bondemen, that had bene in the warre the yere before. Theſe bondemen thought by theyr deſertes to be made free, before they wold deſyre it openly: not withſtandyng he perceyued a murmure of ſome ofthem, complaynyng and ſayinge: Shall we neuer be free, and do battaile like free ſouldiours and citezens: Wherof he wrote letters to the ſenate, as well of their deſyre, as of their deſeruyng, ſayinge, that he had euer vnto that day had theyr good faithful and ſtrong helpe, and that they wanted nothing that belonged to good and iuſt ſouldiours, ſauing liberty. Cō
               cerning that matter it was permitted vnto him, to do that whiche he ſhuld thinke mete for the profite of the cōmon welth. Whervpon before he wold do battaile with his aduerſarye, he ſhewed his men, that the tyme was come, in whiche they might opteyne theyr libertie, that they ſo longe deſyred and hoped after. for the nexte day they ſhuld fyght in a fayre and playne fielde, where the battayle ſhulde be done without any feare of diſceyte, with cleane ſtrengthe and hardynes, and he that then wold ſhewe the head of one of his ennemies, ſtryken of in battaile, ſhuld ſtreight way be made free: and he that fledde, ſhuld be puniſhed with vile ſeruitude for euer. Wherfore nowe (ſayde he) euery mans fortune lyeth in his owne handes. For the confirmation of whiche his wordes, he ſaid, that he alone was not the auctour of theyr lybertie: but that Marcus Marcellus the conſull, and the fathers conſcripte were agreable to the ſame. And thereof he had ſente hym theyr letters, whiche he ſhewed and red vnto them. At theſe his wordes there aroſe a great noyſe amonge them, deſyryng battaylle incontynent, yf it myghte ſoo pleaſe hym. Than Gracchus lette the Conuocation paſſe, and appoynted the

battayle agaynſte the nexte daye. The ſouldyours were verye gladde, and in eſpeciall thoſe, whyche ſuppoſed theyr wages for one day to be perpetuall libertie.

               THe nexte daye, whan the trumpettes blewe to battayle, they came togyther in good araye, and anone vppon the ſonne ryſynge Gracchus broughte his ſowldyours in to battayle. And theyr ennemyes made no taryeng for theyr part. There were of them xvii. thouſande footemen, and one .M. ii. hundred horſemen, the battayle was very ſharpe, and laſted iiii. howres, not knowynge whiche ſhulde haue the victorye. There was nothynge troubled the Romanes more, than the heades of theyr ennemyes, whyche Gracchus had appoynted to be the pryce of theyr libertie. Wherfore euer as they had ſtryken downe any of theyr ennemies, they wolde ſtrike of his heade, and beare it in theyr handes in ſtede of weapon. Whyche thynge Gracchus apperceyuynge, commaunded, that euery man ſhulde leaue the head that he had in his hand, and take his weapon and fyghte. Than the battayle beganne more fierce than before, the capitaines on bothe partes exhortynge theyr men to fyghte. Gracchus ſhewed his people, that yf theyr ennemyes were not that daye put to vtterance, they ſhoulde neuer loke for theyr libertie. Whan the ſouldyours hearde hym ſaye ſo, theyr hartes were ſo kyndled, that they ranne freſſhe vppon theyr ennemyes with ſoo greatte vyolence, that they were not able to ſuſtayne theyr myghte and courage, but incontynent fledde towarde theyr campe. The Romaynes folowyng and purſuyng them, made a greatter ſlaughter in the flyght, than they dydde before in the battayle. There eſcaped not of the hole hoſte, aboue .ii. M. whiche fledde with theyr capitayne away, the moſt parte were horſemen, all the reſydue were other ſlayne or taken. There were not ſlayne of the Romayns paſſynge two thouſande. Whanne they were retourned in to theyr tentes,

loden with theyr great pray .iiii. 
                  •
               . of the bondmen, which had done euyll their deuoyre that day in battayle, had gotten a lyttell hyll not farre from the tentes, who were fetched agayne the day folowyng by the Tribunes, and came to the conuocation or courte holden by Gracchus to the ſouldyours: wherin he rewarded the old ſouldiours as he thought euery one had deſerued. Than as concernyng the bondemen he ſayd, that he had rather, that bothe worthy and vnworthy ſhulde that tyme be prayſed of hym than punyſſhed: Neuertheleſſe, bycauſe it had chaunced well to the commune welth and to them, he commaunded that all ſhulde be free, at which commaundement all at ones thankynge him, deſyred all welth to the Romaynes and to hym. Than ſayd Gracchus: Nowe haue I fully performed my promyſe of libertie to you all vniuerſally: neuertheleſſe to thentent it may be knowen, that I wyll put difference betwene well doing and euyll doinge, betwene vertuous courage, and cowardneſſe, I wylle that ye brynge me the names of all thoſe, whiche departed from the fielde the day before. That doone, he cauſed theym all to be ſworne, that none of them ſhulde other eate or drinke otherwyſe than ſtandynge (onleſſe they were diſeaſed) ſo longe as they ſeryed in the warres. This punyſhement (ſayde he) ye ſhall paciently take, yf ye conſyder with your ſelues, that I could not haue noted you with a leſſe marke for your cowardyſe than that is. Than commaunded he theym to truſſe vp theyr ſtuffe: whiche done, the ſouldyours with great prayſe came to Beneuentum, not lyke men that came from batayle: but as mery as though they had come from a bankette. The citezens receyued them meruaylous thankfully, and deſyred Gracchus, that he wolde ſuffer the ſouldyours to feaſt with them, whiche he graunted.
            ¶ Whyles theſe thynges were done at Beneuentum, Hanniball waſtynge the fieldes of the Neapolitanes, moued his tentes to Nola. Which whan the conſull Marcellus perceiued: he ſent for Pomponius the pretor to mete him, with the hoſtes that lay at Sueſſula, intendyng that they bothe togyther, wolde meete hym, and he ſente Claudius Nero with a ſtronge company of horſemen out of the towne by nyght, to compaſſe Anniball on the other ſyde, commandyng hym, that whan he ſawe the battayle was begunne, he ſhulde ſette vpon

his ennemies at theyr backes. Whiche his diuiſe Nero could not brynge to paſſe, eyther bicauſe he knewe not the cumberſome wayes of the countrey, or els for that the ſhortenes of the tyme wolde not ſuffer hym. Marcellus in the mornynge mette with his ennemies, and gaue them batayle: in the whiche he had the victory, and cauſed his enemies to flee. neuertheleſſe he durſte not folowe theym, bycauſe he wanted his horſeman. Wherfore he cauſed his menne to recule. There were .ii. thouſande of their ennemies ſlayne, and not .iiii. hundred of the Romanes. Nero and the horſemen, labouryng in vayne the nyght and the day, without ſeing his enemies, came home about the ſonne ſette. for whiche his vayne iourney, he was ſore rebuked of the conſull, ſaying, that he was the cauſe as than, that theyr ennemies had not receiued as great loſſe, as they gaue at Cannas. The next day the Romans diſcēded into the fieldes, but Anniball kepte hym in his tentes, knowlegyng hym ſelfe to be ouercome. And the thyrde day, without hope of optaynyng Nola, truſtyng to haue better ſpede, remoued to Tarentum.
            ¶ Quintus Fabius, the other conſull, had his tentes at Caſſilinum, whiche was kept with .ii. M. of the Campanes, and vii .C. of Anniballes ſouldiours. He cauſed Marcellus to come to hym with his hoſte, And if that the Nolans thought them ſelfes not ſafe from Annibal, that they ſhuld ſend to Beneuentū to Gracchus, to com to theyr ſuccours. which thing done, Caſſilinum was quyckely won, and the ſouldiours that were there, as well of Annibals as of Capua, were taken, and ſente to Rome, and there put in pryſon. There were taken by Fabius at that time many cities in Italy, and in them to the numbre of .xxv. M. of Anniballes ſouldiours and frendes taken and ſlayne, beſide .iii. C. lxx. vacabundes and runawayes, whyche were taken and ſente to Rome, and there whypped with roddes, and after put to death.
         
         
            ¶ The cities of Sagūt in Spayn, and Arpos in Italy at wonne by the Romains, kynge Siphax is become frende to the Romans, & is ouercom in batail by Maſſaniſſa. Ca xxxv.
            THere were the ſame yere in Spayne many batailes betwene Mago, and Haſdruball the capitaynes of Carthage,

and the Scipions. for before the Romane capitaynes coulde paſſe the ryuer of Iberus, Mago and Haſdrubal had ſlayne a great numbre of Spaniardes, frendes to the Romanes, and had opteyned the vtter part of Spayn, had not the Scipions come in tyme: whoſe commynge ſtayed the waueryng myndes of many of that countrey. And there was betwixte the two capitaines great and many batailes foughten, in the whiche the Romaynes had always the vpperhand: and in ſundry batayles ſlewe great armyes of the Carthaginenſes and theyr frendes, wanne diuers townes and caſtels, brought their enemies to ſo lowe an ebbe, that of a longe ſeaſon they were glad to reſt, doing no act worth memory. Than the Romane capytaines, remembryng that the citie of Sagunt had ben ſo long oppreſſed with the yoke of dominion of the Carthaginenſes, they remoued theyr hooſte thyther, and wanne the citie agayne, whyche they reſtored to the olde inhabitantes therof, that were lefte on lyue. Than they inuaded the Turditans, who were the fyrſt cauſers of the warre with the Carthaginenſes, whom they wan ſhortly, and diſtroyed their cities. Theſe dedes were done in Spayne, Quintus Fabius Maximus, and Marcus Claudius Marcellus being conſuls. Thā the officers for the yere to come, were choſen at Rome: where Quintus Fabius the yonger, ſonne to the olde Conſull, was choſen one of the conſuls: and Titus Sempronius Gracchus the other: Than all the other officers in order. Whan to euery capitayne was aſſigned his hoſte and warde: the warres agaynſt Anniball were cōmytted to the conſuls: Sempronius went to the Lucanes, and Fabius to Apulia. The father went as legate to the ſonne, to ſhewe hym of the mynd of the ſenate. This yong Fabius lay than at the campe aboue Sueſſula: who hearynge that his father was come to hym as imbaſſadour from the ſenate, came furth to mete hym in his royall aſtate, with his .xii. ſergeantes before hym: but xi. of his ſergeantes, beholdyng the maieſty of olde Fabius, as he came rydyng, paſſed by, and nothyng ſayd to him. Than the ſonne being conſull, commanded the .xii. ſergeant to take hede to his office. He alſo with a lowde voyce commaunded his father to deſcende from his horſe. Than incontinent his father alyghted, and ſayde: I dyd this ſonne, onely to proue whyther thou dyddeſt knowe, that thou arte Conſull or not.

and ſo proceded furthe with hym, declarynge as was gyuen hym in charge.
            ¶ Soone after came to the ſame conſull into the campe oone Claſſius Altinius with his thre ſergeantes, from the towne of Arpos, promiſing for a good reward to delyuer to him Arpos. This matter was debated among the counſell, and by the more part agreed, that this Altinius ſhulde be ſcourged and ſlayne, as an inconſtant traytour and common enemye, conſyderyng that fyrſt he, after the battayle of Cannas, was cauſer of the yeldyng the towne to Anniball, chaungyng his fidelitie as fortune chaunged. And nowe agayn, ſeinge the power of the Romaynes to begin to ryſe in proſperitie, he wold begyn a newe treaſon. Wherfore they thought it not to be ſuffred, but that he ſhuld be ordred as an vntrewe felowe and a vayne ennemye.
            ¶ Agaynſte whyche theyr determynation ſpake olde Q. Fabius, ſayinge, that they oughte to conſyder the peryllous tyme of warre, and ſo to procede, that they loſe none of theyr faythfull frendes by any occaſyon or example that they dyd ſhewe: but by all meanes poſſible, yf any of their frendes were fallen from them, to fynde meane to purchaſe theym agayne. And whan any of them knowledgeth their offences, and deſyreth to returne to their olde amitie: with great gentylnes to receyue them. for in caſe ye wylle admytte it to be more heynous for oure frendes to retourne agayne to vs, than it is for theym to goo frome vs, there is no doubte, but ſhortely we ſhall ſee the moſte parte of our frendes in Italye leaue our frendſhyppe, and alye theym ſelues with Anniball. Neuertheleſſe (ſaythe he) I wylle not aduyſe you to gyue moche faythe to Altinius, but kepyng a good meane, nother repute hym as an ennemye, nor truſte hym as a frende: but that he be ſente to ſomme of youre cyties neere adioynynge, there to be ſafely kepte, tyll the warres be ended: at whyche tyme we may at lengthe conſulte, whether the fyrſte his departyng from vs hath deſerued more punyſhment, than his retourue hathe deſerued pardon. This his aduyſe toke place. He was ſente with his companye to Cales. And the Conſull determyned, to beſiege Arpos. Wherfore folowing his purpoſe, he pitched his campe within a myle of the towne

where he myghte viewe the towne, and there perceyued on the one parte therof, whiche was leſte vſed, a lowe gate and a narowe. To this gate he appoynted certayn good capitaynes, and .vi. C. actiue ſouldiours, to beare ſcalyng ladders about .iii. of the clocke in the mornyng before day, cōmandynge them, firſt to aſſay to ſcale that towre: whiche doone, than on the inner part to breke downe the walles or the gate, and being maſters of part of the towne, by the ſowne of a horne, to gyue hym knowlege, wherby he with the reſte of his hooſte might approche to theyr ſuccour. This his deuiſe with ſpede was executed. And the chaunce was ſuche, that one thynge, whiche was thought wolde be a greate let of theyr purpoſe, beſt holpe them, and diſceyued their ennemies: whiche was, that about the myddes of the nyghte, there felle ſo great abundāce of raine, with ſo vehement a ſtorme, that the watche men were of force driuen, leauyng their appoynted places on the walles, to deſcende and entre into theyr howſes: where abydyng a good ſeaſon, they fell on ſlepe. In this whyle had the Romans ſcaled the walles, and were beſye to breake vp the gates. Whoſe noyſe was not hearde of the watchemen: ſo rude was the ſtorme, and ſuche noiſe made the huge rayne. Than blewe they hornes, at whoſe ſownde the conſull drewe nere, and about the breake of the day entred the citie by the broken gate. Than was theyr entre diſcried. There was of Anniballes men in that towne .v. M. ſouldiours, the towne alſo had armed .iii. thouſande men, whyche townes men the Carthaginenſes cauſed to go in the front of the battaile, myſtruſtynge to haue them behynde at their backes. After a littell ſkyrmyſhyng in the ſtretes, dyuers of the townes men of Arpos, and certayne of the Romanes, whyche were before of acquayntaunce, beganne to common and talke togyther. Fyrſt ſpake the Romans, & ſayd: O ye men of Arpos, what do ye meane, to take part with theſe barbarous nation againſt your own cuntrey men? Wherin haue the Romans offended you? or what haue the Carthaginenſes deſerued vnto you, that ye ſhuld thus trauail to make Italy ſubiect & tributary to Affrica? The Arpins excuſed them ſelues, ſaying, that they were betrayed & ſold by their captains to the Carthaginēſis, & almoſt vtterly diſtroyed. Theyr communication ſtayed the fyghtyng. And after a certayn ſpace, the pretor or gouernour

of the towne was brought by his men to the conſull: Where they ſo well agreed, that incontinente the Arpines toke the part of the Romans againſt the Carthaginenſes. There were alſo in the towne about a thouſande Spanyardes, who all in lykewyſe tourned to the Romanes: but fyrſt they opteyned of the Conſul; that the garriſon of the Carthaginenſes might freely depart the towne, to go at their liberty: Whiche was truely performed. They departed to Salapia, where Annibal was, and the towne incontinent was deliuered to the Romanes, without loſſe of any of theyr army.
            ¶ The Scipions in this ſpace had broughte theyr buſyneſſe proſperouſly to paſſe in Spayne, bothe in conſeruyng theyr olde frendes, and gettynge of newe: beſydes this ſodeynly they had comforte to do good in Affrica, by the reaſone of one Syphax a kyng of Numidia, who as thā was become an ennemy to the Carthaginenſes. To this kynge were ſent .iii. legates, that ſhuld bring him in amitie with the Romans, and alſo cauſe him to make warre vpon the Carthaginenſes. This meſſage was alſo very acceptable to Syphax. Whervpon he reaſoned with the legates, that were expert men of warre, and perceyued many thynges, wherin he and his men before were ignorant. Wherfore whan they wolde haue departed, he intreated them, that two of them wold retourne home to theyr capitaynes, to deſyre a ſure aliaunce betwene hym and the Romanes, and to aſcertayne them of his full mynde: and that the thyrde of them myght remayne ſtyll with hym, to be gouernour of his army, ſaying that his men were good horſe men, but they were nothynge ſkylfull to fyght on foote. To this his requeſt they agreed, and departed, takyng the kynges othe and promyſe, that in caſe theyr capitayns wold not agree therto: that incontinent theyr felowe, whiche was left behynd, ſhuld be ſent home to them agayn. The name of hym that remayned with kyng Syphax, was Statorius, who anon choſe out a greate numbre of yonge and actyue men, whome he taught to folowe theyr baners, and to kepe theyr aray after the Romayne facion: So that in ſhorte ſpace, Syphax thought hym ſelfe able, bothe on horſebacke and on foote, to gyue battayle to the Carthaginenſes. Thus was there a ſafe bande of peace and amytie betweene the Romaynes and Syphax.
            
               
¶ Whan the Carthaginenſes were ware therof, they ſent incontinent meſſangers to one Gala, kyng of the other part of Numidia. This Gala had a ſonne of .xvii. yeres of age, a noble and wyſe yongman, called Maſſaniſſa. The imbaſſadours ſhewed the king, that better it were for him, with theyr helpe to ouercome Syphax betyme: than by his meanes the Romans ſhuld haue any entre into Affrica.
            ¶ With ſuche wordes, they perſwaded Gala to the warre: and moche the ſooner, for that Maſſaniſſa his ſonne deſyred to be gouernour of that army. Whervppon the army of the Carthaginenſes was ioyned to Maſſaniſſa his army. And at the fyrſte battayle Syphax was ouercome, and .xxx. M. of his men ſlayne: ſo that with a fewe horſemen he fledde to the Mauritaynes, that inhabyted nygh the Gades or pyllars of Hercules, where he gathered a newe army of men, thinkyng to ſayle ouer into Spayne: but er euer he could take the water, Maſſaniſſa, with his armye, camme agayne on hym, and without the helpe of the Carthaginenſes, fought a noble batayle with hym, and ouercame hym.
         
         
            ¶ Anniball through the treaſon of Nico and Philomenes, wynneth the citie of Tarent. Cap. xxxvi.
            
               ANniball this ſeaſon euer hauing hope, that the citie of Tarent ſhuld, by one meane or other, be wōne, as is before ſayd, made his abode not farre from that citie. And to bring his opinion to his purpoſe, there happed a fortunate chāce by the meanes of oone Phileas a Tarentine, who longe tyme had taryed at Rome, as a meſſanger of the Tarentines. There were than at Rome dyuers pledges of the noble bludde of Tarent, kept in gentyl kepyng. To theſe pledges this Phileas foūd the mean to haue often recours, and at length he ſo corrupted the kepers, that they ſuffered them to depart out of the citie in the begynning of the nyghti and Phileas went with them to guide them by ſecrete ways. In the morning yarly the fame of the pledges departing was ſprede abrode through the citie, and a great numbre purſued thē with ſpede: ſo that before they had far trauailed, they ouertoke them, & brought them all backe agayn into the citie:

Where for theyr offences, iudgement was gyuen, that they ſhuld be firſt ſcourged with roddes naked, and than brought to a hygh rocke: from the toppe wherof they ſhulde be throwen downe to the grounde.
            ¶ This cruell ende of thoſe nobles offended moch the mindes of dyuers cities in Italy and Grece, ſpecially thoſe that were of kynne or by amitie alyed to any of theym that were ſlayne: among whiche ſort .xiii. of the nobles of Tarent conſpired agaynſt the Romans, of whom the captayns and chief were Nico and Philomenes. They were great hunters, and vſed moche to iſſue out of the citie in the nyght to go on huntyng. Wherfore by the colour of goinge on huntynge, they went towarde the army of Anniball, intendyng to ſpeke with him, and to declare vnto him theyr intentes. Whā they came nere the campe, they two leauyng theyr company in a wodde nere adioynyng, wente to the campe: and anone were taken of the watchemen, and brought to Anniball, as theyr requeſt was: to whom they declared theyr purpoſe and good wylle. And he gaue theym greate thankes, and ſente theym hoome agayne looded with fayre promyſes. And to couer the better theyr deuyſe, he wylled them to dryue with them certayn cattalle of the Carthaginenſes, ſayinge, they hadde gotten that praye of theyr ennemyes: whyche they were ſuffered to doo without reſyſtence: and brought them home to Tarent with ioye. This vſed they to do oftentymes: ſo that it was thoughte meruayle, that they ſoo often enterpryſed ſuche feates, and euer eſcaped vnſlayne. Thus often they vſed, and euer whan they kylled any venyſon, or brought any praye from the Carthaginenſes (whyche they were ſuffered to do at all tymes at theyr pleaſures) they eyther gaue it to the capytayne of the citie, a Romayne, or elles to the porter of the gates: ſoo that they had brought the porter in ſuche a cuſtome, that whan ſoo euer Philomenes dyd but whiſtell, at all tymes of the nyghte, the gates were opened vnto hym.
            ¶ Whan they had brought all thynges in this good caſe for their purpoſe, they wente to Anniball, and agreed with hym on this couenaunt, that the Tarentines ſhulde lyue euer vnder their owne lawes and cuſtomes. Alſo that they ſhoulde paye hym noo Trybute, nor haue anye armye appoynted

by Anniball to kepe the citie, but at their owne pleſure. And that they ſhulde enioy all their goodes. Onely that the ſouldiours of the Romanes, whiche were in the citie, and theyr goodes, ſhulde be at the pleaſure and wyl of Anniball. Than lay Anniball .iii. dayes iourney from Tarent, and bycauſe he wolde not haue his longe abode there, to be ſuſpecte, he fayned hym ſelfe to be ſycke, and cauſed it to be bruted abrode, that his ſycknes was the cauſe of his longe lyinge in that one place. But agaynſte the tyme he wolde haue the towne, he choſe out .x. thouſand horſemen, and of the lighteſt footemen of his army: and remoued from his campe in the nyght, makyng ſpede tyll he came within .xv. mile of Tarent, where he ſecretely abode, chargyng his men, in no wiſe to breake their aray or order: but that they ſhuld beredy to do what their capitaynes dyd cōmaunde them, and none other. But fyrſte, er he ſette furth, to couer the better his remouing, and to thintent that none of the countrey ſhulde deſcrye his armye: he ſent .iiii. ſcore Numidians lyght horſemen, to go before hym, chargyng them to ouerrunne the cuntrey, by whiche he with his army ſhuld paſſe. And yf they ouertoke any men, to bring them backe. And if they met with any, they ſhuld ſlea them to the intent it ſhulde be thought by the inhabitantes as they went, that they were robbers and theues, and not menne of warre. The fame of theyr robbyng came to the eares of the Romayne capitayne at Tarent: who toke but ſmalle regarde therto, thynkyng ſyth Anniball hym ſelfe was ſycke, and his army ſo farre of, that he wolde the next day ſende furth certayne of his men of armes, to dryue away thoſe robbers, and to ſaue the corne and cattall of his frendes. The ſame nyght, in the deade parte therof, remoued Anniball toward Tarent, hauynge Philomenes with hym, as his guyde. Whan they came nigh to the towne, it was appoynted, that Philomenes ſhulde entre the towne, with a numbre of men in harneys, at the gate, where he was wonte to entre, bryngynge his praye from huntynge. Whan he came thither, he awaked the porter, ſaying, that he had brought a great bore that he had ſlayn. At the fyrſt call the porter opened the gates: and fyrſte let in two yong men of his company: than entred he, and other his ſeruantes, pluckyng in the great boore. at whoſe greatneſſe whyle the keper was daryng and muſynge, Philomenes ſodeynly

ſlew hym with his boore ſpeare or huntyng ſtaffe: and incontinent let in .xxx. other men in harneis, who ſlewe the other watchemen of the ſaid gate: and without noiſe let in the reſt of the army, and ſecretely brought theym into the market place, where they abode a ſpace without makyng any noyſe. Whiles this was done at one gate, Annibal, with a great nū
               bre with hym, came priuily towarde an other gate, and a farre of he made a great fyre, which was a ſigne or token made betwene hym and Nico, who abode with other his complices, redy within the towne, loking for his commyng. Whiche fyre whan Nico perceyued, he (as it were anſweryng to the ſame) made him an other fyre. And whan eyther perceyued other, incontinent both theyr fyres were ſodeinly put out. And Anniball beganne to approche with his army to the gates. Nico alſo within the citie, cam to the porters ward, which he found open, and fyndyng the watche on ſlepe, ſlewe all the kepers therof, and openyng the gates, lette Anniball and his company of footemen entre: for the horſemen were cōmaunded to abyde in the playnes without, to do there as neede requyred. Thus they entred the towne, and makyng no noyſe, came into the market place, where they mette with Philomenes, and his other company. Thā had he in his company .ii. M. french men, whyche he deuyded in thre partes, and ſent them to dyuers partes of the citie. The affricanes and the Tarentynes he cauſed to kepe the moſte accuſtomed ſtretes of the towne: commaundynge theym, to ſlea all the Romaynes, but in any wyſe to ſpare the Tarentine citezens. And to that pourpoſe he appoynted the ſayde yonge gentylmenne of Tarent, that were his helpers and frendes, to be in the company of the other his ſouldyours. So that whan they ſawe any citezens, they ſhulde comfort them, byddyng them, not to be affrayde: for they ſhulde haue no hurt. Than beganne a great rumour and noyſe to be rayſed in the towne, as is euer, where ſoo ſodeyne chaunce happeth. The capytayne at the fyrſte noyſe, doubtyng treaſon, fledde to the hauen, and frome thens, in a ſmalle bote, paſſed ouer into the caſtell.
            ¶ Whanne the day appeered, and that the harneys and armes of the Carthaginenſes were perceyued, and alſo of the frenchemen, with the deathe of ſoo many Romaynes: than was it manyfeſt, that Anniball had wonne the towne. Whervpon

the Romanes that might eſcape, fledde into the ſayd caſtell. Than cauſed Anniball the citezens to aſſemble togither without armure, to here his pleaſure, which they all obeyed. There dyd he declare vnto them, the loue and great affection that he hath euer borne vnto them, and the gentylnes that he had ſhewed vnto them at the battaile of Traſymenus, and the battaile of Cannas, whan he ſent vnto theym ſuche of theyr frendes, as he had taken captiues, without any hurt, impediment, or raunſome. And after he expreſſed, with great inuectiues, the cruel and proude dominion, that the Romans euer hadde ouer them. From the whiche he was come to delyuer them: wyllinge euery one of them of the citie, to retourne home to his houſe: and with ſpede to wryte his name on the doore of his owne houſe. for incontinent he wold ſende his ſouldiours to ſpoyle and diſtroy ſuche houſes, as had not the names entitled on the doores: Chargynge theym on peyne of deathe, that none of theym ſhoulde write his name vppon the doore of any Roman: for that was the mark, wherby his men myghte knowe the houſes of his frendes, from thoſe of his ennemies.
            ¶ With this exhortation he lycenſed euery man to departe home, and within a certayn ſpace, he gaue a ſygne to his ſouldiours, to ſpoyle the houſes of the Romanes. Whiche was done, and good ſpoyle therof taken. On the morowe he determined to aſſault the caſtell: but whan he ſawe the ſtronge naturall ſite therof, beyng halfe compaſſed with the ſea, beatyng on the great hygh rockes, and on the other halfe hauing great dyches and hyghe walles towarde the towne: he was lothe to ſpende his tyme in the aſſaultyng therof, and to leaue other great thynges not folowed. Neuertheleſſe being loth to leaue his frendes the Tarentines, open to all inuaſyons of the men of armes of the Caſtell. (For to the towne they myght at all tymes haue acceſſe at their pleaſure) he thought to make a walle and dyche on the towne ſyde, betwene them and the caſtelle. And he hadde this opinyon, that whan the dyche were caſtynge, the Romaynes wolde aduenture to make excurſion on the labourers, to lette his worke and purpoſe. And he intended, that yf they ſo fierſely wold do, ſo to diſpoſe his men pryuily in imbuſhmentes: that ſuch ſlaughter of them ſhulde be made, that they ſhoulde not be able after to

hurte the towne. And euen as he thoughte, ſoo camme it to paſſe. For ſo ſoone as the worke was begunne, anone the gate of the caſtell was ſette open, and the Romaynes came on the workemen and Carthaginenſes, with ſuche violence, that anone they gaue backe, and ſommewhat the more purpoſely, to enhaunce theyr hartes and courage, and to allure theym further frome theyr holde. But anone, at a certayne token gyuen, the imbuſſhemente brake out, and with ſuche force inuaded the Romaynes, that they fledde backe with moche ſpeede towarde the caſtelle: but than was the ſtrete ſoo narowe, by whyche they muſte paſſe, and they ſoo troubled with the baggage of the labourers, that laye in their waye, that many more were ſlayne in the fleinge, than were before in fyghtynge. Thus was the power of the Caſtell, lefte ſo ſmall, that afterwarde theyr workes were neuer lette, but that the depe dyche and walle were made in ſuche wyſe, that he neded not to leaue any garryſon in the towne. Neuer the leſſe for theyr ſauegarde he lefte a certayn of his ſouldiours: and he with the reſte of his army remoued fyue myles from thenſe to the ryuer of Galeſus, where he pitched his tentes. Soone after he retourned to viewe the ſtrength of the Caſtell: and thought it myght be wonne with a ſaute. Whervppon he cauſed all maner of engyns to be made, and ſette vp agaynſte the walles: to the greatte feare of theym of the Caſtell. But ſodeynly in the nyghte came a certayne of ſhyppes of menne of warre, frome Metapontus, whyche than was holden with Romans, and entred the hauen: by whoſe healpe they of the Caſtell threwe downe, and burned all the ingynes and munymentes of the Carthaginenſes. Wherby Anniball loſte his hope of wynnynge the caſtelle by any aſſaulte: but than he ymagyned, by contynuall ſiege to famyſſhe theym. Whyche purpoſe alſo ſerued hym nothynge. For they of the caſtelle hadde the ſea free on the oone ſyde, where they receyued vytayles at theyr pleſure: And the Romaynes, beynge mayſters of the hauen, kepte all prouyſyon frome the cytie, that was wonte to comme by water. Soo that they were moche more lyke to endure famyne, thanne the other of the caſtelle, whome they beſieged. Wherfore Anniball, myſtruſting the ſtrength

of the place, called the rulers of Tarent before hym, and ſayde:
            ¶ I beholde the nature, the ſite, and all the ſtrengthe of this caſtell, and I can not ſee, that any aſſault can preuayle, ſo long as our ennemies be lordes of the ſea, and haue that at liberty. But if we may (ſaid he) haue ſhippes, which may reſtrain vitailes to be brought to them: either they wil depart thens, or yeld vnto vs. To this the Tarentines agreed well: but they ſaid, that he muſt helpe, that ſome of the nauy of Carthage, which were in Sicilia, might be cauſed to comme thither, to kepe the ſaid port. Why (ſayde Anniball) haue you no ſhyppes of your owne. Yes truely (ſayde they) but they lye here in a littell creke, and ſo longe as our ennemies haue the dominion of the mouthe of the hauen, howe can they euer eſcape in to the brode ſeas? Yes ſaid Anniball feare it not. for many thinges, that naturally be letted, by witte and policy may be brought to paſſe. Your citie is ſituate on a playne and euen grounde, and your ſtretes and ways be brode, to paſſe to all partes. Your ſhippes wyll I conuey through the high way, that leadeth through the middell of your citie, vpon waines and wheles, vnto the hauen, with ſmalle charge. And the ſea ſhall be ours, that nowe our enemies be lordes of. Than both by ſea and by lande, we wyll compaſſe them: ſo that ſhortely they ſhall be dryuen to forſake the caſtell, or els we ſhall take bothe them and it alſo.
            ¶ This his wyſe diuiſe made all men to haue wonder and admiration of hym, with alſo a hoope of a good ſucceſſe of his purpoſe. Furth withal waynes and cartes were gathered and tyed togither. Than were engins made, to raiſe and to drawe vp the ſhippes, and the ways made hard, euen, and leuell, that they myght the more eaſily be drawen on them. Thus with ſtrength of beaſtes and men, the ſhyppes were broughte to the hauen, and in fewe daies garniſhed with men and all thinges neceſſary, and brought rounde about the caſtell, caſtyng their ankers before the mouthe of the hauen.
         
         
            
            ¶ Fuluius Flaccus the Romane conſull, wynneth the campe of Hanno, ſleeth and taketh a great number of men with a ryche pray. Mago ſleeth Titus Gracchus and many Romaynes, through the treaſon of Flauius a Lucan. Capitu. xxxvi.
            
               VVhyles Anniball was thus occupied aboute the buſyneſſe of Tarent, Quintus Fuluius Flaccus, and Appius Claudius, that were choſen conſuls for that yere, were com with bothe their armyes into the parties of the Samnites: and the rulers of Capua feared greatly, leſt they dyd intende ſhortly to beſiege their citie. Alſo plentye of corne beganne than to faile them. for the legions of the Romans hadde ſo inuaded their countrey, that the Campanes durſt neither tyll nor ſow their groundes. wherfore they ſent legates vnto Annibal, deſiring hym, to cauſe plenty of wheate to be brought to Capua, from the countrey adioynyng: before that the conſuls dydde enter their countrey with theyr armies. Whervpon Anniball ſent meſſangers to Hanno, that he ſhuld come from the Bruſians with his army into Cāpania: And to make prouiſion, that the Campanes might haue good plenty of corne ſent to them.
            ¶ Hanno (as he was commaunded) leauynge the Samnites, and the Conſuls, paſſed by, tyll he came within .iii. myles of Beneuentum: where on a mountayne he pitched his campe, and in townes of his frendes adioyning, to which great plentie of wheate the ſommer before had bene caryed, he made goodly prouiſion for the Campanes, and ſent worde ſecretely to Capua, what day they ſhuld, with all the waynes and cartes that they coulde aſſemble in the countrey, reſorte to the ſayd places, for to fette away their ſaid wheate. The Campanes, lyghtly and ſklenderly foreſeing their buſines and welth, at the day aſſigned, came thither, bringyng with them but .iiii. hundred cartes: which theyr ſlouth Hanno greatly rebuked, maruaylyng, that they wolde no more hedily auoyde hunger whiche all brute beaſtes labour to eſchue. Wherfore he ſente them home laden, and appoynted them an nother day, to retourne againe for a moche greatter quantitie.
            ¶ This appoyntment came to the eares of the Beneuentanes.

Whervpon incontynent they ſente tenne meſſangers to the Conſulles, certifyenge theym of all the Campanes purpoſe. And they furthwith agreed, that Fuluius, with his armye ſhoulde goo to Beneuentum, and enter the towne, in the nyghte, kepynge him cloſe therin, tyll he ſawe tyme apte for his purpoſe. So ſoone as Fuluius was entred Beneuentum, it was ſhewed hym, that Hanno with a parte of his army was gone furth for wheate: and that .ii. M. wayns were come to the campe with a great rude ſort of people vnarmed, where they lay myngled amonge the ſouldiours, kepyng no order after the vſe of men of warre. This knowen, the conſul cōmanded his men to be redy with theyr baners & armure: for the next night he wold aſſayle the Campanes, and the tentes of the Carthaginenſes. They executyng his commandement made them redy, and about .iiii. of the clocke, they ſet furthe of the towne, and came to Hannos campe, a lyttell before the dawnyng of the day. At theyr fyrſt commynge, with their ſodain noiſe, the Carthaginenſes becam ſo feareful, that if the campe had be pitched on plain ground, they had wonne it with ſmall reſiſtence: but the height of the hyll, with the defēſes that they had made therabout, was ſuch, that they could no way get vp vnto them: but by great ſteppes and climming. In the daunyng of the day the bataile began to waxe ſtronge, the Carthaginenſes not onely defended their campe, but alſo they kept the hyll without, euer throwing doune the Romās that ſtroue wonderſly to clymme the place. Neuertheleſſe at length by great pein and trauaile, and alſo with great loſſe and hurt of men, they gat to the diches of the campe. The conſull aduiſyng well the miſchief that ſhulde fall to his company, in winning the place, callid the tribunes vnto him, ſaying: that he wold no further at that time purſue his foliſhe enterpriſe, but that he wold returne for that day to Beneuentū. And on the morow he wold ioyne his campe to the campe of his enmies: ſo that the Campanes ſhuld not iſſue out, nor Hanno haue recours again to thē, whan he were returned. And to bring this better and more ſurely to paſſe, he wolde ſende for his felowe Claudius the conſull, with his army to aſſiſt him therin: whan the tribune cauſed the retreate to be ſowned, his ſouldiours, that were earneſtly buſy aboute their enterpriſe, wolde gyue none care therto. Among other there was one Vibius, a capitain

of a cōpany of the Pelignes, who ſtreight toke his baner in his hande, and with force threwe it ouer the diche into the campe of the Carthaginenſes. Than ſayd he: Euyl might I fare and my company, if myn enemies ſhall enioy my baner. Than by great force he lightly went ouer the diche, & clame vp, and entred the campe of his enemies: whom his company boldly folowed. While they thus fought within the cāpe of the Carthaginenſes, on an other part cried Valerius Flaccus: what ſluggiſhe cowardes are we nowe waxen? ſhall the Pelignes wynne the honour of taking the campe of our ennemies before vs Romans? Whervpon Titus Pedanius a capitayn of a hūdred men, toke his ſtanderd in his hande from his ſtanderde bearer, ſaying: This ſtanderde wyll I beare in to the fielde of myne enemies, folowe me ſyrs as many as wolde be lothe of the loſſe therof. And anone he and his companye were goten into that other part of the cāpe. The conſul perceyuing their hardynes, changed his mynd of calling them away, and began to comfort them: exhorting the reſt, to helpe their felowes, that ſo valiantly fought in the campe of theyr enmies. By whoſe harty wordis, euery man inforced him ſelfe to enter, not regarding the dartes nor weapons of their enemies, as people fearyng no peryll: And as people that cared not for deth, ſo they might dye in the campe of their enemies. Thus within ſhort ſpace, that ſtrong place was wōne, & aboue vi. M. ſlayn, & .vii. M. taken, with the men of Campania, that came for corne, with al their cartes, and a riche pray that Hā
               no before had gotten in the fieldes of the frendes of the Romans. Whiche pray the conſuls ſolde (for by that tyme was Claudius alſo come thither) & therwith rewarded their men, ſpecially Vibius and Pedanius. Whan Hanno hearde of the loſſe of his people, he fledde backe againe to the Brutianes, with a fewe men whiche he had taken with hym, to get in the wheate for the Campanes.
            ¶ The Cāpanes, heryng of the loſſe of their men & frendes, ſent to Annibal, ſhewing him, that both the cōſuls were at Beneuentū, within a days iorney of Capua, intending to lay ſiege to their city. And it was to be feared, leſt (if he did not ſhortly ſuccour them) that the Romans wold wynne and diſtroy that citie. They ſaid further, that nother the caſtell of Tarent, nor the town alſo, ought to be ſo moch eſtemed of him, as Capua.

the noblenes wherof he knew well him ſelfe. In ſo moch that he was wont to compare it vnto Carthage. Wherfore they truſted, that he wold not leaue it vndefended, to haue it ſpoiled and diſtroyed by the Romayns.
            ¶ Annibal hering this meſſage, ſhewed to the ambaſſadours, what loue he bare vnto their citie, promiſing to be euer a defender therof. With theſe gentyll wordes he ſent them home again, & he ſent with them alſo .ii. M. horſmen, by whoſe helpe they might defend their fieldes from robbing and waſtyng.
            ¶ In the meane whyle P. Cornelius the pretor, with certain ſhippes, laden with wheate, came into the hauen of Tarent, through the hole power of the Carthaginenſes. He cauſed alſo ſuche ſouldiours as were at Metapontus in garriſon, to come to the caſtell of Tarent, there to remaine for the defence therof: by whoſe cōminge, they of the caſtell were than ſure from any hurt of their ennemies. but ſo ſoone as the inhabitantes of Metapontus were deliuered of the Romayne garriſon, they incontinent fell in leage and amitie with Anniball. Whervpon the Thurines, alſo hauynge a grudge to the Romans, for ſleing diuers of their frendes, as is aforſaid, deuyſed a meane, to bringe their citie to the amitie of Anniball: The kynſmen of them that were ſlayne, ſente meſſangers to Hanno and Mago, who than were among the Bruſians: willing them to come with their army, to lay ſiege to the towne: not doubtyng, but that one Marcus Attinius, the ruler of a ſmalle company of the Romaynes, left for the defence of the towne, wolde anon be brought to iſſue out, and to gyue them battaylle, vppon the truſt that he had in the yong men of armes of the towne: whom before he had armed and inſtructed in the feates of warre, after the Roman facion. And they douted not, but this ſort wold doo hym ſmall pleaſure, whan he ſhuld haue moſt nede of theym. The two capitains, hearing this glad tidinges, with ſpede entred the fieldes of the Thurines, diuydyng their company betwene theym. Hanno with the footemen, with baners diſplayed, in good aray, went towarde the towne: Mago with all the horſmen abode in a valey vnder certayn hylles that were nigh the towne. Attinius knowing only of the company of fotemē, put his men in good aray, and with great courage iſſued out of the towne, nothing myſtruſtyng the myſchiefe wrought agaynſt hym within the

towne. The battaile was quicke on the part of the Romans: but the Thurines ſtode as men that gaue the lokynge on, not as enemies. Hanno with his men of pourpoſe gaue backe, to drawe the Romanes into the daunger of their horſmen. And whan they came nere the hilles, than they fierſly aſſayled the Romayns. and on the other ſyde, Mago with his horſemen came ſodainly and egrely vpon them: at the fyrſt encountring the Thurines fledde into their towne, as faſt as they coulde. The Romans for a ſeaſon mainteyned the battaile: but at the laſt, being conſtrained thereto, they alſo fledde towarde the towne: The traytours, that were cauſers of al this miſchief had gotten to the gate with their power, and againſt the commyng backe of the Thurines that fledde, they kept open the gates, and receyued them into the towne: but whan the Romanes came fleyng, alſo thinkyng to haue entred with the other, they cried: It is tyme nowe to ſhutte the gates: for els we ſhall lette the Carthaginenſes into the towne among our owne men, and ſo loſe all. Whervpon they ſhut theyr gates, and ſuffred the Romans to be ſlayne by their ennemies without ſuccour. Only Attinius the capitayn, who gentilly had or dered them, while he was ruler there, they ſuffered to enter with a fewe with him: and incontinent they gaue him a ſhippe in the hauen, and badde hym ſaue him ſelfe by the ſea. After whoſe departynge they opened the gates, and receyued the Carthaginenſes.
            ¶ Nowe were the conſuls departed from Beneuentū, to aſſaute Capua, thinkyng, that they ſhuld make their yere happy and honourable to them, yf they might wynne Capua, that was ſo noble and riche: and reuenge them of the iniuries, by them before done. Neuertheleſſe, to the intent the Beneuentanes ſhulde not be lefte withoute ſuccours in theyr abſence, they ſent to Titus Gracchus, who was than in the cuntrey of the Lucans, commandyng hym, with his horſemen and other lyght footemen, to come to Beneuentum: leauynge with the Lucanes the reſte of his men, vnder ſome capitayn, whom he myght truſte.
            ¶ The Lucans were than diuided, diuers townes were rendred vp to Anniball, and certaine abode vnder the Romaynes iurisdiction: of the which ſort the chiefe rular that yere was one Flauius, a Lucan. This Flauius ſodeynly was tourned

in his mynde to Anniball: and to obteyne his fauour, he ſente to Mago, that was than among the Brutians, to come ſpeke with hym. Whan they were mette, a compoſition was made betwene them, that if he coulde delyuer Gracchus, the capitayn of the Romain army, the Lucanes ſhulde be frendly receiued in amitie with the Carthaginēſes, and lyue after their own lawes. Thā brought he Mago to a great couert, where he willed him, with a great numbre of men of armes to hyde hym: appoyntyng hym a tyme, at whiche he wolde bring thither the Romaine capitayne. After this appoyntment he departed, and went to Gracchus, to whom he ſhewed, that he had begunne ſecretely a great enterpryſe, whyche to brynge to effecte, he muſte haue his healpe and aſſyſtence. I haue (ſayde he) moued and perſwaded all the pryncis of the Lucans, that were gone to the amitie of Anniball, nowe to retourne agayne to the obedience of Rome. I haue declared vnto them the increaſe of the Romanes power, whiche dayly we may perceiue, and the decreaſe of the ſtrength of the Carthaginenſes. And I bad them not myſtruſt the gentylnes of the Romains, whoſe nature we haue euer tryed to be meke and gentyll to ſuche as haue rebelled agaynſt them, vpon hū
               ble ſubmiſſiō to them made. With theſe my perſuaſions they be all contented to be reconciled: ſo that they may here you ſpeake the ſame, laying your right hand in theirs, as a pledge of your faithe, whervnto they may truſt. And I haue (ſayde he) vndertaken, that you ſhall doo it, and I haue appoynted them for that compoſition a ſecrete place, wel out of the way from our company, for feare of eſpies, yet not far from your campe: where, with fewe wordes, you may go through with them in this matter, and by this meane bryng all the Lucanes wholly vnder your iurisdiction.
            ¶ Gracchus nothyng my ſtruſtynge diſceite and treaſon to be in his wordes, toke his officers and horſemen with him, al vnarmed, and ſo rode to the place appointed, hauynge Flauius with hym as a guyde. So ſoone as they were come thyther, Mago with his army inuaded theym ſodaynly. And to make the treaſon more euident, Flauius incontinent ioyned him to the Carthaginenſes. Than was there plenty of dartes caſte at Gracchus, and his horſemen, and whan he ſawe noo other remedy, he alyght from his horſe, and bad his company doo

the ſame, exhortynge them, ſyns they were but fewe in number, and vnarmed, in ſuche place, where they coulde by noo waye eſcape, that they wolde not dye lyke beaſtes vnreuenged, but that with noble hartes they ſhoulde aſſaile theyr ennemyes, and dye bathed and beſprynkled in the bloudde of theyr ennemies: whereby they ſhulde ende in moſte honour: But ſpecially aboue all thyng (ſayde he) lette euery of vs, ſeeke to ſlea that Lucane traytour Flauius, not doubtynge, but who ſo euer ſhall ſende that traytours ſoule to helle, before he dye hym ſelfe, he ſhall fynd the oblation therof, todoo hym moche comforte and ſolace. As ſoone as he hadde thus ſpoken, he threwe his clooke aboute his lefte arme, in ſtede of his ſhielde, and ranne vppon his ennemies, who with their dartes and weapons, ſlewe moſt part of the Romaines. And whan they ſawe Gracchus without helpe, they intended to take hym on lyue: but ſo ſoone as he perceiued Flauius amonge his ennemies, he ranne through the thickeſt of them, with ſuche force, to haue ſlayne him, that they were there conſtrained to ſlea hym, or elles he had done them greate hurte. Whoſe body Mago cauſed to be brought to Anniball, and he cauſed it to be buried with moche honour.
         
         
            ¶ Centenius Penula and Cneius Fuluius with theyr two armies be diſcomfyted and ſlayne by Anniball in ſeuerall battayles. Cap. xxxviii.
            
               IN THIS meane ſeaſon were the Conſulles entred the fieldes of the Campanes, theyr menne ouerſpreading the countrey, robbynge, ſpoylynge and waſtynge in dyuers places, whiche beinge perceyued, Mago with his horſemen, by the healpe of the townes men, iſſued oute ſodaynely on theym: and or euer they coulde gather togyther in order of battaile, ſlewe of them one thouſand, and fyue hundred. Which loſſe cauſed the conſuls more circumſpectly to worke in all theyr procedynges afterwarde.
            ¶ Anniball heryng of this proſperous bataile of the Campanes in his abſence, drew nere vnto Capua with his army, thinkyng that the Romanes ſhulde be moche leſſe able to indure

his power ioyned to the Campanes. Wherfore the third day after his comming, he diſplayde his baners, and ſet his company in order and goodly aray, redy to fight. The Romayns likewiſe made theym redy, and the horſemen on bothe ſydes fought ſtrongly for a ſeaſon, tyll bothe partes perceiued a ſtrange army comming toward them: wherof nother of them were priuie. The truthe therof was, that C. Cornelius, than bearing the office of Queſtor at Rome, had taken the legiōs, whyche the yere before were vnder Sempronius, and was commyng to the ayde of the conſuls. but his commynge vnknowen made as well the conſuls affraide, as Anniball: ſo that as it were by agreement, both partes withdrue to their campes, the Romans hauing ſomwhat more loſſe thā the Cartha ginēſes. Than the conſuls, wylling to draw Annibal away frō Capua deuiſed the night folowing to depart awaye. Fuluius with his hoſt, went to diſtroy the fieldes of the Cumans. Appius with his hoſt went to the Lucanes. Anniball in the morning, hauing knowlege of their ſundry departing diuers wais, was a whiles in dout, whether of them he might folow: t the laſt he determined to folowe Appius, wherin he was moche deceiued. For he, leadinge hym a great compaſſe aboute the countreys, at his pleaſure, retourned againe an other way to Capua. Than fortune a whyle ſmylyng on Anniball, ſent hym ſuche chances, that he was a ſeaſon ſtayed in thoſe parties. One was the foliſhe hardy enterpriſe of one Centenius Penula, a gentylman of goodly ſtature of body, and of noble courage of mynde, correſpondent to the ſame.
            ¶ This Centenius, being broughte into the ſenate houſe by P. Cornelius Sulla, deſyred of the ſenatours, that he might haue deliuered him only .v. M. ſouldiours, with whoſe helpe he doubted not, but that with the knowlege that he had, both of the countreys and alſo of the crafty feates of his ennemy, he wold with the ſame ſubtiltie and policies deceiue Anniball, by whiche he before had deceiued the Romaynes. This his vnwiſe promiſe vnto them, was as vnwiſely beleued of them. And where he demaunded but .v. M. they gaue him .viii. M. men: and he in the countreys as he went gathered togyther almoſte as many mo, of ſuche as willyngly went with him, hauing hope in his courage and promiſe. With this noumbre of men he came into the fieldes of the Lucanes, where Anniball

had reſted hym and his company, wery of the chaſe of Appius Claudius. Whan either of them ſawe others army, they incontinēt put their folke in aray. The matche was not equall nother of capitaines nor of ſouldiours: neuertheleſſe the bataile indured more than two howres. Centenius perceiuinge his part to ſuffre the worſe, and fearing, leſte if he ſhulde lyue after his men were ſlayne, he ſhulde ſuffer great ſhame and infamy during his lyfe, for the loſſe of ſuche a numbre of men by his foliſhe enterpriſe: at the laſt willingly he entred the thickeſt preaſe of his enemies, where he was ſhortly ſlayne, and than his men fledde on all partes, but they were ſo harde chaſed with horſemen, that of that great company, there eſcaped ſcant one thouſand.
            ¶ One other happy chāce fortune ſent to Annibal, as it were for a farewel or leue takyng of him, before ſhe thought to depart to the Romans: the occaſion therof was, that one Cneiꝰ Fuluius, bearing the office of pretor, lay than in Apulia with his hoſt, beſiegyng ſuche townes as before were come to the amitie of the Carthaginenſis. And in his buſynes he had ſoo well ſped, and was become ſo welthy and riche, bothe he and his men, with prayes whiche they had taken, that leauyng all good order of warre, or the peynfull purſuite thereof, they were growen into ſlouthe and ſluggyſſhe ydelnes. Of theyr vndiſcrete order the Appulians ſente woorde to Anniball by meſſangers. And he knowing by experience what wolde folowe the gouernance of an army by an vnwiſe capitane, wherof of late he had the triall by Centenius, with ſpede he remoued into the coſtis of Apulia. Whan the Romains had knowlege, that their enemies approched, and were ouen at hande: they were all mynded to haue diſplayde their baners,. and to haue runne to batail without the cōmandement of their capitain. The night folowing, Annibal perceiuing their great haſt to battaile, cōmanded .iii. M. of his light men of warre, to lye priuily hyd in woodes buſhes & couertes, next adioyning, gyuing them a ſigne or token, at what tyme they ſhulde iſſue out, and aſſaile their enmies. Than cauſed he Mago, with .ii. M. horſemen, to lye priuily in the wayes, by which he demed the Romans wolde flee after theyr diſcomfiture. Theſe thynges in the nyght tyme being wyſely diſpoſed, yarly in the morning he came with his hoſt into the fieldes, putting the reſt of his

men in goodly aray.
            ¶ On the other ſide Fuluius the pretor made no tarying, being moche inforced therto by the haſty wilfulnes of his ſouldiours: Wherfore with ſuche aduyſement as they came into the fielde, with ſuche lyke aduyſement were the batayles ordred. For euery man went to what place him ſemed beſt, and choſe his cōpany with whom he wold be: and ſomtyme changed his place again at his pleaſure. The forward and the left wing were fyrſt ordered, and that all in length, and of a ſmall thykneſſe. The Tribunes cried to them, to ſet more ſtrength of men in the myddell of their battailes, or els their enemies myght eaſyly go through them with ſmall force at theyr pleaſure. But they were ſo wylfull and haſty, that they gaue noo eare to theyr wordes. By that tyme were the Carthaginenſes come in good order redy to ioyne: at whoſe fyrſt cominge with great noiſe & bruite, the Romains were put to the wors: whervpon the capitayn, ſeing all lyke to go to miſchiefe, toke his hors, and with two hundred horſemen with him, fled. The reſte, that abode, were almooſte all ſlayne. for of .xviii. M. of the company, there eſcaped not paſt .ii. M. alyue. The tentes and ſtuffe was alſo taken by the Carthaginenſes, whiche was a good pray. The tydinges of theſe great ſodayn loſſes were brought to Rome, whiche cauſed the citie to be in great feare and mournyng. Neuertheleſſe by cauſe bothe the Conſulles, with their armies were ſafe, and did ſomwhat proſper in their affayres, they toke the more comforte to theym. And incontynent ſent meſſangers to the Conſuls, wylling them to ſerch for all ſuch as were eſcaped at theſe two battailes, & that they ſhuld be gathered togither, and called vnto them: leſt either for feare or for diſpaire, they wold yeld them to their enmies, whiche thyng with all diligence they dyd execute.
         
         
            ¶ The citie of Capua is beſeged by the two conſuls, Anniball cō
               meth to the ſuccour of the citezēs, giueth the cōſuls battel, from thens goth to Rome ward with his hoſt, to thintent therby to draw the cōſuls from the ſiege of Capua. Ca. xxxix.
            IN the meane ſeaſon was Capua compaſſed & beſieged by both the conſuls, & great prouiſion of corne made for the ſame, & laid in garners in the caſtel of Caſſelinꝰ

Than ſent they to Sueſſula for Claudius Nero the Pretor, who leauyng a ſmall garriſon there, came hym ſelfe to theym to Capua with all his power. Thus was Capua compaſſed with thre greatte armyes on three partes, and to encloſe the citezens the more ſurely, they prepared to compaſſe the hole city with a great diche. And thervpon they made many caſtels a good diſtance thone frō the other. The Cāpanes thinkynge to let their work, iſſued many times & fought with the Romās but their fortune was euer ſuch, that they loſt ſtill of their mē, and at the laſt were conſtrained to kepe them within the walles of their citie. but before the warkes or ſiege was ſo ſtraite and ſtrong, they had ſent ambaſſadours to Anniball, complaynyng, that he had forſaken theym and his citie of Capua: and that yf he dyd not ſhortly ſuccour them, they muſt yeld them to the Romans. To whom Anniball anſwered, that of late he had reſ
                  •
               ued them, and rayſed their ſiege ones, and that ſhortly he wolde come to helpe them againe, not doubting, but the Romayns ſhuld be vnable to reſiſt his power at his cōmyng. With this comfortable meſſage they retourned to their citie, whyche they founde ſo compaſſed with a double dyche, that with peyne coulde they fynde the meane to enter into it: neither coulde they haue entred, had not the letters of P. Cornelius the pretor bene, wherin he aduyſed the conſuls, before the dyche ſhuld be fully finyſſhed, to proclaime, that as many of the Campanes as wolde iſſue with their baggage and bagges, before a day by him lymitted, ſhulde go free where they wold, and haue their goodes their owne. After that day, ſoo many as remained, they wolde take and vſe as their enemies. But this proclamation was ſo diſdainfully taken of the Campanes, that beſyde that there wold none iſſue out of the city, they alſo ſpake proude and opprobrious wordes in diſpite of the Romaynes. Whervppon the workes of the dyche were ended, and the citie fully encloſed.
            ¶ Anniball, deſyrous to ſuccour his great frendes of Capua, left al his heuy cariage among the Brucians, and with a great numbre of choſen horſemen and light fotemen, haſted thither as faſte as he might, and after his hooſte came .xxxiii. of his elephantes. With this army he came to the valey that was vnder a mountayn adioynyng to Capua, called Tifata, er the Romans had any knowlege of his cōming. Than ſent he ſpies

to the Romayns hoſte to Capua, commaundynge them, ſoo ſoone as he ſhulde gyue them battaile on his parte, that Boſtar and Mago, with the horſemen and garriſon of the Carthaginenſes, aſſemblynge alſo all the power of the citizens, ſhoulde ſodaynely iſſue oute of the citie: and with force aſſayle their ennemies. This diuiſe of Anniball was executed with ſoo ſodayne crye and clamoure, that the Romaynes were in greate feare and daunger. Neuertheles with as great ſpede as they coulde, they prepared their battayles, and dyuyded their people. Appius Claudius wente to withſtande the Campanes, and Fuluius wente agaynſte Anniball. Claudius was ſtronge inough for his ennemies, but Fuluius was hardly handled of the Carthaginenſes and Spaniardes. One cō
               pany or legion of his men were driuen backe, and than a great companye of Spanyardes, with thre elephantes, had broken the myddell warde of the Romaynes, and were come to the trench of the campe, redy to enter into the tentes and campe of their enmies. Whan Fuluius ſawe, what daunger his people and campe were in, he cried to Q. Nanius, and other pety capitaines, exhorting them to aſſaile that company of Spaniardes, that fought at the diche: ſhewyng them what danger all was in, onleſſe they might ſone be confounded, which was eaſy inough to be done, ſens there was of them no greatter a number. Nanius was a ſtrong man, and of a huge ſtature. And whan he hearde the conſulles exhortation, anone he toke the ſtanderde from hym that bare it, and commaundyng his company, boldly to take parte with hym, he ſette furthe towarde the Spanyardes, with a great courage. As ſone as the Spaniardes ſawe hym drawe nere, they threwe plentye of dartes at hym; and beganne violently to aſſayle him. But he nother beynge ſtayde with the multitude of his ennemies, nor with the dartes that were caſte at him, with great force went ſtylle forwarde, tyl by the helpe of Marcus Attilius, Portius Lucius, and other, they had ſlain the elephantes, and made great ſlaughter alſo of Spaniardes.
            ¶ On the other part, the Campanes were dryuen back, with the garriſon alſoo of Numidians and Carthaginenſes: ſoo that the battaile was ſtronge euen at the very gate of Capua, that was towarde the ryuer of Vulturnus. This gate was garniſhed with Croſſebowes dartes and other ſuche ingyns,

wherby many of the Romayns were wounded by the ſhot out of the towre of the gate. Amonge other, the Conſul Appius Claudius was ſoore hurt on the breaſt vnder the left ſhulder. Neuertheleſſe the citizens with their helpers were driuen into the citie with great ſlaughter and loſſe of theyr company. Anniball ſeing the ſlaughter of his Spaniardes, and that the Romaynes ſo manfully defended theyr campes, he cauſed his people to withdrawe them, and made the horſemen to abyde hyndermoſte for the defence of the footemen, yf their ennemies happed to chaſe them. The Romaines were very egre, and wolde haue folowed them in the chaſe, had not Flaccus cauſed to ſounde the retreate.
            ¶ In this batayle Anniball wrought one crafty poynt, he ſent dyuers of his men forth, that coulde ſpeake the latine tunge, into dyuers partes of the hooſte of the Romaynes, whyche ſhulde in the conſuls name and behalfe declare, that the Romayne campes were taken and ſpoyled. Wherfore he wylled euery man to ſaue hym ſelfe by fleing to the next mountayns, ſens by lenger tarying, the greater ſhuld be theyr loſſe. This crafty deceite made many of them amaſed: but at the laſte it was eſpied, to the great ſlaughter of their ennemies.
            ¶ After this battaile the Romaynes kept them in their campes, and ſo ſtraightly beſieged the citie, that Anniball ſeinge he could no more drawe them furth to bataile, nother through the campes of the Romaines haue any way to enter into Capua, fearyng leſte his vitayles ſhuld be cut from hym and his hoſte: he determined to depart from thens. And than he ymagyned, that he wolde go towarde Rome, not doubtynge, but whan the Romayn capitaynes dyd perceyue Rome theyr head citie to be in any daunger, that either one or both wolde leaue Capua, and come to the defence therof. And than theyr powers being diuided, bothe partes ſhoulde be the weaker: and he truſted, that either he or the Campanes ſhulde haue a fayre day of ſome of them. One thynge troubled hym ſoore, leſt the Campanas ſeing his departyng from them, wolde incontinent yelde the citie to the Romayns. Wherfore by fayre wordes and great giftes, he had gotten one of Numidia to go with his letters through the campes of the Romains, as one that was runne away from the Carthaginenſes army: & whan

he ſhuld come to the further part of the hoſt towarde the citie, than ſecretly to enter into Capua, and deliuer his letters, which were full of comfort, declaring his departyng to be for theyr profite, to thintent onely to withdrawe their ennemies from Capua, to defende their owne citie, bydding them not to diſpayre, but to take pacience for a ſeaſon, truſtyng ſhortly to loſe them of the daunger they were in. Sone after he departed with his hoſte, and paſſed the ryuer of Vulturnus, taking the way towarde Rome. His commynge cauſed great heuynes in the citie. The ſenatours conſulted, what was beſte for to be done in this daungerous caſe. At length it was agreed, that Q. Fuluius ſhulde come from Capua, with a certayn legions with him, leauing his felowe at the ſiege with a numbre ſufficient for that purpoſe. Q. Fuluius, hauing this cōmandement, toke with him .xv. M. fotemen, and one thouſand horſe men, and folowed Anniball as ſpedily as he could. Now was Anniball come within .iii. miles of Rome, where he pitched his tentes, and made his campe on a riuer ſide. And ſoone after came Quintus Fuluius Flaccus into Rome with his army, and conſulted with the ſenators of the affaires that were to be done touching their enmies. Than toke Annibal .ii. M. horſemen with hym, and camme to the walles and gates of Rome, riding from the gate called Porta Collina, to the temple of Hercules, viewynge the ſituation of the citie, and the ſtrength of the walles. This bolde and hygh mynde of Anniball, in ſo doing, Fuluius Flaccus coulde not ſuffer: but incontinent ſent furth a greate numbre of horſemen, who with force droue their enemies to their campe. The next day Anniball came into the fielde with his hoſt in good aray, redy to gyue battaile. And Flaccus hauinge with hym the two newe conſuls, that of late were choſen, with their powers, made hym redy alſo to battaile. Thus whan bothe partes were redy to go togither, abidynge the chaunce of fortune, whether of them ſhulde be maiſter of the noble citie of Rome: there came ſodainly on them ſo vehement a ſtorme of raine and haile togither, that both the partes were faine to withdrawe them to their Campes. The nexte daye they were lykewiſe redye to ioyne battaile, whan a like ſtorme alſo departed theym agayne. And after theyr departure incontynente the wether waxed verye bryght and fayre, and all the wyndes ceaſſed,

whiche euyl chances toke away the hartes and courage from Anniball and his companye, for euer to enioye the citie of Rome. Wherfore hauynge no further hope therof, he returned backe in haſt to the Brucians: And the conſul Quintus Fuluius returned to Capua to his felowe.
         
         
            ¶ The oration of Vibius Virius concerning the yeldyng of Capua, the Romaines receyue the towne, ſlea the ſenatours, and conuerte the groundes therof to the profit of their city of Rome. Cap. xl.
            
               THe Campanes perceyuing the returne of Quintus Fuluius, and not of Annibal, iuged them ſelfes than to be vtterly forſaken of him. Wherfore wepyng and mourning the noble men kept them in their houſes, loking dayly for their owne deathes, and diſtruction of the citie. The hole charge of the keping therof was in Boſtar and Hanno, captains of the garriſon of the Carthaginenſes. They fering their own eſtate, ſent priuily letters to Anniball, ſomewhat ſharply written, wherin they blamed hym, not onely for leauyng the citie of Capua to the handes of the Romaines: but alſo that 
                  •
               e, committing his capitaynes and his ſure frendes and ſouldiours of his retinue into the handes of his enemies, to ſuffre tourmentes intollerable, was hym ſelfe gone to the Brucians, bycauſe he wolde not ſee before hym the takynge of Capua. Wherfore they ſaide, in caſe he wolde come agayn to them, and returne his hole power thither, they with the hole power of Capua, wold be redy to breake forthe on theyr ennemyes, truſting to wynne therby moche honour. They ſayde alſo, that his commyng ouer the mountaines was not to warre with the Rhegines, or with the Tarentines, but with the Romaynes: and where the Romain legions were, there ſhuld the army of the Carthaginenſes alſo be. And ſo doinge, he had for the moſte part euer good ſpede, as at Cannas, at Traſymenus, & diuers other places, by giuing them bataile valiantly.
            ¶ Theſe letters were ſent by one of Numidia, an eſpye, that counterfaited him ſelf to be run from the Carthaginenſes army for the hūger that daily oppreſſed the citie. Other letters alſo of the ſame effect, were ſent by dyuers other Numidians,

but it chaunced, that a woman, whome one of the meſſangers had kepte as his harlotte, feelyng greate hunger in the cytie, ranne out of the towne into the tentes of the Romain conſull Flaccus, and declared vnto hym of ſuche an eſpy, that was in his campe, whiche had letters to conueye to Anniball. This man was founde oute. And whan he came before her, hedenyed any parte of her accuſation to be trewe: he denied alſo, that he knewe the woman. But whanne he ſawe tourmentes prepared for hym, he confeſſed the hole truthe, and alſo he confeſſed, that many other of his facion were among the Romayns, who wayted but theyr tyme, whan they might eſcape from the Romayn hoſte with lyke letters to Anniball. Thervpon ſerche was made, and aboue .lxx. of theym taken: who were beaten fyrſt with roddes, and than hadde theyr handes ſtriken of, and were ſent again into the citie, to their captains.
            ¶ Whan the capitayns ſawe that extreme punyſhement ſhewed to theyr meſſangers, theyr hartes began to fayle them. Whervpon Leſius that yererular of the citie, called a generall counſayle: In the whyche many of the ſenatours moued, that ambaſſadours ſhulde be ſent to the Romayn conſuls: but Vibius Virius, who was the chiefe cauſer of the yeldyng of Capua to Anniball, beynge demaunded of his opinyon therin, aunſwered, that all they that ſpake of peace takyng, or of the yeldyng of Capua, ought to remembre, bothe what they wolde haue done, yf they had had the Romayns in theyr power, in lyke caſe as they had them, and alſo what the Campanes were lyke to ſuffer, whan they were ſubmitted wholly to theyr pleaſure.
            ¶ Lette vs (ſayde he) remembre, howe leauing theyr frendſhyp, we ſubmytted vs to Anniball: and not contented therwith, we ſlewe all the Romaynes lefte here in garriſon with vs. And to haue the certayne knowlege of theyr hartes and enuy towarde vs, lette vs call before vs theyr actes done of late agaynſt vs, and therby ye ſhall perceyue, what kyndnes we are lyke to haue at theyr handes. Anniball a ſtraunger, and theyr vtter enemy being in Italy, and the cuntrey on all partes fulfylled with warre: yet they leauyng Anniball, and all other theyr buſyneſſe, ſente bothe the conſulles with theyr whole armyes, to beſiege Capua, where we by longe contynuall kepyng of the ſame ſiege, are almoſt famiſhed with hunger.

but for further profe of theyr 
                  •••
               yee towarde vs, let vs conſyder, that although Anniball commyng to our ſuccours, had almoſte wonne theyr campes, ſayne many of theyr men, and put them in great ieopardy of loſing all that they had: yet all that ieoperdous peryll of loſſe neuer coulde moue theym to remoue theyr ſiege. Afterward whan he had paſſed the riuer of Vulturnus, bournynge the fieldes of Calenus theyr fath full frendes: yet coulde not the hurtes of them call the capitaynes from our myſerable ſiege. Ye than he cauſed his baners to be diſplayd before the walles of the citie of Rome, ſaying: that onles they wold leaue Capua, he wold take their high citie of Rome from them. Yet wolde they not leaue the ſiege of Capua, beares, wulues, and all wyld beaſtes, be they in neuer ſo great a rage and fury, if a man goo to their caues, where theyr yong whelpes lye: anone they wyll leaue al that they are aboute, and runne ſtreighte to the defence of theyr yonge: but the furyous Romaynes, whan Rome was compaſſed about with theyr enemies, nother for theyr wyues and their chyldren (whoſe lamentable wepinges myght be heard almoſte hither) nother for their houſes, the temples of their goddis, nor for feare of violating the Sepultures of theyr auncetours, coulde be withdrawen from the ſiege of Capua, ſo deſyrous they be to execute on vs greuous punyſhement: And ſo ſore they do thyrſt to drynke of our bludde. And but reaſon: for happily we ſhulde haue done lykewyſe to them, yf fortune had deſerued vs. Wherfore ſens it is the pleaſure of the goddis, that nedes I muſte dye: yet wylle I chuſe me a deathe, bothe honeſt and gentyll: wherby I wyll eſcape the tormentes and diſpites that myne ennemies truſte to put me vnto. Whan Fuluius and Claudius ſhall ſolempnely with triumph enter into Rome, I wyl not bounden be drawen before them as a ſpectacle or wondryng ſtocke, and after put in pryſon, or being tyed to a poſte, ſuffer my body to be ſcourged, and at laſt haue my head ſtryken from my body with the axe of Rome, nother will I lyue to ſe my cuntrey diſtroied & bourned, or to ſee the noble matrons and maidens of Capua rauiſhed and defouled. In the beginnyng of the flouriſhynge of the citie of Rome, the Romains diſtroyed the citie of Alba, and threwe it downe to the grounde: yet had they theyr originall from the ſame citie, what trowe ye than they wyl do

to Capua, whiche they hate more than they doo Carthage? Therfore frendes, ſo many of you as be deſyrous to dye, before ye ſe theſe ſo many and ſo ſpiteful miſeries, come this day to dyner with me, your meate is alredy dreſſed: and whā we be well filled with wyne and good meates, a cup of drynke, that I wyll fyrſt drinke my ſelfe, ſhall be borne about to euery one of you: and that drynke ſhall delyuer the body from tormentes, the mynde from rebukes, the eies and the eares frō the ſyght and hearyng of all cruell diſpites that be prepared for people that are ouercome. After whan we ſhall be deade, our ſeruauntes ſhall be redy to throwe our bodies into great fyres made for the purpoſe, there to be bourned, and ſo ſhall we neuer come into the handes of our enemies. This is the onely honeſt and free way to dye, wherby our ennemies ſhall meruaile and wonder at our noble courage. And Annibal ſhal therby well perceyue, that he hath forſaken and betrayde his valyant and faithfull felowes.
            ¶ This oration of Vibius was heard and wel alowed of many mo than had hartes to folowe it, or put it in execution. for the more part of the ſenatours ſaid, that they had oft tymes in warres had experience of the pitie and gentylneſſe of the Romaines ſhewed to their ennemies in ſuche extremitie, not myſtruſtyng, but they ſhulde fynde them mercyfull nowe to them, vpon humble requeſt to them made: and thervpon determined to ſend legatis to the cōſul, to yeld them vp Capua.
            ¶ Vibius Virius went home to his houſe to dyner, whome xxvii. ſenatours folowed, where they dyned, and drunke plē
               ty of wyne, to the intent they might haue the leſſe feelinge of the laſt dredefull drynke whan it came. At the laſt they all receiued the poyſon, and went from the table, taking eyther other by the handes, and louingly enbraſyng one an other, lamented their owne deathes, with the diſtruction of the cuntrey. Some remained there, and died, and were bourned in the fyres made for that intent: ſome went home to their houſes, and there made their ende: ſo that before the towne was deliuered to the Romaines, none of them were left on lyue.
            ¶ The next day the gates were opened, and the Romaines ſuffered to enter. Than were all the gates kepte by the Romains, that no man ſhuld go furth, and firſt all the armour and wepons were brought to the Romain capitain: than were the

Carthaginenſes of the garriſon taken and put in priſon. The ſenatours were cōmanded to go to the conſuls, than being in their tentes, from whens ſuch as were moſt conſenting to the receiuīg of Annibal, were ſent to ſūdry priſons .xxv. to Cales, and .xxviii. to Theanus, vntil it was agreed, what puniſhment they ſhuld haue. Their golde and ſyluer was brought in, and deliuered to the officers, called Queſtores. Claudius the cō
               ſull was moch inclined to take the ſenators to mercy: Fuluius on the other ſide wold haue them ſuffer, in example of other rebelles and traytours. Wherefore Claudius remitted all thing to the iugement of the ſenate of Rome, and ſent thither to knowe their pleaſure therin. Whervpon Fuluius, fearing leſt he ſhuld be ſtayed of his purpoſe, cōmanded the tribunes, with .ii. M. horſemen, to be redy to ride with him at the third blaſt of a trumpet. With this cōpany of horſmen in the night he departed from the army, and by that it was day light, came to Theanus, where cauſyng the ſenatours of Capua, there being priſoners, to be brought before him, incontinent be cauſed them to be violently ſcourged with roddes, and after to haue their heades ſtriken of. From thens, as faſt as he might he hied to Cales, and there likewiſe ſat vpon the iugement of the other ſenatours of Capua. but whiles they were going to execution, one came from the ſenate of Rome, riding in great haſt, with letters, willing him to ſtay the iudgement and execution of the puniſhment of the Cāpane ſenators. Than Fuluius iudging the letters to be writen for that intent, neuer diſcloſed them, but put them in his boſom, ſaying to the officers that they ſhuld procede quickly to the execution accordinge to the lawe: So were they alſo whipped, and after had their heades ſtryken of. Than the conſull drewe furth his letters, and redde them, ſaying they came very late, to let the thynge that was alredy done. From Cales he returned to Capua and there put diuers other in priſon, beſide many of the citie that were ſold. Thā was there great debate in the ſenate at Rome whether the citie of Capua ſhuld be burned and vtterly dyſtroyed, in exaumple of other rebelles or not. Moch it moued theym ſoo to doo, for that it was a greate and a ſtronge citie, and a very nere neyghbour vnto them: whych if it ſhuld be an ennemy agayne to Rome, as it late was, ſhould greatlye dyſquiete the Romaynes. Neuertheleſſe in concluſyon,

conſidering the fertilitie of the grounde, whiche was the beſt of all Italy, they agreed to vſe it to their profit, hauing plowmen laborers & other to manure and tyl the groundes, and the houſes to be inhabited with rude people, and menne of handy craftes: ſo that it ſhuld be a citie of no body politike, nor haue ſenatours, or other commune counſell or rulars, but onely a iudge yerely to be ſent from Rome, to miniſter iuſtice among them. By this meane was the citie preſerued from vtter dyſtruction, and the profite therof, with the fieldes adioyning, employed to the common profite of the Romains.
         
         
            ¶ Marcellus wynneth the citie of Syracuſa in Sicilia. P. Scipio, and Cneius Scipio are ſlayne in Spayn, with a great numbre of Romaines. Cap. xli.
            
               DVringe the buſines of Capua, and the warres about the ſame, fortune alſo fauoured the Romaines touching their affaires in Sicilia. For Marcellus, capitayne of the Romaines army there, ſo wiſely & circūſpectly gouerned him ſelf and his people, that he wan the noble city of Syracuſa. In whiche he had abundance of riches, as great as if he had taken the great citie of Carthage, with whyche (it was thought) in all thinges it might well as than haue ben compared. In the ende of the yere, whan the time of choſing of newe conſuls was come, Marcus Marcellus, for his wel proued experience, was choſen conſull, & appointed to match Anniball concerning the warres of Italy. And Marcus Valerius Leuinus was elect the other conſull: to whom thende of the warres of Sicilia were wholly cōmitted: who by his induſtry, and by the treaſon of certaine Numidians, wan the towne of Agrigentum, wherby he droue Hanno, Epicides, and all the army of Carthage out of Sicilia: and ſoone after brought the hole cuntrey into the ſubiection of the Romans.
            ¶ While the warres of Sicilia & about Capua were brought to this good paſſe, Cn. Scipio and Publius his brother, were as buſy in Spayne, but not with like ſucceſſe. They had coū
               ſailed togither, the ſommer folowing, ſo to folow the warres, that the Carthaginenſes ſhuld be cleane driuen out of Spain. And to be ſtronge inough therfore, they hyred .xxx. thouſand

men of warre of Celtiberia. The power of Carthage was diuided in .iii. armies, gouerned by thre capitaines, Aſdruball, the ſonne of Gyſgon, and Mago, theſe two capitaines lay .v. dayes iourney from the Romaine legions: the thyrd, whiche was Aſdruball, the ſonne of Amilcar, the auncient capitayne of the Carthaginenſes in that countreye, laye at Anniturgium, more neerevnto the Romaines: and hadde in pourpoſe the ſommer folowynge, to paſſe the mountaynes, to conueye his armye to Anniball. This his pourpoſe to lette, the two Scipios thought fyrſte to aſſayle hym aloone from his company, not doubtyng, but they were ſtronge inough ſo to doo. Their greatteſt feare was, leſt whan they had ouercome him, that the other Haſdruball and Mago, hearyng therof, wolde flee into the mountaynes and ſtraytes with their power, and ſo prolonge the warres in Spayn. Wherfore to make an ende of all theyr trouble at ones, they concluded to part their armies in twayne, P. Cornelius with two partes ſhulde goo agaynſt the two capitaines that lay togither. And Cn. Scipio with the thyrde part of theyr olde army, and with the Celtiberians ſhulde aſſaile the other Aſdruball, the ſonne of Amilcar. With theſe mindes they ſet furth togither toward their ennemies. Cn. Scipio whan he came to Aniturgium, reſted with his company in the ſyght of his enemies, hauyng a riuer betwene hym and them: his brother went furthe, as it was agreed betwene them. Aſdruball perceiuing the numbre of the Romayns to be but ſmall: and that all their ſtrengthe was in ſtrangers late hyred, knowing the faccion of the people, how vntrue and vnſtable they were: by the meane of Spaniardes, that coulde ſpeake the language, for great ſummes of money he corrupted the princis & rulars of them: ſo that they were agreed to departe home with theyr hole power. They were not deſyred or hyred to vndertake the warres with Aſdrubal againſt the Romaines, but onely to depart without fighting. Whervnto they were ſone intreated, partly for that they had as large wages as though they ſhuld haue foughten: And agayne for that they were gladde to retourne home to theyr cuntreys and frendes, auoyding the danger of warre. Therfore ſodaynely they with their baners and caryage departed. The Romaines meruayling what this ſodaine chaunge ment, enquired of them the cauſe of their departure. They anſwered,

they were ſent for home to defende theyr owne cuntrey whiche was oppreſſed alſo with warre. Other anſwere could they none gette: nother were the Romaynes able to kepe them with force. Scipio knowyng, that without theym he was nothynge able to encounter Aſdruball, and alſo ſeynge no waye howe he myghte recouer the companye of his brother: his ennemies beinge ſoo nere, and commynge on hym, was meruaylouſly aſtonied: yet he thought beſte, in no wyſe to meete with hym on euen grounde, he was ſoo farre ouermatched. Wherfore a lyttell and a lyttell he with drewe him backe, ſekyng ſome place of ſtrength, where he myghte ſuccour hym ſelfe and his ſmall company. That perceiuing Haſdruball paſſed the ryuer with his hooſte, and folowed after, with as moche ſpeede as he could.
            ¶ Nowe was P. Scipio his brother as moche troubled on his parte, by reaſon of Maſſaniſſa, a yong luſty prince of Numidia, who beinge than a frende to the Carthaginenſes, was comme with a good power of Numidians to the ſuccour of Mago and Haſdruball the ſonne of Gyſgon, he was fiers and of a greatte courage, the Romaynes coulde nother goo abrode for vitayles, woode, or ſuche neceſſaries, but he with his Numidians was euer redy to oppreſſe them: and dyuers tymes in the nyght he wolde aſſayle theym in theyr campe, as people that were beſieged. There was alſo tydinges brought to Scipio, that one Indibilis, with ſeuen thouſande, and fyue hundred Sueſſanes, was at hande, commynge to the healpe of the Carthaginenſes: whoſe army beinge ioyned to the other, he knewe he ſhulde be more ſtraightly encloſed. Wherfore, compelled by neceſſitie to ſerche the compaſſe of his wytte, he determyned ſecretely to take the greatter part of his armye to meete with this Indibilis in the nyghte, intendynge, where ſoo euer he mette with hym, to gyue hym battaylle, he lefte Titus Fonteius, with a certayne with hym, to keepe the campe. And goynge on his waye aboute mydnyght he met with Indibilis and ſodaynly aſſayled hym. There was a fyerſe conflycte for a ſeaſon: And by the ſodayne ſettynge on theym, the Romaynes hadde putte theym to flyghte with greatte ſlaughter, hadde not the Numidian horſemenne, who alwayes awayted on the Romaynes

where ſoo euer they wente) on bothe partes ſodeynly aſſayled theym: yet Scipio ſoo pryuily was in the nyght departed, that he hadde thought therby to haue begiled the Numidians watchemen. Than the battail being renued agayn, Mago and Aſdruball with their hoſtes folowing after, were at theyr backes: ſo that the Romaynes knew not to whiche were beſt to tourne them. Scipio ſtille comforted and exhorted his men, and euer where the battaile was moſte ſtronge, thyther went he lyke a noble and valiant gouernour, tyll at the laſt hym ſelfe was thyrſt into the ryght ſyde with a ſpeare, ſo that he fell dead from his hors. Whan the Carthaginenſes ſawe the Romayne capitayne falle, incontinent they ranne abrode in all the partes of the fielde ioyfully cryinge, Scipio the capitayne of the Romaines is ſlayne. The fame wherof gaue hart to the Carthaginenſes, and cauſed the Romaynes to flee. but in the flyght there were mo ſlayne than in the batail. The Numidian horſmen were ſo fierſe in the chaſe, and the footemen hauyng lyght harneis were almoſt as ſwyft as the horſes. So that yf the nyght had not come on theym, fewe or none had eſcaped. The Carthaginenſes after this victory ſlept not nor ſtayde, but to folowe theyr good occaſyon offered, incontinent toke theyr horſes, and went to the other Haſdruball, the ſonne of Amilcar, not doutyng of good ſpede there alſo. After that both theyr powers were mette togyther, there was great ioye made betweene the capiteynes bothe for theyr metynge, and alſo for the newes of theyr late victory.
            ¶ On the other ſyde the Romayns were ſtryken with feareful penſifenes, not for any knowlege that they had of the loſſe of their company, for there was ſuch ſpede made by theyrennemies, that worde thereof coulde not ſo ſoone be broughte them: but their feare was as it were through an inwarde and ſecrete iudgement in theyr hartes, of ſomme euyll chaunce that was happed vnto theym. Agayne Cn. Scipio ſeing the hoſte of his ennemyes encreaſed, by the commynge of Mago and Aſdruball, meruailed howe they ſhulde conuey theyr armye thyther ſo ſoone without battayle, onleſſe his brother were ſlayne. He meruayled alſoo, that his brother, nother dydde lette their commynge thyther, nother yet dydde appere folowynge theym. For he knewe, yf he were on lyne,

he wolde make haſte to come and ioyne his army vnto his. In this great trouble of mynde, he thoughte to withdrawe hym as moche as he myght. Wherefore in the nyght he was gone a good ſpace of grounde, but in the dawnyng of the daye, the Numidians were ware of their departing, and folowed with their horſes, ſo that long before nyght they ouertoke theym, aſſayling them now on the one ſide, now on the other, and ſomtyme behynde them: but euer Scipio cauſed theym to keepe good aray, and to go euer forewarde in their fightynge, to be out of the daunger of the footemen of their enemies that folowed them: but the horſemen ſo vexed them on all partes, that they could not go farre. Wherfore Scipio gathered his ſmall company vp to a lytell hyll, the beſt that he coulde there eſpy for his aduātage. There he toke this order. theyr ſtuffe and cariage was brought into the myddell of the hoſt, and the horſemen ſette about the ſame: without them were the foote men, who ſaued the other from the inuaſion of the Numidian horſemen, tyl the reſt of the Carthaginenſes were come. But than Scipio ſeing hym ſelfe ſo vnable to reſiſt .iii. capitaynes and their great hoſtes, began to diuiſe, howe he might by any meanes caſt a trenche about his campe, or make ſome hedge to defende them from the inuaſions of theyr enemies: but thā was the hyll ſo bare, and the grounde ſo ſtony, that no buſhes or thornes coulde there be gathered, nor turues dygged, or any trenche made: and the hyll it ſelfe was ſo flatte, that they coulde by no maner of way let the commyng vp of their enemies. Than Scipio to make ſome ſhewe of a defence aboute the campe, deuiſed to lay his packes and groſſe cariage in cō
               paſſe of the campe one vpon an other, and thervppon he cauſed the packſaddels and other fardels to be tyed: wherby he rayſed the walles of his campe of a good height.
            ¶ Whan the hoſtes of the Carthaginenſes were come, they aſcended that ſmall hyll with lyttel peyne: but than ſeing that ſtraunge kynde of fortifieng the campe, which they had neuer before ſene, they were amaſed, and ſtayde for a ſeaſon. The capitaynes perceiuyng theyr ſodayne ſtoppe and wondryng, cried on al partes to them, ſaying, that it was great ſhame for them to be ſo longe or they coulde plucke downe and deface ſuche a fond deuiſe and mockery, wherwith children and women wold not ſo long haue ben ſtayed. Go to it therfore with

courage (ſayd they) for your ennemies lye lurkyng behynde thoſe packes. With theſe rebukes of the capitaines, they aſſayed to enter on all partes. And though a greate whyle they were lette and troubled therabout, at the laſt in diuers partis they entred, ſo few in numbre could no longer endure againſt ſo many. The campe was wonne, and many were ſlain, wherof Cn. Scipio the noble capitayne was one, a good number ſledde into the woodes, that were next vnto them, and ſo eſcaped, and came into the tentes of Publius Scipio, whyche than were kept by T. Fonteius. Thus were bothe the bretherne and capytaynes of the Romaynes in Spayne, ſlayne within the ſpace of .xxx. dayes: whoſe death was greatly lamented, both at Rome and alſo in Spain. And it was thought at their death, that the hole army of the Romaines in Spayn was vtterly brought to confuſyon, and that countrey thereby brought out of the Romaynes handes.
         
         
            ¶ L. Martius is choſen capitaine of the Romaine army, he maketh an oration to his ſouldiours, and in one nyghte and a day vanquiſheth .ii. hoſtes of Carthaginenſes, winneth their campes, and a greate praye. Capit. xlii.
            
               IN all this peryll and ieoperdous eſtate, one man was founde in the army, by whoſe witte courage and fortune the honour and welthe of the Romaynes was ſaued and reſtored. And that was Lucius Martius, the ſonne of Septinius, a freſhe yonge man and an actiue. This Martius hadde longe ben in the warres vnder C. Scipio, and of hym had learned moche experience and policy in the gouernance of an army. And nowe, ſeing all thinges almoſte deſperate, he gathered togither ſuch ſouldiours, as by fleing were eſcaped from the laſt bataile, and alſo aſſembled a good numbre of men of warre out of dyuers townes and fortreſſes, whiche were vnder the obedience of Rome. With all theſe he came to the tentes of T. Fonteius, ioynyng all the Romaines power togither, and in ſhort ſpace his name and honour was ſo exalted, that by the whole conſent of the ſouldyours of the army, he was choſen to be their capitayne and guyde. Whervpon he incontinent applied himſelfe

buſyly to make ſure theyr campe, and alſo to make good prouiſyon for vitayles of all ſortes. To whoſe pleaſure and commaundement all the men of the hoſte gladly obeyed: Neuertheleſſe, whan they hearde, that Haſdruball the ſonne of Gyſgon, was at hande with his army, myndynge to dyſtroye vtterly all the Romaynes that were lefte: and alſo whan they ſawe theyr newe capitayne, makynge redy his people, and auauncyng his ſtanderdes: they than remembryng theyr olde noble capytaines, and the great power, wherwith they were wont to go to all batayles, coulde not forbeare to wepe and lament theyr myſhappe, in ſuche wyſe, that nother theyr pety capitaynes, nor yet Martius hym ſelfe, myght appeaſe them: yet dyd they ſometime rebuke theyr feminine and vnprofitable wepinges, ſometyme ſtyrre them to defende them ſelues and their countrey, and alſo to reuenge the deathe of theyr olde noble capitaynes of late ſlayne. Whyle they thus were ſpendyng the tyme vnprofytably, theyr ennemies were at hande, and redye to aſſaile them, and to enter into their campes, but than the Romaines, tournyng their teares to a furious rage, in haſte toke their armure and weapons, and not only defended the entries of their campe, but alſo iſſued out fierſely, and ranne on their ennemies, whiche kepte no very good aray, ſo littell they myſtruſted any ſuch reſiſtence. This ſodayne iſſuing out of them cauſed the Carthaginenſes to be ſtriken with a feare, and alſo to meruaile, howe the Romaine hoſte was ſo ſhortly encreaſed, whiche ſo late was almooſte wholly ſlayn and put to vtterance. They muſed alſo of their ſodayne courage and hardyneſſe, and what newe capytaine they myght haue to truſte on, the two Scipios beinge ſlaine. In that feare and dout they beganne ſomwhat to giue backe, and than the Romaines folowed vppon them, ſoo that they were conſtrayned to flee, and in that flyght many of them hadde bene ſlayne, or elles the folowers hadde bene putte to greatte hurte and dyſpleaſure, by theyr faſte purſuite, hadde not Martius hym ſelfe ſounde the retreate, and halfe agaynſte theyr wylles ſtayed theym frome the chaſe, and broughte theym backe to theyr tentes, beynge ſtyll hotte, fyerſe, and deſyrous, by ſlaughter to reuenge theym on their enenmies. The Carthaginenſes fledde faſte for a ſeaſon: but at the laſte, ſeynge noo manne to folowe them, thought

that they for feare durſte noo longer purſue theym. Wherefore they made noo more ſuche haſte, but wente ſoftely to theyr campe, and whanne they were come thither, they alſo regarded not greatly the good watche and kepynge therof, but lefte all thinges negligently and vnſurely, nothynge myſtruſting their ennemies that were at hande, for that they demed them to be but the remenaunt and leauynges of two hoſtes lately beaten, nowe beynge gathered togyther again. This neglygence of the Carthaginenſes was knowen to Martius by eſpies. Wherefore he (at the fyrſte apparance) ſemed rather raſſhely than boldly to enterpryſe the night folowinge to inuade theym in theyr tentes and fielde, thinking it more eaſye for him to wynne the campe of Haſdruball alone, beinge ſodainly taken and vnprouided, than he ſhoulde be able to defende his owne campe and fielde, if he taried tyll the .iii. capitaines of the Carthaginenſes, and theyr arinies, were ioyned togither agayne, Neuertheleſſe before he wold ſodainly and in the night time enterpriſe ſo high a feate, he thought fyrſt to make his companye priuie therof, and alſo to make vnto them an oration, whiche he began in this wiſe.
            ¶ The greatte loue that I haue euer borne vnto oure good capytaynes (louynge ſouldiours) as welle whan they were onlyue, as alſo nowe they are deade, and our preſente fortune at this tyme is ſufficient to perſwade any man, that this greatte authoritie and rule, which of your goodnes, ye haue gyuen me, is both weighty and full of care and troubles. For although my mynde be ſore troubled and diſquieted, that it can almoſte at no tyme fynde any comfort or conſolation, but onely whan feare dryueth away the ſorowes thereof: yet in my dolour, I onely am conſtrayned to comforte and relieue you all of your ſorowes. Neyther whan I am deuyſynge, by what meanes I may ſaue and preſerue the leauynges of the two Romaines hoſtes, for the wealthe of the countrey, can I at any tyme be quitte and ridde of my ſorowes. For euen thanne the two Scipios bothe by daye and by nyghte, doo vexe and trouble me: ſommetyme in dreames they appeere vnto me, and many tymes they awake me out of my ſlepes, cōmanding me, not to leaue them, nor yet their noble ſouldiours your cōpanions, nor the cōmon welth vnreuenged. And for that intent, they will me to folow the rules and diſcipline,

that they haue taught me: And as (whiles they were lyuing) there was no man more obedient to their commandement thā I was: ſo lykewyſe, now they ar departed, I ſhall always be as glad to do that thyng, which I do ſuppoſe they wold haue done, yf they werehere with vs lyuing. And I wold ye ſhuld not thynke it beſt (worthy warriours) to mourne and weepe for theym, as though they were cleane deade, ſens they lyue perpetually through the noble fame of their honorable actes: but whan ſo euer ye ſhall, going to battayle, remembre any of them, I wolde haue you ſo vahantly fight, as though ye ſawe them ſetting furthe before you with baners diſplayde, and exhortyng you to wyn honour. Such an imagination cauſed you yeſterday ſo manfully to vanquyſſhe and put to flyght youre enemies. Wherfore I am moche deſyrous to proue, whether you, that were ſo hardy for your owne pleaſure, dare now vndertake as moche at the deſyre and exhortation of me youre capitayne. For yeſterday, whan I called you backe from the chaſe of your enmies, I dyd it not to plucke downe your ſtomakes, or to quench your noble courage: but only to deferre the ſame to your more and greatter honour, and alſo better oportunitie: to the intente that you beinge prepared therfore, may aſſayle theym vnpurueyde for the ſame, that you armed, may take them vnarmed and a ſlepe. Our enemies thinke nothyng leſſe, than to beinuaded of vs in their campe, whome they accompt as people beſieged within our owne campe, let vs nowe therfore enterpryſe that, whiche no man will thinke, that we dare enterpryſe. And that ſhall be founde moſte eaſy, that ſemed moſte harde to be compaſſed: I my ſelfe wyll be your guide in the dead of the night, and leade you ſo ſecretly, and with ſuche ſilence, that we wyll be within theyr campe, er they ſhalbe ware of our comming. I am aſcertained, that they kepe no watche nor order. Their campe ſhall we wyn at the fyrſt brunt.: And than let me ſee you make the ſlaughter amonge them, that you intended yeſterday to haue made, whā againſt your wylles I called you back frō the purſuit of thē: wherwith ye were than very angry. This enterpriſe I know to be very great and hardy: but in ſuche neceſſitie ſuche coū
               ſels are beſt. For whan occaſion is offred, and oportunitie ſerueth, it muſte be taken: or els it wyll flee away without recouerie. One of theyr armies is here at hande, and two other

are not farre henſe. Nowe yf we aſſayle this one hoſte, there may we fynde oportunitie and haue ſome equall matche. Ye haue alredy yeſterday aſſayed bothe your owne ſtrength and theyrs: but in caſe we delay it, beinge contented with yeſterdays honour, it is ieoperdy, leſt all the capitayns, with their powers come togither: and than howe ſhall we be able to ſuſtein the power of thre armies with their gouernours, whom Cn. Scipio, with his army was not able to withſtand? as by diuyding their hoſtes our two noble capitaynes were ſlayne: lykewyſe our enemies beinge diuided & ſeuered, may by vs be oppreſſed. Other way is there none for vs to take nowe: but only to loke for the oportunitie of this next night. Wherfore in the name of the goddis go ye now to your reſtes, and cheriſhe your bodies, that whan I call on you, you being ſtrong and luſty, maye enter into the campe of your ennemies, with the ſame hertes and courage, that of late ye defended your owne Campe.
            ¶ This newe counſaile of the newe capitayn was wel heard, and ſo moche the more ioyfully receiued, by howe moche the acte ſemed to be more bolde and hardy. Wherfore they prepared all thynges in a redyneſſe for the departure, and reſted them ſelues the reſt of the day, and a good part of the night. Than Martius cauſed them to be called vp, and ſette theym ſecretely on the way forwarde, aboute thre of the clocke after mydnyght. Than was there an other armye of the Carthaginenſes ſeuen myles beyonde the campe of Haſdruball, the ſonne of Gyſgon, and in the myddes of that waye there was a holowe valeye, and therin a lyttell woode. Into this woode had Martius ſent an embuſhement of Romaine horſemen, to receyue ſuche as fledde frome the fyrſte campe, and wolde eſcape to the other. And whan he demed the ſaid embuſhement to be come thither, he with the reſt of his company, went to the next campe, where fynding no watche nor reſiſtence, they entred the tentes as eaſily as they might haue done into theyr owne. Than ſodainly they blew vp their trum pettes, and made great clamour and noyſe: ſome ſlewe their ennemies ſlepyng, ſome ſet the tentes on fyre, many kept the entre or gates of the campe, that none ſhulde iſſue out. Thus with ſodayne noyſe, fyre, and ſlaughter, the other were ſo amaſed, that they wyſt not what to do. They that fledde to the

gates were there receiued of armed men and ſlaine, whan they perceiued the gates ſo hepte, many to ſaue their liues lep touer the dyches or cloſures of the campe, thynking to flee to the next campe of the Carthaginenſes, and they were alſo receiued of the Romayn embuſhement and ſlayne, ſo that none eſcaped. And if any had eſcaped, they could not haue brought word of the newes to the other campe, before the Romaines came theym ſelues: ſuche ſpede they made to go to the ſecōd campe, after they had ſo ſlaine and oppreſſed them of the firſt fielde. Thus in the breake of the day, they came to the ſecond campe, where they found all thinges more vnready, then in the fyrſte: ſome were gone forthe for woode, ſome on for ragynge, ſome for vytailes, many walked vp and downe before the gate of the campe vnarmed, many were layed downe to take theyr reſte: the Romaynes, beynge yet fyers of theyr late victory, ſlewe fyrſte ſuche as made reſyſtence at the entre of the campe, and after they entred and made great ſlaughter. With this great noyſe, many aroſe and armed them, and came to the defence of their fyelde, and thereby the battayle for a ſeaſon was cruel and ſtronge: but as ſone as they perceyued the freſhe blodde on the Romayns ſhyeldes, whyche was a ſygne of the deathe of their companye, they were ſtryken with ſuche feare, that they fledde as many as myght ſundry wayes, ſo that nyght and morninge Martius vanquyſhed ii. of the hoſtes of the Carthaginenſes, and flewe .xxxvii. M. men, and .i. M. and .viii. C. were taken. He wanne alſo their tentes, wherein was a ryche praye. Amonge other thynges there he founde a helmette of ſyluer, waying .C. xxxviii. vnces, and therevppon was grauen the Image of Haſdruball, the ſonne of Amylcar: whiche helmet was ſent to the ſenate of Rome, and kepte long after in the Capitolie, for an honorable monumēt or remembrance of the victory of Martius. And after his tyme it was called Martius helmet, vnto the tyme of the burning of the Capitolye. After theſe great harmes and loſſes, bothe gyuen and taken on bothe partes, they ceaſſed warryng for a whyle in Spayne, neyther party beyng haſtye to put al in ieopardye, tylle they were ſure of more ſocours.
         
         
            
            ¶ How Haſdrubal being encloſed in the 
                  ••
               raightes beſyde Mentiſſa, eſcaped the daunger thereof by mockyng his ennemies: and of the choſyng of yong P. Corn. Scipio to be capitain in Spayne. Ca. 43.
            AFter the ſubduing of Capua, Appius Claudius Nero the conſul, with an army of .xii. M. fotemen, and .xi. C. horſemen, was ſent into Spayn: where receyuing alſo the hoſt that was before with Martius & Fonteius, he toke the way toward Haſdrubal the ſon of Amilcar, that lay with his army at a place called the Blacke ſtone, betwe
                  •
               e the town of Illiturgus and Mentiſſa, whiche was a place ſo encloſed, that there was no waye to iſſewe out, but at certayne ſtreytes, whiche ſtreites Claudius Nero at his fyrſte comynge, cauſed to be wel and ſtrongly kepte, that the other ſhoulde by no waye eſcape, but at his pleaſure. Haſdruball perceiuing him ſelfe to be encloſed on all partes, fearyng his eſcape from thens, ſent incontinente an harrold to the conſull, with faithfull promeſſe, that in caſe he wolde ſuffre him and his company to departe out of that ſtreytes, without further battell or trouble, he wolde be contented forthwith to departe oute of Spayne, with al the army of Carthage, and leaue the countrey holly to the Romayns. This his large offer Nero gladly receyued, and the next daie folowynge was appoynted for a communication to be had betwene them, of the condicions of delyuerynge of the caſtels and fortreſſes, whiche they had in poſſeſſion, and what day ſhould be appoynted for the Carthaginenſes garryſons to departe with their baggage, withoute gile or fraude, from the ſaid caſtels and townes, and the other to be receyued in their places. When they were agreed on this communication, al the ſame night Haſdruball cauſed many of his hoſt, with all his groſſe and heauy cariage, to be ſent forth by the ſayde ſtreyghtes, beyng then not ſo ſtreitly kept and watched. Euer forſeyng, that there ſhoulde not ouer many departe at ones that nyght, to the intent the ſmallenes of the noumbre, by makynge ſmalle noyſe, myght with their ſylence deceiue his ennemies, and alſo the better to eſcape the narrowe and vncaſy wayes of the ſtreighte paſſages.
            The day folowing the conſul and he had long communication, and bokes were wrytten of thynges of ſmalle importaunce,

tyll it drewe towarde nyght: and then they agreed to mete the nexte mornyng, to fyniſhe theyr deuyſes. This nyght alſo Haſdruball beſtowed, in ſending furth many mo of his hoſt, & more of his cariage then he dyd the nyght before. The next metyng alſo was in lyke maner in vayne, the tyme waſted and ſpente in deuiſes of couenauntes: and euer in the nyght he ſent of his footemen and ſtuffe out of daunger.
            ¶ Thus in reaſonyng and debatyng, dyuerſe dayes were employed, tyll all his footemen and cariage were eſcaped. And when a great parte of his hoſt was by this illuſion eſcaped, then began Haſdruball more to ſtaye, and be ſtyffe in the agreing of couenauntes, in ſo muche that he began to diſſent from dyuers artycles, whervnto he had before aſſented. For as his feare was leſſed, his faythe alſo decreſſed. The next morning there appered a great and darke myſte vpon the ground, as wel on the hilles as on the valeys, whiche ſerued wel Haſdruball for his purpoſe. For he, thinking then his good houre to be come, ſent to Nero the conſull, aduertyſing hym, that the ſame day was, and euer had ben kepte bye holy and ſacred amonge the Carthaginenſes: ſo that in the ſame it was not lawfull for hym, to trauayle about any buſyneſſe. Wherfore he deſyred the communication to be deferred tyll the daie folowyng. The conſull yet thynkyng no fraude or deceite to be in the meſſage, agreed thervnto. And then Haſdruball with ſpede iſſued out of the ſtrayte with the reſte of his hoſte, horſemen & Eliphantes, with as ſmall noiſe as he could make, and was paſſed all daunger, before the daye waxed clere. But whē the ſon began to appere, thē Nero perceiuing the campe of the Carthaginenſes to be voyde, and knowyng many feſtly of theyr departure, with theyr vntrueth and his mocke and illuſion, he made as muche ſpede as he coulde to folowe his ennemyes, with a feruent deſyre to fyght, yf he myght ouertake them. But they were in ſafegarde, er he myght atteine vnto theym, without any thyng doyng, onleſſe it were ſmall ſkirmiſſhes betwene the taile of the hoſt of the Carthaginenſes and the lyght foreryders of the Romayne armie.
            ¶ The ende of the yere drewe nere, and the tyme of choſyng of offycers began to approche: at whiche election Marcus Marcellus, and Marcus Valerius Leuinus were choſē conſulles. Then the ſenate of Rome, with no leſſe diligence delibered

of the affayres of Spayne, then they dyd of the eſtate of Italie, for the ſauegarde wherof they determyned to augment the armie, that was there with Nero the conſull, and to ſende alſo with the ſame a newe capitayne, whom they called a proconſull. But all theyr doubte was, whom they ſhulde aſſygne to that office, to ſuccede in the place of two ſo noble capitaynes, as were of late there ſlayne, in the ſpace of .xxx. dayes. The daie was appoynted for the commune election of this capitayne, by voyce of the ſenatours and alſo of the communes. Some loked, when many valiant men woulde haue offered them ſelues therto for the wealth of their countrey: But none was founde amonge them, that wolde enterpryſe to take on hande that great & perillous charge. The citezens by great aſſembles mette at the daye and place appoynted for the nomination. At whiche daye the noble men loked one vppon an other, as people amaſed and deſtitute of counſayle in ſuche perplexitie, lamenting the ſore decaye of the ſtate of the citie.
            ¶ When none coulde be found amonge them, worthy for that rome or office: then ſodeinly yonge P. Cornelius Scipio, the ſonne of him that was before ſlayne in Spaine, being then but xxiiii. yeres old, ſtode vp in an high place, where al mē myght well ſee and beholde hym, and deſyred, that the ſame offyce myght be gyuen vnto hym. when he had declared his mynde, anon the hole multitude of all eſtates gaue to hym their conſent, criyng: Luckie be his empire in Spayne.
            ¶ Soone after his haſtie election a ſodeyne ſylence was amonge the multitude, and then all men began ſecretly with them ſelues to conſyder their haſte in their nomination, meruaylyng, and alſo forthinkyng, that they had more fauoured the perſon through affection, then they did conſider his youth by theyr reaſon, many miſlyked the fortune that had happed to his ſtocke and familie in the ſame countrei before, and ſome were ſorye to ſende one of the ſame kyn and name, to gouerne the countreie, where his father and vncle were ſlayne and lay buryed.
            ¶ When yonge Scipio perceyued their ſilence, and repentaunce of their haſtie election, he deſired them a lyttell to giue him audience. And there he made them ſuch an oration, in the excuſe of his age, and concerning the rule and affayres to him

commytted, with ſuch an herte and courage, that he not onely enflamed their hertes with more ardent deſyre and loue towarde hym, but alſo he fulfylled them with a certeyne hope of proſperous ſucceſſe in his empyre. For the yonge man, beſyde many his marueylous vertues and good qualities, wher with he was naturally indewed, he had alſo from his infancie a wonderfull counning or gifte in the noble auauncing and ſettyng furth of the ſame. Somtime amonge the commune people he woulde ſhewe certayne dreames or viſions, that he had in the nyght: ſometime he woulde declare vnto them thinges that he was commanded inwardly by the goddes to execute. Theſe and ſuch lyke his ſtraunge wordes, with the maner and facion of lyuing after he was fyrſte put in auctoritie, ſhewed ſuche a magnificence in hym, that the commune people both had an opinion, and alſo publyſſhed the ſame, that Scipio was deſcended of the ſtocke or kynred of the goddes. Inuentyng a lyke fable of his conception to be by the ſeede of a ſerpent or ſnake, as heretofore hath ben fayned of great Alexander: affyrming, that the ſimilitude of the ſame hath ben dyuers times ſeen in his mothers chamber: but ſo ſoone as any man entred her ſayde chaumbre, it dyd ſodaynly glide and vanyſhe away.
            ¶ This fayned inuention of his conception, and the ſuperſtitious myndes of the people towarde hym, he woulde nother affyrme to be true, nother ſaye they were falſe and vntrewe: but couertly left them to dwell ſtyll in theyr owne opinions: wherby all men had ſuche an admiration of hym, that they ſuffred hym to enioy that great roume, that els was full vnmete for that his yong age. The army, that ſhuld be vnder hym in Spayne, was increaſed tenne thouſand fotemen, and one. M. horſemen: and M. Iulius Sullanus was appoynted to helpe hym in all his buſy affayres of charge.
            ¶ With this newe army and a nauy of .xxx. ſhyppes, he departed out of Italy, makyng great ſpede, tylle he arryued in Spayne: where he gathered togither all the power that remained there before, and ſo ſobrely handled him ſelf to al men, that in his woordes they iudged to be bothe a royall maieſtie, and a ſtedfaſt faythfulnes. He prayſed moch the ſouldiours, whiche he founde there, fyrſt for that not withſtanding theyr ii. great loſſes of men & capitayns, yet they kept ſtill that cuntrey, defendyng manfully their frendis, and many their cities

of the ſame: and alſo that they ſuffred not theyr ennemies to enioy the proſperous fortune, whiche by the loſſe of the Romayns was ones gyuen them: Thyrdly, for that they had driuen their ennemies to forſake theyr abode on this lide the water of Iberus. But aboue all other, he had Lucius Martius in great honour and veneration. And anon after his cōmyng, he beſtowed his newe menne of warre, to places where they ſhuld remaine for the winter ſeaſon, and he hym ſelfe, after all thinges were ordinately diſpoſed, went to Tarracon.
            ¶ The fame of Scipio was no leſſe among his ennemies, thā it was among his frendes. They alſo had a certaine feare of hym, coniecturyng, as it were by ſecrete diuination, the likely ſucceſſe of thynges that were to enſue. They feared hym before they hadde cauſe, and they feared hym the more, by how moche the cauſe or reaſon of theyr feare was hydde and vnknowen. And in this perplexitie of mynde, they departed their armies, and went to dyuers partes for the wynter ſeaſon. Haſdruball the ſonne of Gyſgon, went to the ſea, toward the pyllars of Hercules: Mago kept the myddell of the cuntrey, and Haſdruball the ſonne of Amilcar, lay nigh the riuer of Iberus, not farre from Sagunt.
         
         
            ¶ The oration of Scipio to his ſouldyours in Spayne, after his commyng thyther. Cap. xliiii.
            IN. the ſpryng of the yere P. Scipio cōmanded all his ſhyppes, furniſhed with men vitailes and munimentes of warre, to mete hym at the mouthe of the ryuer of Iberus: where he with the reſt of his hoſte, cominge by lande from Tarracon, mette them. And there thinkyng it neceſſary to hym, to declare his mynde to the olde ſouldyours that were lefte in Spayne, after the laſte great loſſe and ſlaughter of the Romaynes, he called them togyther, and made his oration as hereafter foloweth.
            ¶ There was neuer newe capitayn before me, that had cauſe to gyue thankes vnto his ſouldyours, before he hadde tryed theyr hardines and diligence in bataile: but fortune hath boūd me vnto you (louinge ſouldiours) before I knewe this countreye, or ſawe the place of our Campe. Fyrſte for the loue and obedience that ye haue borne to my father and mine vncle

bothe quycke and deade: ſecundarily for that, whan the hole countrey was as loſte, by reaſon of the greate diſtruction of our people: yet you by your noble vertue and myghte, haue obteyned the poſſeſſion of the ſame agayne, bothe to the Romaynes, and alſo to me theyr deputie here, and ſucceſſour to my ſayd father and vncle. But now, ſens through the fauour of the goddis we intende to worke, not that we may dwell in Spayne ſtyll our ſelues, but that the Carthaginenſes ſhall haue no dwellyng here: Nother onely to reſtraine them, that they ſhall not come on this ſyde the bankes of the water of Iberus: but that we intend to paſſe the ſame floode with our army, to gyue them battayle. I feare, leſt it ſhall be thoughte by you, that this my counſayle is more hardy (and ſpoken after myne age) than wyſe, conſyderynge the late loſſe that we haue had here, wherby the tyme ſhuld not ſerue vs to vndertake ſuche great enterpryſes. There is noo manne hath more cauſe than I, to remembre our euyll fortune in batayle in Spayne, who haue had both my father and myne vncle ſlayne here, within the ſpace of thyrty days, as ye wold ſay, to make here a heape of corps of our family one vpon an other. Neuertheleſſe, as the loſſe and lacke of frendes is diſpleaſant to the mynde of men, euen ſo doth fortune and noble vertuouſe courage forbyd a man, in ſuche caſe to diſpayre, ſpecially ſens thorough fatall fortune our chaunce hath heretofore bene, that after we haue bene beaten and ſuſteined great loſſes in the beginning: yet at the laſt we haue euer ouercome our ennemies, that before ſuppreſſed vs. I wyll not reherſe the olde hyſtories of our warres with Porſena, with the Frenchmen, and with the Samnites: I wyll onely remembre the warres with theſe our ennemies the Carthaginenſes, how many nauies of ſhyppes, howe many capitaynes, and howe many armies loſt we in the fyrſt battayles, that we had with theym, before the tyme of this Anniball? And nowe in his tyme at Trebia, at Traſymenus, and at Cannas, what other thinges did appere, other than hole armyes with theyr capitaynes and Romayne Conſuls ſlayne? Furthermore, howe great a parte of Italy, of Sardinia, and Sicilia haue forſaken the Romaynes, to folowe the amitie of Anniball? and how nigh the citie of Rome pytched he his campe? ye he hym ſelf was ſene almoſt to ride hard to the gates of Rome. In all the tyme of this great ruyne and hard fortune, the hertes, the vertue and courage of

of the Romaynes remayned ſtyl ſtedfaſt hole and vnmouable: wherby they haue ben euer ſuſteyned and ſet vp agayne. After the cruell batayle of Cannas, Haſdruball, with a great armye was goynge ouer the mountaynes into Italye, to helpe his brother Anniball, and to ioyne theyr powers together: whych if he had done, accordynge to his intent, there hadde by thys day ben almoſt no memorye or name of the Romayns left. But then ye hardy ſouldyours, by the gouernaunce of my father, withſtode theim, and by your good fortune ſo wel ſped there, that therby the euel chaunces, which before hapned vs, were wel releued, and nowe, through the goodnes of the goddes are dayly more ioyfull and proſperous. In Sicilia the great cities of Syracuſa and Agrigentum, be wonne agayn, and the hole Ile brought vnto the obedience of the Romaines, and our ennemies clene expulſed. In Italy Capua is taken, & the Arpines brought again vnder the ſubiection of Rome. And Anniball in gret feare fleing frō Rome, is nowe bryuen into an angle of the countrey of the Brutians, where the dayly prayer that he maketh to the goddes aboue al thinges is, that he may ſafe and ſound eſcape without daunger out of the countrey of his ennemies. Wherfore frendes, there is nothyng more vnmete or more contrary to reaſon, then that you, who haue in al aduerſitie and lowe ebbe, when the goddes were them ſelues almoſt on Annibals partie, & yet by the guyding of my father and frendes, haue ſuſteyned and borne vp the eſtate of the Romaynes: that ye nowe, when al thynges ar mery and proſperous, ſhoulde ſhrynke or ſuffre your hartes to fayle you. Nowe the immortall goddes, the gouernours of the Romayne Empyre, who wylled the people of Rome, by one aſſent to elect me vnto this gret offyce and dignitie, the ſame goddes by ſundry preſages ſignes and dreames in the nyght haue ſhewed me, that all thynges hereafter ſhal haue proſperous ſucceſſe. ye and that I moſt at this time do regarde, my harte giueth me, that ere it be long, al Spaine ſhalbe ours, ſo that as many as beare the name of a Carthaginenſe, ſhall be gladde for feare to flee hens, both by lande and by ſea. And reaſon alſo gyueth, that the ſame whiche in my herte is conceyued, muſt nedes be trewe. For dyuers of theyr frendes, whyche haue by theym ben euil intreted, haue of late ſent embaſſadours to vs for ſocours. Agayne, there

be of them thre captaines, whiche can not agree among them ſelues. For whiche cauſe they haue deuided theyr armye in three partes, and are departed farre a ſundre. Wherfore the ſame, fortune that ſkourged and diſtroyed vs, doth nowe come on theim. For their felowes and friendes, in whom they truſt be gone from theim, euen as the people called Celtiberi, departed and forſoke you, when y
                  •
               hadde moſte nede of theim. They alſo haue deuided and ſeuered theyr hoſtes, which was the cauſe of the deſtruction, bothe of my father & of myne vncle. This diſcorde wyll not ſuffer theim to ioyne to gether againe. And be ye ſure, no one armie of theim by it ſelfe is able to withſtande you. Wherfore I moſte hertely pray you good ſouldiours, loue and fauour nowe the name of the Scipions, whiche am I the ſonne of your olde capitaine Scipio, an impe growen out (as ye woulde ſaye) of a ſtocke that is cut downe by the grounde. And ye olde knightes, ſo worke, that ye may brynge me a yonge capitaine, with my newe armie ouer Iberus into the countrey, which ye haue paſſed, after many great actes and prowes ſhewed: and I doubte not ſhortly to bringe to paſſe, that as ye nowe knowe in me to be a ſimilitude or reſemblaunce of my father and vncle, by my face, countenaunce, and features of my body, euen ſo ſhall ye ſee in me alſo an exaumple of theyr witte faith and vertue: in ſuche wyſe, that euery one of you ſhall ſaye: Scipio our olde capitaine is alyue agayne.
         
         
            ¶ The citie of newe Carthage in Hiſpayne is won by the Romaynes, with a great praye of golde ſiluer and all other neceſſaries for the warre, with the pledges of the noble menne and cities of Spayne Capi. xlv.
            
               VVhen he had by theſe exhortations kendeled the hertes of his men, he lefte behinde hym to kepe that countreye, M. Sillanus, with three thouſande fotemen, and thre hundred horſemen: with the reſt of his armye, which was .xxv. thouſande fotemen, and .ii. thouſande and .v. C. horſemen, he paſſed the ryuer of Iberus. When he was paſſed ouer, many counſailed

hym, ſeinge the army of the Carthaginenſes was deuydedinto thre partes, that he ſhulde aſſaile that hoſt of theim, which was next vnto hym, ſayenge, It was peryll, if they were ioyned together, leſt he ſhulde not be able to reſyſte theim: but he had imagined in his mynde, that he woulde fyrſte aſſaulte Carthago Noua, whiche was then not onely ryche of the rycheſſe of the inhabitantes of the ſame, but alſo riche by meanes of the Carthaginenſes, who had leyde there theyr treaſure, armour, with moche other apparayll for the warre. There remayned alſo in that Citie, all the pledges of noble men and citees of Spayne. Beſyde this, the citie was ſituate vpon the ſea, from whenſe it was eaſy to paſſe ouer into Affrica.
            The hauen alſo therof was able to receyue eaſely the greateſt nauye of any prynce.
            ¶ Of this his purpoſe no man was priuye, but onely T. Lelius, gouernour of the ſhyppes and armye by the ſea, to whome he commaunded, ſoo to tempre his courſe with his ſhyppes, that his armye by lande, and the other by ſea, myghte bothe ſodaynely appeere at Carthage in one tyme. Whyche his charge was dewely putte in execution. For the ſeuenthe daye after theyr departynge frome Iberus, they mette at newe Carthage: where incontynente the Campe was made, and tentes pytched on the Northe ſyde of the citie.
            ¶ Nowe is the ſyte or ſytuation of Carthage on this manier: In the myddell of Spayne, there is a greatte boſome or goulfe, in to the whyche the ſea hath his full courſe, within the lande the lengthe of fyue hundred paſſes, and the breadthe of the ſea in the ſame place, is muche of the ſame quantitie. In the inner parte or furtheſt ende of this goulfe, is a hylle, on whyche the citie is buylded: and it is on two partes, that is to ſaye, on the eaſte ſyde, and on the ſouthe ſyde, encloſed with the ſea, whyche frome the ſayde goulfe or boſome, rounneth in to the lande by the one ſyde of the citie. Vppon the weaſte ſyde, it is defended with a greatte and brode poole, that rounneth vp alſo a good part of the Northe ſyde of the towne: The deepeneſſe of the poole is at noo certayntie: For as the ſea dothe aryſe on heyghte and ebbe lowe, ſoo is the water thereof deepe or ſhalowe. ¶ Thus is the Cytie on all partes enuyronned

with water, as it were an ylande, oneles it be on a part of the northſyde: and the mayne lande there, paſſeth not .ii. hundred and fyfty paces in bredth. Wherfore ſens the grounde there was no broder, Scipio intended not to make trenches on that part, for that he thought hym ſelfe ſtronge ynough to keepe that lyttell peece of grounde from his ennemies: and alſo to thintent he myght at all tymes haue recourſe to view the walles and ſtrength of the towne.
            ¶ Whan Scipio had ordered all thinges ordinately vpon the lande for the aſſaulte, he than went to the hauen, where he in lyke maner ordered his ſhippes and his men, that it might appere to the citizens, that they ſhoulde be aſſaulted, as well by water, as by lande: he alſo commaunded watche to be kepte vpon the water in the night ſeaſon in euery ſhyppe. And after all thynges were prudently appoynted, he retourned to his campe, wyllyng before he dyd any thing, touching the aſſault, to inſtruct and admonyſhe his people of his mynd, concerning the ſame, and to comfort theym in that enterpryſe, he called them togither and made his oration to them in this wyſe.
            ¶ Who ſo euer beleueth (good ſouldiours) that ye are nowe brought hyther only to aſſault and wynne this one towne, he dothe more conſyder your labour and peyne therin, than the profyte that ſhall enſue therof. Trewe it is, that ye ſhall aſſault and ſkale the walles but of one onely towne: but in the obteynyng of this one, ye alſo ſhall wynne the whole cuntrey of Spayne. For in this towne are the pledges of all the noble men, kynges and people of Spayne, who being ones taken, full ſhortly ſhall cauſe all that euer the Carthaginenſes doo nowe poſſede, to be yelded vnto vs, and to be vnder our dominon. Here alſo is al the money and treſure of our ennemies: whiche being taken from them, they ſhall be able no longer to maynteyne the warres, ſeinge they haue many hyred ſtraungers in theyr army. And the ſame treaſure ſhall meruaylouſly profyte vs, therby to wynne the hertes and loue of theſe barbarous people. Beſyde this, here remaineth theyr ordināce, their armour, and al abilimentes neceſſary for the warre: whiche beynge ones wonne, ſhall ſerue well our pourpoſe, and therof make our ennemies bare, to theyr vtter diſtruction. Furthermore, we ſhall be lordes of a fayre and a ryche citie, whervnto lyeth a goodly hauen, whereby we ſhall be ſerued

both by ſea & by lande, of all thinges that we ſhall at any tyme lacke. The hauing of theſe thynges ſhal not only be pleſant & profitable to vs, but alſo the lacke of the ſame, ſhal be a muche greatter hyndrance and loſſe to our ennemies. For this citie hath been and is theyr greatteſt ſtrength. Here be theyr ſtore houſes for corn̄e, here is theyr treaſaurye, here is theyr armory, and theyr houſes ſtuffed with all thynges neceſſarye for theyr ſhyppes of warre: generally this citie is the onely receptacle of all that they haue. Hyther lyeth the ryght courſe by ſea from Affrica to Spayn. And nowe, ſens I perceyue ye be ſufficiently inſtructed, and haue all thinges in good ordre, mete for the purpoſe, lette vs with good hertes, and all our ſtrength, make haſte to the aſſaultyng of this newe Carthage. ¶ Therwithall, euery man with loude voice aſſented therto. And he, not thinkyng to be ſlacke in his buſynes, went furthe towarde Carthage, cauſing it to be aſſauted both by water and by lande. ¶ On the other ſyde, Mago capitain of the Cartha ginenſes, perceiuing that the aſſault was ordeined to be giuen both by ſea and land, he diſpoſed his men within the towne on this maner: Two. M. of the towneſmen he cauſed to be armed & put in aray on that part of the towne, that the Romain tētes or campe was, fiue .C. men he appoynted to kepe the caſtell: other .v. C. he aſſigned to remayne vppon a hylle, that was within the citie towarde the eaſte: The reſt of the people he commanded to be redy to helpe and ſuccour their companies, in what place of the towne ſo euer they ſawe moſt nede to reſiſt. And whan ſo euer they herde any crye made in any parte, through the violent force of the aſſauting: than ſodainly the gate was open, wherat he cauſed the .ii. M. ſouldiours of the towne to iſſue vpon the Romains, at whoſe fyrſt cōming, Scipio cauſed his men to recule backe, to thintent he might draw them further from the towne, and more nere the reſte of the Romayne army. At the fyrſt the battayle was ſtyf
                  •
               e, and well maynteined on both partes: but whan the Carthaginēſes per ceiued ſo great a numbre cominge from the tentes of the Romains, to the ſuccour of their felowes, they fledde with greate feare towarde their citie, and were chaſed and ſlayne harde at theyr gates: which cauſed no leſſe tremblyng to be in the citie, than was before in the battayle. In ſo moche that diuers places of the walles were lefte bare and naked, without men to

defende the ſame: euery man lept from his appoynted place, ſo great and ſodayne was theyr feare. This perceiued well Scipio, ſtandyng on an hyll without the towne. Wherefore he commaunded his ſouldiours, to come out of their tentes ſpedyly, to the aſſaulte of the towne, and to bring with theim ſcalyng ladders. His commaundement was fulfylled. The fyght was ſtrong on bothe partes. And to encourage the more his people, Scipio hym ſelfe came thyther, vnder the couert of ſhyldes and paueſſes, to withſtande the ſhotte that came from the walles, of arowes dartes and other ingynnes whiche was greate. There he ſomtyme exhorted and coumforted his men: ſomtime he counſayled them, what was beſt for them to do, for the attayning of theyr purpoſe. This his preſence was awytneſſe, bothe ofmens valyant courage, and alſo of theyr cowardyſe, wherby euery man enforced hym ſelfe to clymmevp, neyther regardynge the heyghte of the walles, nor fearyng the men of armes, that fierſely defended the walles. On the other ſyde of the towne lyke aſſault was gyuen from the ſhyppes, by that part that laye towarde the water: but all to ſmall purpoſe. For Mago had ſo furnyſhed the walles with armed men, euer bryngynge theym plenty of dartes and other ordinances, that the Romans loſt more than they wāne. And aboue al thinges, the ſauing of the town was the height of the walles, wherby fewe of their ladders were able to reche to the toppe of the ſame, and thoſe ladders that wer longeſt, wer therto moſt weake: ſo that whan one was aſcended vp on any of them, other wolde alſo clyme after him theron, and ſo with heauy burden being loded, many of them brake, to the great hurt of the climers. whervpon Scipio, cō
               ſidering his vaine labours, cauſed his wery company to withdraw them, and to reſt them: wherby the Carthaginēſes wer not only eaſed and releued of their preſent feare & danger, but alſo therby toke a hardy courage and opinion, that the citie was out of all danger of taking by any aſſault, & that they wer ſtrong inough to defend it, tyll their other capitaines of the Carthaginenſes armies might haue time inough to come to their reſcous, and to reiſe their ſiege. It drewthen towarde the middel of the day, when certain fyſſhermen of Tarracon, that had ben fiſhing in their botes on the ſaid great and large poole, that lay on the northweſt part of the towne, certified

Scipio, that the water therof was than at a very low ebbe, & alſo the northwind, being very quicke, and driuing the waues with the tide, cauſed a lower vale, than had lightly been ſeen: ſo that men might well wade ouer to the walles of the citie, the water being in moſt places not paſt the middell of a man, and in ſome partes not paſt the knees. This ſtrange fortune of that vnſeen lowe ebbe of the water, Scipio tourned to a myracle, ſayinge: It was the wille and pleaſure of the goddis, to withdraw at that time the water from that great pole, to make for the Romains a paſſage, & to open them a way, by which neuer man before had paſſed. With theſe ſtronge perſuaſions, he cauſed the reſt of his army, which had reſted thē in their tentes, during the time of the firſt aſſault, to take ladders and engines, and to gyue a newe aſſault in the ſame place, where they were before beaten back. There began a fierſe & a cruel bickering. Neuertheleſſe the height of the walles was ſo beneficiall to the citezens, that were they neuer ſo valiante and hardy, yet vp could they not get: but were ouerthrowen with ſmall peyne to the townes men.
            ¶ While they were buſy and attentife to defende the Citie, as well there as on the ſea coſt, Scipio, with a good numbre of ſtronge men, ſecretely withdrewe hym to the ſayd ponde: where he bad his companye folowe the god Neptunus, that ſhulde be theyr guide on their way through that ſhalowe water. Whervpon they with ſmall labour went ouer, and ſet vp ladders to the walles, which they found eaſy to be ſcaled, and not kept with any men of warre. For that they hauinge a ſure hope in the naturall ſtrengthe on that parte, by reaſon of the water, had made no munimentes or defence: nor yet lefte any watch there: euery man was gone to the defence of the other partes, in the which thaſſault ſemed moſt fierſe & dangerouſe: ſo that without any reſiſtence they entred the towne, & incontinent made haſt to come to the gate, where the battaile was moſt buſy & ſtrong. To which whā they wer com, they found al the townſmen ſo erneſt in their defēce, or in cōforting their felowes, that they neither herd nor ſaw the Romans tyl they perceiued them at their backes, throwing of dartes, & ſleynge them on all partes, nother tyl that time knewe they the town to be won. Thā anon wer the gates broken down, & a gret nū
               bre of armed mē entred at the gate, many had by that time goten in ouer the walles: ſom went incontinent about the towne,

ſleyng all that they met: an other company wente in araye to the market place, through the myddel of the Citie. Than perceyued they theyr ennemies fleyng, ſome to the hyl within the towne, that was kepte with .v. C. men of warre. Mago with a great numbre with him fledde to the caſtel. Then Scipio ſent parte of his hoſt to the ſayd hyll, whiche anone was wonne, and the people ſlayne or els taken. The reſt wente to aſſaulte the caſtel, whiche Mago a ſeaſon valyantly defended: but ſeyng all the towne full of his ennemies, and that he was not lyke to haue any ſocours: he yelded vp him ſelfe with the caſtell to the Romaynes. Then ceaſſed they to make any further ſlaughter in the citie. Euery man wente to the ſpoile of the towne: the praye whereof was greate, as well of golde and ſyluer as of ordinaunce, artyllary, corne, ſhyppes, iron, laten and many other thinges mete for the apparel of ſhippes: the certayntie wherof I wyll not reherſe, for that writars vary moch therin. There was alſo .x. M. pryſoners taken, wherof as many as were citizens, Scipio let go at libertie, and ſuffered to dwel ſtyl in the towne, and to enioy as moche of their goodes as was not before ſpoyled. Amonge other priſoners there were two. M. of craftes men, which he cauſed to be bōd men to worke for the common profytte of the citie of Rome, puttyng them in comfort, that they ſhould within ſhorte ſpace be made all free, if they wolde labour and worke earneſtely about ſuche neceſſaryes, as they ſhoulde haue nede of in the warre. A greate noumber of the reſt, that were ſeruauntes and luſty yonge men, he ſent to be rowers in his ſhyppes and galeys in the places of ſuche as lacked. And he alſo encreaſed his nauy of eyght ſhyppes wel furniſhed. Beſide al theſe priſoners he had alſo the pledges of noble men and cities, to a greate noumbre: whome he cauſed to be well kepte and gently entreated. The reſt of that daye Scipio gaue lycence to his wery men to reſt theym ſelues. For there were fewe, but they had al the daye before ben ſore trauayled with fyghtyng in one place or other. The cuſtody of the towne he gaue to Cn. Lelius and his company of ſee men, and him ſelfe wente to his tentes.
         
         
            
            ¶ Of the gentylnes of Scipio, in reſtoryng a fayre yonge virgin vndefiled to Luceius, vnto whom ſhe was fyaunced. Cap. xlvi.
            
               ON the morowe he aſſembled all his hoſte togyther, and fyrſt he gaue humble thankes & praiſe to the goddis, that had gyuen into his handes in one day ſo great, ſo noble, and ſo riche a citie, the lyke wherof was not to be found in Spain. Into which his ennemies had gathered togither the treaſure bothe of Affrica and alſo of Spayne, in ſuch abundance, that there was but lyttell or nothyng left for thē: the Romayns hauyng great plenty of all thinges. Nexte he muche prayſed the noble courage and valyantnes of his men of warre, whom nother the ſodayne excurſation of theyr ennemies out of the towne, nother the hygh walles or waters of the ſame, coulde make afrayde or let them of theyr enterpryſe: nother yet theyr caſtels and ſtrong towres, coulde reſiſt theyr powers. Aboue other he praiſed muche twayn, that firſt ſcaled the walles, and entred the towne, to eche of them he gaue a crowne of good value: his other ſouldiours he rewarded, euery man after his vertue and merites: but ſpecially Cn. Lelius, the gouernour of the nauye, he prayſed and muche loued, to whome he gaue, for a rewarde, a crowne of golde, and .xxx. oxen.
            ¶ Than cauſed he the pledges to be brought before him, willyng them to be of good comforte, and that they ſhuld conſider, that they wer now in the power of the Romayns, whoſe naturall propretie and deſire is, to bynde men throughe theyr benefytes ſhewinge, to loue them, rather than by compulſion to kepe men in feare of them. And had leauer to ioyne ſtrange nations in amitie with them by faithfull felowſhyp, then ſorowfully to kepe them in myſerable ſeruitude. Than he toke the names of the cities, that had their pledges there, and to the ambaſſadours that by chaunce were with hym preſent of any of the ſayde cities, he, incontinent delyuered the pledges vnto theim: to the other cities he ſent meſſangers, wyllynge theim to ſend vnto him for theim, and they ſhulde haue theyr pledges frely delyuered. There were alſo taken many noble matrones and honeſt maydens, whom he committed to ſobre

and honeſt men to be kept, without any force or diſhonour to be done vnto them: among other captiues there was one virgin brought vnto hym, of ſo excellent beautie, that where ſo euer ſhe went, all men delyted to beholde her. Scipio enquired of her, of what cuntrey ſhe was, and of what kynred ſhe was deſcended: & he perceyned by her, that ſhe was betrouthed or made ſure to a yong prince of the Celtiberiās, whoſe name was Luceius. Wherevppon he incontinent ſent for the ſaid yonge man, and alſo for her parentes. At whoſe coming, knowyng that the yonge man was ſoore enamoured of her, he thus ſayd vnto hym: I being a yonge man, haue ſente for you, that are alſo a yong man, to come to me, the cauſe is, for that whan this yong maiden, being fianced or enſured to you, was brought to me, by my ſoldiors, I herd ſay, that you entierly loued her. And her beautie witneſſeth, that you haue good cauſe ſo to do. If I might laufully enioy her pleaſaunt loue, and were not otherwyſe occupied in my mynde about the affayres of the commune welthe: I coulde perchaunce beare her my loue: and deſyre to enioy the ſame: but nowe I wyll beare fauour to your loue, that of ryght ought to haue her. She hath bene here with me as well and honourably kept, & her virginite preſerued, as though ſhe had dwelled ſtyl with her owne parentes, to thintent I might make of her a preſent to you moſt acceptable, & for the conſeruation of mine honor. And for this my gift, I require of you, but one only reward, that is, that you from hēsforth becom a louing frēd to the Romās. And if ye eſteme me to be a good or an honorable man, as my father and vncle before me were reputed for to be: thinke, that there are in the noble citie of Rome many like vnto vs. And truſt me neuer, if any people can this daye be founde on the earth; that you wyll be gladder to haue the loue and frend ſhyppe of, or that ye wolde be more ſory to haue the diſpleaſure of. The yong man, after gret thankes gyuen hym, praide the goddes to rewarde him for his goodnes, where his power ſuffiſed not: Then were the parentes of the mayden called forthe, who had broughte with them a great ſumme of golde for the redemption of theyr chyld. But when they perceiued, that he had giuen her frely to her huſband, they deſired him to take a parte therof, as of theyr gyfte, for the declaration of theyr good hertes towardes hym: affirminge, that his receyuinge

therof ſhulde be as ioyfull vnto them, as the reſtitution of theyr dowghter vndefiled.
            ¶ Then Scipio, beinge ouercome with theyr longe and vehement interceſſion, cauſed the ſayde ſumme to be layde on the grounde before his fete, and callinge Luceius againe to hym, he ſayde: Beſyde the dowere that ye ſhal receyue of your father in lawe, for the mariage of his doughter, ye ſhall alſo take this gyfte of dower at my hande. With whiche his great gift, and alſo moch honour to hym done beſyde, he retourned home to his houſe and countrey, declaring to euery man the honour and magnifycence of Scipio, ſayinge, that there was a yonge man come moſt lyke vnto a god, who bothe with his power in warre, and alſo with his gentilneſſe and liberalitie in peace, had ouercome all the countrey. This yonge gentilman leauing his houſe and familye in good ordre, ſhortely after retourned to Scipio, bringynge with hym a. M. CCCC. good horſemen, to the ayde and ſocour of the Romaynes.
            ¶ Then Scipio ſent C. Lelius to Rome, to beare tidynges of his victory, and with hym he ſent Mago, and .xv. other ſenatours of newe Carthage, whiche wer, at the takynge of the ſame citie, taken alſo priſoners, & after he had repaired the broken walles of the citie, & ſet therin a ſufficient numbre of ſouldiours, for the defence of the ſame: he remoued to Tarracon: whyther he had apoynted the legates of all his olde friendes, and alſo of his newe gotten acqueintaunce, to reſorte for a further communication of theyr aliaunce, and for the further procedynge in theyr affaires.
         
         
            ¶ Anniball ſleith Cn. Fuluius, with xiii. M. Romaynes, beſide Herdonea: Marcellus the conſull chaſith Anniball through Apulia, makyng many ſhirmiſhes with hym. ca. xlvii.
            
               IN this eſtate were the warres in Spayne, durynge whiche tyme the conſull Marcellus toke Salapia by treaſon, and .ii. other townes of the Samnites by force: where he ſlewe .iii. M. men of warre, whiche Anniball had lefte for the kepyng of the ſame townes. And Cn. Fuluius the proconſull, truſting to wynne Herdonea from Anniball, which

was not very ſtronge of it ſelfe, neither had any garnyſon left there, for the ſufficient defence therof: he remoued thyther with his army, hauyng the more hope and comfort to atteyne the ſame, for that he knew wel, that Annibal, after the loſſe of Salapia, was departed into the cuntrey of the Brutians. But ſuche as were the ſure frendes of Anniball in the towne of Herdonea, ſent hym priuyly worde by meſſangers. And he deſyrous to kepe ſtyl his old frendes, haſted ſo with his horſemen and lyghteſt footemen, makyng ſo great iourneys, that he was alredy com nere Herdonea, before the fame of his comīg wer well knowen. And to put the Romayns in more feare, he appered in good aray of battaile ſodainly with baners diſplaied. Whiche Fuluius perceiuynge, with lyke hardynes made ſpede to put his folke in aray, and ioyned battayle with hym. Than Anniball cōmanded his horſemen, that after a ſigne or token to theim made, whiles the Romains were buſy in battail againſt his footemen, and euery mans eye wer occupied buſyly: that they ſhoulde ſecretelye cooſte the fielde, and parte of them to ſet vpon the backes of his ennemies, one other parte of them to inuade their campe and tentes with greate noyſe and ſlaughter, ſaying, that he truſted to vanquyſhe this Fuluius as he had .ii. yeres paſte ouercome an other Fuluius of his name in the ſame cuntrey. And in his hope he was nothing deceyued. for ſo ſoone as the horſemen aſſailed the Romayns on theyr backes with great feare and ſlaughter, anon from the campe was hearde a great crye: wherby the Romayns, that before kept aray and fought boldly, were ſo diſinayd, that ſome fledde, and many mo were ſlayne. Among which the ſaid Fuluius and .xii. tribunes, with .xiii. M. Romayns were ſlayne, and theyr campe and ſtuffe taken.
            ¶ Than Anniball, truſtyng nothyng to the ſtrengthe of that towne, remoued the inhabitantes therof to Metapontus, and to the Thurines. He ſlew the capitains therof, which had ſecrete cōmunication with the Conſull, and after he ſet the town on fyre.
            ¶ Marcellus the Conſulle, baynge nothynge afrayde with the tydinges of this loſſe, ſente letters to the ſenate of Rome, byddynge them to be no whytte diſcomforted therwith: for he doubted not, but he wolde cauſe Anniball to haue but very ſhort ioy of his victory. Whervpō he immediately remoued

toward Annibal, pitchyng his campe in the playne fieldes euen in the ſyght of his ennemies. And ſoone after valyantly came furthe in order of battayle, redy to fyght. On the other ſyde Anniball was no leſſe quicke than he. The battayle betwene them, bothe of the horſemen and of the footemen, was meruaylous fiers & cruell, neither ceaſſed it, tyll the nyght departed thē, with indifferēt loſſe of both parties. In the night Anniball ſecretly remoued and went into Apulia. Marcellus in the mornyng, perceyuynge the departure of his ennemies, folowed incontinent, and ouertoke theim nere vnto Venuſia. Thus paſſed they all Apulia without any notable battaile, the one folowinge the other: And euer Anniball wolde remoue in the nyght, ſekyng a place to deceiue his ennemies. But the conſull always folowed in the day tyme, ſendynge before hym eſpies, to be ſure from the crafty trayne of Anniball.
            ¶ The ſummer was almoſt ended, and the tyme of choſynge conſuls drewe nere, at the whiche chuſyng Marcellus ſhulde haue been hym ſelfe: but he ſent his letters to Rome, affyrmynge, that it ſhulde be ryght hurtfull to the common welth, yf he dyd depart one foote from Anniball. For his abſence, yea his onely ceaſſyng to aſſayle hym, ſhulde gyue hym moche courage. Whervpon he was cōmaunded to abyde ſtylle with his army. The other conſul Liuius was ſent for. Than were choſen conſuls Q. Fabius Maximus, and Q. Fuluius Flaccus. Beſyde this it was determined, that M. Claudius Marcellus ſhulde kepe alſo his army and the warres agaynſt Anniball one yere longar.
            ¶ As touchynge the warres in Spayne, it was ordeyned, that Publius Scipio and Sullanus ſhoulde be there gouernours, not onely for a yere, but vnto the tyme they were called from the ſame by the ſenate.
            ¶ Aboute this tyme came the ambaſſadours of kynge Syphax from Affrica to Rome, ſhewynge the proſperous battayles that he hadde fought with the Carthaginenſes, deſyrynge to haue the amitie of the Romaynes agreed to hym by the whole ſenate, whyche before was moued betwene hym and the two bretherne Cneius, and P. Scipio in Spayne. To whoſe ambaſſadours the ſenatours not only gaue gentyl thankes and louynge anſweres, but alſo ſent by them to the kyng, ryche preſentes.
            
               
¶ Not longe after tidinges wer brought to Rome out of Affrica, that Maſſaniſſa, the ſonne of kynge Gala, was come to Carthage with .v. M. Numidians, and that a great numbre of other Affricans wer hyred to go ouer into Spayne to Aſdruball, to the intent that he, ſtrongly accompanied, might depart ſhortly from thens into Italy to his brother Annibal, in whom they iudged the hope of theyr victory to reſt.
            ¶ About the ſame time came Lelius out of Spayne to Rome bryngynge with hym a great numbre of priſoners, reherſynge in the ſenate houſe the happy wynnynge of newe Carthage in one daye, with the gettyng of many newe friendes in Spaine. Theſe newes made theim not ſo mery, as the comming of Aſdruball into Italy made theim afrayde, conſyderinge, that before he was come, all theyr power was ſkant able to reſiſte the onely power of Anniball. Neuertheleſſe, with as good chere as coulde be, they diſcharged Lelius, ſendyng hym agayne in to Spayne with the ſhyppes that came with hym.
         
         
            ¶ Marcellus gyueth battayle to Anniball, in whiche his men be put to flyght, wherupon he maketh them a ſharpe oration, he reneweth the battayll on the morowe, putt
                  •
               th Anniball and his hoſt to flight, with loſſe of many of his men. cap. xlviii.
            
               THe newe Conſull, leauynge all thynges in good order at Rome, departed towardes the warres. Q. Fuluius Flaccus paſſed Capua, to whome Q. Fabius made inſtant requeſte, before he departed, that he wolde kepe ſtrayght and quicke warres with Anniball whyles that he dyd beſiege the citie of Tarent: whiche citie, if he myghte ones take frome hym, he ſhulde haue no place ſure to go to, neyther knowe to what coſt he myght ſafely tourne hym: ſo that he ſhuld afterwarde haue ſmall cauſe to abide in Italy. The ſame requeſt he alſo made to Marcellus by his letters: who thynkynge no man in Italy ſo able to matche Anniball, as he was hym ſelfe, was ſo kendeled & ſtirred with Fabius letters, that ſo ſone as the wynter was paſſed, and any fode was founde in the fieldes, able to ſuſteyne his army and cattel, he went to Canuſium, where Annibal then laye, and hadde moued the rulers of the towne to yelde vnto

hym, leauyng the Romayne amitie. But ſo ſone as he parceyued, that Marcellus was come, he remoued from thenſe, leauynge that playne countrey, and ſought the hylly and woddy countrey, whiche myght be more apte for traynes of deceipte for his ennemies.
            ¶ Marcellus euer folowed him harde, ioyning almoſt campe to campe. Dyuers ſkyrmyſhes were made betwene the horſe men of bothe partes. But Anniball not mynding to ieoparde all at ones, fledde before hym in the nyghte. At the laſt the other ouertoke hym in the playne fielde: And as Anniball cauſed his campe to be trenched & fortified, Marcellus with his men let the workes therof: ſo that whether he wold or no, he was enforced to do batayl, which thyng he had moſt eſchued. Wherefore they ordered theyr armies on bothe parties, and fought tyll the nyght departed them. On the morowe Marcellus early put his men in good aray, and Anniball dydde the ſame, exhortyng his men to remembre their noble conqueſtes at Traſymenus and at Cannas, and not to ſuffre theyr gredye and vnreaſonable ennemy ſo to vexe them, that they might not haue tyme to incampe them ſelues, ye ſcarſely to loke aboute, or to take breathe. The ſonne whan it ryſeth, and the Romain army, do bothe at one tyme appere in the fieldes. But in caſe (ſaythe he) ye ſo handle hym, that he may ones departe with loſſe of his men out of the fielde, he wil herafter be more eaſy to intreate. With theſe exhortations, and alſo being euyl contented with the tedious continuall purſuing of theyr enemies: they fierſly went to battaile, where they fought cruelly by the ſpace of .ii. longe houres. At the laſt the ryght wynge of the Romayns gaue backe, whoſe place to fulfyll, Marcellus appoynted an other legion of men of armes of his company. But as the fyrſt reculed with feare, ſo the other came fayntly into their places. At the laſt the Romayn hoſt being more fearefull than ſhamefaſt, began to flee. There was ſlayn that day of the Romains .ii. thouſand and ſeuen hundred, wherof .iiii. wer capitaines hundreders, and two tribunes.
            ¶ Marcellus after that he was come into his campe, made to his ſouldiours ſo ſoore and cruell an oration, that the wordes of the angry capitayne ſemed to them more diſpleaſaunt and peynefull, than the trauayle that they toke in the battaylle the daie before.
            
               
¶ I am moche bounde (ſayth he) to the immortall goddes, when ye ſo fearfully toumbled together into your tentes, that it chaunced not your ennemy, after his victory, to aſſayle your campe alſo. For no fayle, loke with what feare ye left the battayle, with lyke feare alſo had ye forſaken your campe. What ſodayne feare hath nowe inuaded you? What thynge hath cauſed you ſo ſone to forget, bothe the eſtate of your ſelfe, and alſo of your ennemies? Do ye not remembre, that theſe be the ſame ennemies, whom ye ouercame and purſued the laſt ſōmer? theſe be the ſame, whome fleinge before you bothe daye and night, ye chaſed through the cūtreis. Ye they be the ſame, that yeſterday ye wold neither ſuffer to flee from you, nor yet gyue theim ſo moche time, as to fortifye theyr fielde. I wil no more reherſe thynges, wherein ye may glory: but nowe wyll I declare thynges, whereof ye ought moche to be aſhamed. Yeſter daye ye departed from the batayle with euen hande: and nowe what hath this daye or this nyghte ben ſo greate a lette vnto you, or taken from you? Was your army therby any whit leſſed, or theyr power any whyt encreaſed? Truely me thinketh nowe, that I ſpeake not to mine owne company of ſouldiours, nor yet to Romains. I perceiue here nothing of theim, but bodies and armour. For if ye had had the ſame hertes and mīdes your ennemies ſhuld neuer haue loked you on the backes: nor you had loſte none of your ſtandardes. Before this time he could neuer glorie of the ſlaughter of any of our company, only yeſterdaie ye gaue him the honour by the death of your felowes. ¶ Then euerie man cried out aloude to him, deſirynge pardon of the daie paſt: and ones againe to trie the herte and courage of his men, when ſo euer it ſhulde pleaſe him. Nowe (ſaide he) truely and I wyl proue you againe. For I wil to morowe in the morninge ſet you forthe in araie, to the intent that ye as vanquiſhers may aſke forgiuenes, rather then as people vanquiſhed.
            ¶ On the morrowe, after that his men had well eaten and dronken, and made theim ſtronge, when he ſhould put his people in order, he ſet in the v
                  •
               warde thoſe that fled firſt the daye before, and thoſe companies that loſte their ſtandardes: and then the other as him beſt lyked, comaundinge theim all, earneſtely to fyghte and to ouercome theyr ennemies: ſo that the victorie of that preſent daie might fly and come to Rome, before

the ſclaunder of yeſterdaies flienge.
            ¶ Whan Anniball herd of the fierſe courage of Marcellus, he ſayd: We haue to do nowe with ſuche an ennemye, as can neyther ſuffre his good fortune nor badde. For yf he ouercom his ennemies, he gredily ſtyl aſſaileth theim: And whan he is ouercome, he alſo fierſly renueth the warres vpon theim. After theſe wordes, he incontinent brought his hoſte furthe into the fielde, where the battayle was more cruell than it was the daie before. The Carthaginenſes euer ſtryuynge to kepe the honour, and the Romaynes to auenge the ſhame gotten the daie before. The aduauntage of the battayle betweene theim abode longe in ſuſpence. Marcellus, as a preſent witneſſe, was euer redye to comforte and exhorte his Romayn
                  •
               s. Anniball, ſeinge the doubtefulneſſe of the fyght and victory, to putte his ennemies to ſodayne feare, cauſed his Elephantes to be ſette agaynſte the forewarde: whyche at the fyrſte comynge, brought theim out of order, and didde theim muche trouble and hurte: wherby the one parte thereof was lefte bare and voyde of reſyſtence, and the reſte had fled alſo, hadde not Decius Flauius a Tribune taken the ſtanderde of one of the bandes of horſemen, commaundynge the company belongynge to the ſame ſtanderde, to folowe hym boldely, whom they obeyde: and he incontinent brought theim, where the company of elephantes dyd moſte diſpleaſure, cauſynge mooſte trouble and rumour. Than badde he theim couragiouſely to throwe theyr dartes and ſpeares at thoſe beaſtes: whyche they dyd, woundynge many of theim: who feelynge theim ſelues hurt, with greatte rage runne away, and coulde not be ſtayed by theim that rode on theim. The Romaynes folowed theim ſtyll, and droue thiem vpon theyr owne company of Spanyardes and Carthaginenſes, makynge greatter ſlaughter amonge theim, than they hadde before done to the Romaynes. And whan they ſawe the Carthaginenſes by this meane brought out of array, the Romaine footemen in order entred and brake the aray cleane, puttynge theym to flyght: whō Marcellus cauſed his horſmen to folow. And the chaſe ceaſſed not, tyl they wer driuen into the yates of their campe, with great loſſe bothe of men and of elephantes. There were ſlayne that daye .viii. M. men, and fyue elephantes. Of the Romaines there were ſlayne thre thouſande, and very many

ſore hurt. Whervpon Annibal, the next nyght folowinge, remoued vnto the Brutians: and Marcellus abode there a ſeaſon, to cure his hurt ſouldiours.
         
         
            ¶ Home Q. Fabius Maximus recouered from Anniball the citie of Tarent. Cap. xlix.
            IN this ſeaſon Q. Fabius Max. the conſul toke Manduria with force, and from thens remoued to Tarent, pytchyng his tentes hardeby the mouth of the hauen, where he founde certayne ſhyppes, whyche Liuius the late conſull hadde left there for the defence of other ſhyppes that brought vytayle and other neceſſary prouiſion for the caſtell. All theſe ſhyppes, and alſo all other that came with vitayles and prouiſion thyther, he charged ſome with gunnes and ſtones, and all kynde of weapons inuaſiue, ſomme he laded with ſcalyng ladders, and other engyns to aſſaulte the towne: ſoo that by the ſea al thinges wer ready for the aſſaulte. And then he by land alſo ordered his cōpany for the ſame. Now to help his purpoſe to be acheued, ther chaunced a ſmall thing in eſtimation: yet it proued meruailous happy for the ſucceſſe of his great enterpriſe. Anniball had ſent to Tarent a crue of men of warre of the countrey of the Brutians. The capytayne of this company was meruailouſly enamored on a yong womā in the citie, whoſe brother was then ſouldiour in the hoſt of Fabius, to whom his ſiſter ſent worde by letters, of the familiaritie and new acquaintaunce of her earneſt louer, and of his greate ryches and honour. Whervpon this man imaginynge, and truſtyng alſo, that the loue of his ſyſter myght leade her louer to do what ſo euer ſhe wolde diuiſe, conceyued an hope, to do good therby, touchynge the wynnynge of the towne. Whervpon he ſecretely opened his mynde to his capitayne Fabius, deſyrynge hym, that he woulde ly
                  •
               ence hym to departe frome the armye, and to goo in to the citie, whiche he woulde vndertake to dooe, by diſſemblynge hym ſelfe to be ſtolen away from his company, for the loue of his ſiſter, deſyrouſe to be a cytezen there. The Conſull thynkyng to proue the effecte of his opynyon, ſuffered hym to departe. Thus came he to his ſyſter, and by her meanes felle in greate familiarite with her louer the capytayne of the Brutianes. And

after longe acquayntaunce he beganne couertly to proue his mynde a lyttell and a lyttell. After, whan he founde ſome towardneſſe in hym, he ſette his ſyſter in hande with hym, who with her fayre and flatterynge woordes ſoo compaſſed hym, that to haue her loue, he conſented to the betraiynge of that parte of the Citie, wher of he was rular and Capytayne.
            ¶ Whan they were agreed on the tyme, maner, and circumſtaunce of the purpoſe: the ſouldyour ſecretly in the nyghte, was lette furthe out of the towne, and came to his capitayn, declarynge vnto hym what he hadde doone, and what waye he ſhoulde take, to achieue his enterpryſe. At the tyme and houre appoynted, whiche was the begynnynge of the nyght, the Conſull hadde prepared, that on the ſea ſyde in the hauen, his ſhyppes and menne of warre thereto appoynted, ſhoulde vyolentely aſſaulte the towne. And on an other parte the Romaynes in the caſtell, with all theyr force alſo, ſhulde aſſayle the citizens: and he with a good numbre with hym, pryuyly drewe hym to the eaſte parte of the towne, where he abode a longe ſeaſon, withoute makynge any noyſe.
            There was greatte noyſe and bruite made purpoſely on the hauen ſyde, and on the ſyde towardes the caſtelle, where leaſte daungier was: Soo that Democrates the capytayne, whyche was than nyghe vnto the crew of Brutians, fearynge leſte in his abſence, the Romaynes myghte chaunce on the other ſyde to wynne the towne, whyche to feare he was moued by the greatte rumour and crye of the cytezens on that parte. Whan he hearde all thynges quiete and at reſte on that parte of the towne, wherin he was: he with his people haſted towarde the caſtell ſyde, where he hearde the greatteſt noyſe.
            ¶ Than the conſull, heringe thenoyſe ceaſſed of men of armes, whiche before were very loude, iudging that the kepers of that warde were gone from thens: he commanded ſtreight ſcalynge ladders to be ſette to the walles on that ſyde where the Brutians kepte warde, whyche was done without any reſyſtence. For the Brutians not onely made noo reſyſtence, but alſoo holpe theym vp. Thus entred they the towne, and ſtreyghte wente to the nexte gate, the whyche they brake, and cauſed moche of theyr companye to entre with theyr baners dyſplayed. And by the breake of the day, they

came into the markette place. The Tarentines parceyuinge theyr towne to be taken, came with all theyr power frome the caſtell ſide, and from the hauen, to the ſuccour therof: but all to late. For after the battayle was a lyttell begonne, they felte them ſelues farre vnable to reſiſt the Romaynes. Wherfore anon they fled euery man to his houſe, or to his friendes houſe. There wer Nico and Democrates ſlayne in battayle. Philomenes, the chiefe autour of betraying the towne to Anniball, toke his horſe and fledde: but whither he wente, or what became of hym, it was not after knowen. Great ſlaughter was made both of the Carthaginenſes and of the Tarentines.
            Many priſoners were taken, and a ryche ſpoyle. The wall, whiche Anniball made to deuyde the caſtell frome the towne, was throwen downe.
            ¶ Anniball when he fyrſte hearde, that Tarent was beſieged: he with all haſt poſſible hyed thyther to the ſuccour therof. But when he came nere thervnto, and hearde newes of the takynge of the citie, and by what meanes, he ſayde: I nowe do ryght well fynde, that the Romaynes haue alſo an other Anniball amonge theim. For euen by ſuche crafte as we wanne Tarent, by ſuche haue we loſt it. Then for that it ſhulde not appeere, that he were reculed for feare, he pitched his campe fyue miles from the citie, where he taryed certayne dayes: and from thenſe went to Metapontus, where he cauſed letters to be written by two of the chiefe rulers of the citie to Fabius.
            The contentes therof was, that if it woulde pleaſe the Romaynes and hym, to receyue theim into theyr grace, and to remitte all theyr olde iniuries and wronges to them doone: they woulde delyuer into his handes, bothe the towne, and alſo the garniſon of the Carthaginenſes, which wer within the ſame. Fabius nothynge miſtruſtinge, ſent to them agayne, appoyntynge a tyme, when he wolde come to Metapontus to ſpeake with them, whiche letters were ſtreyght brough to Anniball. Who beinge very ioyouſe, to trayne and deceyue the old wiſe Fabius, At the tyme appoynted layde a great embuſſhemente vpon the waye, where Fabius ſhulde paſſe to Metapontus.
            ¶ The ſame tyme when Fabius ſhulde departe, he ſought by diuinations and auguries, howe he ſhulde ſpede in his voiage, as by the kyllyng of a beaſte, and therwith to do ſacrifyce: and by the lucke of byrdes, as the deteſtable vſe was then, and

longe before had ben amonge the Romaynes. Whiche auguries were ſo vnlucky and vntowarde, that they ſhewed to hym ſome euyll aduenture, if he wente forwarde in his appoynted iourney. Wherfore the deuynours or wyſe men aduyſed hym, to tary ſtyll in his tentes, for feare of treaſon.
            ¶ The Metapontans, ſeing that Fabius came not at the day aſſigned, ſent agayne to hym, requyring hym to come to their capitaynes. Whiche meſſangers were incontinente taken and examyned vpon the caſe. And they fearynge the tourmentes that wer prepared for theim, confeſſed all the deceyte and treſon: wherby Fabius eſcaped his death, and the deſtruction of many of his armye.
         
         
            ¶ Scipio fyghteth with Haſdruball beſyde Betula, dryueth hym from his hyll, ſleith .viii. M. of his hoſt, taketh .xii. M. pryſoners, with Maſſus neuew to Maſſaniſſa, and a great praye in the campe. Cap. l.
            IN the ſame ſummer tyme, whyles all theſe thynges were done in Italy, P. Scipio beinge in Spayne, had ſo gotten the loue of the ſpanyardes, that Ediſco, Indibilis, and Mandonius, thre great princes of Spayne, were come into his amitie and alliaunce. Indibilis deſired, that their commynge myght not be diſhonorable vnto them, and that no man ſhulde reproche theim after, that they were ſtolen awaye from theyr olde friendes of Carthage, and lyke lyght people were runne to the Romaynes: For he ſayde, they had doone worthely at all tymes for them, whiche theyr kyndeneſſe was euer recompenſed with pryde, auaryce, and many iniuries: ſo that onely theyr bodyes abode in the amitie of Carthage, but theyr hertes hadde longe beene towardes the Romaynes: whom they knewe euer to be kepers of theyr truſe taken, and mainteinours of right and equitie. Wherfore he deſyred Scipio, to receyue theyr friendely commynge vnto hym, accordynge to theyr meanynge and intente▪ and as he founde them dylygent in theyr ſeruyce doynge vnto him, ſo to eſteme them. Scipio hertely thanked them, grauntynge theyr requeſtes in all thynges. Wheruppon theyr wyues and chyldren were reſtored vnto theim, whiche before were captyues with Scipio: and a ſtedfaſte aliaunce of amitie was knytte betwene theim.

And ſone after theyr hole power of men of war came to theſe prynces, and ioyned in campe with the Romaynes, not departinge from them, but guided them euer, tyl they brought them nere the campe of theyr ennemies.
            ¶ By this meane was the armye greatly increaced. Yet beſydes this, by one other waye Scipio polytikely augmented his hoſt. For when he ſawe no nauy of Car
                  •
               hage was on the ſea, ſo that he neded not to haue any great noumbre of men in his ſhyppes: He broughte his hoole nauye to Tarracon, takynge all the ſouldiours, whiche were in theim, and alſoo the more parte of his maryners, with hym in the warres by lande. With this great hooſte he wente forwardes, and made ſuche ſpede, that ſecretly he came nere vnto the towne of Betula, where Haſdruball laye with his armye. At theyr fyrſte commynge thyther, certeyne ſmalle ſkyrmyſſhes were made betwene theim. But Haſdruball, ſeynge the Romaynes power dayly increaſed, and his to be made leſſe, thoughte he woulde ieoparde to fyghte without lenger prolongynge of tyme. But he determyned to ſeeke a place of ſtrengthe, where he myght fyghte to his aduauntage, and to the more hurte of his ennemyes. Wherfore in the nyghte he remoued his armye to an hyghe hyll, nere adioynynge. In the toppe wherof there was a fayre large playne: on the backe ſyde of this hyll, there ranne a ryuer, whiche compaſſed a good parte of the hyll.
            Furthermore aboute the myddes of this hyll, was there another playne fyelde, moche lower than the other playne: vnto the which nether playne, the aſcendyng was hard and peinfull. Into this lower fyelde Aſd
                  •
               uball, the day folowyng, ſent a great numbre of Numidian horſemen, and other light harneſſed fotemen of Affrica, and of the iles called Baleares, nowe named Maiorque and Minorque.
            ¶ Scipio rydynge aboute his hoſte, ſhewed theim theyr ennemyes. Theyr hertes (ſaythe he) wyll not ſerue theym to fyghte with vs on euen grounde. Wherfore they ſeeke out hyghe mountaynes, truſtynge more to the ſtrengthe of the place, then to theyr owne ſtrengthe or armour. Newe Carthage hadde hye walles, whiche neuertheleſſe was ſcaled by my Romayne ſouldyours. Neyther coulde the hyghehylles, nor the caſtell thereof, nor yet the ſea withſtande theyr power. I knowe (ſaythe he) that theſe hye places, whiche our

ennemyes haue choſen, they thynke ſhall ſerue theym, to flye from vs, by leapynge and runnyng downe the ſtiepeneſſe therof. But that wayes I wyll alſo ſtoppe frome theim. Wherevpon incontinente Scipio ſente two companies of his menne of warre, commaundynge the one to kepe the mouthe of the valley, by whiche the ryuer ranne: and that the other ſhulde abyde ſecretely on the waye, that laye by the bowinge of the mountayne, betwene the towne of Betula and the fyeldes: And he hym ſelfe, with a good noumbre of nymble harneſſed men, wente ſtreyghte towardes theſe Numidians and Affricanes, whiche were on the lower playne of the hyll: whoo ſuffered theim to come almooſte vppe withoute let, ſaue onely of the ſtyepeneſſe of the hylle, vntyll they came within the caſtynge of dartes. Thenne was the fyghte ſoore on bothe partes, but ſpecially great plenty of ſtoones and other inginnes was throwen from the hyll on the Romaines. Neuertheleſſe althoughe the hylle was verye tediouſe and harde to be wonne, and they alſo almooſte ouerwhelmed with ſtones: yet they beinge nymble and well harted men, and moche vſed to the approchynge and ſcalynge of walles, ceaſſed not to goo ſtyll vppewarde, tyll the formooſte of theym hadde gotten the playne and euen grounde. They anone putte the Numidyans to flyghte, and with greatte ſlaughter droue theym vppe to theyr armye, that abode in the hygheſte parte of the hyll. Thenne Scipio commaunded the ſame his companye to go ſtreyghte vppe after towarde the myddle of theyr ennemyes. The reſt of his hoſte he deuyded in two partes, wherof he cauſed Lelius to take the one halfe, and with them to go aboute on the ryght hande of the hyll, to eſpy where he myghte fynde a more eaſye place for them to aſcende. He with the other parte kept on the lefte hande. And ere euer he had fette any farre compaſſe, clambe vp the ſayde mountayne, and ran on his ennemyes, whoſe backes then wer toward him, wherwith the hoſt of the Carthaginenſes was ſore troubled, and great clamour was made, inforcynge them to tourne them to reſyſt Scipio and his company, and to chaunge theyr ordre, whiche they were in before. In all this troublous bruite came Lelius on theym on the other ſide, whoſe coming cauſed the foreward to gyue backe, for feare to be inuaded behynde, by meane wherof, the myddell warde of

Scipio gotte them the hylle, whyche before was not poſſible for theim to haue wonne, the army & elephantes kepyng their aray, the place was ſo ſtiepe to aſcend. Then began the Carthaginenſes to flee for their ſauegard. there was great ſlaughter made among them that abode, by Scipio and his company: and of thoſe that fledde, many were receyued by the .ii. companies, which were before layde in embuſſhement for the ſame purpoſe: ſo that there were ſlayne to the numbre of .viii. M. men. Aſdruball ſeing the beginning of the battaile nothing proſperous after his intent, ſent his money, and many of his elephantes away before him▪ and he folowed after with as many as coulde ſaue them ſelues with flieng: and paſſyng the ryuer of Tagus, went ſtreight toward the mountains of Pyreneis. ¶ Scipio, comynge to the campe of the Carthaginenſes, gaue all the pray therof to his ſouldiours, except the priſoners, which wer in numbre .x. thouſand fotemen, and .ii. M. horſemen: of whiche numbre, ſoo many as were Spanyardes, he let go at lybertie freely, without raunſome paying: the reſt he cauſed to be ſold by the Queſtor. Than gaue he large gyftes to the princis of Spayn, ſpecially to Indibilis he gaue .iii. C. horſes, the beſte he coulde chuſe of all that were taken. Through whiche his liberall diſtribution, the communes of Spayne called hym kyng: whyche name, Scipio declared to them, that it was very odious and deteſtable to the Romans. Wherfore he deſyred them, to abſteyne from callyng hym by that name. For with the name of gouernour or capitayne, he was well contented.
            ¶ Whan the Queſtor was about to ſell the pryſoners by the capitaynes commaundement, among other he found a goodly yonge chylde of .xv. yeres olde: whome he ſente to Scipio, for that he herd of him, that he was deſcended of lignage roial. Of whom Scipio enquired, what he was, & of what countrey, and how he, being of no greatter age, happened to be in the campe amonge men of warre. He aunſwered, that he was of Numidia, and was named Maſſus. His father (he ſayd) was deade. Wherfore his mother ſent him to her father Sala kinge of Numidia, and frome that time he had ben brought vp with his vncle Maſſaniſſa. And when his vncle came ouer into Spaine, to the ſocour of the Carthaginenſes, he came alſo with him. But euer when he went to any batteil, his vncle

wolde not ſuffer hym to go with him. So that before this time (he ſayde) he neuer came in the fyelde. And nowe it was alſo vnware to his ſayde vncle. But when euery man made hym redye, he pryuely alſo toke an horſe and harneies, and entered the battayle with them. But his chaunce was ſo euyll, that he had nowe a faule from his horſe, wherby he was taken of the Romaynes. Scipio demaunded of hym, whether he were not deſyrous to retourne to Maſſaniſſa. To whom he aunſwered, wepynge for ioye, that he wolde be verye glad, if his chaunce were ſo good. Then Scipio gaue him a ringe of golde, a cote, a ſenatours garmente, a ſpanyſſhe cloke, a goodly horſe, well harneyſed, and a buckle of golde, and ſuffered hym to departe to his vncle at his pleaſure, appoyntynge him horſemenne to conducte hym on the waye, ſo farre as he woulde haue theim.
            ¶ After theſe thynges done, he beſtowed the reſte of the ſummer in receyuynge many people and Cities of Spayne in to the amitie of the Romaynes, and remayned at Tarracon.
            ¶ Sone after the battayle foughte at Betula, the other Aſdruball, the ſonne of Gyſgon, and Mago with theyr armyes came frome the further parte of Spayne, to the helpe of the other Aſdruball: but all to late. For the battayle was paſte before theyr comynge. Wherfore they conſulted, what was beſte be doone. At the laſte, conſyderynge that Scipio, by gyftes and his lyberalytye, hadde won the hertes of the hyther partes of Spayne, and that onely the people of the furtheſte parte of the co
                  •
               ntreye towardes the Gades or pyllers of Hercules, knewe as yet nothynge of hym, nor of the Romaynes, wherfore they were ſure frendes to the Carthaginenſes: they determyned, that of neceſſytie they muſte remoue all theyr ſouldiours of Spayne, eyther to the furtheſte partes of Spayne, or elles into Fraunce: or elles in ſhorte ſpace they woulde all turne to the frendſhip of the Romaynes.
            ¶ They alſo agreed, that Aſdruball, takynge with hym al the Spanyardes out of Spayne, and farre from the name of Scipio, ſhulde go ouer the mountaynes with them towardes Anniball into Italy, where the heade and chiefe grounde of the warres was.
            
               
¶ Furthermore, that Mago, leauinge his hoſt with Aſdruball the ſonne of Gyſgon, ſhuld paſſe ouer the ſea into the iles called Baleares, nowe called Maiorque and Minorque, with a great ſumme of money, where he ſhulde alſo hire many mo ſouldiours for theyr helpe in this purpoſe. After whoſe departyng, Aſdruball, the ſonne of Gyſgon, with all his hoſt, was appointed to depart into Portugall, and that he ſhoulde in no wyſe fyght with the Romayns. Than had Maſſaniſſa .iii. M. of the beſt and lighteſt horſes and men appoynted to be with hym: with whiche numbre he was aſſigned to pervſe and ryde abrode the countreys, helping the cities, frendes of the Carthaginenſes, and to ſpoile and diſtroy the townes and fieldes of their ennemies. With theſe intentes and myndes euery one of the capitaines departed from other, makyng greate ſpede to achieue their enterpryſe.
         
         
            ¶ Marcellus the Conſull is ſlayn by an imbuſhement layde by Anniball, Criſpinus the other conſull, and Marcellus ſonne be ſoore hurte. Capi li.
            THe fame of Scipio dayly encreaſed at Rome. Alſo Q. Fabius Maximus had gotten greate honour by wynnynge the towne of Tarent. But Marcellus by meane of ennemies was runne in great infamy. For it was reported, that Anniball rouyng abrode in the countrey, he kept his hoſt in the ſommer ſeaſon in the towne of Venuſia. Marcellus to purge hym of this ſclaunderous name came to Rome, againſte the tyme of chuſynge of offycers. Thyther came alſoo Q. Fuluius Flaccus the conſull. There was the cauſe of Marcellus openly debated. And C. Bibulus, one of the Tribunes, charged hym ſoore, ſayeng, that the negligence of Marcellus, and other ſuche lyke, was the cauſe of Anniballes ſo longe abode in Italy, This is (ſayd he) the tenthe yere, ſens he came fyrſt into this countrey. He hath lyued almoſt as long in Italy, as he hath done in Carthage. At the choſyng of officers, ye wylled M. Claudius Marcellus to continue a yere longar in his office: and nowe if ye wyll knowe the fruite that he hath brought forth this yere, by the meane therof, ye ſhall vnderſtande, that he hath his hooſte two tymes beaten; and many of them ſlayne this yere. And in the chiefe of ſommer,

he hath kepte the reſydue of his men at Venuſia, within the ſure walles of the ſame.
            ¶ To this accuſation Marcellus ſo wyſely and ſobrely aunſwered, ſhewynge his policies and his actes doone agaynſte Anniball, that his excuſe was not onely welle taken, but alſo for his well dooinge, the daye folowynge he was, by the hole conſent of the people, choſen conſull: And Titus Quintus Criſpinus was choſen to be his felowe. They both were appoynted to kepe Italy agaynſte Anniball. Marcellus wente to his olde army to Venuſia, takyng with hym dyuers other, to ſupplye the places of thoſe that were before ſlayne. Criſpinus ſeinge the honour that was growen to Fabius by wynnyng of Tarent, thoughte to beſyege the citie of Locrus. Wherfore he ſent for all maner of ordynances to Sicilia, with ſhyppes alſo to aſſault the ſame by ſea as well as by land. But hearinge of the cominge of Anniball to Lacinium, he lefte his pourpoſe for a ſeaſon, and ioyned his hoſte with his fellowe Marcellus, who as than was come from Venuſia into the countrey of Apulia, where they bothe incamped their armies .iii. myles the one frome the other. Thyther came alſo Anniball ſoone after that he parceyued the conſull Criſpinus hadde lefte of his beſiegynge of the Locrenſes, and in the ſame cuntrey pytched his campe and tentes. He had the yere before aſſayed the power and herte of Marcellus, ſometyme with wynnyng, ſometyme with loſſe of men. Wherefore fearynge with the power of bothe the conſulles to be ouermatched, he than diuyſed, howe with policies and craft to deceiue them. The conſulles made dyuers ſkyrmyſhes with his men, thinkyng with ſuche tryflynge frayes to paſſe furthe the ſommer, and to kepe hym occupied: yet neuertheleſſe, they truſted to be ſtronge ynough alſo for the beſiegynge of Locrus. Wherfore they ſent to Sicilia, cauſyng L. Cincius, with his nauy and army, to come to the beſiegynge of Locrus by the ſea. Furthermore to aſſayle it alſo by lande, they commaunded part of the army, whiche laye for the defence of Tarent, to be brought thyther. This appoyntement was not ſo pryuyly done, but that Anniball hadde knowledge therof by certayne of the Thurines. Whervppon agaynſte the tyme appoynted of theyr comynge, he ſent an embuſſhement of two thouſande horſemen, and thre thouſande footemen, to lye

ſecretely vnder the hylle of Petillia, vppon the way, wherby the Romayne Tarentines ſhoulde paſſe. The Romaynes vnaduyſedly paſſyng by the waye, were amonge them to their great hurtes: for two thouſande of theim were there ſlayne, and one. M. and two hundred taken pryſoners, the reſt that eſcaped, fledde by dyuers waies backe agayne to Tarent. The conſulles laye in theyr ſeuerall campes, not farre frome the campe of Anniball. Nowe was there in the myddell waye betwene the Romaynes campe and hym, a greatte hylle, full of woodde, not taken nor viewed by any of them both. The Romayns feared for to viewe it, for that they doubted, what maner of grounde the vttermooſte parte thereof was towarde theyr enemies. Neither was it viewed of Anniball: for that he eſtemed the ſame to be a place more mete for to deceiue his ennemies, than for to pytche theron his campe. Wherefore he in the nyght ſent thither a company of Numidian horſemen to lye pryuily in the myddell of the wood, without mouynge or makynge any noyſe in the daie tyme, for feare to be eſpied. The Romaynes euer cryed to theyr capytaynes, that they ſhoulde take the ſayde hylle, and pytche there, one of theyr campes, for feare leſte Anniball ſhoulde take it before theim. Than ſaid Marcellus to his felowe Criſpinus, lette vs then, with a certaine horſemen with vs, go viewe the ſame hyll: by the 
                  •
               yghte whereof, we maye diſpoſe all thynges accordyngly. Beynge thus agreed, they takyng with them .ii. hundred and .xx. horſemen, wente bothe to ſuruey the ſayde hylle and wood. Whom yonge Marcellus, the conſuls ſonne, and Aulus Manlius beinge bothe tribunes, folowed. So couetous was the mynde of Marcellus to ioyne battaile with Anniball, that he thoughte he coulde neuer ioyne his campe nyghe ynough to the campe of his ennemye. Wherefore at his departynge, he cauſed his people to be in a redyneſſe: that in caſe the place lyked theim, that they myghte gather vp the veſſelles, and all theyr ſtuffe, and folowe theim frome theyr campes.
            ¶ The capytaynes paſſed thorough a lyttell playne fielde, and frome thenſe they entred into a fayre brode waye or rydynge, whyche wente vp into the woodes. At the toppe of this rydynge, the Numidians hadde ſette an eſpy to watche, not thynkynge of any ſoo greate a praye as happed theim to

come: but onely to watche for forrageours or wood caryars, that ſhoulde happe to roue abrode for vytayles, wood, or ſuche neceſſaries. This eſpye warned theym of the Romaynes commynge, and of the numbre, and gaue theim a ſygne, whan euery man of theim ſhoulde leape oute of his ſecrete denne: whyche he craftyly executed. For he gaue theym not the ſygne to iſſue oute, tyll the Romaynes were ſoo farre paſſed in theyr wa
                  •
               e, that the hyndermoſte parte of the embuſſhement myght incloſe theim, and ſtoppe theyr waye behynde theim, by that tyme the formoſte of the embuſhement aſſayled theim before. Than on all partes they iſſued out, and layde on the Romaynes. The conſulles ſeynge theim ſelues ſtopped, bothe before and behynde, foughte manfullye theym ſelues, and comforted theyr fellowes, thynkynge to prolonge the battayle tylle ſuccours myghte come to them. But the other were ſoo fierſe, that parte of the Romaynes fledde. Neuer the leſſe the reſte foughte for a ſeaſon, tylle they ſawe Criſpinus ſoore wounded, and his felowe Marcellus, thruſte thorough with a ſpeare, falle deade to the grounde. Thanne the reſte that were left on lyue fledde with Criſpinus the Conſull, who was ſoore hurte with two dartes, and yonge Marcellus, beynge alſo ſoore wounded. Aulus Manlius was there ſlayne, with Marcus Aulius, and foure and forty other horſemen. Arenius, with fyue ſergeantes of the conſulles, and eyghtene other horſemen, were taken priſoners.
         
         
            ¶ Anniball craftily ſendeth lettters to Salapia, ſealed with Marcellus ſygnet. Aſdruball paſſeth the mountayns with his army, to mete his brother Anniball. Cap. lii.
            
               
                  ANNIBALL knowynge that greatte feare woulde be in the Romayne hooſte, by the deathe of the one Conſulle, and alſo by the woundynge of the other: to putte theym to further feare, he incontynent remoued his hooſte into the ſame hylle, where the battayle hadde beene before, where he pytched his Campe. There founde he the bodye of

Marcellus, whiche he cauſed to be buryed. Criſpinus beinge ſore feared with the deathe of his fellowe, and alſo with his owne woundes: in the nyght folowynge remoued ſecretelye his armye into the higheſt and nexte hyll, that he for his ſuertie coulde fynde, there pitchinge his campe and tentes. Both the capitaines endeuoured them ſelues, to the vttermoſt, the one to deceyue, and the other to eſchewe deceite.
            ¶ Anniball, with the bodye of Marcellus, founde alſoo his ringe, with his ſygnet: wherby he truſted to worke deceytfull concluſions. Criſpinus myſtruſtinge alſo the ſame, ſente with ſpede worde to all the cities of the Romaynes, nere adioyninge, warnynge theim, that his felowe Marcellus was ſlayne, and that Anniball had gotten his ſignet. Wherfore he commanded theim, in no wyſe to gyue credence to any letters that ſhulde be ſente vnto them, ſealed with the ſeale of Marcellus, or made in his name. Soone after a meſſanger came to Salapia from Anniball, with letters written and ſealed in the name of Marcellus: ſhewynge vnto them, that the nyght folowynge Marcellus wolde priuely come thyther. Wherfore he commaunded the capitaynes and garriſon to be redy at his commynge, to knowe his further pleaſure, what was to be done. The Salapiens fyndynge crafte in the wrytynge, ſente backe the meſſangers to Anniball with gentyll anſwere. And they the nyghte prefyxed, ſette ſure watche and warde on the walles, ſpecially on that parte of the towne, and at that gate, where they demed theyr ennemyes wolde come. A lyttell before the daye came Anniball, with a great company with hym. The firſt company that cam to the yates, was of Romans, that wer departed from the cuntrey, & taken in wages by Anniball. They had all Romayne armour, and when they came to the gate, they ſpake laten, as dydde the Romaynes, wakynge the watchemen, and byddynge them to open the gate to the conſull. The watche aroſe, and with great leuers lyft vp the port colyes ſoo hyghe, that men myghte entre vnder it. Then the ſayde bande of Romaynes runawayes, entered ſo faſt as they myght. But when they were entred, to the numbre of .vi. C. of them, the rope, whiche dyd holde vp the portcolyes, was let ſlyp, and fell downe with great noyſe makynge. The Salapiens, with ſmalle reſyſtence, ſlewe them that were entred the towne. For that they, myſtruſtinge no ſuche thyng, bare their

harneys hanginge on theyr ſhulders, thynkyng to haue entred with peace. Many of the towne with ſpeares and dartes, chaſed theyr ennemyes from the gate and walles.
            ¶ Thus Anniball, beinge taken in his owne trappe, was deceyued: and from thenſe departed, to rayſe the ſyege of his friendes the Locrenūs, whom Cincius, with his ſouldiours and ordynaunce, that came from Sicilia, kept very harde and ſtrayghte.
            ¶ Mago was in the citie, who herynge of the death of Marcellus, toke ſome comforte vnto hym. But when he harde tydynges, that Anniball had ſente his Numidian horſemen before him, and was coming hym ſelfe after with his fotemen, as ſpedely as he myght, he was then withoute feare. Wherfore when he eſpyed afarre of the Numidians approchyng, he cauſed the gate to be opened, and in arraye with his folke iſſued out vpon the Romaynes. His ſodeyne comyng on them, more then his ſtrengthe, cauſed the battayle to endure for a ſeaſon doubtefull. But when the Numidians were alſo come, the Romaynes were ſo ſtryken with feare, that withoute ordre they ranne towarde theyr ſhyppes, leauynge behynde theym all theyr ordynaunce, wherwith they had beaten the walles. And by this meane was the ſyege of the Locrenſis rayſed.
            ¶ Criſpinus the conſull ſente letters to Rome, bothe of his felowes deathe, and alſo of his ſore hurtes: which letted him ſo, that he could not come to Rome to the choſyng of the conſuls. The ſenatours were very penſyfe, to ſe two conſuls armies deſtitute of capitaynes. Wherfore at the day of the election, they loked about, to fynd two wiſd and circumſpect perſons for that offyce, who had ben acqueynted with the deceites of Anniball. Fyrſte they aboue other lyked C. Claudius Nero, whom they knewe to be a valyaunt man, and a good capytayne. But they eſtemed hym to be to quicke for that tyme of the warres, and to matche that ſoobre capytayne Anniball.
            Wherfore they deuyſed to match his quickenes, with a ſobre felowe of great temperance. Then was there one M. Liuius, a man of great ſobreneſſe, late come agayne into the citie. He had before ben conſull about .viii. yeres paſſed, and in his conſulſhyppe was condempned by the comons, without fault: and put out of his offyce. Which ſhame to hym done, he toke ſo diſpleaſauntly, that leauynge the citie, he wente forthe into

the countrey, to dwell out of the company of men. And .viii. yeres after his condempnation, M. Marcellus, and M. Valerius Leuinus the conſulles, brought hym home agayne into the citie: but they founde hym foule and euyll apparellyd, his heare and bearde longe, as a token of his ſhame receiued. But at this time the cenſors cauſed hym to rounde his heare, and puttynge on other cleane garmentes, to come in to the ſenate houſe. When he was brought thyther, and the fathers were examyned of theyr opinions of M. Liuius, touchyng the offyce of conſull: They agreed all, both ſenatours and the commons, that it were a mete couple of hym and Claudius Nero. But he alone refuſed the office, accuſyng the citezens of their vnkynde lyghtneſſe, ſayinge:
            ¶ I meruayle moche, ye laye nowe the burthen of this office on me, whom ye of late thruſte oute of that ſame offyce, thynkyng me vnworthy therof. If ye accompt me to be a good and an honeſte man, why then dyd ye condempne me as an euyll man, and as an offender? And ſyns ye iudged, that I euill gouerned the conſulſhyp, wherin I laſte was: why truſte ye me nowe agayne with the ſame roume?
            ¶ With ſuch wordes he accuſed the fathers and alſo the commons. But the ſenatours rebuked hym for his wordes, ſhewinge him the example of M. Furius Camillus, which though he were banyſhed the citie of Rome, yet was he after reſtored agayne: For (ſayd they) lyke as the childe ought to ſuffer the ſharpe puniſhement of his father: ſo ought euery man to ſuffer the puniſhement of his countrey, with pacience and gentilnes.
            ¶ With theſe wordes they appeaſed hym, and cauſed hym to take on hym the ſayde office.
            ¶ The one conſull was appoynted to kepe the warre againſte Anniball in Italy, leſte he ſhulde drawe nere to Aſdruball, cominge from the mountaynes to his ſuccour: The other was aſſygned to mete Aſdruball, the fame of whome was, that he beganne to approche the mountaynes, to thintent to come ouer, to ioyne his power with his brother Anniball. The opynion of Anniball dyd alſo mo
                  •
               he helpe the Romaynes in this purpoſe. For althoughe he knewe, that his brother woulde that ſommer paſſe the mountaynes, to come ouer to hym: yet whan he remembred the manyfold lettes that he had him ſelfe, as in paſſynge the ryuer of Rhodanus, and then the dangerus

mountaynes, ſtryuinge bothe with men and peryllous places, wherin he had ſpent fyue monethes, he loked not for ſo ſpedye and quicke coming of his brother. whiche cauſed hym to be ſo long, er euer he remoued frō the place, where he wintred with his army. But in this he was moche deceiued. For Aſdruball had better ſpede in his paſſage, then he loked for him ſelfe. For the frenchemen, and alſo the mountaynoys, dyd not onely receiue him, and ſuffered hym with his army to paſſe their countreys: but alſo they folowed him to the warres, leadinge him many ſure wayes, whiche to Anniball his brother, were then vnable to be paſſed. Agayne, the wayes ouer the mountaynes, by the continuall vſe of goinge ouer them, were made moche more eaſy then they were, and the people more gentyll to intreate. For before Annibals comynge, they were not vſed to the company of ſtraungers, neyther had ſene any before in the countrey. wherfore they were wylde and ſauage people. They thoughte alſo at the fyrſte tyme, that the Carthaginenſes had come to take theyr caſtelles and cattell from them. But nowe the fame of the warre holden in Italy, betwene the Romaynes and the Carthaginenſes, taught them, and made them to know, that the hole contention betwen thoſe noble head cities of the worlde, beinge ſo farre diſtant a ſundre, was onely for the honour and for riches: ſo that they wolde trye, whether of them ſhulde poſſede the dominion of the hole.
            ¶ Theſe cauſes knowen, made the mountaynes open and eaſy for Aſdruball to paſſe: but his ſpeede was not ſo good in paſſynge the ſame, as his let was great in the beſieginge of Placentia. Whan he was come ouer, he had thought the citie, beinge in a faire plaine countrey, had ben eaſy to wynne: and by the fame of the wynnynge therof, he thoughte all other cities adioyninge, ſhulde haue trembled for feare. But the ſtrength therof moche deceyued him, and that knewe Anniball full wel. For when he came ouer the riuer of Trebia, he in vayne had aſſayed the ſtrength therof. So that Aſdrubals aſſieginge of Placentia was not onely a lette of his owne iourneye: but alſo it ſtayed Anniball moche longer: after he harde therof, ere euer he ſette forthe of the place, where he wyntered with his hoſte.
            ¶ The conſulles with theyr armyes went to their prouinces, M. Liuius towardes Placentia, whome ere he departed,

Q. Fabius warned and exhorted, that he ſhulde not ouer haſtyly fyght with his ennemies, before he knewe the maners and conditions of theim. To whom Liuius, remaynynge yet in dyſpleaſure towarde his citezens for his banyſhement, anſwered: that he wolde fyght with theim ſo ſoone as he might haue fyght of them. Whan the cauſe was demaunded of hym, why he wolde make therm ſuche haſte: Truely (ſayd he) eyther I wyll quyckely haue great honour, by ſubduinge myne ennemyes, or els greatte ioye, by the ſleynge of myne owne vnkynde cytezens. Whyche ioye althoughe it be to me not honeſte: yet ſhall it be accordyng to theyr deſeruynges.
            ¶ Quintus Claudius Nero made haſte, tyll he approched nere vnto Anniball: who as than was gone into the countrey of the Lucanes, and lay by the towne of Grument. Claudius hadde in his army forty thouſande fotemen, and two thouſand and fyue hundred horſemen: Anniball gatherynge togyther as moche power as he coulde amonge the Brutians, and from ſuche fortreſſes as he than helde: lay inc
                  •
               mped nigh vnto the walles of Grument: and within halfe a myle of them was the campe of the Romaynes. Betwene bothe the campes there was a goodly playne valey, hauynge on the oone ſyde fayre playne hylles, without any wooddes or couerte, for to hyde any embuſſhement, or cauſe deceyte. Wherfore it was the leſſe ſuſpecte to bothe parties. Theſe hylles laye adioynyng to the lefte ſyde of the Carthaginenſes, and to the ryghte ſyde of the Romaynes. In the playne medowe were many lyght eſkyrmyſſhes made betweene the hoſtes, and many excurſyons the Romayne conſull cauſed to be made onely to kepe his ennemyes there frome goynge towarde Aſdruball.
            ¶ On the other ſyde Anniball, deſyrous to remoue out of that place with all his power intended to gyue hym battaile. Wherfore he putte his whole hoſte in array. Claudius Nero, perceyuynge his intent, cauſed ſecretely the nyght folowynge, Titus Aſſellus, and P. Claudius two tribunes, with a good noumbre of men with theim, to paſſe ouer the ſayde hylle, adioynynge, and to abyde in the valeye behynde the hylles, appoyntynge theim a tyme, whan they ſhoulde deſcende from the mountayne on the backe of theyr ennemies. He hym ſelfe in the breake of the daye, with the reſte of his

footemen and horſemen, came into the fielde in good araye. Anniball lykewyſe commaunded his men to arme theim, and greate noyſe was made in the campe, euery man runnynge to harneys. And whan they were armed, they ranne oute of the campe yates, bothe horſemen and footemen, without array before Anniball had knowledge therof. And as ſoone as they were out of the Campe in the playne, they ranne to their ennemyes, fyghtynge bothe on horſebacke and on foote, as chaunce gaue theym to meete with theyr ennemies, kepynge none order.
            ¶ Whan the Conſull ſawe theym thus rounnynge abrode in the fyelde without order, he commaunded C. Arunculeus, with the horſemen of a legyon, to inuade the Carthaginenſes, with as moche vyolence as he myght: wherby he myght ſlea theym, beinge without order lyke beaſtes, before they coulde be brought in array. Whyche he dydde dilygentely execute, makynge greate ſlaughter. The battayle was ſtrong for a ſeaſon, by reaſon of contynuall reſorte of freſhe ſouldiours, runnyng to the ſuccours of theyr felowes.
            ¶ Anniball, being yet in his campe, hearyng the noyſe of his men fyghtyng, came furthe with the reſte of his power, and ſo dilygently applyed him ſelfe: that euen as his menne were fyghtynge, he put many of theym in araye. Whiche thynge hath not bene lyghtly ſeene, and therein he ſhewed hym ſelfe to be an experte capytayne, hauyng olde and well acquaynted warryours vnder hym. And thus had he brought his wholle hoſte in order, as they were ſtyll fyghtyng: had not C. Aſſellus, with his bandes of Romaynes, ſodainely deſcended from the hylles, at the backe of the Carthaginenſes, with greate clamour: By the meanes wherof, they beyng aferde leſt they ſhuld be ſtopped from their campe, began to flee on all partes. The horſemen ſlewe many of them in the chaſe: and many mo had been ſlayne, had not the campe been ſo nere at hande. yet loſt Anniball of his men at that battayle .viii. M. which were ſlayne, and vii. C. taken aliue. The next day, and diuers days after, the Romains in array kept the fielde, deſyrous to fight, but the Carthaginenſes abode ſtyll in theyr tentes.
            ¶ Soone after in the nyght, Anniball, with his army, remoued towardes Apulia, makinge great fyres before the campe, towardes the Romaynes, and leauynge in the entree of his

campe, certayne Numydian horſemen for a ſhewe, tyl he with his hooſte myght be farre gone frome his ennemyes. Whan it was day lyght, the ſayd Numidians ſhewed theim ſelues in the gate of the campe for a ſeaſon, purpoſely to deceyue the Romaines: and whan they ſawe theyr tyme, they ſpedily rode after theyr companie.
            ¶ Than the conſull, hearynge noo noyſe in the tentes of his ennemyes, ſent two light horſmen to viewe theyr campe, who fyndynge it voyde of theyr ennemies, retourned to Claudius, certifiynge hym of theyr departyng. Whervpon he with his hoſte wente thyther, and toke the ſpoyle of ſuche baggage as was there leſte: and on the morowe early folowed the Carthaginenſes, by the fame that they hearde of their waie, by whiche they were gone. Anniball, no more willynge to fyght, toke his waie euer in the nyght, and ouer the mountaynes, tyl he came to Metapontus: where he toke of Hanno, the ſoudiours, whyche were there lefte, and ioyned theim to his armye, ſendynge hym with a ſmalle numbre with hym, into the countrey of the Brutians, there to aſſemble moo men of warre to his ſuccour.
         
         
            ¶ Of the great battayle betwene Aſdruball and the conſulles, in whyche Aſdruball was ſlayne, with ſyx and fyfty thouſand men, beſyde many that were taken, with a great ſpoyle. Cap. liiii.
            
               ASdruball, leauing his further aſſiegyng of Placentia, ſent foure frenchemen, and two Numidians to his brother Anniball with letters: who paſſyng all Italy, heryng that Anniball ſhoulde then be at Metapontus, folowed him thither: But er they were ware, they loſt their way, and came to the fieldes of Tarent, where they were taken, and ſent to Claudius Nero with their letters. Who whan he had redde them, and knewe by the contentes therof, that Aſdruball intended to mete his brother in Vmbria, thynkyng then to be no tyme mete for the common welth, to tary the determination of the ſenate: he imagyned, that he would enterpryſe ſome ſtrange thing, wherby he ſhulde put both the citezens of Rome, and alſo his ennemies in great feare. But at lengthe,

whan it was achieued, it ſhulde tourne the wholle citie from greate feare into meruailous gladneſſe. Wherfore he ſent the ſayde letters to Rome, with other his owne letters of his intended enterpryſe. And incontinent ſente meſſangers before hym, to all the townes & countreys, by whych he with his army ſhoulde paſſe: commaundyng theim to brynge furthe into the fieldes agaynſt his commynge, vitayles, horſes, and other neceſſaries for his ſouldyours. Than of his wholle armye he choſe out .vi. thouſande footemen, and one. M. horſmen: ſayinge and publyſhyng, that with them he intended to aſſault the next towne of the Lucans, & to take the Carthaginenſes, whiche were there left for the keping therof. With this company in the nyght he departed, makyng as great haſte as he myghte in his iourney, to come to the healpe of his felowe Liuius, before he ſhulde haue to do with Aſdruball: leauynge Quintus Tatius in his campe, to rule and gouerne the reſt of his hoſte. At Rome the conſulles letters made all men no leſſe aferde, than they were two yeres paſt, whan the Carthaginenſes hadde pytched theyr tentes before the walles of Rome. They doubted, whether they myght allowe or diſallowe that bolde enterpryſe of the conſull, whyche dyd appere to hange all vpon chaunce. They knewe the campe was left very nere to Anniball, with an army diſpurueyed of a capitayne: ye and the flowre and ſtrengthe of the ſame armye was taken awaye with the Capytayne, leauynge his campe ſure in nothynge, but onely by the ignoraunce of his ennemies, who were not priuy as then of the conſulles abſence. But what yf it happed to be knowen, and that it chaunced Anniball with his wholle army to folowe Nero, hauyng with him but .vi. thouſand fotemen armed, and one. M. horſemen: or that he wold aſſaile the reſte, which were left in the campe, without ſtrength or good gouernance. The euil chances, which they had before ſuſteined in the warres, with the late dethe of .ii. conſuls in one yere, increaſed their feare, whyche all had happed to theim, whan there was but one capytayne and one army of their ennemies in Italy. Nowe they knewe .ii. myghty armies .ii. valyant capitaines: ye almoſt .ii. Anniballes, to be in the countrey. For Aſdruball the ſonne alſo of Amilcar, hadde many yeres in Spayne, made warre agaynſte the Romayns, where he had hadde two noble victories, ſleynge two greate armies,

and alſo .ii. Scipions, the noble capitayns of the ſame. Furthermore, that he myghte glory aboue Anniball, bothe of his ſpedy paſſage ouer the mountaynes, and alſo of drawyng with hym the frenchemen to battayle. For euen where the one had almoſte loſte the greatter parte of his menne, by hungre and colde (whiche two be the greatteſt myſeries of warre): euen there had the other gathered together a gret puiſſance. They rekened alſo, that Claudius Nero ſhuld haue to do with a witty capitayn, whom he knewe before had mocked & illuded hym in Spayne lyke a child, with deceiteful intretyng of conditions of peace: wherby he eſcaped out of the ſtraytes, wherein he was indaungered. Thus throughe feare (whiche is thinterpretour of all thynges to the worſte) they eſtemed the power of theyr ennemyes to be great, and their owne to be ſmall.
            ¶ In the meane tyme Nero the conſull, after he had ſo farre traueyled frome the daunger of his ennemies, that he iudged he myght ſafely diſcouer his ſecrete enterpriſe: he then called together his ſouldiours, and ſpake vnto them ſayinge:
            There was neuer any enterpryſe taken in hande by any capitayne, whiche was in apparence more bolde, and in effect more ſure then this was. For I wyll nowe brynge you (ſayde he) to a certayne and ſure victorye. For we goo to a battayle, for the whiche my felowe Liuius had before as many fotemenne and horſemen appoynted hym of the ſenate, as he wolde deſyre. Ye ſuche a numbre as he wolde not haue deſyred a greatter, if he ſhulde haue ben appoynted to fyght with Anniball hym ſelfe: and nowe, by the fame of the comynge of the other conſull, with his armye, beinge ioyned to the other: we ſhall not fayle to haue an vndoubted victory. For fame is the thynge that gyueth victory in battayle. Yea ſmall thinges oft tymes driue the hertes and myndes of men, eyther in to feare or in to a good hope. And the hole glorye and honour of all the good ſpede ſhall be gyuen to vs. For euer that, whiche cometh laſt, draweth all the honour to it.
            ¶ With this comforte he led them forward on theyr way, paſſynge by a great multitude of men and women of the countrey, that came forth to mete them with great fauour and prayſe giuynge: namynge them the patrons and defendours of the cō
               mon welthe, and of the hole empyre of Rome, in whoſe handes then laye the helthe welth and lybertie, bothe of them and

of theyr children. Wherfore they prayed vnto the goddes for theyr proſperous returne with victory and tryumphe. And in declarynge theyr loue towardes theyr ſouldiours, they offered them cattell, vitayles, and other neceſſarye thynges, whiche they hertely deſyred them to take at theyr pleaſure. And they on the other ſyde, thankefully receiuing that they neded, went on theyr waye, eatynge whan they were hungry, and but ſeldome toke any reſte, tyl they came nere to the campe of the other conſull M. Liuius. Then ſent Claudius meſſangers to his felowe, aduertyſynge hym of his comynge, to knowe his mynd, whether it were beſt for hym and his company, to come to hym pryuely or openly, in the nyght tyme or in the day: and whether he ſhoulde entre in to his campe, or make an other campe for hym ſelfe and his army: Liuius anſwered, that beſt it was, he entered into his campe ſecretly in the nyght. For the more ſuertie wherof, he gaue a pryuy watche worde or token, wherby one tribune ſhulde receyue an other, one centurio or hundredour an other, one horſeman an other, and one foteman ſhulde receyue an other. And it was thought, that there was ſpace ynoughe in the fyrſte campe, to receyue hym and his cō
               panye, ſenſe thoſe that came with Claudius Nero brought lyttle more with them, but onely theyr armour, for the ſpedineſſe of theyr war. Liuius tentes were then pitched nere to Sena, and Aſdruball reſted not paſt halfe a myle thence. When Nero approched, he couered hym with mountaynes and hylles, tyll it was nighte. Then kepynge greate ſylence, they entred the campe of Liuius, and were euery man broughte into the tentes by his lyke officer, where they were friendly and gentylly receyued, with great ioye and gladneſſe .L. Portius the pretor had his campe ioynynge to the campe of the conſull. The daye folowynge they counſayled, what was beſt then to be done. Some gaue aduyſe, that Nero with his company, beinge wery, ſhulde reſte them certayne dayes, and that the battayle ſhulde be differred, tyll they were fully refreſhed of their longe trauayle: and in the meane tyme to knowe the maner of theyr ennemyes. But Nero wolde in noo wyſe agree therto, he inſtantly deſyred them ſo to worke, that his ſecrete enterpryſe, whiche by his ſwyfte comynge thither was made ſure, ſhulde not by theyr long tarying be made folyſhe and voyde. For Annibal beinge deceyued, kepeth hym cloſe in his tentes,

not knowynge of my comyng hyther, nor of the vnſure leauing of myne armye in my campe: but this deceyte can not longe behyd. With ſpede makyng Aſdruball and his hoſt may be ouerthrowen, er euer I departe: and then may I with lyke ſpeede returne to my company into Apulia. But whoo ſo by prolongynge of the tyme, gyueth ſpace to his ennemies, he cauſeth my campe in Apulia to be delyuered to Anniball, and openeth the way for hym to come hither to be ioyned to his brother, Aſdrubal at his pleaſure. Wherfore incontinent let vs go to battayle: and therby bothe our ennemyes, that be abſente in Apulia, and alſo thoſe that be here preſent at hand, ſhalbe deceyued: the other by thynkynge our numbre there to be no leſſe then it was, and theſe by thinking your numbre to be nothynge increaſed.
            ¶ After theſe earneſt wordes of Claudius, they departed frō the counſaile, and euery man armed hym ſelfe, and were put in good order of battayle. The Carthaginenſes alſo were alredy come out of theyr campe, and ſtode in array redy to fyght, and bothe the armies had without taryeng gone to gither, had not Aſdrubal for a ſeaſon cauſed his company to ſtay. He, with certayne other horſemen in his company, rode before his hoſt: where he perceiued amonges the Romaynes, to be many olde ſhildes, whiche he had not ſeene before. Alſo he marked many carreine leane and ouer laboured horſes. He thought alſo the numbre of his ennemies was greatter then it was wont to be. Wherfore hauyng a miſtruſt of that, whiche in dede was true: he blewe the retraite. And incontinent ſent certayn of his men to the ryuer, where the Romayne horſes were watered, to eſpye and marke, whether any of theyr horſes were diſcoloured by daſhinge with myre of the waye, or with duſt: wherby they might appere to be of late iourneyed. He alſo cauſed ſome other to ride a farre of aboute theyr campes, to ſe, whether the trenche that enuironed the campe, were enlarged any whyt or not. Furthermore to marke, whether the trumpet, did ſounde ones or two tymes within the campe of the Romaynes. Nothinge deceiued him ſo moche, as when worde was broughte him, that the campes were nothynge enlarged: but that there were but twaine as was before, one of Liuius cōſull, the other of L. Portius: and neither of thē altered otherwiſe then they fyrſte were. Neuertheleſſe it troubled hym ſore, beinge a wyſe

man and moche vſed to warres with the Romaynes, when it was ſhewed hym, that the trumpet blewe but ones in the pretors campe: but in the other it blewe two tymes: wherfore he iudged ſurely, that bothe the conſuls were there. Whervppon he began to muſe, howe the other conſull ſhulde be departed from his brother Anniball. He could not deuyſe the thing as it was, that his brother was ſo illuded by the departinge of the capitayne from his campe, whiche was not farre of, with part of his power. He iudged, that he had ſuſteined ſome gret loſſe: wherby he durſt not followe the conſull. Wherfore he feared greatly, leaſt whan all was loſt before, he was come to late to his brother with ſocours. He alſo miſtruſted, that his letters neuer came to Anniballes handes, but that they, with his meſſangers, were taken vp by the waye: vpon the ſyghte wherof the other conſull was come with haſt to vanquiſhe him alſo. Beinge in this great perplexitie, he cauſed all the fires to be put oute, and euery man to truſſe vp his ſtuffe and baggage: and in the begynninge of the nyghte, he with his hole hoſt departed ſecretely, folowinge two guides. Whoo had not farre gone with them, but partly for feare, and partely beinge troubled with the rumour of the armye, toke no good hede to their waye: wherfore they ſecretely ſlypped awaye, leauyng theim without a guide. Some wandered abrode in the fieldes, ſome beinge wery and ouerwatched, laide them bowne to ſlepe and to reſt them, leauynge theyr ſtandardes. When the daye appered, Aſdruball cauſed his ſtandardes to go before the hoſte alonge the ſyde of the ryuer of Metaurus, ſekynge for fordes, where he myght paſſe ouer: but the further he went vp the riuer, the hyer were the bankes. Thus wanderynge ſtyll after the crokes and tourninges of the banke, ſekyng a place of paſſage: he ſpente a great parte of the daye in waſte: wherby the Romaynes had gotten tyme and ſpace to followe them. Fyrſt Nero with his horſemen ouer toke them: ſone after came Lucius Portius with his light harneſſed men. They ſlewe many of Aſdruball his folke, that abode behynd in the fieldes to reſt them. Aſdruball ſeinge no remedy to eſcape, ſoughte for ſome hyll by the riuer ſyde, wheron he myghte lodge his hoſt. By that tyme was Liuius alſo come with al his power of fotemen, armed and in good array. Then ioynynge theyr companies to gether, they put euery man in order. Claudius Nero led the

ryght wynge. Liuius kept the lefte wyng. Portius the pretor came in the myddell warde.
            ¶Whan Aſdruball ſawe to remedy, but that he muſt needes fyght, he left the fortifiyng of his campe, and put his people in array. In the forefront he ſet his elephantes: about theim on the lefte hande agaynſt Claudius Nero the conſull, he ſet his frenchemen: not for that he truſted to theim moche hym ſelfe, but bicauſe he thought his ennemies feared theim moſt. The ryghte wynge he kepte hym ſelfe with his ſpanyardes, his olde meane of warre, in whom his moſte truſte was. The Liguriens, men of a countrey of Italy, were ſette in the middell behynde the elephantes. There was a greatte hylſe betwene the Frenchemen and Claudius Nero: ſo that he by no meanes with his hoſt, might come to fight with theim. Wherfore they ſtode ſtyll a good ſpace without doing of any thing. But betweene Aſdruball and Liuius fyers and mortall was the fyght. There were the greate numbre of Romayne fotemen agaynſt the multitude of Spaniardes his expert warryours, and alſo agaynſt the Liguriens, which wer very ſtronge and valiant men. The elephantes alſo dyd at the fyrſte moche diſpleaſure. Claudius ſeinge that he coulde not haue to doo with the Frenchemen, tourned aboute his company, and fetchyng a compaſſe, came on the other ſyde of Aſdruballes armye. Than were the Spanyardes and the Liguriens ſlayne on all parties, and the fyght was alredy come to the frenchmen, who were able to make ſmal reſiſtence: for many of their company were ſhronken away and feble for labour and ouerwatchynge, as they be a people that can not well away with peyne. Many of theim were there ſlayne. Many alſo of the elephantes were ſlayne by the Romaynes, but moo by theyr owne rulars that rode vppon theim. For after they were ones ſtryken and aferde, the beaſtes were ſo vnruly, and dyd ſoo moche hurte to theyr owne Carthaginenſes hoſte: that theyr owne kepers and ryders ſlewe theim.
            ¶Aſdruball, lyke a full noble capitayne, handled hym ſelfe in that battayle, ſometyme fyght
                  •
               ng valiantly in his owne perſone, ſometyme exhortyng his men manfully to fight, ſometyme he deſyred his werye ſouldiours to take ſome peyne for hym, and for theyr owne lyues, ſometyme he rebuked theyr ſluggyſhnes. And yf any began to flee, he anon brought them

backe to the battayle, and reſtored agayne the fielde, whyche in diuers places was ſlaked. At the laſt, whan he ſaw no helpe, but that withoute remedy he muſte loſe the fielde: not myndynge to lyue after ſo great a ſlaughter of his men and friendes, whyche for his ſake vndertooke that voyage: he ranne his horſe with the ſpurres into the myddell of the Romayne hoſte: where to declare the noble valour of his ſtomacke, of whome he was deſcended, lyke the ſonne of Amilcar, and brother to Anniball, he valyantly fought, and fyghtyng was ſlayne. Greate was the ſlaughter of the Carthaginenſes in that battayle: ſo that it was thought equall to the Romaynes loſſe at Cannas, as well for the numbre of menſlayne, as for the loſſe of the capitaynes. There was of Aſdrubals hoſte in this battayle ſlayne ſyx and fyfty thouſande men, and there were .v. thouſande and foure hundred taken pryſoners. The pray at the ſpoyle was great, bothe of golde and ſyluer, and alſo of the Romayne priſoners, whiche before Aſdruball bad taken. Of whyche Romayne pryſoners, there were founde aboue .iiii. M. The Romayns loſt in this battayle almoſte .viii. M. men. On the morowe woorde was broughte to Liuius, that thoſe frenchemen and Ligures, whiche were left on liue at the battayle the daye before, were nowe aſſembled togither agayne, and went away without any capitayn or kepyng good order, ſo that they myght ſoone be all ſlayne, yf he wolde ſend but one wynge of horſemen to purſue theim. Not ſo ſayd Liuius, we wyll ſuffre ſome of our ennemies to eſcape, whyche ſhal remayne and be meſſangers, both of the diſtruction of our ennemies, and alſo of our noble honour and proweſſe.
            ¶Claudius Nero, the night after the battayle foughten, departed with his company agayne toward his owne camp, making ſo moche haſt in his retourne, that the ſyxt day folowing he was come to his owne campe, and to the frontiers of his ennemy Annibal, he made ſuche ſpede, that no meſſenger was come thyther before him, whiche hadde broughte any newes of the victorie. Wherefore his perſonalle comynge, with the ſodein declaration of their good ſpede, cauſed ſo greatte ioye and gladnes in the Romayne armie, as thoughe an heauenlie comforte had ben ſent theym after an extreme doloure. At Rome alſo, when newes were brought of their proſperus ſucceſſe, ſuche ioye was made, as canne not well be expreſſed.

For after Claudius departynge towarde his ſelowe, frome the ſonne ryſynge to the ſome ſettynge, the ſenatours neuer departed frome the ſenate howſe: neyther wente the cytezens out of the market place. The matrones of the citie were in contynuall prayers: ſoo that with theyr clamour, pylgremages, and vowes, theyr goddis were all weryed. But whame the certayntie of the vyctorye, the greatte occiſion of theyr ennemies, with the deathe of the Capytayne, was broughte the

               n beganne the marchauntes to bye, to ſell, to paye, to receyue, and to make all maner of contractes, as they were wont to do intyme of peace.

He alſoo cauſed the Affricans, whyche he hadde taken pryſoners in the battaylle, bounden as they were, to be ſette before his campe: to the intente his ennemyes myghte ſee theim. And for the more encreaſe of Anniballes ſorowe, he looſed two of his ſayde Affricanes pryſoners, commaundynge theim to goo to Anniball, and to declare vnto hym, the ordre of all thynges as they hadde ben done in the battayl: wherwith he was ſo ſtryken with ſorowe, bothe for the loſſe of ſoo greate noumbee of menne of his brothers armye, as alſo for the loſſe of his friendes and famylyars, that he ſayde, he knewe full well, what ſhoulde be the fortune and fatall chaunce of Carthage within ſhorte ſpace. Whervppon he remoued into the fieldes of the Brutians. And for that he hadde no power lefte hym of men, to defende his fortreſſes, that yet helde, being ſo farre of: he gathered to gyther all the Metapontanes and the Lucanes, ſuche as were his frendes: and brought them all into the countrey of the Brutians, where he remayned for a ſeaſon, counſailing, what were beſte for hym to doo.

               yue, dryucth Haſdruball and Mage, with all theyr power, cleane out of Spayne, Cap. liiii.
            IN Spayne betwene the Romayns and the Carthaginenſes thus was the countrey diuyded. Aſdruball, the ſonne of Gyſgon, was dryuen with his companye into the vttermoſte parte of Spayne, and to the yles called the Gades. The reſt of the countrey eaſtwardes, was vnder the dominion of the Romaynes, oneleſſe it were very fewe cities, whyche were kepte by the Affricanes: to whoſe ſuccours Hanno, a newe capitayne was ſent from Affrica, with a newe armye, in ſteede of Aſdruball, that was ſlayne. This Hanno had alſo hyred a great nomber of men of warre in Celtiberia. With this great hoſte he ioyned to Mago. Agaynſte whome Scipio ſent M. Sillanus, with .x. M. footemen, and v .C. horſemen. And he paſſynge the hye hilles, and manifold daungerous paſſages and ſtraites of Spayn, made ſuch ſpede, that by the guyding of certayne runawayes of Celtiberia, he came within ten myles of his ennemies, before any knowledge was hadde, or any fame was bruted of his comynge. There he ſtode for a ſeaſon, tyll he had by the ſayde runawayes or eſpyes knowledge, that his ennemies were lodged in .ii. campes: the Celtiberiens on the left hande of the hye waie, and were to the noumbre of .ix. M. ſouldyours, the Carthaginenſes were on the ryghte hande. Sillanus fyrſte aſſayled the Celtiberiens: who by the meanes of Mago, were ſoone put in order. The battaile endured ſoore for a ſeaſon: and ſomewhat the longer, by meanes of reſorte of the Carthaginenſes, whiche came frome the other campe to the healpe of the Celtiberiens. At the laſte Mago, ſeinge his parte lyke to be putte to the worſte, with two thouſande footemen, and the wholle power of horſemenne, that were lefte on lyue, fledde vnto the Gades, and came to Aſdruball. Hanno, the other capytayne, was taken on lyue: with many other noble pryſoners.
            ¶ Soone after the battayle with Hanno, Cornelius Scipio departed to Tarracon, leauynge in that countrey L. Scipio his brother, with tenne thouſande fotemen, and one thouſand horſemen. who after his brothers departing with this power,

aſſanted the town
                  •
                of Qungin: not without peyne. For they ſcarſely were ſuffered to put theyr ſcalinge ladders to the walles: ſo great was the violence of the dartes and other ingins, whiche were throwen at them. And ſo ſone as any were raiſed vp thervnto, and men theron, ſtriuinge to aſcende: anone they were eyther throwen downe, men and all, by the ſouldiours of the towne, hauinge forkes made for that purpoſe: orels they were in ieoperdy to be drawen vp ladders men and all, by reaſon of iron hokes that were throwen vpon the ladders, taking ſuche ſure holde on them, that the clymbers were often times pulled vp farre frome the grounde, and hanged longe by the roundes of the ladders. Thus continued the aſſault very long, and was verye fyers and daungerous on bothe partes. Then had Scipio deuided his hoſt in thre partes, to the intente one parte ſhulde euer aſſaulte the towne, while the other reſted.
            Wherfore he commaunded thoſe, whiche were at the fyrſt aſſaulte, to withdrawe to their tentes, and reſt them: and incontinent with other two partes of his freſhe ſouldiours, he gaue a newe aſſaulte on two partes of the towne: ſo that the defondours, beinge wery with the longe ſuſteinyng the furſt aſſault, and alſo ſoore afraide, as deſperate, leauinge the walles, withdrewe them: wherupon the towne was wonne, and great occiſion made of people of all kyndes and ages.
            ¶ Whan tidinges of this noble acte was brought to P. Scipio the capitiane, he gretly prayſed his brother, doing to hym as moche honour as he myght. And after ſente hym to Rome, to beare newes to the ſenate of theyr ſpede. with hym alſo he ſent Hanno the capitayn of the Carthaginenſes, & diuers other noble priſoners, that were before by them taken.
            ¶ Aſdruball the ſonne of Gyſgon: and Mago the ſon of Amilcar, deſyrouſe to redreſſe theyr harmes, and to recouer theyr loſſes, gathered together of theyr friendes in Spayne, and of hyred ſouldiours, an huge army, to the numbre of .l. M. fotemen, and .iiii. M. v. C. horſemen: and came to the towne of Silpia, where in the plaine fieldes they pitched theyr campes.
            ¶ P. Scipio, heringe of theyr great armye, aſſembled all his men lykewiſe: and to be more able to rencountre with his ennemies, he ſente Sillanus to Colchas, the kynge and ruler ouer xxviii. cities and townes: of whom he had .iii. M. footemen, and .v. C. horſemen. He h
                  •
               dde in his army, when he came to

Betula .xlv. M. of horſemen and fotemen. Certaine daies after theyr metynge there were ſhyrmiſſhes and iuſtes betwene the horſemen and the lighte fotemen of bothe the armies. At the laſt they bothe deſcended into the fieldes with al theyr powers in good order of battayle. The middell wardes kept the Romaynes on the one ſyde, and the Carthaginenſes and the Affricanes on the other ſyde: the wynges of both the parties were of ſpaniardes and hyred ſouldiours. Thus ſtode they redye to do battayle, tyll it was night, without ſtroke ſtrikinge: and euen ſo they dyd certayne dayes folowynge: So that euer it was bruted in bothe armies, that the myddle wardes ſhulde be ſtill of the Romaynes and Carthaginenſes, where the greateſt ſtrength was, and where that moſt noble and experte men of warre were: betwene whom alſo reſted the cauſe and chiefe grounde of the warre. Scipio beinge aduertiſed, that his ennemies truſted and beleued, that this order ſhulde be kept ſtill in the battayle: againſte the daye, wherin he thought to fight, he chaunged all his order. Fyrſt in the euenyng before, he commaunded all his horſemen, before the dawnynge of the day, to eate ſome meate, and then to be armed, and euery one of them to haue his horſe alſo made redy for the battayle. Whiche his commaundement they diligently accompliſhed. Then Scipio, ſo ſone as the day appered, cauſed al his horſemen, with lyght armour, to inuade the ſtation or campe of the Carthaginenſes: and he with the reſt of his hole hoſte folowed in good arraye, but otherwyſe ordered, then eyther his ennemies or his owne company loked for. For he put his Romaynes in the wynges, and in the middle he put all ſtraungers and hyred ſouldiours. Aſdruball, heringe the greate noyſe of the Romayne horſemen, with the ſodayne rumour and feare of his owne menne, ranne out of his tente. And when he perceyued all the fieldes garnyſhed with his ennemies, he ſent forthe anone his horſemen againſt the Romayn horſemen: and ſone after he hym ſelfe with all his fotemen came forth of his campe kepyng the ſame 
                  •
               rdre that he had doue certayne dayes before, without chaungynge any parte therof. The battayle betwene the horſemen endured longe, but whan the hoſt of fotemen were within half a myle together: Scipio cauſed his horſemen to withdrawe them ſelues, whom he deuided then in two partes, and cauſed to ſtande behynde the two wynges, to be euer redy for theyr

ayde and ſuccour. Nowe was his myddle warde moſt of Spaniardes: whom he commaunded to marche forwardes, not faſt, but a ſofte pace. Then ſente he a meſſanger to Sillanus and Martius, who gouerned the lefte wynge, chargyng them to make ſpeede forwardes on theyr partes, in lyke maner as they ſawe hym do with the ryght winge, whiche he ledde hym ſelfe: ſo that the wynges might be fyghtyng a good ſpace before the myddle wardes ſhulde mete. In this ordre they wente forwardes, ſpreadynge theyr wynges, and makynge a great boſome in the myddell of theyr hoſte. For the ſpanyardes in the middel went a moch ſofter pace then the wynges: wherby the winges were al redy come to ſtrokes, and fought a long ſpace, before that the Affricans and Carthaginenſes (in whom reſted the great ſtrength of theyr ennemies) were come to any ſtroke ſtrikinge. Agayne, to bende to any part of the winges to helpe theyr felowes that foughte, they durſte not, leſte they ſhulde open theyr battayle to theyr ennemies, whiche came directly vpon them. By this meanes the winges wer anone ouercome, and dryuen into the myddell warde: and no meruayle. For the yong and the hyred ſouldiours of Spayne were marched with the ſtronge and olde warriours of the Romaines and the Latines, Agayne, Aſdrubals men were ſo ſodainely taken in the mornynge, that they had no tyme to receyue any ſuſtenaunce before the battayle. Wherfore whan the daye was ſomewhat ſpent, they waxed feynte and feble. And for that intent Scipio purpoſely tracted and prolonged the tyme, before the myddell wardes ſhoulde mete: to the ende the heate of the ſonne towardes the myddell of the daye, with the longe ſtandynge in harneis, and lacke of meate and drynke, ſhulde take from them bothe theyr ſtrength and corage. Thus they beinge wery, and aſſayled bothe before with the middell warde, and alſo on the ſydes with the Romayne wynges, were conſtrained to recule. Whiche they dyd a great whyle, kepynge ſtyll good ordre in theyr withdrawynge: for Aſdruball continually cried to them, and therto exhorted them, ſayinge: If they wolde by lyttell & lyttell withdrawe them, they ſhulde ſone get the mountaines, whiche were at theyr backes: and then they ſhulde be ſure out of the daunger of theyr ennemies. But at the laſt, ſeinge them ſelues ouercome, and ſo many of theyr companye ſlayne on all partes: theyr feare ouercame ſhame. Wherfore with greate

ſlaughter they fledde to theyr campe. The Romaynes purſued them faſte, and had taken theyr campe and tentes, had not a vehement ſtorme of rayne ſodeynly come vppon them, with ſuche violence, that euery man was gladde to gette hym to his owne tent and pauilion.
            ¶ The Carthaginenſes, althoughe the nighte drewe faſte on them, being very ſore woūded and wet with the rayne (wherby they had neceſſary occaſions of ſlepe & reſt) yet were they ſo afraide, that they ceaſſed not, ſtylle to ſtrengthen and to fortifie their campe with dyches and ſtones, whiche they gathered in all partes about them: truſtinge more to the ſtrength thereof, then to theyr armour. Then many of the hyred ſouldiours of the hoſte of the Carthaginenſes lefte Aſdruball, and came to Scipio. Dyuerſe ſtronge townes alſo were delyuered vp to hym: with all the garriſons, whiche were left in them. Wherfore Aſdruball, thinkynge hym ſelfe more ſure by fleinge, then by his abydinge, ſecretly departed from thenſe in the nyghte.
            ¶ Scipio in the mornynge, being aduertiſed of the departing of his ennemies, ſent his horſemenne before: and he hym ſelfe with his army ſodeynly folowed them: The horſemen at length ouertoke them, and made ſo many ſkyrmyſhes with them, that therby they were ſtayed, tyll theyr hole armie of fotemen alſo ouer toke them. Then was there great occuion made of them with ſmall reſiſtence. And Aſdruball with .vii. M. men with hym, was fayne to flee to the next hye mountayne, where they encamped them ſelues, and were ſafe frō any daunger or hurt, that coulde be done them. Sone after he ſlypped from thens, and ſtale to the ſea, whiche was not farre of: where he toke ſhyppynge hym ſelfe, with Mago, and a fewe with hym, and went to the iles beyonde the furtheſt parte of Spayne, called Gades, leauynge the moſte parte of his men behynde hym at theyr owne aduenture, to prouide for theim ſelues. Parte of them went to the Romaynes, parte to ſuch cities as wer then remayninge in the dominion of the Carthaginenſes.
            ¶ Scipio, after the dryuinge away of Aſdruball and his company, wyllyng vtterly to expell all the Carthaginenſes out of Spayne: layde ſiege to Illiturgus: which after longe trauail he wan with force, and cauſed his men to ſlee al that euer they founde on lyue, man woman and childe. And after they ſette the towne on fyre, and threwe downe the walles to the earth,

that the place, whiche hadde ben the chiefe receptacle of theyr ennemies, myghte be clerely defaced, and the memorye therof abolyſſhed for euer. Frome thenſe he wente towarde Caſtulo, with his armie. The capytayne therof, fearynge the crueltie of the Romaynes: yelded the towne to them, with the Carthaginenſes alſo that were therin. Aſcapa alſo a ſtrong towne was won by Martius, and brought in ſubiection, with all other townes cities and fortreſſes that the Carthaginenſes before helde. Thus were they clerelye expelled oute of Spayne, the .xiiii. yere after the warres fyrſte beganne, and the .v. yere after that Scipio was appoynted by the ſenate to be capitayne of the army, and was aſſigned to warre in Spayn as his prouince.

               NOwe let vs retourne to M. Liuius the conſull, that after the great victory had by hym and his felowe Claudius Nero, agaynſte the other olde Aſdruball, in the frontiers of Italy, as is before declared: He ſente Q. Fabius Maximus to Rome, to the ſenatours, aduertifynge them, that he thought the armye, whiche L. Portius the pretor had there, was ſufficient inoughe for the kepynge of that prouince: So that (if they thought it beſte) he and his armye might be well ſpared there. To whom the ſenatours aunſwered, that they wylled him to come him ſelfe to Rome with his army, and that Claudius Nero his felowe ſhuld alſo mete him the ſame tyme at Rome, leauyng his hoſt with good capitains to kepe the countrey ſtyll againſt Anniball.
            ¶ Vpon this decree of the ſenate the conſulles wrote letters eyther to other, and agreed, that lyke as they had with one good wyll and mind gouerned and defended the cuntreye, durynge the tyme of their offyce: euen ſoo nowe they ſhoulde bothe at one tyme come into the citie of Rome, althoughe they came frome diuers partes. Wherefore it was agreed, that who ſo euer of theim came fyrſte to the citie of Preneſte, ſhulde there tary the comynge of his felowe. Accordyng to

the appoyntement, there they mette bothe in one baye: and frome thenſe they ſent meſſangers to the citie, deſyrynge the ſenatours to mete them in the houſe of Bellona the goddes of warre, the third day folowing. There wer they receiued with a great multitude both of ſenators and of citezins with goodly ſalutations and great thankes for theyr politike gouernance of their roumes: by whoſe helpe and dexteritie the cōmon welth was nobly preſerued and aduaunced. Soone after they were brought into the ſenate: there accordinge to the olde cuſtome of conquerours, they declared theyr noble actes, whiche they had achieued for the common welthe of the citie of Rome: and for the ſame deſyred, fyrſt that honour myghte be giuen to the immortall goddes: and then that they mighte with triumphe entre the citie. Whiche theyr requeſt was graunted them. As touchinge the maner of theyr entringe in triumphe, it was appoynted, that they ſhuld not come in ſeuerally but together, as they vainquiſhed theyr ennemies together. They agreed alſo betwene them ſelues, that bicauſe the victorye was had in the prouince of M. Liuius, & alſo bicauſe Liuius army was come to Rome with him, where Nero his hoſt coulde in no wyſe be brought thither: Therfore ſhuld Liuius ride in a charyot, and his ſouldiours in order followe hym. Nero ſhuld ryde by hym on horſebacke without any of his ſouldiours to folowe hym. Claudius was contented to gyue the honour to his felowe: by whiche his gentilnes he wan moche the more honour & praiſe. For euery man ſaid of him, that he on horſebacke in .vi. dais had ridden the length of all Italy, and had fought with Aſdruball in the borders of Fraunce, what time Anniball iudged hym to be in Apulia. So that his onely name was able to kepe Anniball lurkyng in his campe, and his onely comyng was the cauſe of the victory againſt Aſdrubal. Wherfore (ſaid they) ride the one conſull neuer ſo highe in his charyot, yet the other conſul, that rode but on horſebacke, was worthy of the very triumph. ye although Nero dyd go but on his fote: yet was he worthye of glory and fame perpetual. With theſe prayſes they folowed Nero into the capitoly or palaice in Rome. Where they preſented moche money of theyr gayne, and that was put into the treaſory. On the morowe both the conſuls, and alſo the horſemen, prayſed moche L. Veturius, and Q. Cecilius: deſiring that they might, for the next yere folowing, be choſen conſuls.

Which at the next election was done, and bothe they appoynted with .ii. conſuls armies, to kepe warre agaynſt Anniball.
            ¶ After all thynges were putte in good order, they departed from the citie, and wente into the countrey of the Lucanes, and in ſhorte tyme they had brought all that countrey into ſubiection. With Anniball there was lyttell doone. For he offered not hym ſelfe to gyue battayle, he was ſo diſcouraged with the loſſe of his brother, his frendes and his ſouldiours. On the other parte, the conſulles thought it not beſt to prouoke hym to battayle: ſe
                  •
               s they founde in hym noo ſturrynge. So moche they feared and eſtemed the valour of that noble capytayne: to whome this prayſe is gyuen, That noo man coulde iudge in hym, whether he were more to be commended in tyme of proſperitie, or in tyme of aduerſitie. For who woulde not wonder to ſe, that he maynteyned the warre ſo farre frome his countrey by the full ſpace of thyrtene yeres in the lande of his ennemies, hauynge his armye not of his owne citie or countreye, but gathered togyther of many nations, whyche lyued not vnder one maner of lawe, neyther hadde one cuſtome or language, but moche different in apparayle, armour, cuſtomes, ceremonies, ye they hadde all ſeuerall goddis. Yet dydde he ſo gouerne theim all, and knytte theim to gyther all in ſuche amitie, that no man coulde iudge or knowe of any dyſſention betweene theym, or inſurrection agaynſte theyr capytaynes, althoughe dyuerſe tymes he lacked to paye them theyr wages, and alſo vitayles for their ſuſtenaunce: by the lacke whereof, in other warres moche inconuenience hathe enſewed. Agayne, after the deathe of Aſdruball, and his armye, in whome was all his truſt, whan all Italy was taken frome hym, ſaue onely the countrey or corner of the Brutians: Who woulde not wonder to ſee noo rebellyon amongeſt his owne menne. Conſyderynge that vyttayles hadde they not, but only from that lyttell angle of the Brutians, whyche yf it hadde beene wholly tylled and ſowed, hadde not beene able to ſuſteyne ſoo greate an armye. Neuer the leſſe, a greatte parte therof was vntylled, parte for feare of the Romaynes, and theyr friendes, partely for that the mooſte parte of the yonge menne of the countreye were taken to the warres, whyche were before wonte to tylle and man
                  •
               re the grounde for huſbandrye.

Theſe thinges (I ſay) conferred togither, it wyll make al men to muſe, howe he coulde ſo quietly gouerne his greate hooſt, and to prayſe greatly his wyſe conduict therin.
         
         
            ¶ Scipio and Aſdruball arriue both in one daie in Affrica, and be lodged bothe togyther in the palays of kynge Syphax. Cap. lvi.
            
               AFter the departynge of P. Scipio to Tarracon, the Carthaginenſes beinge dryuen out of Spayne, Maſſaniſſa, ſeinge the great falle of his frendes the Carthaginenſes, ſecretely had communication with Sillanus, and was wōne to be a ſure frende to the Romayns. Whervppon to haue his frendes in Affrica the more obedyent and redy to hym in all his neceſſities, he appoynted to ſayle ouer in to his countrey, there to make hym ſelfe as ſtronge as myght be, for the ayde and ſuccour of the Romaynes whan neede requyred. And Sillanus ſoone after retourned to Scipio to Tarracon.
            ¶ Than P. Scipio, wylling to certifie the ſenate of his great victory and happie chaunces, ſente his brother L. Scipio to Rome, as is before reherſed, who ledde with hym many noble men priſoners, whome he hadde before taken in the warres: whervppon he was meruaylouſely honoured and prayſed of all men. Yet he alone, that hadde deſerued all the ſayde honour, eſtemed all his feates done in Spayne, to be nothyng in compariſon of thoſe thynges whyche he had conceyued in his mynde. He looked for the conqueſte of greate Carthage and Affrica, as the ende of his warre, and the conſummation of his honour and glory. Wherfore, to worke in tyme all thinges, that afterwardes ſhoulde ſerue for his pourpoſe, he determyned to wynne vnto hym the hartes of princis, whyche were borderars vnto that countrey. And fyrſte he mynded to attempt kynge Syphax.
            ¶ This Syphax was kyng of a people in Affrica, called Maſeſuli, adioynyng to the Moores, and lying on the other ſide of the ſea Mediterrane, ouer againſt new Carthage in Spain, who at that tyme was a great friende to the Carthaginenſes: To hym he ſent C. Lelius, with a goodly preſent: wherwith

the kynge was verye gladde and well pleaſed. And conſyderynge in his mynde the good fortune, whyche the Romaynes hadde in all partes, and ſeynge the power of his olde friendes the Carthaginenſes to be ſoo greately decayed, that in Italy they hadde nowe lyttell to doo, and in Spayne nothynge: He agreed with Lelius, to become a friende to the Romaynes. But he ſayde, he woulde no further procede to the confirmation of the amitie betweene them, tyll he myghte perſonally ſpeake with Scipio, the chief capitayn of the Romaynes. Whervppon Lelius takynge aſſuraunce of hym, for the ſafe goynge and commynge of his capitayne, retourned to Scipio. And declared vnto hym, howe he had ſpedde, as is before declared. Scipio indgynge his frendſhyppe to be a great helpe and furtheraunce to his purpoſe, touchynge his deſyrous affayres in Affrica, bothe for his greatte ſtrengthe and rycheſſe, and alſo for that his countrey was adioynyng to Carthage, directly ouer agaynſte Spayne, leauynge Lucius Martius at Tarracon, and Sillanus at newe Carthage, with a power ſufficient for the defence of Spayne: he with Lelius in two galeys or rowbarges of fyue oores a piece, paſſed ouer into Affrica.
            ¶ Nowe it happened, that euen the ſame tyme Aſdruball, who of late had ben dryuen out of Spayne, was newely arryued in the ſame hauen, with ſeuen galeys, and caſtyng their ankers, drewe as neere the ſhore as they coulde. Aſdruball, perceyuinge the other two galeys or rowbarges of Scipios, comynge towardes the ſame hauen: knewe full welle, they were the veſſelles of his ennemyes. Wherefore not doubtynge, but that they beynge ſoo fewe in numbre, myght eaſyly be oppreſſed and vanquyſ
                  •
               hed, before they ſhoulde gette the hauen: he commaunded his folkes to wey vp the ankers, and to make theim redy to ſette furthe with all ſpeede. But the other, hauynge good wynde to theyr furtherance, entred the hauen, before the galeys of Aſdruball myght gette out, ſuche ruffelinge noiſe and littell ſhifte was made by his men. Wherefore when the Romaynes had ones gotten the kinges hauen: no man durſte be ſo bolde to meddell with theym. Thus wente the two capyteynes on lande: fyrſte Aſdruball, and then Scipio with Lelius, and bothe wente to the kynges palayes: whoſe comynge dydde vnto Syphax greatte

honour. For it was neuer before ſeene, that the gouernoures of the .ii. moſt noble ſeignories, that were in thoſe dayes in all the world, came euer to his palayce vpon one day, to deſire his amitie and peace. The kynge ryght gentylly receyued theim bothe, and ſens theyr chaunces were to mete both at one time in his howſe: he dydde what he myght, to brynge them both to communication, truſtynge therby to appeaſe all ſtryfe and diſcorde for any mattier that hadde beene betweene theym. But that Scipio refuſed to doo, affyrmynge, that there was no pryuate matter of diſpleaſure betweene hym and Aſdruball, whyche by communication or hearynge of friendes, neded to be determined. Neyther was there any thynge touchynge the common welthe of his countrey, wherin he might trauayle or intreate, oneleſſe it were by ſpeciall auctoritie or commaundement of the wholle ſenate. Than the kynge made great inſtance to Scipio, ſeinge they were bothe his gueſtes at ones, that he wolde be contented to be ſo ordered, that he myghte not haue cauſe to expelle any of theim bothe frome his table. Scipio at the kynges requeſte was not onely contented to ſytte with Aſdruball at oone table, but alſo, for the kynges pleaſure, he laye in the ſame bedde that he dyd. For Scipio was naturally of ſuche dexteritie, and ſo conformable to reaſon, that thereby he not onely wanne the herte of Syphax: but alſoo he broughte his mooſte mortall ennemye Aſdruball in more admyration of hym, after he hadde ſeene his conuerſation, than euer he dydde before, for any acte that euer he dydde. Wherevppon he beganne than to coniecture and to iudge, that Syphax, with all his myghte was become friende to the Romaynes. Suche polycie he deemed Scipio to haue in wynnynge the hertes of men. And than he beganne to dyuiſe, that it was neceſſary for the Carthaginenſes, to conſult among theim ſelues, not how Spayne was loſte, and myghte be recouered: but rather howe they myghte keepe their domynion in Affrica. Specyally he was moued thus to be in doubte, for that he iudged, that ſoo greatte a capytayne of the Romaynes, woulde not leaue the countrey, that he lately hadde conquered, to wander abrode in a ſtraunge domynyon, onely with two galeys, leauynge behynde hym his greatte power, and committyng hym vnto the daungier of an vnknowen kynge: but onely vppon

ſome truſte that he had therby to wynne Affrica.
            ¶ Scipio concludinge a peace and amitie with the kynge, departed from hym, leauynge Aſdruball wrapped in manyfolde troubles. And within foure dayes after, ſuſteynynge many ſtormes on the ſeas, he arriued in ſafegard at newe Carthage.
         
         
            ¶ Maſſaniſſa ſpeaketh ſecretely with Scipio, and entreth in leage with the Romaynes: Mago ſayleth into Italy, to ioyne with Anniball. Cap. lvii.
            IT is before declared, howe Sillanus had ſecrete communication with Maſſaniſſa, and had wonne hym to be friende to the Romaynes: but the concluſyon of this communication was deferred, tyll Maſſaniſſa myghte ſpeake with Scipio perſonallye, for the more ſure and faythfull aſſurance of theyr alliaunce. Whiche cauſed P. Scipio to enterpryſe that longe peynfull iourney, to come nere to the ſea ſide, to mete hym. Of whoſe approchynge Maſſaniſſa, being in the yle called the Gades, was aduertiſed by L. Martius: He fained to Mago, that his horſes were loſt and ſpylt, for that they were ſo longe kepte within the yle, without any exerciſe: and his men alſo were empayred throughe idlenes, not puttynge them ſelues in vre to do any feates of armes. Furthermore he ſaide, their longe lienge in that ilande cauſed derth and ſcarſitie of all thynges. Wherfore he deſired licence of him, that he mighte, with his horſemen paſſe ouer in to Spayne, there to ſpoyle and waſt the countrey nere to the ſea ſyde.
            ¶ By this perſwaſyon he obteyned lycence, and came ouer in to Spayne. At his fyrſte arryuaile, he ſente thre noble men of Numidie to Scipio, wherof he wylled him to reteyne with hym two of them, as pledges: And to ſende againe the third of theim, to acertayne hym of the tyme and place of theyr metynge: by whoſe conducte he myght be broughte to the place appoynted. When the daye came, they met to gether, with a ſmalle numbre in their companye: where Maſſaniſſa, at the fyrſte ſyghte, althoughe before he had a greate admyration of Scipio, throughe the noble fame of his actes: yet vppon the ſyght of hym and his preſence, he had hym in moche more veneration. For beſydes that of nature he was indowed with goodlye and large ſtature: wherein he ſhewed a marueylouſe

magnifycence: yet the ſame was ſet forthe the more by reaſon of his goodly long heare, and his comly apparell, after a manly and warrelyke faſhion. He was alſo of a myddle age, at his full ſtrength, and was become ſo beautyfull after a ſickenes, of whiche he was late recouered: that his luſty youthe ſemed renewed: wherby he was more pleaſaunt to beholde. At theyr firſt metyng, Maſſaniſſa half aſtonied, gaue hym humble thankes for his goodneſſe ſhewed, in ſendynge home his brothers ſonne: whom he before had as priſoner. From which tyme (he ſayde) he ceaſſed not to ſeke occaſion of his friendſhyp and amitie, for the whiche, nowe that he had obteyned it, he gaue thankes to the goddes. Truſtynge that he wold ſo apply himſelfe in his affayres and the Romaynes cauſes, that theyr common welthe was neuer more aduaunced by one man, beinge a ſtraunger vnto them. Which his harty beneuolence and good wyll that he bare to them, he coulde neuer before (althoughe he wolde) haue ſhewed to hym and to them in Spayne, beinge to hym a ſtraunge, and an vnknowen countrey. But in caſe the Romaynes wolde ſende Scipio as theyr capitayne into Affrica, where he was bred and brought vp, he doubted not, there to do them ſuch hie ſeruice, that the honour of Carthage ſhuld no longe while endure.
            ¶ Scipio gladly behelde hym, and alſo heard hym: knowinge ſurely, that he was the chiefe of al the horſemen in the army of his ennemies, and a luſty yonge man, of a nobleherte and courage. Wherfore after they had entreated of theyr buſines, giuynge faythe the one to the other, of faythfull loue and amity, they departed: Scipio to Tarracon, and Maſſaniſſa to the ile of Gades. but bycauſe it myghte appere to Mago, that he had done ſome feate in Spayne: Scipio ſuffered him to ſpoile certayne goodes and groundes on the ſea coſt, and to take the praye with hym.
            ¶ Mago beinge deſperate of any good ſpede to be hadde in Spayne, was in mynde to ſayle into Affrica, when ſodeynlye letters came to hym from Carthage, commaundyng hym with his nauy of ſhyppes, that he had at the Gades, that he ſhulde ſayle ouer into Italy. Where hyringe as moche people as he myghte, of frenchemen, and Liguriens, he ſhoulde with all ſpede ioyn him ſelfe with Annibal. And for that purpoſe great ſummes of money were ſent him from Carthage. Beſydes that

he leuied and exacted as moch money as he coulde of the Gaditanes, compellinge euery man to brynge in his money. Beſydes this he ſpoyled the temples. With all this riches he arryued at the ile of Minorque, where he gathered together .ii. M. yonge men, whom in the beginnynge of ſommer he toke with hym, and fayled ouer into Italy with .xxx. great ſhippes of warre, and many other ſhyppes loden with prouiſyon. He had in his hoſte at that tyme .xii. M. fotemen, and two. M. horſemen. With this numbre he ſodeynlye arriued at Geene, whiche towne he toke with ſmall reſyſtence, beinge vnprouyded of men of warre. From thenſe he ſayled alonge the coſtes of Liguria, nexte to the mountaynes called Alpes, and hering, that a people of that countreye, called Ingawni, helde warre with certayne mountanoys called Epanterii: he landed there, and makynge a leage or amitie with the Iagawnes, he graunted them to inuade the mountanoys with certayne of his people. The reſt he ſent to Carthage, to defende the coſtes of the ſea there. For it was bruted abrode, that Scipio was mynded to lande his nauy in Affrica.
            ¶ He had no longe ſeaſon taryed there, but his armye ſtil encreaſed. For the frenchemen dayly reſorted vnto hym, hering the fame and glory of his name. Of his arriuaile in Liguria about Geene, Sp. Lucretius ſent letters to Rome to the ſenate, aduertiſynge them, that where Aſdruball was about .ii. yeres paſte ſlayne with his armye in the frontiers of Italy, to the great comfort of the citie, that great ioye was but in vaine, and paſſed lyke a ſhadowe, onleſſe they prouyded nowe ſpedye remedy. For a newe armye was come with Mago from Carthage, to begynne a newe warre lyke the other: onelye the capytayne therof was chaunged. Theſe newes moued moch the ſenatours. Wherfore they ſente letters to M. Liuius, then proconſull, commaundynge hym to brynge his hoſt from Hetruria to Arminius. Cn. Seruilius the pretour hadde alſo commaundement, to bringe thyther from Rome two newe legions. Thus laye bothe the hoſtes of Romaynes, and the army of the Carthaginenſes, with theyr friendes, the oone not farre from the other, a longe ſeaſon, without any thynge doinge worthy of memory.
         
         
            
            ¶ Scipio ſayleth into Italy, cometh to Rome, and is treate one of the conſulies, he deſpreth to haue licence, to ſaile into Affrica with an army. Cap. lviii.
            
               SOne after the departyng of Mago from the ile of Gades, the Gaditanes yelded them ſelues to the Romaynes. P. Scipio committing the rule and gouernaunce of his army to L. Lentulus, & L. Manlius, takyng with him .x. ſhippes, with men ſufficient, went him ſelfe to Rome. Againſt whoſe coming the counſaile ſatte without the citie in the houſe of Bellona. There he ſoberly declared to the ſenatours, what thinges he had done in Spayne: Howe often he had foughte with banners diſplayed againſt his ennemies: howe many cyties he had taken from them by ſtrength: what people he had brought into theyr obeyſaunce: he ſhewed alſo that he hadde fought with .iiii. ſundry capitaines noble men, and vanquiſhed them and their armies, whiche before were neuer vanquiſhed: So that nowe there was no Carthaginenſes lefte in Spayne. But for al his noble actes, he was not admitted to entre the citie with triumph, bicauſe he had neuer borne office in the citie. After the counſayle aroſe, he entred the citie, where he preſented and brought into the treſory great plenty of money and riches of his gaynes and prayes. Soone after the tyme came of choſyng of conſuls, at whiche daye P. Cornelius Scipio was choſen conſull, and P. Licinius Craſſus his fellowe for that yere. Great was the reſort that came to behold Scipio where ſo euer he went. The commons had conceiued in their mindes an opinion of hym, that he was the manne, appoynted by the goddes to finiſhe the warres in Italy, as he had before delyuered Spayne from the Carthaginenſes. Whiche warres in Italy ended, they appoynted in theyr owne hertes, and alſo they ſpake it openly, that he ſhulde haue Affrica, appoynted as his prouynce. When the prouynces were allotted, he was appoynted to Sicilia, and L. Craſſus to the Brutians againſt Anniball. The fame amonge the commons ranne ſtyll, that Scipio ſhoulde haue Affrica to his prouynce. And he euer deſyrouſe of great glory, ſayde: that he was not onely choſen Conſull, to meynteyne the warre, but to fynyſſhe and to make an ende therof. Whiche in no wiſe myght be achieued, oneles

he myght paſſe with his army into Affrica. Which his deſyre in caſe the ſenatours woulde not graunte, he wolde referre it to the voyce of the communes.
         
         
            ¶ An oration made by Q. Fabius Maximus, diſſwading Scipio from his deſired iourney into Affrica, and willyng him to mayntein the warres againſt Anniball in Italy. Cap. lix.
            
               OF this purpoſe of Scipio the ſenatours conſulted togyther, and amonge other, they deſyred Q. Fabius Maximus to declare his opinyon. He aunſwered, making an oration in maner and fourme folowynge.
            ¶ I am well aſſured, fathers conſcript, that yf I diſſent and agree not to this haſty paſſage into Affrica, two thynges wyll be iudged and ſpoken of me. One is, a ſlownes or a ſlacke tractynge of my mattier, whiche naturally is gyuen me, and that yongemen calle fearefulnes or ſlouthe. And it greueth me lyttell, thoughe they haue ſuche opinion in me, ſens other mens councelles heretofore haue appered gloryous at the fyrſte face: but at lengthe my counſaile hath euer proued beſte and moſte for the common welthe. The ſeconde thynge is, that I ſhoulde for euyll wyl go aboute to hynder the glory of this valyaunt conſull, that daily groweth and encreaſeth. Frome whyche ſuſpition, yf neyther my faſcion of lyuynge and maners, nor the offyce of Dictatour, whiche I haue borne, nor the roume of a conſull, whiche I haue fyue times enioyed: neyther the greate glorye, that I haue wonne both in the tyme of peace and warre, wyl delyuer and pourge me: lette myne age at the leaſt deliuer me therefro For what indifferent contention can be betwene me and hym that in yeres may not matche my ſonne? When I was dictatour, the mayſter of the horſes laboured ſo to the ſenate, that he was made equall with me in auctoritye and rule: whyche thynge neuer was ſeene before. yet neuer manne herde me, eyther priuyly or openly refuſe theyr ordre therin. For I hadde leauer to gette by my deedes than by my woordes, that he whyche was by other mennes iudgement compared with me, ſhoulde ſhortely after by his owne confeſſyon gyue me the

preferrement. Moche leſſe nowe, whan I haue ſo oft borne theſe honourable offices, dooe I intende to ſtryue with this flouryſſhynge younge manne. I letted Anniball of his vyctory, to the intent he myghte nowe be vanquyſſhed of you that be luſty and ſtronge. Reaſon woulde, Pub. Cornelius, that ye ſhoulde be contented (ſens I dy dde neuer ſette more by myne owne fame & honour, or the fame of the people, than I dyd by the common welth) although I do not now preferre your honour and laudis before the common welth. Neuer the leſſe in caſe there were no warre in Italy, or elles ſuche an ennemy, by whoſe vanquyſhing ſmall honour were to be gotten: than he that would kepe the in Italy (although the commune welthe were therby ſomewhat anaunced) myght ſeeme to go aboute to take thy glory from the. But ſens Anniball is our ennemy, who hath with his hooſte theſe .xiiii. yeeres vexed Italy: ſhouldeſt thou P. Cornelius, thynke the to loſe honour, if by thy proweſſe, beynge conſull, thou canſte expelle and driue hym out of this cuntrey, who hath been the cauſe of ſo many of our mens ſlaughter, and of our ſo great diſtruction? Wherby as Luctatius bare away the honourable title of fynyſhyng the firſte warre with the Carthaginenſes: euen ſoo nowe thou mayſte obteyne the prayſe of fynyſhing this warre. Oneleſſe thou doeſt thynke, that Amilcar than capitayn, was to be preferred before Anniball: or that warre before this: or that victory to be more noble and gloryous, than this ſhall be to the, if it be thy chaunce (being conſull) to ouercome? Thinkeſt thou it more honour, to deliuer Spayne frome our ennemies than to delyuer Italy? Anniball is no ſuche man, but that who ſo euer wyll choſe to warre in an other place, muſte be reckened rather to feare hym, than to diſpyſe hym. Make the redy therfore, and thynke not to fetche a compaſſe aboute the buſſhe, to goo before in to Affrica, to the intente Anniball ſhoulde folowe the: but goo the nexte waye to woorke, and where ſo euer Anniball be, thyther dyrecte thy warre. Nature gyueth, that a manne ſhould fyrſt defend his owne countrey: or he inuade or aſſaile an other lande. Lette there firſte be peace in Italy, before there be warre in Affrica. And lette feare be fyrſte expelled from vs, or it be driuen vpon other. Yf thou canſte by thy gouernaunce do bothe, fyrſte ouercome Anniball here: and then after aſſayle Carthage. Our treaſorye

is not able to finde .ii. greate armyes: one here, and an other in Affrica. And if it were ſufficient to fynde P. Licinius one hoſt in Italy, and P. Scipio an other alſo in Affrica: what yf it ſhuld chance (as god forbyd, yet ſuche happes haue happed and maie dooe agayne) that Anniball dyd ouercome Licinius, and were comynge towardes Rome: Myght we call the frome Affrica, as we dydde call Quintus Fuluius frome Capua to our ſuccours? Ye, and in Affrica alſo the fortune of warre is doubtfull and variable. Lette thyne owne howſe or famylie be to the a warnyng. Were not thy father and thyn vncle ſlayne, with theyr hooſtes, and all within thyrty dayes ſpace? Yet hadde they before amonge ſtraunge nations, both by ſea and by lande, gotten greatte renoume to the cytie of Rome and all theyr poſterytie. The daye woulde fayle me, or I made an ende, yf I ſhoulde reaken vp the names of kynges and capyteynes, whyche raſſhelye haue inuaded the landes of theyr ennemyes, to the vtter vndooynge of theym and theyr armyes. The Athenienſes, leauynge warre at home, ſente a noble yongeman capyteyne, with an huge nauye into Sicilia, where beynge ouerthrowen in oone battaile, they hadde ſuche loſſe, that their common welthe was cleane ſubuerted for euer. This outwarde exaumple is to auncient. Let the ſame A
                  •
               frica, and the loſſe of our owne conſulle M. Attilius, there taken by the Carthaginenſes, and their frendes, be to vs a document. In comparyſon of Affrica, Publius Scipio, the countreyes of Spayne be but a play or a game. The eſtates of theym be nothynge lyke. For at thy paſſynge into Spayne thou dyddeſte ſayle by the coſtes of Italye and Fraunce, and dyddeſt arryue with thy nauye in the citie of oure friendes. Where ſettynge thy men on lande, thou by ſure wayes were conueyed to Tarracon, the friendes alſo of the Romaynes. Frome Tarracon, thou cameſt to the ryuer of Iberus, where thou foundeſte that noble capytayne L. Martius, & many fyers Romain ſouldiours, left of the armies of thy father and thyne vncle. And ſone after newe Carthage was wonne: bicauſe none of the .iii. hoſtes of the Carthagynenſes, came to the ſuccour and defence of the citie and their fellowes. Theſe thynges I cannot ſo greatly praiſe: but touchynge the warres in Affrica, they ſhall be founde farre vnlyke. For there ſhalte thou fynde no hauen open for our army

and nauie, no grounde peaſyble, no citye of oure fryendeſhyppe, no kynge our frende. Alſo no place mete for vs, eyther to abyde vppon, or to goo forewardes on. Wherefore whereſoeuer thou looke, thou ſhalte ſee all full of thyne ennemyes. Wylte thou beleeue Syphax and the Numidians? Lette it ſuffyſe the, that thou dyddeſt ones beleue hym. Folyſſhe hardyneſſe doothe neuer proſpere: Deceyte doothe ſoo order it ſelfe in ſmalle thynges, that faythe may be geuen to it: to the intent in great thynges he may deceiue with gret aduauntage. Thy father and vncle were not oppreſſed by the armour of their ennemies: til they were firſt deceiued by their owne felowes and fals friendes the Celtiberiens. Ye thy ſelfe were neuer in ſo great ieopardy through Mago and Aſdrubal capiteines of thyne ennemies, as thou were in by Indibilis and Mandonius, princis of Spaine: whome thou diddeſt take to be thy very frendes. Thyne owne Romain ſouldiors haue of late rebelled agaynſt the: and wilt thou nowe truſt the Numydians? Bothe Syphax and Maſſaniſſa, touchyng the dominion or rule in Affrica, wil preferre theim ſelues before the Carthaginenſes: yet wyl they gladlier ſuffer the Carthaginē
               ſes to beare rule there, then any ſtranger. Nowe is there contention & debate betwene them: bicauſe they be not fraied with any forein power: but ſo ſone as the Romain army ſhal appere before theim, they wil ſtraight ioyne them ſelfes together. As in a towne where fier is in a houſe, people wyll aſſemble together to the quenchyng thereof, for feare of a common hurt or danger. ye ſhal ſee the Carthaginenſes defend theyr walles of their town and cuntrey, their tēples, their owne houſes, with their wiues and yong thildren, of an other ſort then they defē
               ded Spayne. And what if the Carthaginenſes, makyng peace with the kynges that be theyr neyghbours, truſtynge to the ſtrength of their townes, & perceyuing Italy to be made bare of men of warre by thy coming thither with ſuch a power, wil ſende a newe army from Affrica into Italy, or wyll commande Mago, who is already come to the coſtes of the Liguriens, to ioyne with Anniball with all his power: Then ſhall we be in the ſame caſe, wherein we were when Aſdruball paſſed the mounteynes, and was deſcended into Italy. The more ſtronger and valyant Capytaine that thou arte, the moore oughte we and all Italy to reioyce, and to keepe the ſtyll amonge vs.

Thou canſt not deny thy ſelf, but that where Anniball is, there is the head and ſtrength of all this warre. And thou ſayſt, that thy goinge into Affrica ſhall be to drawe Anniball thyther, ſoo that whether it be here or there, with Ann
                  •
               bal thou muſt chefly haue to do. And then I praye the aunſwere me, Shalt thou be more ſure in Affrica, beinge there alone, or here in Italye, hauinge the other conſull thy felowe and his hoſt ioyned with the? And if thou wilte ſeke the experience therof, let Claudius and Liuius, the late conſulles, be to the an exaumple and a lernynge. Agayne, whether ſhall Anniball be ſtronger in the lyttle angle of the Brutiens, wherunto he is dryuen with his hole hoſte, or when he ſhall come to Carthago, hauynge al his friendes of Affrica about hym? What a deuiſe is this, to choſe rather to fyghte and to trye with thyne ennemie, where thy power ſhall be ſmaller by the halfe, and thine ennemies power doubled: then to fyght in a place, where thou ſhalte haue two armies againſt his one? ye and that one worne and weried with longe and greuous warre. Conſydre thy ſelfe, howe moche this thy counſayle varieth frome the mynde of thy father, he beinge fully appoynted to Spayne, as his prouynce, fearynge the comynge of Anniball into Italy, to the intent to mete hym at his deſcendinge from the mountaynes, lefte his owne prouynce, and came into Italy. But nowe thou, when Annibal is al redy in Italy, intendeſt to leaue Italy: Not for that it is for the common welthe ſo to do, but therby to purchaſe the a noble and glorious name. But O ye noble fathers conſcripte, I do thinke, that P. Corn. Scipio was not made conſull for his owne priuate welthe or pleaſure, but for the common welthe, and the ſafegarde of all vs. Neyther were the armies of men of warre appoynted to hym, to thintent, be lyke a prynce mighte ſayle with them into what part of the world he wyll. But they were aſſigned to him, and to all other his predeceſſours, for the ſafegarde and defence of this citie and of Italy.
            ¶ With this oration of Fabius, beinge a man of great authoritie wiſedome experience and fame, the more part of the auncient ſenatours were perſwaded: and mo men allowed the ſobre counſayle of the olde man, then the fyerſe mynde of Scipio the yongemanne. Wherfore Scipio made vnto hym this aunſwere.
         
         
            
            ¶ The aunſwere of P. Cornelius Scipio, to the oration of Q. Fabius Maximus: And of his ſaylynge into Sicilia with his armye. Cap. lx.
            
               QVintus Fabius in the beginning of his oratiō (fathers conſcript) ſaid, that in the declaration of his opinyon he mighte be ſuſpected to ſpeke of euill wylle and enuy: but it is not I that do accuſe ſo great & ſo noble a man therof: Although I doo not perceyue the ſame ſuſpition as yet to be by him ſufficiētly auoyded, whether the defaulte therof be in the deformitie of his oration, or for lacke of good matter, I knowe not. But this I well perceiue, that to auoyde the crime or ſuſpition of enuy, he hath ſo extolled his owne honour, with the fame of his noble actes, as though it ſhuld not becom him, or ſtand with his honor, to contende with me, being my ſelfe but a childe, vnder the age of his ſonne. Conſiderynge the great offices that he hath borne in the citie, wherby as it ſemeth, his meanynge is, that the deſyre of glory ſhulde be meaſured onely, by the length of the lyfe of man, and not extende to be had in perpetuall memory with our poſteritie. But this I knowe well, that euery noble herte hathe a couetous deſyre to be equiualent in famouſe vertue, not only with the age preſent, but alſo with the people of al ages, both paſt and yet to come. And (onles I wold diſſemble) truly Q. Fabius, my wyll is not only to be equall vnto the in renowme, but alſo to paſſe the in prayſes, yf I may atteyne thervnto. Lette neyther of vs bothe thynke, that none that ſhall come after vs, ſhall be lyke vnto vs. For that were a deſyre of greate hurt and hynderaunce, bothe of our poſteritie, and alſo of the common welth, and generally of all mankynde. Furthermore, Fabius hath remembred the ieoperdies and peryls, that I ſhulde entre into, by my goynge into Affrica, as though he were carefull bothe for me and myne army. I meruaile greatly, from whens this louing care and thought for me is ſo ſodeinly ſpronge. For whan my father and myn vncle wer bothe ſlayne, and bothe theyr armies almoſte diſtroied, ſlayne, and cleane loſte, the Affricanes ouerrounnynge the countrey with .iiii. ſeuerall hooſtes and capytaines: than woulde no man offre hym ſelfe to be a capitayne of the Romaines in Spayne,

but onely I. Atwhychetyme, whan the people of the citie made me gouernor, being thā but .xxiiii. yeres old, there was no man founde, whiche would remembre my tendre age: neyther the power of our ennemies, the daungerouſnes of battayle, nor yet the late death and deſtruction of my frendes in Spayne. Is there nowe in Affrica any greatter armies or better capitaines, than were than in Spayne? Was mine age at that tyme more mete for the warre, thanne it is nowe? or is it greater matter to fight with our enemies of Affrica in Spayn, than it is in Affrica? As it is nowe eaſy to auaunce my ſelfe of iiii. armies of Carthage, by me diſtroied: after ſo many cities taken by force, after ſo many princes and wylde nations ſubdued, and all Spaine won vnto the occean ſea, ſo that none apparence is lefte there of any warre: Likewiſe after my victorious returne from Affrica, it ſhalbe as eaſie to ſet forthe the ouercominge of all thinges, whiche nowe be laide very terryble and dangerdus: only to the intent to kepe me ſtil at home. Fabius demeth, that I ſhal haue no hauens or portes open for me to enter. He alſo remembreth the taking of M. Attilius Regulus in Affrica: as though M. Attilius had his fall at his firſte arriuall into that countreye. Where of trueth he hadde hauens open and entre at his pleaſure, ye by the ſpace of an hole yere he did many noble actes there: Whome the Carthaginenſes were neuer able of their owne power to ſubdue, till the ſeconde yere after his coming, and many of his hoſt ſlaine. They ſent for Xantippus, capitayne of the Lacedemonians, with his power: by whome he was at lengthe ouercome and taken in battayle. This exaumple can nothing feare me. For why ſhoulde I more feare to ſayle into Affrica bycauſe of the taking of M. Attilius, then I was afrayd to ſaile into Spaine after the deathe of bothe the Scipions? And I truſte Xantippus the Lacedemonien was not born to be more fortunate to the Carthaginenſes, then I ſhalbe to the Romayns and to mine owne countrey. The tale muſte be recited of the Athenienſes, howe fondely leauynge warre at home, they entred into Affrica: But why doeſt thou not reherſe the hiſtorie of Agathocles, king of the Syracuſanes? Who when his countrey of Sicilia had ben long troubled with warre by the Carthaginenſes, he with his hoſt failed ouer into Affrica: whereby he delyuered his owne countrey from warre, and tourned

all to the defence of him & his power in Affrica. But to ſhewe the commoditie of inuadinge of a foreyne countreye, thereby to auoyde ieopardyes at home: what better example can any man reherſe, then of this Anniball? There is greate difference betwene the ſyght of bournynge and ſpoylyng of other mennes countreyes: and the ſyght of the deſtruction of thine owne cities and regyons. There is more courage in a manne, that offrethe battayle, then in him that defendethe. Lyttell thoughte Anniball at his fyrſt comyng to Italye, that ſo many cities and people wolde haue yelded them vnto him as did after the battail at Cannas: moch leſſe cauſe ſhal the Carthaginenſes haue of truſte or hoope in Affrica, conſideringe their vntruthes to their neyghbours, & their owne proud and cruel dominion ouer their ſubiectes. We beynge forſaken of our neyghbours, haue ſtil endured al dangers by our owne power and ſtrength. The Carthaginenſes haue no great ſtrength of their owne. Their power is in hyred ſouldiours of Affrica and Numidia, whoſe lyghte wyttes cauſe lyghte faythe, when they ſe cauſe of chaunge. Yf ye ſuffer me to depart hence, with ſpede, ye ſhall ſhortely heare of my paſſage thither, and of the warre wherewith I ſhal vexe theim. And then ſhal ye ſee Anniball make ſpede to departe from this countreye: and ye ſhall heare ſhortely of the ſyege of Carthage: not doubtynge, but that ye ſhal receiue gladder tydynges from Affrica, then euer ye had fro me out of Spayne. Theſe hopes I do conceyue. Fyrſte of the fortune of this citie and people of Rome. Secondely, throughe the truſte of the goddes, whiche are witneſſes of the truſe broken by theim. Thyrdely, that occaſyon offered by Syphax and Maſſaniſſa, to whoſe promyſe and faythe I wyll ſoo truſte, that I wyll alſo be well ware of theyr falſehode and dyſceipte. And it is the parte of a manne and a good capyteyne, not to ſhrynke and forſake fortune, when it is offered. I knowe well Quintus Fabius, that I ſhall find Anniball my matche: but I wyll rather drawe hym, then he ſhall retire me. I wyll cauſe him to fyght with me in his owne cuntrey. And Carthage ſhall rather be a pray and a rewarde of our victory: then the countrey and caſtelles of the Brutians, whyche are almoſt dyſtroyed already. Nowe when ye ſay, Italye ſhalbe in daungier by my departynge hens, I praye you, may not P. Licinius the conſull (whyles I am ſay lynge thyther)

ſtaye with his hoſte Anniball, that is nowe of ſmall power: aſwell as thou Q. Fabius, dyddeſt ſlaye him, when he as a conquerour ouerranne all Italy? Yt ſhall be a greate honour to the Romayns, and an eternal ſame among kinges and ſtrange nations, that we haue the courage not only to defend Italy, but alſo to enter & make warre in Affrica. What ſhame ſhal it be when it ſhall be ſayde, that Anniball enterpriſed an act, that no Romayne capiteyn euer durſte enterpriſe? When contention was betwene vs and the Carthaginenſes for Sicilia, our nauies and armies oftentimes inuaded Affrica: Howe when contention is for Italy betwene vs, Affrica remaineth quiet and in peace. But nowe let Italy take reſt, & be in peace, whiche of long tyme hath ben vexed, and let Affrica an other ſeaſon ſuffer bournynge ſpoylynge and waſtyng. And let the puiſſaunt Romayne army approche the walles of Carthage: rather then we ſhould with bulwarkes and fortifycations defende our ennemies from our owne walles. Let Affrica be from henſeforthe the place of warre. Let feare, flieng, ſleing, waſtynge of fyeldes and other dyſtructions, belongynge to warre, be nowe tourned thyther, whiche by the ſpace of .xiiii. yeres hath inuaded our countrey.
            ¶ After this aunſwere of Scipio, greate ſtryfe and altercacion was in the ſenate houſe. At the laſte it was decreed, that Sicipo, with thyrty ſhyppes ſhulde go into Sicilia, and from thence at his pleaſure, yf he thoughte it moſt conueniente for the common welthe, to ſayle ouer into Affrica: the other cō
               ſul to kepe warre in the countrey of the Brutians againſt Anniball. Beſydes theſe ſhyppes, and the Romayne legyons, whiche were appoynted to Scipio, many cities and cuntreys adioyning to Rome, willingly ayded him with ſhyppes, with vii. thouſande ſouldiours, and all thinges neceſſarye, of their owne coſtes and charges. With whiche noumbre he arriued in Sicilia, and there deuyded theim into companyes, appointynge to euery company an hundred men. Amonge al whiche nomber, he choſe oute thre hunderd of the mooſt valyant and actife yonge men, that were withoute armour: whom he kept euer aboute hym. But they knewe not to what pourpoſe he mente it. And on a daie he choſe and named .iii. C of the moſt noble and rycheſt yonge gentylmen of all Sicilia, whome he ſayde, ſhould ſayle with him into Affrica: aſſygninge theym a

day, at whiche they ſhuld appere before him with theyr horſe and armour. This commaundement troubled theim ſore, and to be ſo farre frō home with the labours by land and by ſea, ſemed very painful, not onely to theim, but alſo to their frendes and kinſefolkes. At the daye appointed for their retorne, they came all before him, bringing with theim horſes harneis and althinges neceſſary. Then ſaid Scipio: It is ſhewed me, that certaine of you, men of armes of Sicilia, grudge ſore to go inthis iourneye with me: Wherefore if there be anye of you here, of that mynd, I pray you ſpeake nowe, and I wil gladly heare you. For I had moche leauer, that ye vttered it nowe betymes: then that ye ſhuld agaynſt your hertes go forth, and become vnprofitable ſouldiors to me and to the cōmon welth. Wherevnto one of the .iii. C. anſwered: Truely ſyr, yf it were in my choyſe and election, what I ſhulde do, I woulde not go forthe in the warres. Well, ſayde Scipio: Sence ye haue playnely declared your mynde without diſſimulation, I wyll appoynte one in your place, to whome ye ſhall delyuer youre horſe, harneyes, and other neceſſarye inſtrumentes of warre, whome ye ſhall take home with you to youre howſe, and there teache inſtruct and exercyſe hym in feates of warre, tyll I ſende for hym agayne. Of this bargaine the yong gentylman was verie ioyefull, and delyuerynge him all his appareyll for the warre, he toke him home with him. When the reſte of the three hundred men of armes of Sicilia, perceiued their companion by this meane diſmyſſed from the warre, with the good loue and fauour of the Capytayne: euery one of theym alſo beganne to make his excuſe, and deſyred to haue Scipio to appoynte other in theyre roumes. Whyche he gladdelye dydde, and by this meane he horſed, harneyſed, and inſtructed the three hundred wyllynge Romaynes, that were vnarmed, with the horſes and harneys of the knyghtes of Sicilia, withoute anye charge of the ſtocke of the cytie of Rome: Whyche proued after valiaunte menne of armes, and dydde manye noble actes for the aduauncemente of the common welth. Than Scipio ſerched out ſuche ſouldiours as warred vnder Marcellus the conſull, at the wynnyng of Syracuſa, whom he choſe chiefly: for that he iudged theim to be expert in aſſaultyng and ſcalyng of townes and caſtelles. For euen than he imagined the wynnyng of great Carthage. Sone

after he ſette menne a worke to make ſhyppes with ſpeede, and to amende and to repayre his olde ſhyppes. Which done he ſent C. Lelius, with a good numbre of men into Affrica, to ſpoyle robbe and waſt the ſea coſtes: where he landed in the nyghte. And in the dawnynge of the daye, ſettynge his men in good order, he ſpoyled the fieldes, diſtroyed and ſlewe manye of the Affricans: whiche loked lyttell for any ſuche ſodeyn inuaſion, they had ſo longe continued in pleaſure and eaſe. The fame of the deſtruction came anone to Carthage: the meſſangers noyſed abrode, that Scipio was arriued. For they hadde herde before, that he was alredy come into Sicilia: and they were ſo ſodeinly taken, that for feare they coulde tell the certayntie of nothynge, neyther of the numbre of the Romaynes, nor of theyr ſhyppes: But feare cauſed theim to make moche more therof then it was in dede. The citezens of Carthage were then in a meruaylous feare and penſifeneſſe, beholdynge the ſodeyne chaunge of fortune, that of late had ſo aduaunced them, that theyr army lay before the gates of Rome: and their capytaines had almoſt ſubdued al Italy: Nowe contrary wiſe, they loked for none other, but the ſpoyling of theyr countrey, and the beſieginge of Carthage by the Romaynes. When they conſidered their helpe, they founde theyr citezens, and menne of theyr owne countrey about them, weake and nothyng mete for the warre. All theyr ſtrength was in hyred ſouldiours frō other partes of Affrica: and they were wauerynge people, vntrewe and vnſtedfaſt. They alſo rekened Syphax to be turned from them by the ſecrete cōmunication, that Scipio had with hym: and Maſſaniſſa was apparently become theyr ennemye. Of Mago they had no tidinges of his remouing from Gene, and goinge into Italy to ioyne his hoſte with Annibals hoſte: and the fame, and alſo the ſtrengthe of Anniball was waxed faynte.
            ¶ When they had all hole conſydered theyr wofull ſtate and condition: then began the ſenatours to counſayle and prouide for helpe in theyr preſent neceſſitie. They muſtered theyr men, both in the citie & without. They hyred many ſouldiours Affricans. They vytayled theyr citie: they amended theyr ſhippes, they prouided harneſſe and all other thynges nedefull.
            ¶ When they were thus buſy, true tidinges came, that it was not the capitayne Scipio, that was arryued: it was Lelius,

that with certayne ſhyppes and menne was come to robbe and ſpoyle the countrey onely. And that the great reſt of the army was yet in Sicilia. With theſe newes they were ſomewhat comforted: and then they deuyſed to ſende embaſſadours to Syphax, and to other princes aboute theim, for a ſure aliance and frendſhyp. They ſent alſo to Phillip kyng of Macedonia, promyſynge hym great ſummes of money, to inuade eyther Italy or Sicilia with a great hoſt. Into Italy alſo were meſſangers ſent, to cauſe the capitayns Annibal & Mago to ſtay Scipio in Italy. To Mago was ſente .xxv. longe ſhyppes .vi. M. fotemen .viii. C. horſemen, and .vii. elephantes, with greate plenty of money, to hyre mo men in thoſe parties, willyng him with all his ſtrengthe to remoue towardes the citie of Rome, and ioyne his hoſt with Annibals. This preparation made the Carthaginenſes.
            ¶ When the ſhippes of Carthage were arriued at Gene, they founde there Mago with his army and nauy of ſhyppes: who knowyng the mynde of the Carthaginenſes, called before him a great numbre of frenchemen and Liguriens, vnto whome he ſhewed, that he was ſent into thoſe parties to purchaſe theim lybertie, and delyuer them from bondage, wherin they hadde longe ben holden. He declared alſo to them, how M. Liuius, and Sp. Lucretius laye with theyr two Romayne armies not farre from them. The one in Hetruria, the other in Fraunce. Whoſe powers to reſyſt, he neded to haue a great aſſemble of people. Then the frenchemen aunſwered, that theyr hertes & myndes were holly to ſerue hym therin. But they ſayd, there was an hoſt of Romaynes all redy in theyr countrey: whiche if they dyd perceyue, that Mago were ayded by theym, they wolde incontinent waſt and deſtroy theyr countrey. Wherfore they deſyred, that the Liguriens might helpe hym: who were nothynge ſo nere daunger, and they wolde priuely helpe hym with vittayles and all thynges neceſſarye, to the beſte of theyr power. Wherunto the Liguriens agreed, and deſyred two monthes ſpace, to aſſemble and take muſters of theyr beſte ſoudiours.
            ¶ Marcus Liuius, herynge that Mago gathered to gether ſo great a numbre of people: he remoued with his hoſte in to Fraunce, and ioyned hym ſelfe to Sp. Lucretius, lyinge euer in awayte to mete with Mago, ſo ſone as he remouynge from

the Liguriens wolde offer to entre into Italye, and take his iourney towardes Rome. But in caſe Mago wolde reſt in the angle of the mounteynes without further procedynge: then they lyke wyſe wold abyde about Arminius, euer redy for the defence of Italy.
         
         
            ¶ The complaynt of the Lortenſes to the ſenatours of the cruell gouernaunce of D. Pleminius. Cap. lxi.
            
               MAſſaniſſa hearynge of the arriuaile of a Romayne army in Affrica, with a ſmall numbre of horſemen cam to Lelius, to whom he complayned moche of the ſlowenes of Scipio, that he hadde not all that tyme ben in Affrica with his great power: conſyderinge the lowe ebbe that the Carthaginenſes were broughte vnto, and alſo ſeynge that Syphax was now buſyed with warre with the prynces adioynynge vnto hym. Whom (he ſayde) he knew ſuerly, after that he had brought his owne purpoſe to good effecte, and had leiſer to ſettle all his owne buſynes, that then he wolde obſerue no promiſe or bonde, that he had before made to the Romains. So lyttle good faythe he knewe to be in hym. Wherfore he deſyred Lelius, to moue and ſtyrre Scipio, to make haſt thyther, and he wolde not fayle (although he were dryuen out of his owne realme) to mete with hym ſoone after his landinge, with a good numbre bothe of horſemen and of fotemen.
            ¶ On the morowe after Lelius departed, with his ſhippes loded with theyr pray & landed in Sicilia: where he found Scipio, to whom he declared the mynde and meſſage of Maſſaniſſa. Wherupon he had ſhortly ſet forwardes into Affrica, had he not hearde comforte of the wynnynge of Locres, a citie in the vttermoſt parte of Italy, that then was holden by the Carthaginenſes. Whiche citie in ſhorte tyme he obteyned, partly by treaſon of certayne carpenters, that wrought in the caſtell, partly by the fauour of the citezens therof. Who beinge greuouſly opreſſed by Amylcar the capitayne, and other Carthaginenſes of the garriſon, that ceaſſed not to vſe all kyndes of oppreſſion ouer them: at the laſt conſented to receyue the Romaynes into the towne. Whiche brought to paſſe, Scipio returned to Sicilia, leauynge behynde hym Q. Pleminius capitayne

of the towne, with a garryſon ſufficient for the kepinge of the ſame. After whoſe departynge, Pleminius with his ſouldyours, farre paſſed Amylcar and the Carthaginenſes in pride auaryce and all other vyces. So that it ſeemed, they ſtroue not, who ſhuld ouercome other in feates of armes: but who ſhuld excede other in vice. They ſpared nother mens wiues maidens nor doughters: they exercyſed cruell rapine of mens goodes, and ſpoilyng of temples. Wherof the citizens beynge wery, ſent meſſage of complaint to Scipio the conſul. whervpon he eftſones came to Locrus, where he had al their matters debated, and at length punyſhed certayne of theim by empryſonmente: and after departed, leauynge ſtyll Q. Pleminius capitayne there, with no leſſe auctority then he had be fore. But after he departed, Pleminius wyllinge to execute his malice ouer his ennemies, put certayne of theym to cruell deathe: whiche before had complayned of him to the conſull. His ſouldiours alſo were afterwarde more cruell and vnrulye then they were before. Therfore they ſent legates to Rome, with greuous complaynte to the ſenate, of the manyfolde iniuries, hurtes, and cruell paynes, that they ſuffered: moche more by the Romaynes, then euer they hadde by the Carthaginenſes. Whoſe complaynte beynge well and delyberately herd in the ſenate, Quintus Fabius, replete with olde malyce agaynſt Scipio, to ſet forthe his neglygence, inquired of the legates, whether they had neuer before that time ſhewed their cauſe to the conſul Scipio. They aunſwered, that at their firſt complaynt, he herd the matter, and then putting the tribunes in pryſon, he let Pleminius go at libertie, and put him again in auctority: although he was worthy more puniſhement then the other. But at their ſecond complaynt made to him by their legates, he was ſo buſied aboute the ſetting forewardes of his ſhippes & men into Affrica, that he could not attend to here or examine their matter. Then was there gret reproch ſpoken of Scipio, by many of the princes of the ſenate, ſpecially Q. Fabius alleged, that he was born to corrupt and diſtroy al warlike policy and lernyng, by his ouermoche ſufferāce and giuing of libertie. Some would haue had Pleminius brought to Rome bound, and Scipio called frō his prouince. At the laſte the ſentence of Q. Metellus toke place, whiche was, that it was good, to ſend for Pleminius, according to the

mynde of Fabius. But as touching Scipio, whom the whole citie fyrſte had choſen in his youth to be a capitaine in Spayn, and he according to theyr expectation had delyuered the hole countrey out of the handes of their ennemies: whervpon they alſo of late had choſen hym conſull, to ſubdue Affrica, and to deliuer Italy of Anniball: He thought it not meete for ſuche a noble man to be ſodainly condemned, his cauſe not being duly herd and debated, or to haue him called frome his iourney, without a greatter cauſe than this was. Conſideringe that the Locrenſes could lay no defaut to Scipio, but only ouermuch ſufferance of Pleminius. Wherfore he thought it beſt, that M. Pomponius, with .ii. tribunes, ſhuld be ſent to Locrus, & frō thens to Sicilia, to examyne & trie, whether the wronges done to the Locrēſes, wer done by the cōmandement or aſſent of P. Scipio or not. And in caſe he were conſentyng therto: then that they ſhuld cōmand him to returne to Rome: & other legates to occupy his place, or els that he ſhoulde continue in his purpoſe and iourney into Affrica, as he had appoynted.
            ¶ According to this ſentence Pomponius, with .ii. tribunes & other legates, came to Locrus, makyng proclamation, that yf any man wold accuſe Pleminius, Scipio, or any other mā, that they ſhulde come before theim, and they ſhuld be well herde. The Locrenſes gyuyng great thankes to the Romaines, for the goodnes therin to them ſhewed, anſwered, that they wold accuſe Pleminius, as chief doer of all the miſchief, and certain other with him. But as touching Scipio, they had nothynge to charge hym withal: but that he eyther gaue ouermoch credēce to Pleminius, or to litell faith to their wordes. But they ſayd, they knewe wery well, that the wronges to theim done, were neither by the wyll nor commaundement of Scipio: but they thought hym to be of the nature of many men, which are ſory, that any wronge or offence ſhulde be committed, and yet whan the iniuries be done, they haue not the hertes or willes to reuenge or puniſhe the offenders of the ſame.
            ¶ With this aunſwere M. Pomponius, and the other, were moch eaſed of any further inquirie of Scipios matter. Wher fore they toke Pleminius, and .xxx. other of his complices, that were founde gyltie of dyuers greatte offences, and ſente them bound to Rome: where Pleminius dyed in priſon. Sone after the other wer put to condigne execution. Then thought

they to go to Scipio, to ſee, whether the ſclaunder ſpoken of his ſlouthe in gouernaunce, or of the myſorder of his hooſte, were true or not: that they myght therof make true reporte, whan they were returned to Rome.
            ¶ Scipio hearyng of their coming, cauſed all his army to repayre to Syracuſa, where he than lay: and alſo cauſed his nauy of ſhyppes, to be ſette furthe and ordered in all poyntes, as though he ſhulde the ſame day haue fought with the Carthaginenſes, bothe by water and by lande. Whan Pomponius, and the other embaſſadours were come, he gentilly and louingly receiued them. he ſhewed them his army on the land in array redy to fight: his nauy alſo on the ſea, he ſhewed them not onely redy to battaile, but makyng a ſhew of a fight in the hauen. Than ledde he them to his garners of corne: and into his armory and ſtore houſes of ordinance and artillary, and all inſtrumentes of warre. Who ſeing al his prouiſion and order, were ſtriken with a great admiration of hym and his conduict: iudgyng that through his gouernance and his army, the Carthaginenſes ſhoulde be ouercome: or elles it were neuer poſſyble for theim to be ſubdewed. Wherfore deſyrynge the goddis to proſpere welle his iourneye, they departed frome hym, takynge theyr waye to Rome with greatte ioye, as though they were goinge to brynge tydynges to Rome of victory, rather than to report the meruaylouſe preparation towarde battayle, whiche they hadde ſeene in Sicilia. Whanne they came into the ſenate howſe, they extolled the fame and actes of Scipio after ſuche ſorte, that they ſent hym worde incontinent, to departe towardes Carthage, takynge with him whom he wolde, leauynge behynd hym for the defence of Sicilia certaine at his pleaſure.
         
         
            ¶ King Syphax marieth the daughter of Aſdruball, he ſendeth letters to Scipio, willing him to abſtein from any warre in Affrica, with the aunſwere and dyſſimulation of Scipio vnto the ſame. Scipio arryueth in Affrica with his hooſt, to whom cometh Maſſaniſſa. Ca. lxii.
            VVhyles the Romaynes made this great ordynance for the warre: the Carthaginenſes, fearing greatly the coming of Scipio, prepared as moche as they coulde for

theyr defence and ſtrengthe. Wherfore to plucke Syphax from the amitie of the Romaynes, Aſdrubal, the ſonne of Giſgon made haſt to fyniſhe a maryage betwene Syphax and his daughter, that was a very fayre mayden. The kynge being inflamed with loue, made haſt alſo to be maried. Then Aſdrubal, beſides his particular aliance, made a newe general bonde of amitie betwene hym and the Carthaginenſes, with greate ſolempnitie and othes takynge: promiſynge faythfully, that the friendes and ennemies of the one, ſhulde alſo be the friendes or ennemies to the other. Neuer the leſſe Aſdruball remembringe the promyſe of amytie, that the kynge had ones made with Scipio, when he was lodged with him in his palais: knowynge the mutabilitie and vnſtedfaſtnes of thoſe barbarous nations, and fearynge leſte if that Scipio were ones arryued in Affrica, that the bande of mariage wolde be but lyttel worthe: Therfore whyles the loue was feruent betwene the kyng and his daughter, he by his greate deſyre, and his daughter alſo with her fayre entreatynge, cauſed the kynge to ſende his embaſſadours to Scipio into Sicilia, with letters, gyuynge hym warnynge, that he ſhulde not vpon the truſte of any promiſe to hym before made by the kynge, ſayle ouer into Affrica: aduertiſynge hym, that he had maryed the daughter of one Aſdruball of Carthage, whom Scipio mette in his palaice, when he arriued in Affrica. Furthermore he ſayde, he was in a greate leage and amitie with the people of Carthage. Wherfore he deſyred hym and the Romaynes, if they wolde warre with the Carthaginenſes, that they do it farre from Carthage, as they haue done heretofore, that he ſhulde not nede to be preſent at theyr battailes. For in caſe Scipio wold not forbeare Affrica, but lay ſiege to Carthage, he coulde no leſſe do, but fighte for the defence of his countrey of Affrica, in which he was gotten borne and brought vp: and for the defence of the countrey of his wyfe, for her father and family.
            ¶ With theſe letters came the meſſangers to the citie of Syracuſa to Scipio, who parceiued by the contentes of the ſame, that he ſhuld haue great lacke of the kynges helpe, in his buſines of Affrica: yet he ſet forth a countenaunce, kepynge ſecrete the cauſe of theyr coming, tyll he had ſent them home agayne to the kynge with letters: wherin he moued him, neuer to breake the promiſe that he ones made him, nor ſwarue from

the faith and amitie made with the Romains, wherof the goddes were witneſſes. When the meſſangers wer departed with his letters, Scipio fearing, leſt his ſoudiours wold muſe moch and deuiſe alſo of the cauſe of the comynge of the ſayd meſſangers, to hyde the ſayd cauſe from them, and to put them in courage, he diſſembled the matter, and callinge his men to gether ſayde to them.
            ¶ Sirs nowe is the ful tyme for vs to depart henſe into Affrica, without further tarieng. For the kinges our friendes haue ſent vnto vs, inſtantly deſiring vs, to make ſpede. Fyrſt Maſſaniſſa came to Lelius, complaining greatly of our tractynge of tyme. And nowe Syphax hath alſo ſent vnto vs, marueylynge why we tary ſo longe. Deſiringe that we wyll eyther ſhortlye come ouer to him, or els in caſe we be otherwiſe minded, to certifie hym by writing: that therupon he maye prouyde for hymſelfe and his countrey. Wherfore ſens althinges is now redy, and the matter requireth haſt, I intende to leade mine army & nauy to the partes of Lilibeus: & as ſoone as the wether, ſerueth, to depart with the fauour of the gods towardes Affrica.
            ¶ After theſe wordes to them ſpoken, he ordered al thynges for his departynge, and ſoone after came to the ſayde porte, with all his hoſt. All his ſhyppes alſo met him there. The nomber whereof was ſo greatte, that the hauen ſuffyſed not to conteine theym, nor the citie coulde not receyue the men. Of the certainte of the nombre wrytars do not agre. Wherefore I wyll let it paſſe. But it ſemeth, the nomber of the men was greatte, that achyeued ſo greatte an enterpryſe, and for whom ſo gret prouiſiō was made. For there were .iiii. C. ſhippes charged with men vitailes ordinances and other neceſſary cariage, beſides .xx. great and long ſhippes: wherof Scipio him ſelfe, and L Scipio his brother, toke the gouernance. and other .xx. like ſhippes vnder the rule of C. Lelius his admyrall of the ſea. Whiche .xl. great ſhippes thus deuided, ſailed euer on both ſydes of the other .iiii. C. as wafters, for the defence of theyr vitayles and cariage. In euery ſhyppe alſo he cauſed to be vittailes and freſhe water for .xlv. dayes: wherof the meate that wolde ſerue for .xv. dayes, was redye ſodden: the other was rawe. Then gaue he commaundement to al his ſouldiours, to kepe peace and ſylence in theyr ſhyps, for troublynge the ſhipmen: and that they ſhulde be redy to do al that

the ſayd ſhypmen deſyred them to do, if nede requyred. With this great numbre of ſhippes and of mē, they departed the day folowyng: Euery one of the .xl. long ſhyppes beinge appointed to haue in the nyght ſeaſon one lyght, euery one of the .iiii. C. laden ſhyppes. u. lyghtes, and the capitaynes chiefe ſhips for a ſpeciall marke or knowlege, had thre fayre lightes. In the mornynge at the ſoundinge of a trumpet the veſſelles ſet forth in good order. And Scipio hym ſelfe at his departynge made his praier openly in the audience of many peple on this maner.
            ¶Oye goddes and goddeſſes, whiche inhabite rule and gouerne both ſea and lande, I humbly beſeche you, that ye graūt all thynges that I haue done, do, or ſhall do, may turne to the honour and welthe of me and the citizens of Rome, and that ye wyll be aydynge and aſſiſtinge to me in my procedinges: So that our ennemies, beinge ouer come, we maye ſafe and ſounde returne home to our houſes, laden with the pray gotten by the ſpoyle of our ennemies. Graunt ye alſo, that I may haue power, ſo to do vnto the people and citie of Carthage, as they haue intended to do to the citie of Rome.
            ¶After theſe wordes, doing ſacrifice (after the cuſtome that they vſed) he departed. The wynde was good, and in ſhorte ſpace toke them from the fyght of the lande, and within foure dayes, they were brought vpon the coſt of Affrica. Then Scipio ſeinge a great mounteyne or rocke, lienge out vpon the ſea, inquired of the mayſter of his ſhyppe, what was the name of that mountain. He anſwered, it is named the mount of Beaute. Then ſayde Scipio, I lyke the name and the lucke therof very well: in the nexte hauen therto ſet vs on lande. When the armye was landed, they get them to the nexte hylles, whervpon they pitched theyr tentes, and encamped them ſelues. Then were the inhabitantes of the ſea coſtes, and all the coū
               trey there about, in great feare and trouble, perceyuynge the arriuaile of ſo great a nauy, euery man fled from thoſe parties, takynge with them theyr wynes theyr chyldren and ſubſtance: driuinge before them their cattell to the nexte ſtrong townes, to the great feare of all the countrey, where the newes therof was brought. Specially in Carthage ſuch feare ſorowe and trouble inuaded the people, as though theyr citie had ben all redy taken by theyr ennemies. They were then vnprouyded bothe of men of warre, and alſo of a good capitayne to be their

gouernour. The beſt capitayne that they then had, was Aſdrubal the ſonne of Byſgon, whom Scipio at diuers battelles in Spayne, had before put to flyghte, and at the laſt droue him cleane oute of Spayne, with all his helpers: ſoo that they eſtemed the capitaynes to be as farre vnlyke, as the armye of Carthage was vnlyke to the Romayne hoſte. In this greate feare the gates of the citie were ſhutte, the walles kepte with watche and warde, as thoughe theyr ennemies had ben already come before the walles of the towne. Fyue hundred horſemen were alſo ſente forthe to eſpye the conduite of the Romaynes, who by chaunce mette with manye Romayne horſemen, that were ſent out to robbe and ſpoyle the fieldes adioynynge, and were by them put to flyghte, to the greate loſſe of many of the Carthaginenſes.
            ¶Sone after the arriuaile of the Romaynes, came Maſſaniſſa to Scipio, bryngynge with hym .ii. C. good men well horſed. His power was then not greate, for he had ben driuen and chaſed out of his owne realme, and was baniſhed by ſtrengthe out of his owne countrey. Whoſe comynge was verye ioyfull and comfortable to the Romaynes. The Carthaginenſes after the loſſe of theyr horſemen, aſſembled againe a newe winge of horſmen, wherof they made gouernor Hanno, the ſon of Amilcar. Then ſent they letters and legates to Aſdruball, to come to the ſuccour of the citie, that was at pointe to be beſyeged. They ſent alſo to kyng Syphax, deſyring him to come to the ſocour & defence both of Carthage & alſo of all Affrica. Then lay the Romaines nere vnto the citie of Vtica. Hanno hauyng with him .iiii. M. horſemen, came to the towne of Salera, xv. miles from the Romain campe. When Scipio had knowlege therof, he ſent Maſſaniſſa before, with certayn horſemen with hym to ſhirmiſhe with them at the gates. Commaunding him, that ſo ſone as the multitude of his ennemies were ones come forth, and that he coulde no longer endure theyr ſtrength, that then he ſhuld ſoftly withdrawe him ſelfe towardes the hylles, where he ſhuld fynde hym with his hoſt, redy to ſuccour him. With this inſtructiō Maſſaniſſa departed & rode to the gates of the citie, ſkirmiſhing with ſuch as were at the ſaid gates. ma ny came forth to the battayl, without good order, & then Maſſaniſſa faining him ſelfe to be afraide, ſomewhat reculed: ſometime he turned again and fought, with them that folowed him.

Thus he played at baſe with them, tyll the whole multitude of horſemenne were come furthe of the yates. Than ſobrely he withdrewe him ſelfe tyll he came to the hylles: to which hilles the Romayne horſemen were than couertely come. Than Maſſaniſſa fierſely retourned and aſſayled his ennemies, and the Romaines beinge freſſhe them ſelues, and hauyng freſſhe horſes, compaſſed and aſſailed them that were before almoſte weery with chaſing Maſſaniſſa: ſo that at the fyrſt brunt Hanno him ſelfe, and 
                  •
               . M. horſemen with hym were ſlayne. The reſt fledde, wherof the Romaynes in the chaſe ſlewe and toke other .ii. M. amonge whom wer many noble men of the citie of Carthage. The pray after the victory was greatte. The towne was taken, and the capytains with other men of armes were welle rewarded by Scipio. But aboue other he gaue Maſſaniſſa great gyftes, and leauynge a ſufficient garriſon in the towne, he with his hoſte remoued thenſe: ſendynge moche of the pray, whiche he had taken, bothe men, beaſtes, and other rycheſſe, by certayne of his ſhippes into Sicilia: intendyng hym ſelfe to aſſayle the citie of Vtica, with all his power: whiche yf he myght ones wynne, he reckened to be a reſtyng place for him and his, tyl the reſt of his voiage were acheued.
            ¶ Thus was the town of Vtica beſieged round about, & their hope was to haue ſuccours of Aſdruball: who had aſſembled togyther .xxx. M. fotemen, and .iii. M. horſmen. Neuer the leſſe for all that numbre, Aſdruball durſte not ſette furthe of Carthage tyll kyng Syphax was alſo come to hym with fyfty thouſande footemen, and .x. M. horſemen. Then ſet he forewardes, and came nere vnto Vtica, pytchinge his tentes and campe not farre from the Romayn army. There came aboute this tyme from Sicilia and Sardinia, great plenty of wheate, to vitaile the Romaines: ſo that they had therof great plenty. There was alſo brought thither .xii. C. gownes, and .xii. M. cotes for the ſouldiours, and prouiſion was made for all thynges that they lacked. Theſe were the actes of Scipio in Affrica this ſommer.
            ¶ Duryng whych ſommer P. Sempronius the conſull in Italy fought with Anniball: where the Romayns had the worſt, and loſte .xii. C. of theyr men. But ſoone after Sempronius ſent for P. Licinius the proconſull, to come to hym with his armye. After whoſe cōmyng, theyr powers beinge ioyned together

they went towardes Anniball, and he beynge ioyefull of his laſte victory, foughte with theim agayne, to his greate loſſe. For there were aboue .iiii. M. of his men ſlayne, and iii. C. taken. Then Anniball, beynge greately dyſcomforted with this loſſe, retourned from thence to Croton. Sone after the tyme of the choſyng of conſulles was come, at whiche Cn. Seruilius Cepio, and Cn. Seruilius Geminus were create conſulles, & other officers were choſen, according to the olde cuſtome, diuers cities alſo of the Brutiens, as Conſentia, Pandoſia, and other, ſubmytted theym ſelues, and retourned agayne to the Romaynes.
         
         
            ¶ Scipio wiſely eſpieng the maner of his ennemies campes, in the nyght burneth them bothe, putteth Syphax and Aſdruball to flyght, with great loſſe of theyr men. They make agayn a newe fylde, and are eftſones diſcomfyted and put to flyghte. Cap. lxiii.
            
               THe winter drewe nere, and both the gret hoſtes lay encamped not farre from Vtica: Yet Scipio neuer ceaſſed from the beſiegynge of the towne, and his campe was in ſyghte of his ennemyes. His mynd was ſtyll vpon his buſynes touching the warre. Amonge other his cares, he deuiſed greatly, by what meanes he myght wynne king Syphax from the Carthaginenſes, iudgyng that the heate of loue, which he had to his yonge wyfe, was by that tyme ſomewhat aſſwaged, and that he was then werye of the pleaſure in loue, beinge (as he thoughte) ſatisfyed therin to his contentation: When he had by legates aſſaied the mynde of the kynge, he made aunſwere, that he wolde intreate of peace betwene the Romains and the Carthaginenſes, Vpon this condition, that the Romaynes ſhulde departe cleane out of Affrica, and the Carthaginenſes lykewyſe out of Italy, without further trouble: orelles he wolde not fayle to purſue the warre on the partie of the Carthaginenſes. With theſe conditions Scipio was nothynge pleaſed: Neuertheleſſe, truſtinge by further communication in the matter: to haue aduauntage, by the ſerche and trewe knowledge of the ſtate of his ennemyes, throughe the common entercourſe of eyther partie to the others campe: he

fayntly refuſed thoſe conditions, wherby his ennemies myght take ſome hope of the achieuinge of theyr purpoſe. Now were the wynter houſes in the campes of the Carthaginenſes made of wodde and bowes, ſuche as they coulde get together. The Numidiens lodginges were couered with flagges and redes, and they laye within theyr campe, without order. Many alſo choſynge theyr owne places without aſſignemente, laye withoute the campe or dyches: whiche beinge ſhewed to Scipio, gaue hym a comfort and an hope, that the lodginges of his ennemies by pollicie myghte be ſet on fyre. Wherfore at euerye tyme that he ſente any embaſſadours to the kynge Syphax, to entreate of the peace, to be parfectly aſſured of the 
                  •
               rewe ſtate of all thynges, he euer ſent with them certayne witty fellowes of his army, diſguyſed in the habite and fourme of ſlaues, commaundinge them, whiles the embaſſadours were buſy in theyr communication, that they ſhulde ſtraye abrode to all partes of the campe of his ennemies, and to marke well the entrees and iſſues of the campes, with the ſyte & faſcion of the ſtacion or lodginges, as well of the Carthaginenſes as of the Numidiens, and in what quarter they were ſette, and howe farre the kynges campe was diſtante from the campe of Aſdruball, with the maner of theyr watche and warde bothe by nyghte and by daye.
            ¶ When the matter was thus dyuerſe tymes debated betwen the two counſayles: and that the Romaynes were parfecte of all the ſtate of theyr ennemies, and theyr order: Then the legates of Scipio ſayde vnto the kynge, that they were commaunded neuer to returne, vntyll they had brought determynate aunſwere, eyther of peace or of warre: Deſyrynge hym, eyther to gyue aunſwere therof hym ſelfe, or to take the counſayle and aduyſe of Aſdruball and the Carthaginenſes, and therupon to make them theyr aunſwere. For it was nowe hye tyme to knowe, eyther the oone or the other, withoute further tryfelynge forthe of tyme. Thus while Syphax toke the aduyſe of Aſdruball, and Aſdruball of the noble menne of Carthage, the eſpyes had leyſar to viewe and ſerche all thynges that they were charged with: and Scipio hadde tyme to prepare all that was mete to ſerue his purpoſe. The Numidiens alſo and the Carthaginenſes, truſtynge euer on peace, were neglygente in foreſeinge and aduoydynge daungiers of

warre, that were prepared for theyr myſchiefe. At the laſte aunſwere was made, that the Romaynes woulde haue peace, but theyr conditions were not indifferente, whiche they deſyred. Wheruppon Scipio, hauynge a good occaſion, honeſtlye to breake the truſe before betwene theim taken: On the morrowe he ſente worde to the kynge, that ſyns he perceyued no man wyllynge to haue peace but hym ſelfe: therefore the kynge from thens forthe ſhulde truſte to haue noo peace with the Romaynes, onleſſe he wolde leaue the amitie of the Carthaginenſes. Then was the tyme of truſe expyred, and the ſprynge of the yere was come. Wherefore Scipio, to brynge his pourpoſe aboute, aſſembled to gether his ſhippes, and furniſhed theim with ordynaunce and artyllery, as though he woulde aſſayle Vtica on the ſea coſte. He alſo ſente two thouſande men of warre to kepe the hyll about Vtica, whiche before laye vnkepte: And that he dydde for two purpoſes.
            Fyrſte, to drawe the myndes of his ennemies from the ſuſpection of that whiche he had deuyſed, and to occupy them with contrary worke. Secondly, with that power to defende his campe from the excurſions of the citezens, in caſe they wolde iſſue out, whyles he with his power were gone to Syphax and Aſdruball. Then dydde he open vnto Maſſaniſſa, and certayne other, what his mynde was to doo the nyghte folowynge. And he commaunded the Tribunes, that in the euenynge folowynge, they ſhulde brynge forthe the hoſte into the fyeldes. They accordynge to his commaundement, aboute the ſonne ſettynge, ſette forthe the ſtandardes and banners, and in the begynnynge of the nyghte, the hoſte ſet forwarde in arraye, ſo that by mydnyghte they hadde gone .vii. myles, and were come nere to the campe of theyr ennemyes. Then Scipio deuyded his army in .ii. partes. The one parte with the Numidiens, he appoynted to Lelius and Maſſaniſſa, wyllynge them to inuade the campe of kynge Syphax, and to ſet fire on the lodginges made of bowes and of flagges, hartely prayinge them bothe, that nyght to apply theyr buſineſſe with great dilygence. And he ſayde, that ſo ſone as he myghte perceyue the fyre to be in the kynges campe, then wolde he alſo aſſayle the campe of Aſdruball.
            ¶ Accordyng to his commaundement the purpoſe was achieued. For incontinent after the fyre was put into the vttermoſt

partes and houſes, the fyre anon toke in the drye ſtyckes and flagges, and ranne from one houſe to an other: ſo that in ſhorte ſpace it was abrode in euery parte of the campe. The Numidiens of the kynges hoſte, parceyuinge the fyre, were ſtryken with a ſodeyne great feare, and the more bycauſe it chaunced in the nyght ſeaſon. yet nothynge miſtruſtinge the cauſe therof to aryſe throughe their ennemies, but iudginge it to come throughe ſome negligence or euyll fortune. They ranne on all partes to helpe to ceaſſe or quenche the fyre, without armour or weapons. Nowe Maſſaniſſa, whiche knewe the wayes and entrees about the kinges campe, had ſoo laide his Numidiens in embuſhmētes, that as the people ran abrode to quenche the fyre, they fel into the company of theyr ennemies er they knew where they were, and by that meanes many were ſlaine, many alſo wer burned in theyr beddes with fyre. The watche of the Carthaginenſes, in the campe of Aſdruball, parceyuinge the great fires in the kynges campe, awaked the reſt of the hoſte. Who being alſo deceyued, for that they thought the fyre was hapned by negligence, and not by the deuiſe of theyr ennemies, and herynge the greate crye of theyr companye in the kynges hoſte, that were ſlayne, whiche they thought came but onely throughe the ſodeyne feare of the fyre, that was happened in the nyghte: they ranne together in companyes vnarmed out of the gates of theyr campes, the next way, takyng onely with them ſuche thynges, wherwith they myght quenche the fyre. Whom the Romaynes receyued as they came, and flewe them euery one, that none eſcaped to beare tydynges therof. Then Scipio incontinent inuaded the campe. Where fyudynge the gates ther of vnwarded, he entred with his armye, and ſet fyre on the lodginges in diuerſe partes, whiche ſpreadyng abrode, in ſhort ſpace burned all that was therin, bothe man beaſte and ſtuffe. And ſuche as wold haue fledde from the daunger of the fyre, were ſlayne with the ſwerde of the Romaynes.
            ¶ Thus in one tyme were bothe the campes wonne. Neuertheleſſe bothe the capitaines eſcaped with .xx. M. fotemen, and v. C. horſemen: wherof manye were wounded and hurte with that fyre. There were ſlayn and burned that night .xl. M. beſydes them that there were taken, aboue .vi. thouſand, with many noble men of Carthage: whereof .xl. were ſenatours, with a greate and ryche praye, of horſes armure and other

thynges moche of valure, whiche were diſtributed amonges the ſouldiours. The kynge with certayne with hym, fledde to his owne countrey.
            ¶ Aſdruball with as great ſpeede as he mightcame to Carthage, where he founde the citie ſoore troubled, and in greate feare. For they iudged, that Scipio, leauynge the further aſſault of Vtica, wolde incontinent after his victory come to aſſault and ouercome Carthage. Than they determined, in haſt to aſſemble a newe hoſt of the citie and countrey about theim. They alſo ſent meſſangers to kynge Syphax, to require hym, that he would gather his power, and healpe to defende bothe his countrey and theyrs. Whervnto his yonge wyfe muche moued hym: who pyteouſly wepyng, deſyred hym not to ſuffre his fathers and her countrey to be diſtroyed, and the citie of Carthage to be bourned by the Romaynes, as they of late bourned the kynges tentes and her fathers. The legates of Carthage alſo ſhewed hym, that good fortune was comminge towardes them. For that there were arryued of late .iiii. M. men of warre of Celtiberia, a countrey of Spayne, whyche were hyred to comme to their ſuccours. And that Aſdruball woulde not fayle to ioyne with hym with a full noble armye. To whome the kyng gaue gentyll aunſwere, ſayinge, that he woulde aſſemble and put in armour all the luſty yonge men of his realme. For he ſayde, he knewe well, that he was before ouercome by fyre, and not by battayle. Wherefore he woulde neuer accompte hym ſelfe vanquyſhed, oneles he were ouercome and ſubdued in the fielde by ſtrength and power. With this anſwere the meſſangers departed.
            ¶ And ſhortly after, accordyng to theyr appoyntement, Aſdruball and the kynge mette togyther, with their armies, and had betweene them bothe .xxx. M. men. Scipio herynge of theyr newe comming agayne on hym, with that power, lefte at the ſayde Vtica, a ſmalle numbre of his people, bothe by ſea and by lande: and hym ſelfe with his greatte power, went to mete his ennemies. He pitched his campe in the playn fielde, not farre from the kynges campe, where lyghte ſkyrmyſſhes were made betweene the horſemen of bothe partes, by the ſpace of .iii. dayes. On the fourthe day, the capitaynes prepared theyr hoſtes to battayle.
            ¶ Scipio ſet his ſpearemen in the front of his battayle: behynde

whome were his beſt aſſured ſouldiours footemen ſet to theyr ayde and ſuccours. On the ryghte wynge were his horſemen of Italy. In the lefte wynge was Maſſaniſſa with his Numidian horſemen.
            ¶ On the other ſide, Aſdruball againſt the wynge of Italyan horſmen, ſet his Numidians, and againſt Maſſaniſſa he ſet his Carthaginenſes. In the middes were the newe ſouldiours of Celtiberia. Thus beinge ordered, the battailles ioyned. And at the fyrſt encountre, both the winges of the Carthaginenſes and of the Numidians were driuen backe. For the Numidians being now rude and vntaught men of armes, were noothinge able to reſyſte the Romain horſmen: neither the Carthaginenſes (being alſo vnexpert in feates of warre) were able to withſtande Maſſaniſſa, that was fierſe and terrible, through the ioy of his late victory. Wherfore the wynges beinge thus put to flight, the poore army of the Celtiberians remained alone, naked, deſtitute of helpe or refuge. Flie they durſte not, for that beinge in an vnknowen cuntrey, they knewe no place whither to flie to be ſaued. Again, if they were taken, they looked for no grace at Scipios hand: ſeinge they came from their owne cuntrey into Affrica, to fight againſt hym that had before ofte tymes been their good frende. Wherfore, being compaſſed about with their ennemies, they were ſlayne one vppon an other without pitie. But whiles al men were buſy about theim, Syphax and Aſdrubal had tyme to eſcape, to whom the night beinge ſo nere, was moche their ſafegarde.
            ¶ What feare the Carthaginenſes were in after this great ouerthrowe of their friendes, and ſeing Scipio with his army, ouer ryding the countrey rounde aboute theim, and winning the cities and townes, which were vnder their ſubiection: no penne can write, nor tunge expreſſe. They loked euery houre whan theyr citie ſhoulde be enuyronned with their ennemies: they fortifyed their walles, they broughte in vytayles to endure a lenger ſpace, and prepared all thynges neceſſarye. They conſulted, what were beſt for theym to do. It was agreed, that meſſangers ſhoulde be ſent with letters to Anniball, commaundyng him to come to Carthage with his power to their ſocours.
            ¶ Certayn of the ſenatours gaue counſel, that a good nombre of ſhippes, furnyſhed with men and ordenance, ſhuld ſodeinly

inuade the Romayne hoſte and nauy, that lay in reſt at Vtica: not myſtruſtynge, but they ſhulde fynde the ſhyppes neglygently kept: wherby with ſmall peyne they myghte oppreſſe theim. On theſe two pointes the ſenators agreed. The ſhippes were ſette furthe, and letters were alſo ſent to Anniball. Scipio retournynge from the battayle, leadynge and cariyng with hym the ſpoile or pray of many townes, which he wanne: ſent his ſayde praye with the priſoners to his campe at Vtica. He hym ſelfe came to Tunnes, whyche he found void of men of warre. They were fled after the battayle, and left the town without any garriſon. Of the takyng of this towne Scipio was very gladde, as well for that it was naturally ſtronge by reaſon of the ſyte therof, beſyde that it was ſurely fortifyed by the induſtry of man, as alſo for that the place was ſo commodyouſe for his pourpoſe. It was dyſtaunt from Carthage twelue myles. Yet frome thenſe he myghte welle ſee the citie of Carthage, and alſo the ſea that bette on the walles of the towne.
            ¶ Whyles the Romaynes were caſtynge a trenche and fortifiynge this towne of Tunnes: they perceyued the nauy of the Carthaginenſes ſaylynge towardes Vtica. Than Scipio leauyng his woorkes, made haſte with his men towardes Vtica, to come to the healpe of his ſhippes, that lay at the ſiege therof, and came before the arryuing of the Carthaginenſes: who trifled the tyme on the ſea, beinge in feare to ſet on that enterpryſe: ſo that Scipio had prouyded well for the defence of his ſhyppes before their coming. Neuer the leſſe after moche trouble and fyght on the ſea, they toke with them .vi. Romayn ſhyppes, and returned to Carthage, where no ſmall ioy was made of that very ſmall gayne.
         
         
            ¶ Syphax maketh a new fialde with Lelius and Maſſaniſſa: where he is taken priſoner, and his men put to flighte. Maſſaniſſa then taketh the citie of Cirtha, and there in haſt, marieth Sophonisba, wyfe to kinge Spphax. Cap. lxiiii.
            THe morowe after the battaile was fought, and the kyng Syphax eſcaped, as is before declared, Scipio ſent Lelius and Maſſaniſſa, with all the Romayn horſmen & the

lyghteſt harneiſſed footemen, and alſo the Numidians, to folowe the kyng and Aſdruball: whiles he went about to wynne the townes and countrey adiacent to Carthage. They within xv. dayes came into Numidia: at whoſe coming, a people therof called Maſeſuli, receiued gladly Maſſaniſſa, and deliuered hym the whole realme, as to theyr ryghtfull kynge, whoſe cominge they had ſo longe deſyred, expellynge cleane out of the cities and fortreſſes therof, all the garnyſons of Syphax, ſoo that he was glad to kepe hym within the bondes of his owne realme. His harte ſwelled at this diſpleaſure, wyllynge to be reuenged: whervnto his wyfe and her father moche intyced hym, and prycked hym forwardes. He hadde great plentie of men, and alſo of horſes, whyche moche encouraged hym to make a newe fielde. Wherefore he aſſembled as many as he thoughtable, gyuyng theim horſes and harneys: diuydynge his horſemen and footemenne into companyes, appoyntynge to theim capitaines, accordynge as he before had learned of the Romaynes. Thus hauyng all thinges in a redyneſſe, he marched towardes his ennemies, with as great an hooſte as he had before: but they were almoſte all newe ſouldiours, and yonge men of warre. Whan he came nere the hoſt of the Romains he there fortified his campe. And anone certayne of his horſemen iſſued and badde baſe to an nother numbre of the Romayne horſemen. And who ſoo was beaten, retourned agayne to his company, and was anon reſcued of an other numbre of his company. Thus by diuers iſſuynges and helpynge euery part theyr companies, beyng either aſhamed or angrye of theyr driuynge backe, the battayle beganne to be quicke on bothe partes, ſo that at the laſt the hole companyes of horſemen on bothe partes were come to the fieldes. The noumbre of kynge Syphax hoſte was come ſo thicke to the bataile, that the Romaynes were fayne to recule, and had been put to the worſe, had not the Romain legyons of fotemen come to theyr ſuccours. At whoſe comynge the kynges people muſynge of theyr order and maner of fyghtyng, began to ſtay, and at the laſte were dryuen backe, and began to flee. Syphax, wyllynge to withholde his people from flyght, beganne to exhort them to abyde, and manfully to fyght, ſhewynge vnto theim, bothe the ſhame and alſo the ieoperdye that woulde enſue through theyr flyinge.
            
               
¶ And whyles he rode about the fielde, comfortyng his people, he hapned to come nere a company of Romaynes, where his horſe was ſtryken downe and ſlayne vnder hym, and he taken alyue, and brought to Lelius. His people fledde as faſte as they myght, and came to the citie of Cirtha, whyche was the chiefe citie of all that realme. There were of his menne ſlayne in that battayle .v. M. and aboute .ii. M. v. C. taken. Than ſayd Maſſaniſſa to Lelius: There were nothynge to me more pleaſant, than hauyng nowe victory, to viſite my fathers kyngdom, which after my long exyle, I haue now recouered. But the time will not ſuffre vs to ceſſe from our enterpriſe. wherfore, if ye wil ſuffre me, to take with me all the hors men, and the kyng alſo nowe priſoner: I will goo before you to Cirtha, where I ſhall fynde euery man ſoo ſuppriſed with feare, that I ſhall ſoone wynne it with ſmal reſiſtence: ye, with your fotemen may come after me ſmall iourneys at your eaſe.
            ¶ To this his diuyſe Lelius aſſented. And Maſſaniſſa with his horſemen haſted, tyll he came to the walles of the citie of Cirtha, where he called certaine of the towne to him, and deſired to haue certain of the noble mē of the citie to come furth and ſpeake with hym, which done, he moued them gentylly, to yelde vp their citie: But they, not knowing of the takinge of their king, in no wiſe wold be perſwaded to ſubmit them ſelfes to the Romains. Than cauſed Maſſaniſſa the king Syphax to be brought before them bound as a priſoner. After which pitifull ſyght, the citezens partly for feare, partly truſtyng therby to obteine fauor of Maſſaniſſa and of the Romains, opened the yates of the citie. And Maſſaniſſa, leauyng fyrſt the gates & wals furniſhed with his people, to thintent none of the citie ſhuld eſcape out: he with great ſpede rode to the kinges palaice. Where at his fyrſt entre he found Sophoniſba, the wife of Syphax, daughter to Aſdruball of Carthage, who abode his coming at the gate of his palaice. whan ſhe eſpied him coming amonge a great route of men of armes, ſhe iudging partly by his goodly armure, partly by his riche apparaile, that he was the kyng: ſhe fell on her knees before hym and ſayd: The goddis, thy ſtrength, and thy good fortune

               y take place with her lord, that hath power both of lyfe and of deth: I humbly

beſeche the, by that royall maieſtie, wherin of late alſo we wer, and for the loue of the name of the people and cuntrey of Numidia, which appertained both to Syphax and to you: for the loue alſo of the goddis of this place, whō I deſire to ſend the better & more proſperus coming hither, thā they gaue to Syphax a departing hens, that thou wilt graunt me to be thy priſoner. and what ſo euer thy pleſure be to do with me, I ſhal not refuſe it: ſo that thou ſuffre me not to come into the cruell and proude dominion of any Romayne. I had leauer auenture to yelde me into the power of a Numidian, and of one that is borne in myne owne countrey of Affrica, than to the handes of a ſtranger. For it is not vnknowen to you, howe moche the daughter of Aſdruball and a Carthaginenſe borne, hath cauſe to feare the hande of a Romayne. And in caſe thou canſte none otherwiſe helpe my deſire, I mooſte hartily require the, to ſteame: and thus by deathe delyuer me from the daunger of the Romaynes.
            ¶ This quene being of excellent beautie, and in her luſty flouriſhyng age, what with her humble behauiour, what with her fayre ſpeche, ſo perſuaded the king Maſſaniſſa, that he not only toke her to mercy, but alſo hauyng the victory of her, & the hole citie, he becam ſo captiue to her by loue, that he takig her by the right hand, promiſed her, her requeſt, and thervpon he mounted into the kinges palaice. Than he began to dyuiſe in his imagination, by what meanes he myght performe his promiſe vnto the queene. And whan he coulde fynde noo way to bringe his purpoſe to paſſe, as one that was ouercome with blynd loue, he inuented a foliſhe and a ſhamefull diuiſe, whiche was, to be maried incontinent vnto her the ſame day: thynking by the mariage of her vnto him, he had taken away all occaſion both from Lelius and alſo from Scipio, of doing her any hurt or diſpleaſure. Whan the mariage was ſtnyſhed, Lelius with his hoſte of footemen came to the citie of Cyrtha. And knowing of the ſodeine weddyng he was ſo diſpleſed with the act, that he was mynded to take her from the pleſant bedde of her new huſband, and to ſend her to Scipio, with her huſband Syphax and other 
                  ••
               iſoners. But at the laſt, he being ouercome by thinterceſſiō of Maſſaniſſa, who remitted the order of that matter to the iudgement of Scipio: he ſent Syphax and other priſoners to the emperour Scipio. After whoſe departyng,

he, by the helpe of Maſſaniſſa, receiued the other townes and cities of that countrey of Numidia into his handes: which before were kept by the retinue of kyng Syphax.
         
         
            ¶ Syphax is brought to the campe of Scipio, Maſſaniſſa ſendeth to Sophoniſba poyſon, whiche ſhe without feare drinketh. Capi. lxv.
            VVhan tydinges came into the Romain campe, of the coming of Syphax, and the other noble captiues: greatte was the numbre of people that ranne to behold theim. The king being bounde, was caried formooſte, and after hym folowed a great numbre of the nobilitie of Numidia. And as the opinion of men is dyuers, ſo diuerſe were the tales of the people, extollynge the honour of the victorye by the myghty power of Syphax, and by the noble fame of the people that was ouercome. There was recounted the myghty power of the kyng, to whoſe maieſtie in one day .ii. of the moſt noble ſeignories of the worlde ſued for his fauour and frendeſhip, that is to ſay the Romayns and the Carthaginenſes. The Romanes ſent theyr valyaunt emperour and capitaine Scipio, onely with .ii. galeys that bare fiue oores on euery ſyde, into Affrica, to ſeke his amitie, leauyng in Spayn, than his prouince, all his hoſte and great charge. Agayne Aſdruball, the capytayne of the Carthaginenſes, not onely came into his countrey for amitie, but alſo he gaue hym his daughter in mariage, for the more ſure conſyrmation of alyaunce betweene theim. Some reherſed the power and actes of Syphax to be ſuche, that he had driuen Maſſaniſſa out of his realme, brynging him to ſuche extreme calamitie, that his lyfe coulde none otherwyſe be ſaued, but by the bruite and fame of his death: and he after gladde to hyde his head in dennes or caues, and to lyue in the foreſtes and woddes lyke a wylde beaſt.
            ¶ With theſe and ſuche lyke famous report of the beholders he was brought into the tent of Scipio: who was by his preſence and ſyght muche moued with pitie, conſyderyng the honour that he of olde tyme had knowen hym in, and conferryng the ſame to his preſent miſery. Than Scipio after ſalutations made, & other cōmunicatiō betwene them had 
                  〈…〉
               , what he wold haue him to do to him: ſeing he 
                  〈◊〉
                onely refuſed the

amitie of the Romaynes, but alſo wyllingely gauetheim battayle. To whom the kinge aunſwered, that he knewe wel, that he had offended, and he confeſſed, that he was not in his right mynde, whan he moued warre againſte them. He was madde: when he dyd forget the comynge of Scipio into his realme, and the bonde of alliance that he then made with hym: but ſpecially whan he receiued into his houſe a matrone of Carthage, of whoſe hot loue and mariage the fyry brondes had alredy ſet fyre in his royall palaice. That madde and peſtilente fury, by her intiſement neuer ceaſſed, tyll ſhe had turned his harte and mynde from his olde friendes the Romaynes: cauſynge hym to purſue the warre againſte them. Neuer the leſſe (ſayde he) in all my myſery I haue nothynge that ſo moche doth comfort me, and reioyſe my herte, as when I beholde the ſame peſtilent madde fury nowe to be entred the houſe of my moſt ennemy. And when I conſyder that Maſſaniſſa is noo more wyſe then Syphar was: but that he more madly, and with leſſe temperaunce hath receiued her, then euer I dyd.
            ¶ With theſe wordes of the kynge, Scipio was not a lyttell troubled, and then herynge the great offence layde to Maſſaniſſa, he ſawe good cauſe, why he ſhuld gyue credence therto. Conſydering the great haſt made in the maryage, without the aduiſe of Lelius, and without abydinge his comynge. This acte alſo ſemed worſe, and more to be abhorred, conſyderyng, that he beinge a yonge man in Spayne, was neuer before taken with the loue of any captiue or priſoner.
            ¶ As he was muſynge hereon, anone Lelius and Maſſaniſſa came vnto hym, whom in open audience he meryly and ioyfully receyued, giuynge them great thankes and praiſes for their dilygence in that iourney ſhewed. But anone, takynge Maſſaniſſa alone with hym in to a ſecrete place, he ſayde thus vnto hym.
            ¶ I knowe ryght well Maſſaniſſa, that you dydde perceyue ſome good qualities and vertues in me, whan you fyrſte came into Spayne to me, defyrynge there my frendſhyp and amitie: and afterwarde in Affrica, when ye holly cōmytted your ſelfe into my gouernaunce. But at that tyme ye thought your ſelfe, that there was no vertue in me, whiche ye ſoo moche eſtemed as temperaunce and continencie: of whiche alſo I truely dyd moſt glory of my ſelfe. And theſe vertues Maſſaniſſa I wolde

ye ſhulde ioyne vnto other noble qualities and vertues, wherwith ye are indued. For beleue me, there is not ſo moche daunger to men of our yonge age by armed ennemies, as is by voluptuouſe pleaſure of our wanton deſyres, whiche euer are redy to vainquiſhe vs. And who ſo euer throughe temperaunce can bridle and ſubdue thoſe affecions, is worthy more honour, and hath achieued a greatter victory, then we haue nowe had by the takynge of kynge Syphax. The actes whiche ye haue ſo valyauntly and nobly done in myne abſence, remayne daylye in my memory: the other your euill actes I had leuer ye dyd call to remembraunce your ſelfe, then that I ſhoulde declare theym to youre greatte ſhame. Syphax, by the good fortune of the Romaynes, is nowe ouercome and taken. Wherefore he, his wyfe, his kyngedome, his poſſeſſions, his townes and caſtelles, his people, inhabitauntes of the ſame, with all that euer to Syphax belonged, is nowe a praye due to the people of Rome. The king and his wife (although ſhe had not bē a citezen of Carthage, and althoughe her father were not the capitain of our ennemies) ought to be ſent to Rome, and there ſhe ought to abide the iudgement of the ſenatours, and people of the citie, for that ſhe turned the minde of the kyng her huſbande from our friendſhyp, perſwadynge hym to take armour agaynſte vs. Wherfore nowe ouercome your owne affectionate mynde, and beware, that with one vyce, ye dyſgrace not ſo many your good vertues: and by one offence, loſe the rewarde and the thankes, whiche by your merites ye haue here tofore worthely deſerued.
            ¶ With theſe ſecrete rebukes Maſſaniſſa was not onely aſhamed, but alſo conſtrayned to wepe, ſayinge: that he wolde alwayes be at his commaundemente. Neuer the leſſe he deſyred hym, as moche as myght be admitted, to regarde the faythful promeſſe that he had vnaduiſedly made vnto her: whiche was, that he wolde delyuer her into none other mans handes. After theſe wordes, all abaſhed he departed to his owne tente, where remayninge alone, he ſighed and ſobbed a great ſeaſon ſo vehemently, that ſuche as were without his tent myght eaſely here hym. At the laſte, makynge dolefull lamentation, he called to hym one of his faythfull and ſecrete ſeruauntes, who had the keping of his poyſon, according to the 
                  ••
               age 
                  〈◊〉
                kinges and prynces: who vſed to haue the ſame euer kepte nere to

them, therby to ouercome the incertayntie of fortune: parte of this poyſon put into drynke, he ſente by hym in a cuppe to Sophoniſba, commaundynge hym to ſaye to her, that Maſſaniſſa wolde (if he had coulde) gladly haue kepte his firſt promyſe made vnto her, as becometh a man to do to his wife: but ſens it lieth not in his power, to perfurme it, yet wyll he kepe his ſeconde promes made vnto her, whiche was that ſhe ſhuld not, whiles ſhe were on lyue, come into the daungier of any Romayne. Wherfore he wylleth her, to remembre the Emperour her father, and the .ii. kynges, to whom ſhe hath ben maried, and therafter regarde her owne honour.
            ¶ When the meſſanger hadde preſented to Sophoniſba the poyſon, and done his meſſage, ſhe aunſwered: I wyll receyue this mariage gyfte, and that gladly, if a huſbande can gyue no better gyfte to his wyfe. But (ſayde ſhe) I praye the ſhewe Maſſaniſſa, that my deathe had not ben ſoo greuouſe to me, if I had not maryed ſo nere the goinge to my graue. And without gyuinge other ſharpe wordes to the meſſanger, ſhe without feare or tremblynge, toke the drynke empoyſoned, and dranke it of.
            ¶ Whan this was ſhewed vnto Scipio, leſt Maſſaniſſa, being a fyerſe yonge man, and takyng this diſpleaſantly in his minde, myght do ſome hurt to him ſelfe: he called hym vnto him: ſomtyme comfortynge hym, ſometyme gentilly rebukinge him, for that he had corrected his fyrſt foly with an other folyſhe acte, makynge of the thynge more ſorowe then neded. On the next daye, to the intent he wolde put all ſuche fantaſies out of his mynde: he aſcended to the place of iudgemente, whyther he cauſed all his hoſte to aſſemble. There he fyrſte gaue to Maſſaniſſa the name of a kynge: and after great lawdes and prayſes gyuen to hym, he alſo gaue hym many ryche gyftes, as a crowne of golde, with a great bolle of golde, a chaire of Iuorye, a walkynge ſtaffe of Iuorye, a ryche gowne, with a cote of bawdekyn, vſed to be worne in 
                  •
               ygne of victory. And to ſet the matter forthe to his further honour, he declared, that in any tryumphe at Rome, after any victory hadde of theyr ennemies, no man could weare any more noble apparaile then this, whiche he hadde 
                  •
               yuen hym. Sayinge alſo, that of al ſtraungers the 
                  〈◊〉
                of Rome iudged onely Maſſaniſſa worthye to be preſented with th
                  •
               ſe gyftes. Then called he forthe Lelius,

to whom he alſo gaue great prayſes, and rewarded hym with a crowne of golde. And after he rewarded other his ſoldiours, according to theyr deſertes. By this gentel handeling and honour gyuen to the kyng Maſſaniſſa, his troubled minde was pacifyed: and he was put in hope after the deathe of Syphax, to be ruler of all Numidia. Then Scipio ſent Lelius to Rome, with Syphax and other pryſoners, with whome alſo wente the embaſſadours of Maſſaniſſa. And he after their departynge, wente agayne to Tuniſe, where he encamped his hoſte, and fortifyed the place, makynge an ende of the workes, whiche he before had begunne.
         
         
            ¶ Lelius, with kinge Siphax, and other priſoners, and the embaſſadours of Maſſaniſſa, came to Rome: Maſſaniſſa is made king of his realme of Numidia. Cap. lxvi.
            
               THe Carthaginenſes, hering of the takyng of Syphax, in whom they had as moche truſt, as they had in Aſdrubal, and his armye: began then to be faynt harted. Wherfore ſens they knewe no further helpe in theyr warre, they ſent .xxx. the moſt noble ſenatours of their citie to Scipio, to intreate of peace. Theſe auncient noble men, ſo ſone as they came into the pauilion of the pretor before Scipio, of a flatteryng facion they fel proſtrate to the grounde, and then made an humble and a flatterynge oration, not pourgynge them ſelues and theyr citie of theyr offence, but layinge the begynnynge of all the defaulte in Anniball, and his adherentes. Deſyrynge to haue the citie pardoned of this offence, ſynſe they truſted, that the Romains wolde not deſyre theyr deſtruction, but that they wold be contented with theyr humble ſubmiſſion, as of people ouercome, whiche wolde be glad to obey to any thynge that he ſhulde cō
               maunde them to do. To whom Scipio anſwered, that his comynge into Affrica was vpon truſt, to returne home agayne to Rome with victory, not to conclude with peace, whiche his hope, fortune alſo fauouryng, had moche aduanced by proſperous ſucceſſe. Neuertheleſſe (ſaide he) now

And in caſe ye be contented with theim, ye ſhall haue truce of me, and ſend your embaſſadours to Rome to the ſenate, for a confyrmation of the ſame.
            ¶ The Carthaginenſes, myndynge onely to tracte the tyme tyl Anniball with his power might come into Affrica, thought they woulde refuſe no conditions of peace, that were demaunded to be done for their partes. Wherfore they ſent ſome legates vnto Scipio, to take truce, other they ſent to Rome, to aſke peace, leading with theim certain priſoners and fugitiues for a colour, to the intent they myghte therby the better obteygne peace.
            ¶ Whyles theſe thynges were woorkyng, Lelius with king Syphax, and other noblemen priſoners of Numidia, wer com to Rome. Where he declared to the ſenatours by ordre all thinges whiche had ben done in Affrica, to their greate comfort and alſo hope of good ende of that voiage.
            ¶ Then were theſe newes publyſhed abrode in the citie, whiche cauſed great ioy and gladnes.
            ¶ Sone after were the ambaſſadours of Maſſaniſſa brought into the ſenate, where fyrſt they ſaid, They were glad and ioyfull, that Scipio had nobly and happily ſpedde in Affrica, to the no ſmalle comforte of the ſenate, and alſo of the citie of Rome: Than dyd they gyue thankes for that Scipio hadde not onely giuen to Maſſaniſſa the name of a kynge, but alſoo had made hym a kyng, reſtoring him to his fathers kyngdom, if it were the pleaſure of the fathers of the ſenate. Thyrdly, that it pleaſed Scipio, not only to giue great prayſes to Maſſaniſſa openly, but alſo that he had gyuen hym greatte gyftes, whiche to deſerue he hath and wyll dilygently indeuour hym ſelfe, deſyryng that the ſayd name of a king, with other the beneficiall gyftes of Scipio, myght be confyrmed by the decree

of the ſenate: And furthermore they ſayde, that yf it myght ſtande with theyr pleaſure, Maſſaniſſa deſyred theim, to ſende vnto hym certayne priſoners of Numidia, whiche were kepte in priſon at Rome: by the reſtoring of whom, he ſhuld purchas moche honour and loue among the communes of the cuntrey. To theſe their ſayinges and demaundes, it was then anſwered by the ſenate, that the proſperous actes of Scipio, doone in Affrica, were as moche to theyr comforte, as to the kynges. And that the honour and the giftes, which Scipio had gyuen to Maſſaniſſa, were well beſtowed, and accordynge as he had well deſerued: which his actes they al dyd ratifie and allowe: Beſydes whyche his gyftes, they alſo ſent vnto Maſſaniſſa the kyng, by theim, dyuers other preſentes of apparaile, mete to be worne bothe in the tyme of peace and of warre. Furthermore, the embaſſadours of the king were honourably rewarded. The priſoners alſo of Numidia, at theyr delyuery & ſendyng home, had certayn apparayle gyuen theim. And thus plentyfully enryched, they had all departed towardes Affrica, hadde not the newes of the coming of the legates of Carthage cauſed the ſenatours to ſtay Lelius and theim all for a ſeaſon, to tary their cominge, bycauſe the communication of the peace with theim, ſhulde be in the preſence of Lelius.
         
         
            ¶ Mago is diſcomfited by the Romaynes, and wounded, of whiche wounde he dyeth, Anniball by the commandement of the ſenate leaueth Italy, and ſayleth toward Carthage, makyng great doole for his departing. ca. lxvii.
            IN the ſame Sommer, whyles theſe thynges were wrought and decreed in Affrica, and at Rome, Quintilius Varro, than beynge Pretor, and Marcus Cornelius, beynge Proconſull in the coſtes of Lumbardy, hadde battayle with Mago the brother of Anniball, whyche was earneſtly foughte on bothe partes: and hadde not the Romayne horſemenne ſodeynely inuaded the footemen, ſoore fyghtynge, and broken theyr araye, it hadde bene lykely to haue tourned the Romaynes to the worſe. But after the array was broken, they were fayne to recule: And Mago ſo well handled hym ſelfe in the reculynge, that ſoo longe as he abode vnhurt, he defended his company, and cauſed them to

recule in good order and array. But at the laſte he was ſoore wounded, and fell to the grounde, and with peyne was borne oute of the fielde alyne. After whoſe ouerthrowe his people fled on all partes, wherby many of theim were ſlayne. He loſt at that battayle aboue .v. M. men. And the Romains eſcaped not free: for they alſo loſt then aboue .ii. M. iii. C. men, with many capitaines that bare offices of honour. The nyght folowynge Mago departed with great ſilence, and makynge as great haſty iourneys as his wounde wolde ſuffre hym, he cam to the ſea coſtes of Liguria, where he founde the meſſangers of Carthage, that fewe dayes before were arriued, and there abode his cominge. Theyr meſſage was, that with as moche ſpede as myght be, he ſhulde hye him to Affrica. and that his brother Anniball had alſo lyke commandement by other meſſangers to do the ſame, certifiyng hym, that the ſtate of Carthage was not nowe ſuche, that they were able to kepe ſtylle bothe Italy and Fraunce by force of armes. Mago partely moued by the cōmandement of the ſenate of Carthage, partly fearyng left his ennemies, purſuing hym, might by his long carying do hym further diſpleaſure. Agayne, truſtynge on his way homewardes to be better releued and cured of his woundes: he with ſpede put his company into ſhyppes, and departed. But he had not paſſed the Ile of Sardinia: but he dyed of his maladye. After whoſe deathe, dyuers of his ſhyppes, beynge beaten with the ſtormes of the ſea, were taken by the nauy of the Romaynes, that laye the ſame tyme aboute Sardinia.
            All this yere Anniball, and Cn. Seruſlius the conſull, lay bothe with theyr hoſtes in the parties of the Brutians, without any memorable bataile betwene theim foughten. And than came the legates of Carthage vnto hym, callyng him home to Carthage to theyr ſuccours, whoſe meſſage he hearde roring and lamentynge, and with peyne coulde he forbeare weepynge. And after a pawſe he ſayde: Nowe they openly call me backe, that before couertly imagyned to fetche me frome henſe, in that they denyed for to ſende me money and menne of warre, to ſupplye the roumes of ſuche as lacked.
            Wherefore I woulde all men dydde knowe, that the vanquiſhynge nowe of Anniball is not by the people of Rome: but by the ſenate of Carthage, throughe deſpyte and 
                  〈◊〉
               . And

of this my ſhamefull retourne, Scipio wyll no more reioyce, thanne wyll Hanno of Carthage, the olde ennemye of my whole famylie.
            ¶ After greatte doolefull mone made, he tooke the ſea hym ſelfe, and his chiefe menne of warre, with ſhyppes therefore prepared: leauynge certayne vnprouffytable ſowldyours, as a defence of ſuche ſmalle fortreſſes as remayned than in his poſſeſſion, more for feare than for any good wylle or faythe.
            ¶ It hath not lyghtly bene ſeene or hearde of, that euer man departed from his countrey (beyng exiled therfro) with more heuyneſſe, than Anniball departed frome the countrey of his ennemies. Full often, whan he was on the ſea, he loked backe towardes the ſea coſtes of Italy, accuſyng bothe the goddis & alſo men, ye and curſyng hym ſelfe, for that he after his victorie at the battaile of Cannas, had not incontinent brought his fierſe and bluddy knightes to the takyng of Rome. Thus bewaylyng his euyll fortune, he left the poſſeſſion of Italy, whiche he had kepte the ſpace of .xvi. yeres after that he fyrſt paſſed the mountayns of the ſame.
         
         
            ¶ Anniball arryueth in Affrica, and deſyreth to ſpeake with Scipio, whiche he graunteth hym, and thervpon they mere at a place appoynted. Capit. lxviii.
            
               NOwe was Q. Fuluius Sillo, the legate of Scipio com to Rome, with the embaſſadors of Carthage, to require peace of the fathers of the ſenate. But the ſenatours wold not ſuffre theim to entre the citie, but apointed theim to abide with out the walles. The ſenatours ſoone after ſatte in the houſe of Bellona, whyther the Carthaginenſes legates were broughte, and there made an oration, moche lyke to the other, whych they before made vnto Scipio, laying all the blame from the common counſaile vnto Anniball: ſaying, that he, without the conſent of the ſenate of Carthage, paſſed both the mountaynes and alſo the ryuer of Iberus, makyng warre not onely to the Romaynes, vppon his owne wylle and pleaſure, but alſo to the Saguntines. Where the mynde of the Senate of Carthage was euer, to kepe the leage and amitieinuiolate,

whyche was taken before with the Romayns. In concluſyon they declared, that the ſumme of theyr charge giuen theym, to deſyre of the ſenate of Rome, was, that they myght continue in the ſame leage and conditions of amitie and peace with the Romaines, as were before at the laſt truce taken with them by Luctatius, than being conſull.
            ¶ Then dyuers of the auncient Senatours of Rome, whyche were preſente at the leage taken by Luctatius, demaunded ſundrye queſtyons of the legates of Carthage, concernynge the ſayde condition of peace, conteyned in that leage. Wherevnto they, beynge all younge menne, aunſwered, that they were not of aege to remembre that treatie. This aunſwere was greattely ſuſpected of the fathers. Wherefore they ſaid with one aſſent, that the Carthaginenſes, accordyng to theyr olde accuſtomed crafte and falſehode, had choſen ſuche imbaſſadours, to requyre a peace to be renued, wherof they had no knowlege nor remembrance. Whervppon the legates were cauſed to auoide the place, whiles they counſayled vppon the matter. And after longe deliberate diſcuſſynge therof, Lelius and Fuluius declared to theim the opinyon of Scipio, touchyng this peace, whiche was, that he dydde not myſlyke the meanyng of the Carthaginenſes, in caſe they dyd not ſende to call home Anniball and Mago out of Italy: but if they ſo dyd, than he thought they wolde diſſemble the matter vnto their capitains coming with ſuccours, and afterward forgettyng their promiſe, wolde renewe the warre. Vpon theſe wordes the whole counſayle agreed to the ſaying of M. Valerius Leuinus, who ſayde, that they were to be taken as eſpies, and not as embaſſadours, and that they ſhuld be cōmanded to auoyde Italy, hauyng guides ſente with theim, to conduct theim vnto their ſhyppes. And that word ſhulde be ſente to Scipio, to procede in the warre as he had begunne.
            ¶ Nowe in the meane ſpace, whiles the legates of Scipio and of Carthage, were at Rome, Cn. Octauius, with .ii. C. ſhippes of cariage, and .xxx. other longe ſhippes, to guyde theim, paſſed from Sicilia, to go into Affrica: but the windes were ſo vehement, & the ſtormes ſo importunate, that he with the long ſhyppes, with peyne ſaued hym ſelfe in a porte neere to the mountayn of Apollo. The other hulkes of cariage were driuen to diuers places on the coſte of Affrica, in the ſight of the

men of Carthage. The Carthaginenſes perceyuing this great praye eaſy to be taken, forgettynge theyr deſyre of peace, and alſo the tyme of truſe taken with Scipio (yet mention of them bothe was made to them by certayne of the citie) they by hole aſſente appoynted Aſdruball, with fyfty ſhyppes to gather togither, and to bring home thoſe ſeabeaten & diſparpled ſhippes, with all that was in them. At whoſe comynge the ſhypmenne fled away, leauynge theyr veſſelles: and he without any reſyſtence drewe them with hym to Carthage. Scipio conſidering this theyr acte to be doone, before the legates were returned from Rome, or that they knewe what aunſwere they ſhuld receyue, eyther of warre or of peace. Alſo ſeinge the tyme of truſe was not yet expyred, toke it to be moche more heynous and diſpleaſaunt.
            ¶ Sone after this breake of truſe on the parte of the Carthaginenſes, arryued Lelius and Fuluius, with the legates of Carthage, to whom Scipio, declarynge theyr vntrewe dealynge, cōmaunded them to departe, and he with all ſpede prepared for the warre.
            ¶ This yere folowynge were choſen conſulles, M. Seruilius Geminus, and T. Claudius Nero. Seruilius was apoynted to Hetruria, as his prouynce: and Claudius Nero to Affrica. He had ordeyned fyfty good ſhyppes, wherwith he and his hoſt ſhulde paſſe into Affrica, where he ſhulde be equal ruler with Scipio.
            ¶ NOVVE VVAS Anniball, with his armye, arriued ſafe in Affrica, and by land came to Zama, fyue days iourney from Carthage. From thens ſente he eſpies before hym, to knowe the ſtate of the Romayne campe and armye. Theſe ſpyes by chaunce happed on the ſkoute watche of the Romaynes, and were taken and brought to Scipio. Who demaunded of them the cauſe why theyr capitayne ſent them thyther. They aunſwered, to eſpye and to haue knowlege of his army and order. Then Scipio called certayn of his capitaines, called tribunes, commaundinge them to go with the eſpies of Anniball, and to conducte them throughe all his campe, not fearynge to ſhewe them, what ſo euer they deſyred to ſee: Whan they had gone rounde about a longe ſeaſon, and were brought agayne to him, he demaunded of them, whether they had well, accordinge to theyr myndes, viewed his campe and hoſte. They ſayde ye.

Then ſaid he: Go ye to Anniball, and make to hym relation of that ye haue ſeene. Thus let he them departe, ſendynge with them guides to conduct them out of daunger.
            ¶ The ſpies, whan they came to Anniball, declared vnto him, how Scipio had intreated thē. Beſides that they ſhewed him, that Maſſaniſſa the ſame day was come to Scipio, with .vi. M fotemen, and .iiii. M. horſemen. But there was nothyng, that euer they tolde him, ſo moch abated his courage, as the libertie that he gaue his eſpies, to viewe his order and power. For that great boldenes of his ennemye he iudged and knewe well proceded of ſome great aſſuraunce, that he had in his ſtrength and good order. Wherfore although he him ſelfe was the firſt cauſe and occaſion, bothe of the warre and alſo of the truſe brekinge: yet he deuyſed hym ſelfe, to ſpeake with Scipio, thinkinge before any battayle, whyles his power was not aſſayed, he ſhuld obteine peace with more eaſy conditiōs, then he ſhuld, in caſe it chaunced hym to be ouercome. Wherfore he ſente a meſſanger to Scipio, deſyringe that he myght haue lybertie to ſpeake with him, and that he wolde apoynt a place, where they might come together. Scipio refuſed not to accomplyſſhe his deſyre. The place was apoynted, voyde of al deceite and gile. Thyther came the .ii. moſt noble capitaines of the worlde, hauing onely eche of them one interpretour with him, to declare to eche other, what ſhulde be ſpoken by them. Theyr hoſtes abode a good ſpace from them. When they were come together, either of them was aſtonied with the fyght of the other: So that as perſons amaſed through admiration, they ſpake no worde of a good ſeaſon. At the laſte Anniball began to ſpeake in maner folowynge.
         
         
            ¶ The wytty oration that Anniball made to Scipio, before the battayle betwene them. Cap. lxix.
            IF it be gyuen me by the fatall fortune, that I whiche fyrſt moued this warre againſt the people of Rome, & that ſo many tymes haue had the victorye ouer theim, ſhuld nowe of mine owne voluntary wyll come to be a ſuiter to haue peace: I am glad, that it is thy chance Scipio, to be the man appoynted of the goddes, of whom I ſhulde come to require the ſame peace. And among many other prayſes, that be

gyuen vnto the, this maye be as one of the greateſt: That Anniball, to whome the goddes haue gyuen ſo many victories of the Romaynes, ſhulde nowe gyue place and obey vnto the. So that thou mayſt make an ende of this notable warre, that hath ben betwene vs, as yet more to your loſſe then to ours. Again, what worke is this of fortune, that I whiche fyrſt fought with your father, beinge conſull, in armes, with banners diſplayed, ſhulde nowe come to his ſonne vnarmed, for to ſue for peace? I woulde it had pleaſed the goddes, to haue gyuen ſuche honeſt hertes to our fathers and predeceſſours, that they wolde haue ben contented with the dominion of Affrica, and to your fathers to haue ben contented with the empyre of Rome. For if we make a trewe rekenynge, neyther Sicilia, nor Sardinia, be a worthy recompence of the manyfolde nauyes, armies, and noble Capytaynes, that we haue loſte, throughe our prowde contention. But it is eaſyer to fynde faulte with thynges that be paſſed: then it is to amende the ſame. And for our partes we haue ſo coueted others dominions, that at lengthe we haue ben fayne to fyghte for our owne. We haue for our parte not onelye warred in Italy, but alſo ſo farre aduaunced our hoſte and power, that at the verye gates of Rome ye haue ſene our ſtandardes, and men of armes. And in lyke maner we of Carthage haue ben within the herynge of the noyſe of your Romayne campes and armye. Nowe by your good fortune, communication of peace is hadde betweners, whiche we of reaſon ſhulde leaſte care for: And ye for your partes ſhulde chieflye deſyre. And we nowe intreate thereof, whom it mooſte behoueth to make peace. Conſyderynge that what ſoo euer we two agree vpon, our cities wyll ratyfye and coufyrme. Wherfore there lacketh nothynge in vs, but quyet myndes and peaſable hertes. And for my parte myne age vppon my returne into my cuntreye, frome whenſe I came forthe but yonge, with the tymes ſometyme chaungynge to proſperitie, ſometyme to aduerſytie, haue ſo taught me, that I can be better contented, to followe reaſon then brittell fortune. But I feare greatly, leſte thy youthe and thy perpetuall felicine, ingender in the ſuche a fyerſeneſſe, that thou wylte not regarde quyete counſayle. No man ſhall ſoo aduyſedlye conſyder the vncertayne chaunces of Fortune, as he that hath benne deceyned by Fortune: as I was at the battayle of

Traſymenus and at Cannas, ſo art thou now being but a yong ſouldiour of age, made a capitayne the fyrſte daye. Thou beganſte all thynges with a bolde and a ſtout courage, and fortune neuer fayled the, throughethy deſyre to reuenge thy fathers and thyne vncles deathe (wherby all your familye was almoſte brought to extreme calamitie) thou haſt purchaſed the a noble fame. Thou haſte receyued Spayne, that was before loſt, driuynge from that countrey .iiii. notable armies of the Carthaginenſes, that before dyd poſſeſſe the ſame. Afterwarde being made conſul, when other men lacked hertes to defende Italy, theyr owne countrey, thou tokeſt on the to ſayle into Affrica: where ſleinge two great hoſtes, and in one houre takynge and burninge two riche and ſtronge campes: And after the taking of the mighty kyng Syphax, with many cities and caſtelles of his realme, and of our empire of Carthage: at the laſte thou haſte nowe plucked me frome the poſſeſſion of Italy: whiche theſe .xvi. yeres I haue with ſtronge hande kepte and enioyed. Nowe hauynge all theſe proſperous chaunces, it is lyke, that thy minde may be more deſirous of victory, then of peace. And truely I haue knowen yours and ſuche lyke hertes and courages, to be euer more great and valyaunt, then wyſe and profytable. The daies alſo haue ben, that fortune dyd in lyke maner ſhine bryghte and ſmyle vppon me. But if the goddes wolde gyue vs in proſperitie good and right mindes: we wold not onely conſyder thynges that haue happed, but alſo what mighte happen vnto vs. And ſettynge all other exaumples aparte, I my ſelfe maye be beſt a document of lernyng vnto the, for all kindes of fortune. I had not longe agone mine hoſt encamped betwene the riuer of Amenes and the citie of Rome, and diſplayed my banners before the walles of the citie: Nowe after the loſſe of my two bretherne, which were full good and noble capitaynes, I am here to ſuccour myne owne troubled & ſore vexed countrey, gladde and deſyrous to praye, that myne owne citie maye be delyuered from the daungers, wherwith I aſſayled then your citie. Let no man put to moche confydence in hyghe and ſwellyng fortune. Better it is, and more certain, to be ſure of peace, then to hope for victory. The one thou haſt nowe in thine owne handes: the other is in the hande of the goddes. Put not the felicitie, whiche in many yeres thou haſt 
                  •
               tteigned, into one houres ieoperdy. Call to thy mynde, both

thyne owne power, and the power of fortune: which in warre is common. On bothe partes be men and weapons of warre. And conſyder, that chaunces be varyable in all our affayres, ſpecially in battayle. And in caſe thou vanquiſhe vs in battayle, thou ſhalte not wynne ſo moche glory and profyte, aboue that thou mayſt haue of vs by peace: as thou ſhalte loſe, in caſe fortune turne agaynſte the. For in one houre fortune maye ouerthrow, that in longe ſpace hath ben gotten, and alſo that is loked for, whiche ye truſte to haue. Nowe it is in thy power, to ioyne all thynges to gether by peace P. Cornelius. But if it come to further tryall, we muſte bothe take ſuche fortune as the goddes wyll ſende. Amonge other exaumples of felicitie, Marcus Attilius may be well remembred for one, who arryued here in this ſame countrey of Affrica, and wynning the victorye vppon our forefathes the Carthaginenſes, denyed to graunt them peace, which they inſtantly required of hym. But at the laſt, for that he coulde not meaſure his felicitie, nor moderate Fortune, that ſo hyghly aduaunced hym: therfore his fall was the fowler, by howe moch he was the more hygher eleuate in proſperitie. It belōgeth not to him that aſketh peace, but to hym that gyueth peace, to appoynte the conditions of peace: But we knowlegyng our defaulte, wyl appoynt to ourſelues condigne puniſhemente for the ſame, not refuſynge to leaue vnto you the poſſeſſion of ſuche countreys, for whiche the warre beganne, as Sicilia, Sardinia, Spayne, and all the Iles within the ſea, betwene Italye and Affrica. And we of Carthage, beinge contented with Affrica onelye (ſenſe it hath ſoo pleaſed the goddes) wyll ſuffer you to enioye the Empyre of dyuerſe ſtraunge countreys and dominions, gotten bothe by ſea and by lande. Paraduenture in the aſkynge of peace heretofore ye haue not bene playnelye and iuſtely delte withall, whiche cauſeth you to myſtruſte the faythe and promyſe of the Carthaginenſes. But therin, as touchyng the obſeruynge of peace when it is taken, it is moche to be conſydered, what the perſons be, by whom the peace is required. For as I haue harde it tolde Scipio, your fathers heretofore denyed the Carthaginenſes peace, for that the perſones, that came to intreate therfore, were of ſmall dignitie or eſtimation. But nowe doo I Anniball requyre peace, whiche I woulde not deſyre, onleſſe I thoughte it profytable, and for the ſame

profyt that I do demande it, for the ſame wyll I alſo ſtyll kepe and conſerue it. And as I haue endeuoured my ſelfe, that no man ſhoulde forethynke hym of the warre begunne thorough mine occaſion: in like maner ſhal I nowe enforce my ſelfe, that none ſhal repent of the peace, which I ſhall take. His oration finiſhed, Scipio made him thervnto this aunſwere.
         
         
            ¶ The anſwere of Scipio to the oration of Anniball, with the battaile thervpon had betwene them, wherin Anniball was vanquiſhed and put to flyght. Ca. lxx.
            I Knewe ryght well Anniball, that the truſte of thy comyng home, made the Carthaginenſes to breake the truſe betwene vs taken, and alſo to let all further hope of peace. And this thou doeſt not denye thy ſelfe: but thou nowe withdraweſt from vs all thynges that we requyre, and were alſo graunted in that treatiſe of peace, ſaue onely thoſe countreys, wherof we haue alredy the poſſeſſion. Wherfore as thou doeſt labour, that thy citezens may feele of what burthen they be diſcharged by the: ſo muſt I trauayle, that noo parte of that, whyche they haue promyſed me, ſhall be nowe withdrawen, for to remayne vnto theim as a rewarde of their vntrouth, conſyderyng the ſame theyr vntrouthe, hathe made theim vnwoorthye to haue the conditions of peace before to theim offered. Neyther dyd our father fyrſte make warre for Sicilia, nor we nowe for Spayn: But than the dangier, wherin the Mamertines our frendes and fellowes were put into: and nowe the diſtruction of Sagunt, cauſed vs iuſtly to make warre. That all hath bene by your prouocation, thou haſt cō
               feſſed thy ſelfe. The goddis alſo be witneſſes, who gaue ſuche ende to the firſt warre, as of right it behoued to haue. And in this warre haue gyuen: and I doubt not, but wil giue like end. As for my part, I conſyder well, bothe the infirmitie of man, and the power of fortune: and I know, that all our actes be ſubiect to a. M. chances. But as I do knowlage, that in caſe thou woldiſt haue come to deſire peace of me, before I toke ſo grettrauaile, to come into Affrica, and that thou haddeſt with thy good wil departed with thine army out of Italy: if I had then denied thy requeſte, I might well haue been iudged, to haue wrought proudely and ſtubburnely. Euen ſo now after that I

haue drawē the and thy power home into Affrica, where thou arte redy to make vs reſiſtence: And ſeinge that a peace and truce was ones taken, whiche ye haue broken, taking our ſhippes with force in tyme of truce, and violatinge our embaſſadours: I may ryghte well with honour, byd you prepare for the warre, ſens you could not hold you contented with peace, whan ye had it.
            Thus without any agrement of peace, the .ii. capytaines brake of their communication, and departed euery one to his company, determining to try the matter by battail, and to take ſuche fortune as the goddis wolde gyue theim.
            ¶ As ſoone as they were come into their campes, they openly on bothe partes gaue commaundement to their ſouldiours, to make them redy to fyght now theyr laſt battaile, wherby in cas they dyd ouercome, they ſhulde haue felicitie, not for one day, but for euer. For before the next nyght, they ſhuld know, whether Rome or Carthage ſhuld haue the ſuperioritie. And that not onely of Italye or of Affrica: but of all the worlde, whiche ſhulde be a rewarde nowe to hym, that ſhuld haue the victory. On the contrary part, the peryll and ieoperdye was no leſſe declared to that part, whiche ſhulde haue the worſe in this battayle. For the Romaynes hadde no place, whether to flye, beinge in a ſtraunge countrey. And to Carthage muſte nedes come an vtter diſtruction, in caſe this their laſt army of refuge were vanquiſhed or ouerthrowen.
            ¶ In this great ieopardy on the next day the .ii. valyant capitaynes of the two moſt noble and rycheſt people, ſette furthe with their .ii. myghty armies: intendynge that day, eyther to increaſe the honour, whiche before they had gotten, or els to be ouerthrowen and loſe all. Hoope and feare were myngled bothe togyther in theyr myndes. And whan they ſawe theyr owne battaile, and the battayle of their ennemies: they conceiued in their myndes both ioye and ſorowe. And that that the ſouldiours fayled to remembre, theyr capitaines declared vnto theim, with greate warnynges and exhortations. Anniball reherſed to his people all theyr actes done in Italy: how many Romayne capytaynes, and howe many armyes they hadde ſlayne. Scipio ſhewed his conqueſtes in Spayne, and alſo of late in Affrica, with the confeſſyon of his ennemyes, that they for feare were conſtrayned to requyre peace: although

theyr vntrouth wold not ſuffre theim to kepe the ſame, whan they had it. Wherfore he geſſed, that the goddis had appointed theim to fyght in this bataile, with lyke ſucceſſe and lucke, as they had whā they fought at the yle of Egates. Now (ſayd he) all warre & trauayle is at an end. The ſpoyle of Carthage is euen at hande, after whyche ye ſhall retourne home in to your countreye, to youre parentes, your wyues, your chylderne, and your owne goodes. Theſe comfortable woordes he ſette furthe, with ſuche geſture of his bodye, and merye countenaunce, as though he hadde al redy hadde the vyctory of his ennemies. Afterward he putte his men in order. Firſt his ſpearemen, than his chiefe and mooſte aſſured footemen, not in greate multitudes togyther before any ſtandarde, but in ſmalle bandes, whyche ſhoulde be a certayne ſpace diſtaunt the one from the other, to the intent the elephantes of theyr ennemyes myghte come betweene the ſayde bandes, and be receyued of theim, without breakynge any arraye. In theſe voyde ſpaces betweene the ſayde bandes, he appoynted dyuers of his lyghteſt harneyſed ſouldiours to ſtande, to fulfyll the voyde places, commaundynge theim, that whan the elephantes preſſed on theim, that they ſhuld recule behynde the ſayd bandes, whyche were in array, or els to ſteppe in among thoſe that went before the ſtanderdes, on their right hande, or on their left hand, giuing way to the vnruly beaſtis to entre amonge his men, where with weapons they myght be wounded and ouerthrowen. The lefte wynge ledde Lelius with the Italyan horſemen. The ryghte wynge ledde Maſſaniſſa with his Numidians.
            ¶ Anniball on the other part, in the forefront of his battaile, ſette his elephantes, whyche were to the numbre of .lxxx. After whome he put in ordre all ſuche nations as were hyred, or came to his ſuccour, as Liguriens, Frenchemen, and men of the Iles named Baleares, now called Maiorque and Minorque, myngled amonge a great numbre of Moores. In the ſeconde battaile he ſette his Carthaginenſes, with the Affricanes, and the legion of the Lacedemonians, ſent thither to the ſuccours of the Carthaginenſes from Philip kyng of Macedome. And within a lyttell ſpace of from theim, he placed the Italians, which cam with him, whan he left that cuntrey. The winges wer of horſemen. The left winge helde the Numidian

horſemen. The right wynge was of the Carthaginenſes. In this hoſte of Annibal wer men of diuers nations & cuntreis, of diuers tunges and langages, they were alſo different in lawes, armour, and in aparaile. To euery one of theſe he gaue ſundry and diuers exhortations, either of feare, or of comfort. To ſuche as were come to his ſuccours he promyſed great rewarde of the pray, whiche ſhulde be wonne by their induſtry and trauaile. To the Liguriens he promiſed a plentiful reward of the fertile and pleaſaunt fieldes in Italy. The Moores and Numidians he exhorted to do well, for feare leſte they ſhulde els be in greuous ſeruitude of Maſſaniſſa. The Frenchemenne wer ſet on by the naturall hatred, which they bare to the Romaynes. The Carthaginenſes he put in remembrance to fight for the walles of their naturall cuntrey, for their propre goodes, for the ſepulchres of their elders, for their children, their parentes and trembling wiues. There is no meane way (ſayde he) now to be put betwene hope and feare. For either muſt we ſuffre miſerable ſeruitude, after the diſtruction of our citie and cuntrey, orels obteine the empire of all the worlde.
            ¶ By that tyme this noble capitayn had finyſhed his wordes: the Romaynes blewe vp theyr trumpettes and hornes, makynge ſo terrible a noyſe and clamour, that a greate numbre of the elephantes, beinge furyouſe, tourned backe vppon theyr companye, ſpecially vppon the lefte wynge of the Moores and Numidians. Whiche perceyued well Maſſaniſſa, wherefore he alſo inuaded the ſame wing with his horſemen, putting theim to ſuche feare, that they fledde, leauynge that ſyde of the hoſte bare of ſuccour. Dyuers of the elephantes by force wer conſtrained to entre the myddle battaile, to whome anone the lyght armed ſouldiours gaue place, ſuffryng theim to entre among theim, where they were thruſt in with ſpeares & innelyns, ſo that many were there ſlain. During this while, Lelius with his horſmen aſſailed the right wing of the horſmē of Carthage, puttig thē alſo to ſlight: ſo that the body of the hoſt was of both ſides left without defence of horſmē, the winges being chaſed away: thā began the battel of fotemen to be ſtrōg on both partes. Great wer the cries that wer there made: but the Romans wer of better corage, of ſtronger hope, & of more ſtrēgth. wherfore in a ſhort ſpace, they cauſed their enmies to giue back a certain ſpace of groūd. And whā thei had ons gotē
               
ſome grounde, they with theyr ſhyeldes and targettes came ſtill thruſting on theyr ennemies, bearing them backe, tyl ſome ſone after the fyrſte battayle, tourninge theyr backes, began to flie, and came to the ſecond battayle of the Carthaginenſes and Moores, who wolde not ſuffer them to entre, leſte they ſhulde cauſe all theyr arraye to be broken. Wherfore betwene them and theyr owne fellowes began great debate and ſlaughter: ſoo that the Carthaginenſes were conſtrayned to fyghte, bothe with theyr owne vnruly felowes, and alſo with the Romaynes theyr ennemies. Neuertheleſſe they wolde in no wyſe receyue theyr felowes that fledde in amonge them, leſte they ſhulde mengle that fearefull ſorte, whiche in the flyghte were hurte and wounded, amonge them that were earneſtly bent to fight: Whiche myght haue turned moche more to theyr dyſpleaſure. But dryuing them away by heapes, compelled them to go to gether, ſome into the one ſide of theym, ſome abrode the fieldes. Great was the occiſion that was made of them, in ſo moche that the Romaynes coulde not come to fyghte with the Carthaginenſes: but fyrſte they muſte with peyne go ouer the dead bodies of them that were ſlayne. Then Scipio cauſed a troumpet to be blowen, to withdrawe his men of the firſt battayle, who had ben ſore traueyled, and many of them were ſore wounded. Theſe cauſed he to ſtand behinde the rereward, and made the ſame rerewarde of his beſt men to auaunce forewarde vpon the Carthaginenſes. Then beganne the battayle newe agayne: whiche was very ſore and fierſe. For then came the Romaynes to the moſt aſſured and ſtrongeſt men, and moſt expert in warres, who before beinge vanquiſhed twyſe, were nowe lothe and aſhamed to be vanquiſhed. But the Romaynes were farre moin noumbre, and had taken to them a great courage, by dryuinge awaye bothe the wynges, and alſo the forewarde of theyr ennemies.
            ¶ Whyles they thus foughte in the ſeconde battayle, Lelius and Maſſaniſſa returned with theyr horſemen from the chaſe of the wynges of the Carthaginenſes: and with all their power and violence came on the backes of the ſeconde battayle of the Carthaginenſes, whiche were buſy and valiauntly fought. Then were they not able to endure theyr violence, but were with force put to flyght and ſlayne on all partes. There were that day ſlayne and taken of the Carthaginenſes aboute .xl. M

men. Many elephantes, and many ſtandardes of noble men were taken in that battayll. Great alſo was the praye of the ſpoyle founde in the Campe, which all the Romanes toke and brought to their ſhippes. The Romaynes alſo loſt at this battayle aboue .x. M. men. Anniball, with a fewe with him, fledde to Adrument: But he neuer departed from the field, til he had bothe in the battayle and before, aſſayed to do aſmoche as was poſſyble for to be done, for the ſafegard of his people. Wherin he that day had prayſe bothe of Scipio, & of al other expert men of warre of the Romains: ſpecially for the ordering of his battayl. For fyrſt he ſet in the forefront his great nomber of elephantes, whoſe gret ſtrength and intollerable violence ſhuld breke the arraye of the Romaines, putting them out of order, whyche is halfe the wynnynge of a battail. Then ſet he foremoſt his hyred ſouldiours of diuers nations: to the intent ſuch a confuſed nombre of ſtrangers (who fought for no great faith or loue, but onely for money) ſholde haue no place nor tyme to flee from the battayle. Alſo to the intent ſuche ſtrangers ſhuld endure the fyrſt violence of his ennemies, makyng them wery and weake, before his chiefe men of moſt truſt ſhould haue any thyng to do. Then after theim were his Carthaginenſes and Affricans, his moſt truſtie ſouldiours. Laſt of al a good ſpace behinde theim, he placed his Italiens, as people whome he knew not wel, whether they ſhuld be his friendes or his foes. Thus when all his pollicie wolde not ſerue hym, nor yet his ſtrengthe coulde helpe, he fledde (as I ſayd before) to Adrument: and from thenſe he was ſent for to come to Carthage.
            Whyther he came the .xxxvi. yere after his departynge from thenſe, beinge but a chylde. There in the open aſſemble of the noble men of the citie he confeſſed hym ſelfe to be vanquiſhed; and that there was none other hope of ſafegarde for them, but by obteyninge of peace.
         
         
            ¶ The conditions of peace graūted to the Carthaginenſes by Scipio: and the ratyfyeng of the ſame by the ſenate. Ca. lxxi.
            AS Scipio and his hoſte were comynge to his ſhippes, laden with a ryche praie, worde was brought hym, that P. Lentulus was arriued at Vtica, with .l. ſhippes of warre, and an .C. hulkes laden with all maner of prouiſion.
            
               
Wherfore Scipio, thynkinge to put the citie of Carthage in feare on al partes: Fyrſt ſent Lelius to Rome, to beare newes of his victory. And then ſent Cn. Octauius by lande towarde Carthage, with his army of horſemen and fotemen. Whiles he, takyng with hym bothe the newe nauy of ſhyppes, brought hym by Lentulus, and alſo his olde nauye, wente by ſea from Vtica towardes the hauen of Carthage. He had but a whyle ſailed on the ſea, when a ſhippe of Carthage met hym, couered all with white lynnen clothe, and full of bowes of Oliue, in token of peace. In whiche ſhippe were .x. embaſſadours of the prynces of Carthage, ſente by the mynde of Anniball to deſyre peace. When this ſhyppe was come to the fore parte of Scipiosſhip, the coueringe was taken awaye, and the legates ryght humbly required hym to extende his mercy and pitie vpon them. But other aunſwere had they none giuen them, but that they ſhoulde come to hym to Tunes, for to that place he ſayde he wolde remoue his campe. With this aunſwere they departed: and he wente with his nauy of ſhippes before Carthage, partely to viewe the ſituation of the towne, partely to make the inhabitantes ther of the more afraide. But after ſmal ſoiourninge there, he departed frome thenſe, and returned to Vtica: And from thenſe was goinge to Tunes, when ſodeine newes wer brought him, that Vermina, the ſonne of Syphax, with a great numbre of horſemen and fotemen, was comyng to the ſuccours of the Carthaginenſes. To encountre with theſe people, Scipio incontinent ſente a good parte of the fotemen of his hoſt, and all his horſemen, who metynge with theim, at theyr fyrſte reencountre put them to flyght, and ſtoppinge the paſſages, wherby they myght by fleinge eſcape, they ſlewe of the Numidiens .xv. M. and toke aboue .xii. C. with many horſes of that countrey, to the numbre of xv. C. and with peyne the capitayne hym ſelfe eſcaped, hauynge a ſmall numbre with hym. From thenſe the campe was pytched at Tunes, in the olde place, where they before had ſet it. Thyther came .xxx. noble men of Carthage embaſſadours, ſent vnto Scipio, who with moche more lamentation then the other had done before, required peace of Scipio, conſtrained more therunto through the contrarietie of Fortune, and by the late ouerthrow of their friende Vermina: And they were lykewiſe herde with leſſe pitie, bicauſe of theyr late vntruthe and rebellion. In ſo moche

that it was thought by moſte men, that the citie of Carthage myghte then iuſtely and worthely be deſtroyed by theim. And ſo had it ben in dede, had not one thynge ſpecially moued Scipio to the contrarye. Whiche was, that the newe conſull was comynge thyther, whoſe deſyre was, to haue the honour and fame of that victory, and of fyniſhinge that warre, whiche was before achieued by Scipios traueile, to his great daungier. And for this cauſe Scipio and his counſaylours wer fully minded to take peace with the Carthaginenſes. Wherefore the nexte day he called the legates of Carthage before him, greatly rebukinge them of the vntrewth to him diuers times ſhewed: Wyllynge theim nowe at the laſt, beinge taughte by good experience, to regarde bothe theyr goddes and theyr othes, and ſhewinge them, that he, hauing pitie of the deſtruction of theim and of theyr ſoo noble a citie, was contented to graunte them peace vpon theſe conditions. Fyrſte, that they ſhoulde lyue free after theyr owne lawes and cuſtomes, enioyinge all ſuche cities and townes in Affrica, as they hadde in poſſeſſion before the warre betwene theim taken. And that frome that daye forthe, the Romaynes ſhulde no more deſtroye or ſpoyle any parte therof. Agayne, the Carthaginenſes ſhulde reſtore to the Romaynes all ſuche perſons as were fled and runne away from the Romayns, and all the priſoners of the Romains, and theyr friendes, whom they had in captiuite. Alſo that they ſhoulde delyuer theim all theyr ſhyppes of warre, and other ſhyppes, excepte onely galeys, hauynge thre orders of oores in a piece. And that they ſhoulde alſo delyuer vp all theyr elephantes, whiche were alredye tamed and made apte for the warre: neyther ſhulde they after tame any moo. Agayne, that they ſhoulde moue no warre in Affrica, nor withoute Affrica, but by the lycence or commaundemente of the Romaynes. Furthermore, that they ſhulde reſtore vnto Maſſaniſſa all ſuche thynges as they hadde taken of his, makynge a peace and agrement with hym. And alſo yelde vnto the Romayne hoſte wheate and wages vnto the return of the legates from Rome. Beſydes all this, they ſhulde paye .x. M. talentes of ſyluer in fyftye yeres: durynge whiche tyme, they ſhulde yerely paye that ſumme, deuyded in euen portions. For the paymente wherof, and perfourmaunce of theſe condytions, they ſhoulde delyuer hym an .C. pledges of his owne election. Wherof

none ſhuld be vnder thage of .xiiii. yeres, neither aboue thage of .xxx. Vpon theſe conditions, he agreed to giue them truce: ſo that they wolde delyuer to him out of hand all ſuche hulkes or ſhyppes of burthen, with their fraught and implementes, which the Carthaginenſes toke from theim, duringe the laſte tyme of truſe, that he had before graunted theim: Or elles they ſhulde neither loke for truſe nor for peace.
            ¶ Whan the legates were come to Carthage, they were cō
               maunded to declare the ſame conditions of peace openly before the congregation of the people therevnto aſſembled. Againſt which conditions one Gyſgo, a noble man of Carthage, ſpake very ſore, and wold haue diſſuaded the people from the taking of peace. To whoſe ſayinges many of the vnruly multitude gaue good audience. But Annibal, being therwith greatly moued, went to him, and with force drewe him downe from his place. Which his violent facion had not bene vſed before in that citie, and was thought of dyuers to be contrary to the libertie of their citie: where before all people had free libertie to ſpeake their opinions: Annibal being vſed to the facion of the warres, more than to the peaſible vſe of the citie: remembrynge the liberties therof, excuſed his rudeneſſe in this maner. Whan I departed from this citie, I was but .ix. yeres olde, whiche is nowe .xxxvi. yeres agone: during which time I haue ſufficiently knowen and been inſtructed in all feates of warre, beinge taught by the chaunces of fortune, euen frome my chyldehoode. Wherfore beynge diſvſed ſoo longe ſpace frome the lawes, maners, and cuſtomes of the citie, although I doo forgette the liberties and vſes therof, I am the leſſe to be blamed. Thus after he hadde excuſed his folye, he perſwaded the people to the takynge of peace, and howe neceſſary it was nowe for theim, and alſo howe reaſonable the conditions were, conſyderynge theyr preſente eſtate. To whiche his perſwaſions the greatteſt parte of the multiude agreed, and the reſiſters agaynſte it, were greately blamed. The greateſt doubte was, howe they myghte make reſtitution of that that was taken frome the Romaynes in the tyme of truce. For all was ſpoyled and goone, neyther knewe they, who badde theym, onely the ſhyppes and hulkes remaygned. But in concluſyon, worde was ſent agayne to Scipio, by the ſame legates, that they wold receyue his conditions of peace.

And where they coulde not knowe, who had the goodes that wer in the hulkes: they wold pay therfore at his owne iudgement. The veſſels and men ſhulde be reſtored.
            ¶ Thus was the truce gyuen to the citie of Carthage for thre monethes, with a commaundement, that duryng the time of truce, they ſhulde ſende embaſſadours to no place, but only to Rome. And in caſe that any embaſſadours were ſent frome any place to Carthage, that they ſhuld in no wyſe depart from thens, vntyll the Romayne capitayne were aſcertayned what they were, and what was the cauſe of theyr comming.
            ¶ Soone after went the legates of Carthage to Rome: with whom were ſent C. Veturius Philo, M. Martius Valla, and Lucius Scipio, brother to P. Scipio the Romayn capytayn.
            ¶ When they were come thyther, L. Veturius Philo declared, howe Scipio hadde foughten with Anniball, and ouercome the Carthaginenſes, to theyr vtter confuſyon, makynge nowe an ende of the dolefull longe warre, that had been betwene the Romaynes and theim. And that alſo Vermina, the ſonne of Syphax, with his power, was beaten and ouercome. Of whyche newes the ſenatours beinge meruaylous ioyfull, commaunded hym to publyſſhe the ſame gladde tydynges, to the whole multitude of the citezens. Who makynge greatte ioye, gaue thankes for the vyctory to the goddis. Than wer the legates of Carthage broughte into the ſenate. And whan the ſenatours behelde the age, the dignitie, and the grauitie of the ambaſſadours (who were of the mooſte noble menne of the citie of Carthage) than they iudged, that they intended playnely and ſyncerely to intreate of peace. Amonge other of theſe nobles of Carthage, there was one Aſdruball, called Hedus, one of the chiefe of theim, bothe in auctoritie and in nobilitie: who was euer deſyrous of peace, and held moche agaynſte Anniball and his affinitie. This Aſdruball ſayde, that a fewe couetous perſonnes of the citie were culpable for this warre, and not the comminaltie. Some faultes, whyche were layde to theym, he excuſed: ſome other he confeſſed, leſte by the denying of all, he myght be the worſe hearde of the ſenate. Than he perſwaded the Senatours to vſe theyr proſperous fortune gentylly, and in due temperance, profeſſynge euer, that in caſe the Carthaginenſes would haue folowed the myndes of hym, and of Hanno, takynge the

tyme whan it was offered: that they had beene the gyuers to other of peace, vppon ſuche conditions as they were nowe gladde to take at others handes. But (ſayde he) it is but ſeldome ſene, that good fortune and a good mynd be gyuen both at ones to men. The cauſe of the conqueſtes of you Romains euer chiefly hath been, for that in proſperitie ye haue had the remembrance to conſulte of thynges to come. And your empyre hath bene more encreaſed by gentylnes and fauour ſhewed to nations, whom ye haue vanquyſhed, than it hath bene by the victories gotten on theim.
            ¶ After that Aſdruball had finyſſhed his oration, the other ambaſſadours made moche more lamentable propoſitions, bewayling the miſerable fall of the ſtate of the Carthaginenſes, who being the greatteſt lordes in honour of the worlde, were nowe conſtrayned to abyde encloſed within the walles of the citie, hauyng nothing els, that they myghte clayme propretie of. ye and that ſame only citie they helde, but vpon the goodnes and forbearyng of the Romaynes, whiles theyr pleaſure was, to forbere the vtter diſtruction therof. With theſe humble and gentyll woordes, the ſenatours vniuerſally were fully inclyned to peace. Than one of the ſenatours ſpake out with loude voyce: If peace be graunted to the Carthaginenſes, by what goddis ſhall they ſweare, and make peace, whan they haue broken promiſe, and deceiued the goddis, by whom they ſware, whan they laſte toke peace with vs: To whom the ſayd Aſdruball anſwered, euen by the ſame goddis wyll we ſweare, who be ſo angry, and are reuenged on vs, that brake oure laſte truſe and leage. Herevpon all the ſenatours and the comons, being inclyned to peace, determined, that by thaduiſe of .x. legates of Rome, P. Scipio ſhulde make with theim the peace, vpon ſuche conditions as to him ſemed beſt. The legates wer named, and made theim redy to depart with the Carthaginenſes. For the whiche the ambaſſadours gaue greate thankes to the ſenate, of theyr goodnes to theim ſhewed: deſyryng them before their departyng, to licence theim to entre the citie, and to viſite certayne of their frendes and kynneſmen, that were kepte in the citie, as priſoners. whiche requeſte was graunted theim. And they deſyred alſo, that they myght redeme diuers of theim vpon reaſonable raunſom. They were cōmaunded to write the names of ſuche as they wolde haue redeemed. And

they named .ii. C. of theim, who incontinent were delyuered to the x. legates, to take with theim into Affrica to Scipio, wyllyng him, in caſe the peace went forwardes with the Carthaginenſes: that then he ſhoulde rendre theſe .ii. C. pryſoners to the Carthaginenſes, free without payinge any raunſome. Theſe thynges beynge ſo concluded, the Carthaginenſes, with the Romayne legates, departed towardes Affrica. And whan they cam to Scipio they concluded the peace with hym vppon the conditions before ſpecified. The ſhyppes of Carthage, the elephantes, the fugitiues and priſoners, to the numbre of .iiii. M. were delyuered to Scipio: among whome was one Terentius Culleo, a notable ſenator of Rome. The ſhyppes, vpon the deliuerie of theim, were had furth into the ſea, to the numbre of .v. C. of al ſortes: and there by the commaundement of Scipio were ſet all on fyre. Which bourninge was as ſorowfull a ſyght to the Carthaginenſes, as if they had ſene the whole citie of Carthage on fyre.
         
         
            ¶ Scipio teturneth to Rome with greate triumphe and ioye of all the people. Cap. lxxii.
            THus ended the warres betwene the Romaynes and the Carthaginenſes, more gentylly than it was thoughte it ſhulde haue done. For Scipio dyuers tymes after reported, that the conctouſe and hyghe mynde, fyrſt of Claudius Nero, and after of Cu. Cornelius, deſyrynge both the honoure of the vyctorye of Carthage, was the cauſe, that the citie of Carthage was not vtterly diſtroyed and waſted. After the ſayde peace thus taken, the money, whyche ſhulde be preſently payde to the Romaynes, was very greuous to the Carthaginenſes. Whoſe ſtocke and common ſubſtaunce was before greatly waſted, by reaſon of the longe contynuall warres. Wherefore at the leuyinge of the ſayde ſumme of theyr pryuate ſubſtaunce, greate lamentation and wepinge was made in the citie. Whiche Anniball beholdynge, coulde not forbeare to laugh. Wherat Aſdruball Hedus toke great indignation, rebukynge hym, for that he (beynge the verye origynall cauſe of al theyr ſorowe) in the common mournyng of the citie, ſhulde ſo laugh. Thervnto Anniball aunſwered: If ye myghte beholde the inwarde thoughte of my mynde,

as ye maye the outwarde apparent countenaunce of my face, ye ſhulde parceiue this laughter not to come of any ioy of the herte, but of a madneſſe and a freneſie. Neuer the leſſe this my laughter is not ſo inordinate, nor cometh not ſo out of time, as your teares do. For you ſhuld haue wept, when your armour was taken frō you, and your ſhippes burned before your eies: and when your libertie of makinge of warres with any ſtraunger (but onely by lycence of the Romaynes) was taken frome you. wherin reſted your chiefe vndoinge and greatteſt falle. But ye fele no hurte, oneleſſe it touche your priuate welthe. The great hurte of the common welthe ye neyther fele nor regarde. When your ennemies had the greate ſpoyle, after the vyctorie had, and when Carthage remayned alone, and naked without armour or defence, among ſo many armed men of Affrica: Then no man wepte nor mourned. But nowe, when ye muſt pay the tribute of your owne priuate goodes: euery man wepeth, as ye wolde do at the burienge of all your friendes. I feare it ſore, that ye ſhall ſhortly perceyue, that ye wepte now in your leaſte harmes, and the worſt to be behinde.
            ¶ When the peace was thus cōcluded, betwen the Romains and the Carthaginenſes, Scipio, calling his people together, beſides that he reſtored vnto Maſſaniſſa his fathers kyngedome: He alſo gaue him the citie of Cyrtha, and other townes and groundes that he had wonne of Syphax. Afterwarde he cauſed Cn. Octauius, to delyuer to Cn. Cornelius, the newe conſull, his nauy that he brought into Sicilia. Then cauſed he the embaſſadours of Carthage to go towardes Rome, there to haue all thinges confirmed by the auctoritie of the Senate, whiche he by the auctoritie of the Romayne legates had before concluded with them.
            ¶ Thus all thynges beinge at peace, both by ſea and by lande, he with his army toke ſhippynge, and ſayled ouer into Sicilia, and from thenſe into Italye: where he was met by the men of the countrey with great honour and ioye: ſo gladde was euery man bothe of peace and of victorye. The poore men of the townes and cities by the waye, as he went towarde Rome, ran forthe to ſe hym, and to prayſe hym. Thus in greate honour came be into Rome, where he was receiued into the citie with mooſte noble triumphe. After that he enryched the citie with greate ſ
                  •
               mmes of golde and ſyluer, of the prayes that he had

taken, beſyde that he diſtributed amonge his ſouldiours .xl. M. li. And of the conqueſt, whiche he had made in Affrica, he was called Scipio Affricanus euer after, to the great honour of all his familie and ſucceſſion.
         
         
            ¶ Anniball fleith by ſea to Antiochus kynge of Siria, Antiochus moueth warre to the Romaynes, L. Cornelius Scipio ſayleth into Aſia, fyghteth with Antiochus, vanquiſheth hym, graunteth hym peace vpon conditions, and returneth to Rome. Cap. lxxiii.
            AFter the warres thus ended in Affrica, the Carthaginenſes continued in peace a certayne ſeaſon. At the laſt the ennemies of Annibal, to worke him diſpleaſure, ſent worde to Rome to the ſenate, that Anniball had pryuely ſente meſſangers and letters to Antiochus the kynge of Siria, mouynge hym, to warre with the Romaynes. And alſo that meſſangers were ſente with letters ſecretely from Antiochus to Anniball. Certifieng them further, that the mynde of Annibal was ſuche, that he coulde neuer be contented, till he harde the ſounde of harneis vpon mennes backes. The Romaynes beinge angry therat, ſent legates thither, C. Seruilius, Claudius Marcellus, and Terentius Culleo, to try, whether the information to them made, were true or no: Commanding them, to publiſhe abrode, that the cauſe of theyr coming was, to here and determine certaine matters in controuerſie, which wer betwene the Carthaginēſes & the king Maſſaniſſa, & none other.
            ¶ This tale publiſhed by them, was beleued to be true of the common people. But Anniball therwith could not be blinded. He knewe full well, that he onely was the cauſe of theyr comminge. Wherfore thynkinge for a ſeaſon to gyue place, till the time might better ſerue hym. He with .ii. other departed oute of the citie in the begynninge of the night, in a ſtraungers apparaile, and came to a place: where he before had apointed his horſes to mete him, and from thenſe with ſpede he wente to a caſtell of his owne by the ſea ſyde, where a ſhip of Italy awaited for hym, apoynted for the ſame purpoſe. In whiche ſhyp he ſayled from Affrica, and arriued the ſame day in the Ile of Circyna, makynge more dole all the way for the harde chaunces that were happed to his countreye, then he dydde for his

owne euyll fortune. In the hauen of Circyna he founde many ſhyppes laden with marchaundyſe, and at his landinge, greate reſorte of people of the ile came vnto hym, ſalutynge hym, and makynge of his comynge great ioye. Anniball fearynge, leſte ſome of thoſe ſhippes in the nyght ſhuld departe from the hauen, and ſhewe in Affrica, that they had ſene hym in Circyna: He deuiſed to make a ſolemne ſacrifice, and a great feaſt, to the which he badde al the maiſters of the ſhyppes that were in the hauen, and all the marchauntes that were in the ſame. And for that the wether was very hot (being about the middes of ſommer) he cauſed al the ſailes of the ſhips, with the croſſe maſtes, wherunto the ſayles be faſtened, to be all broughte on lande. W
                  •
               erwith he made pauilions and bowres, to defende theym from the vehement heate of the ſonne, whyle they ſouped on the ſhore. The feaſt was ſumptuous, as the tyme might ſerue therto, and was kept very ſolempnely. There was wine great plenty, wherwith many were drunken and heuy headed. The bankette was alſo purpoſely prolonged, tyll it was farre in the nyght. Then fell the marchauntes a ſlepe, with the maryners alſo. Whiche Anniball eſpienge, thoughte he had then good tyme to mocke them, and takynge his ſhyppe, ſecretly departed, leauynge them faſte on ſlepe. On the morowe, when the maryners aroſe with heuy heades, they caryed theyr ſayles and other tackelinges agayne to the ſhyppes, preparynge all thynges redy. But or they myght bryng al to paſſe, they ſpent a good parte of the nexte daye.
            ¶ On the morowe after the departyng of Anniball from Carthage, his friendes, that vſually reſorted to his company, after that they coulde not fynde hym, nor here of hym, they gathered a great multitude of the citie together in the market place, inquiringe, if any newes coulde be ſhewed of the chiefe ruler of theyr citie. Some coniectured, that he was fledde away for feare of his conſpiracie againſte the Romaynes. Some other ſayde, that the Romaynes had by ſome crafty traine conſpired his deathe. Thus dyuerſe were the tales, accordynge to the diuerſitie of ſectes that were in the citie. Tydynges ſone after was brought thyther, that he was ſene at Circyna. Than the Romayne legates openly in the ſenate of Carthage, founde greate lacke, and blamed greately the citezens and rulers, for ſuffryng hym to departe, conſyderynge the priuie letters and

meſſages that were ſente betwene him and Antiochus, ſaying. That he wolde neuer be ſatiſfyed, tyll he hadde moued warre throughe all the worlde. The Carthaginenſes excuſed theym ſelues, affyrmynge, that they were nothyng priuie nor conſentynge to his departynge.
            ¶ Now was Annibal arriued at Tyrus, where he was receyued honorably, and with great ioy: and there he ſoiourned certaine daies. From thenſe he ſayled to Antioche, and after that to Epheſus, where he founde the king Antiochus: who was in great doubte before his comynge, in what maner he ſhulde mainteygne his warres againſt the Romayns. The kyng was greatly comforted by the meane of his coming, and alſo by the beinge there of the embaſſadours of the Etholiens: whoo the ſame tyme wer departed from the amitie of the Romaines. He was determined to moue warre: for agree wolde he not to certaine conditions of peace, that the Romaines preſcribed vnto him. Whiche he thought ſhuld be greatly to the loſſe both of his honour and alſo of his dominions. For they wold haue cauſed hym to leaue the poſſeſſion of certayne cities, that he had. And alſo that he ſhuld not medle in Grece: but how and where he ſhulde moue this warre, he was not determyned. Anniball was greatly in his fauour, and chieifly for that he thought him an expert man & a mete counſaylour in his affayres agaynſt the Romaynes. Anniball euer was of the opinion, that he ſhulde make warre in Italy, for that the countrey of Italy is able to furnyſhe an army of vitayles and all thynges neceſſary, and alſo of ſouldiours, if he ſhulde haue nede of men of armes at any tyme. But (ſayde he) if no warre be moued in Italy, ſoo that the Romaynes maye haue all the hole power therof, to make warre in other regions out of Italy: then is there no prynce nor nation of the worlde able to withſtande the Romaynes.
            Wherfore if ye wyll delyuer vnto me one .C. of ſhyppes of warre, and .xvi. thouſande fotemenne, with one thouſande of horſemen: I wyll with that power ſayle into Affrica, truſting to cauſe the Carthaginenſes to rebel agaynſte the Romaynes. Or in caſe they wyll not folowe my requeſt: yet wyll I inuade ſome part of Italy, and moue warre to the Romaynes. Then maye you (ſayde he to the kyng) with all the reſt of your power, ſayle into Europe, kepynge your armye in Grece, redy to ſet forwardes as ye ſe cauſe.
            
               
¶ This his counſeyle was well allowed of the kinge: wherevppon one Ariſton, an Epheſien, a wyſe and a truſtie manne, was choſen to ſayle to Carthage, to the friendes of Anniball, with priuie and ſpeciall tokens by mouthe, whiche they knewe wer true and not feyned, to ſhewe vnto theim his purpoſe. For writinge durſte he ſende none, for feare of takynge of the meſſangers. His meſſage onely was to be declared vppon credence.
            ¶ But whyle Aryſton went on his meſſage, and therin hadde no good ſpede: the ambaſſadours of Rome were come to Epheſus, to knowe of Antiochus, the cauſe why he intended ſuche warre agaynſt the Romaynes, among whiche ambaſſadours it was ſayd that P. Scipio, called Affricanus was one. Whiche ambaſſadours hauyng knowledge, that the kyng Antiochus was a lyttell before gone agaynſte the Piſidians, and fyndyng Annibal there: they diuers times reſorted vnto him, and had familyar communication with him: onely to the intent to make him haue a good opinion of the Romaynes, and not to myſtruſte, that any thyng was intended by theym agaynſte him. Among other communication betwen the ambaſſadours and Annibal, it is remembred, that Scipio demaunded of him, whome he iudged to be the moſt noble capitayne, that euer he knewe or hearde of. To whome Anniball aunſwered, that it was Alexander of Macedony: for that he with a ſmal power ouercame ſo many nations, and vanquiſhed ſo many greate armies in battayle, traueylynge ſo many ſtraunge and farre cuntreis, whiche paſſed the power and witte of mannes cumpaſſe. Then Scipio demaunded of hym, whom he iudged to be the ſeconde moſt noble capytayn. He aunſwered, Pyrrbus, which was the moſt wyſe and expert man in placinge his campes, in fortifieng his fortreſſes with watche and ward, and in getting the hertes of men vnto his obeyſaunce. In ſoo muche, that when he warred in Italye, the Italyens were gladder to be vnder his gouernaunce, beynge but a ſtraungyer, then vnder the dominion and power of the Romaynes. Then demaunded Scipio, whome he thoughte to be the thyrde: Withoute fayle (ſayde he) it is my ſelfe. At whych aunſwere Scipio laughed, and ſayde: What wouldeſt thou then haue ſayd, in caſe thou haddeſt ouercome me in battayle, as I haue done the? Treuly (ſayde Anniball) then woulde I haue putte myſelfe before bothe Alexander and Pyrrhus alſo. This aunſwere

ſeemed to Scipio very ſtraunge and proude, whereby he mynded to take from Scipio al his glory.
            ¶ Durynge this longe taryenge of the Romayne legates at Epheſus, nothynge els was wrought, but that the often metynge and communication of theym with Anniball, made the kynge more to ſuſpecte and myſtruſt him. Whervpon he was no more called to his councel.
            ¶ Agayn, one Thoas an Etholien, deſirous to haue the kyng, with all his power, to arryue in Grece, withoute partynge of the ſame his ſtrengthe, ſayde vnto hym: Syr, the greatte citie Demetrias, and the more part of all the cities in Grece, loke daylye for your commynge thyther. And agaynſte your arryuayle, ye ſhall ſee all the countreye aſſemble on the ſeaſyde, ſo ſone as they may by watches perceyue your nauy comynge on the ſea. And as touchyng the parting of your ſhyppes and power: that I can in no wyſe allowe. And in caſe ye were mynded ſo to do, Anniball of all men is moſt vnmete, to haue the rule and gouernance therof.
            ¶ Fyrſt ye muſt conſyder (ſaid this Thoas) that Annibal is a Carthaginens, and an outlaw or baniſhed man frō his cuntrey: Whoſe crafty witte wyl imagyne dayly a. M. newe deuyſes, euen as fortune dothe varye, or as it ſhall fall into his brayne. Agayne yf it ſhoulde chaunce, that Annibal looſe his nauie, or his men to be vanquyſhed: the loſſe wil be no leſſe, then if any other capitayne had loſte theym. But in caſe it ſhoulde happen hym to haue the vyctorye, the honour therof ſhall wholly abyde with Anniball, and not with Antiochus. Furthermore, if fortune ſo well ſerue, that Anniball vtterly ſubdue the Romaynes: what will ye then thynke, that he will continue in your ſubiection, whiche in his cuntrey culd not ſuffre him ſelf to be in any obedience? Nay (ſaid he) he that in his youth hath euer coueted in his minde, to be Emperour of the hole world, will now in age neuer be contented, to be vnder the rule of any other, if he may choſe. Wherfore my coūſayl is, that ye haue no nede to make Annibal your capitain: But if it pleaſe you, ye may vſe his cōpany as your frēd in your iourney, takīg his aduiſe in your affayrs, as a prudēt counſailour, & none otherwiſe.
            ¶ This crafty and vntrew coūſail of Thoas, turned the kīges mynde cleane frome ſendynge of Anniball with any army into Affrica: which before was thoughte moſt mete and neceſſary.

Wherfore he prepared to ſayl in to Grece, where by the help of the Etholiens he wanne certayn citi
                  •
               s. At the laſt the conſul M. Atulius, with an army of Romains, came to the ſocors of their frendes, and at the great mounteyne, whiche paſſethe throughe the myddle of Grece, fought with Antiochus, and put him to flyght, ſleyngal his hoſt, except onely .v. C. which fled with the kyng.
            ¶ After whiche diſcomfiture, Antiochus, with Annibal, and his ſmalle nomber of men, that were lefte hym at the battaylle, cam to the ſee, and toke ſhipping, and came to Epheſus, where he remayned, thynkyng him ſelfe there to be ſure oute of the daunger of the Romayns. And that he was perſwaded to beleue, by many that were about him, gladde to pleaſe his mynd: as many ſuche diſſemblers haue beene and ſhall be dayly about greatte prynces. But onely Anniball aduyſed the kynge, to prepare for the commynge of the Romaynes, ſayenge, that he meruayled more, that they were not already arryued, rather then their commynge myghte be loked for. Shewynge him alſo, that the Romayns were as ſtronge and valiant vpon the ſee, as on the land: Not doubtyng, but ſhortely they wold ſtriue for the dominion of Aſia, and that eyther he muſte take from theim their Empire, or els he ſhuld be in dangier to loſe his kyngdome. For he knewe, their deſire was to be rulers ouer all the worlde, Counſelynge him to loke for none other thyng at their handes. For in caſe he did, he ſhuld deceiue him ſelf with his vayne and falſe hope.
            ¶ Not long after this beginnynge of the warres in Grece, L. Cornelius Scipio, and C. Lelius, were chooſen conſulles. After whiche election, P. Scipio Affricanus offered the ſenate, that in caſe they would grant his brother, L. Scipio the countrey of Grece for his prouynce: he would gladly take the payne to go with him in his iourney. Wherunto the ſenate agreed, geuynge him alſo further auctoritie, to go into Aſia, if he thought it expedient. Sayenge, they woulde nowe proue, whether Antio
                  •
               hus ſhould be more holpen by the counſayl of Anniball, which was before vanquyſhed: or the Romain conſull and his army by the help of Scipio, that had before made the great conqueſt in Affrica. The armies and ſhippes were made ready, and the conſull arriued in Grece, where ſone receyuing many the rebell cities into his handes, he from thenſe

ſayled into Aſia: where, by the licence of the kynge Philyp, he had paſſage throughe Macedony and Trace, to the kyngdome of Antiochus.
            ¶ Dyuers battaylles were foughte vppon the ſea, betweene the Romayne nauy and Polixenidas, capitayne of the kynges ſhyppes: but euer the Romaynes had the victory, by the help of the kyng Eumenes, and alſo of the Rhodiens. At the laſte it chaunced, that the ſoonne of Scipio Affricanus was taken priſoner, and brought to Antiochus: who kepte him honorably and gentelly. And afterward, truſtyng to haue the frendſhyp of P. Scipio, and his healpe, for a peace to be made betwene the Romaynes and him: he ſente him home his ſonne, withoute payeng any raunſome for him. For when he perceyued the Romaynes to approche ſo nere vnto him, he thought it better to common of peace before the battayle, then after, truſtyng to haue more eaſy conditions of peace, if it were moued in tyme. But when the matter came in communication, betwene the conſulle and the kynges embaſſadours, the conditions of the peace were ſo ſore, that Antiochus refuſed to take theim, althoughe he were thervnto perſwaded by the letters of P. Scipio the Affricane. Wherevpon bothe partyes prepared theim to fyghte. The battayle was cruel, but at the laſt the kyng Antiochus was put to fiyght, and .liiii. M. of his footemen ſlayne, and of horſemen .iiii. M. beſydes .i. M. and iiii. C. that were taken pryſoners, with ſmall loſſe of the Romayns. Then ſent Antiochus eftſones his embaſſadours to the conſull for peace: which at lengthe, by meanes of P. Scipio Affricanus, was graunted him, vpon theſe conditions.
            ¶ Fyrſte that he ſhoulde frome thenſe foorthe no more make warre in Europe. Alſoo that he ſhoulde leaue the poſſeſſyons of all the cities landes and countreyes, whyche were on that ſyde the greatte mountayne, called Taurus. Agayne, he ſhoulde paye the Romaynes fyftene thouſande talentes in xii. yeres, and to pay vnto king Eumenes .iii. hundred talentes, and a great quantitie of wheate. Vpon theſe condytions he ſhoulde haue peace. Prouyded that Anniball, the authour of this warre, with Thoas, and dyuerſe other capytaynes and counſaylloures, myghte bee delyuered vnto hym. The kynge, beynge at this extreeme myſchyeffe, receyued the peace vppon the ſayde condytyons: and putte in for the

perfourmance ther of pledges. The ſame peace alſo was after that confirmed by the ſenate of Rome.
            ¶ And ſo all thynges thus proſperouſly brought to paſſe, L. Scipio the conſull returned to Rome, who was receyued into the citie with great honour and triumphe. And as his brother, of his victory in Affrica was named Affricanus: ſo was he of his conqueſtes in Aſia, called Aſiaticus, to the honour of his ſucceſſion euer after.
         
         
            ¶ Anniball fleith to Pruſias, the kyng of Bithynia, and howe he ended his lyfe. Cap. lxxiiii.
            ANniball, after the battayle begon betwene the Romains and Antiochus, wherin he was vanquiſhed and fledde, miſtruſtinge (as it folowed after) that the kynge of neceſſitie muſt be dryuen to take peace, in whiche he feared, leſte the Romaynes, bearyng to hym mortall malyce, wold require his delyuerie: thoughte to prouyde for hym ſelfe in tyme. Wherfore he incontinent fledde to Pruſias, then kyng of Bithynia. He had not longe taryed there, but that T. Quintius Flaminius was ſent from Rome to the kynge, ſhewinge hym, that the ſenatours thought, he delte not friendly with them, to kepe in his realme theyr great and capitall ennemy Annibal: a man that made fyrſte his owne countrey to make warre with them, to the vtter vndoinge of the ſame, and from thenſe came to Antiochus, and was autour alſo of his warre with the Romaynes, and nowe was repayred vnto hym, which he thought woulde tourne to his vndoinge. Pruſias, wyllynge to gratyfy the Romaynes: deuyſed, eyther to ſlee hym, or els to take and delyuer hym to Flaminius. Wheruppon incontinente the ſeruauntes of the kynge, and alſo of Flaminius, beſette the houſe of Anniball rounde about, ſo that he coulde no waye iſſue out. Anniball, foreſeinge the hatred that the Romaynes bare hym, and the ſmall fayth of prynces: ſpecially the lyghtnes of Pruſias: He therfore, thynkynge to haue ſome waye to flie daungier, if nede required, had deuyſed .vii. wayes and entrees into his houſe. Wherof certayne were very ſecrete and priuie. But the numbre was ſo great of men of armes, whiche were about his houſe: and the watche ſo ſtraightly kept by the kynges commaundement, that where ſo euer he offered to iſſue,

he eſpyed embuſhementes of harney

                men. 
                  〈…〉
                his tyme of death to drawe nere, he called for poyſon, whiche he longe tyme had 
                  〈…〉
               ! hym, and had euer redy for ſuche chaunces, and ſayde: Nowe wyll I delyuer the Romaynes of great thought, that they haue longe tyme taken, to bringe me to confuſion. For althoughe I be nowe olde, yet they thynke it longe before I dye. But of this deathe, bothe they and Flaminius theyr legate ſhal haue ſmall victory. Then blaming the deteſtable falſhede of Pruſias, that ſo cruelly wolde ſuffer the murther of his friend, whom he had receyued into his keping: He drunke the empoyſoned drinke, and ſone after dyed.
            ¶ This was the lamentable ende of the ryght wyſe noble and valyaunte capytayne Anniball, in a ſtraunge region, exiled and banyſhed from his owne natiue countrey. Aboute which time, or not longe before, the worthye Romayne Scipio Affricanus alſo dyed: whom the Romaynes, after his manyfold benefites to them ſhewed, recompenced with deteſtable ingratitude, certayne of the citie beinge his ennemies (as no man in authoritie can eſcape enuye) charged hym with the olde matier, betwene Pleminius and the Locrenſes. Wherin (they ſayde) he being conſul was corrupted with money. And therfore miniſtred not iuſtice. Agayne, they layde agaynſt hym, the delyuerye of his ſonne, beinge priſoner with Antiochus, withoute raunſome: whiche they thoughte was very ſuſpecious. For theſe ſmalle cauſes was he called before the Senate, and as though he had ben a meane perſone, put to aunſwere with extremitie: without fauour, or hauynge any reſpecte to his noble actes, done for the common weale. Whiche ingratitude he toke ſo diſpleſantly, that departynge out of the court, he went into the countreye, to the towne of Lytarne, where he dwelled as long as he lyued, exilynge hym ſelfe from Rome for euer. And at his deathe, he commaunded his body to be buried there alſo: that his bones myght not reſt in an vnkynde countrey.
            ¶ Thus were .ii. of the worthyeſt cities of the worlde found vnkynde to theyr noble rulers and capytaynes, and both about one tyme. Carthage banyſhed Anniball, after that he was vanquiſhed. Rome exiled Scipio, that had vanquiſhed all her ennemies. Wherin ſhe was of the twayne more to be blamed of ingratitude.
