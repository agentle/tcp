Thankeſgiuing vnto GOD, for his grace and power. VVritten by a
cloſe priſonner (with a coale) for his owne
comforte.
            
               LET others ſinge of this and that,
               I will ſinge to thy prayſe,
               Who doeſt out of aduerſitie,
               Deliuer me alwayes:
               And 
                     ••••
                  'ſt to me that Comforter,
               In all my ſore temptation:
               Who doeth refreſhe my ſinfull ſoule
               With ſpirituall conſolation:
               And graunt'ſt to me ſuch patience,
               For all my foes deſpight,
               As I to wayte vpon thy will,
               Doe inwardlie delight.
               And when I ſee my nature ſtriue
               Againſt thy iuſt correction,
               Then doe I pray thy Maieſtie
               To helpe myne vnſubiection.
               And when my troubles moſt increaſe,
               (As who liues well and ſmarts not)
               Then comes my Sauiour next to me,
               And ſtickes by me and ſtartes not:
               And when I feele my fleſhe to ſhrinke
               Vnder thy heauie hande▪
               
               I am conſtrain'd my 
                     ••••
                  chednes,
               Better to vnderſta
                     •••
                  
               
               Calling to minde thoſe grieuous ſinns,
               I thought not on before,
               Lamenting them and purpoſing
               To doe the like no more:
               But their contrarie vertues all,
               Eft ſoone to put in vre
               From grace to grace, frō ſtrength to ſtrength,
               Whyl'ſt my dayes ſhall endure:
               By thy free grace and perfect ſtrength,
               Whereof alone I boaſt,
               For if I ſhould doe otherwyſe,
               My labour were but loſte:
               Since all good giftes doe come from thee,
               And thou wilt ſuffer none
               To rob thee of that prayſe which doeth
               Belong to thee alone:
               Yet whyl'ſt by wreſtling againſt ſinne,
               Rewarde for to obtaine,
               I ſeeke by deſerte of my workes,
               Thou aunſwer'ſt thus againe.
            
            
               The aunſwere.
               WHereas thy ſinnes doe farre exceede,
               My grace doeth more abounde,
               And in thy weakenes most of all,
               My power is tryed and founde:
               My grace in Christ ſufficient is,
               And all my workes doeth paſſe:
               By it I am more glorified,
               Then ought that euer was:
               And as J made all things of nought,
               And darkenes to be light,
               So make I nought for to bee good,
               And ſeeble to bee might:
               All perſons and all things on earth
               I haue ſhutt vnder ſinne,
               That by my pardon, generall,
               I might all glorie winne.
               I am the first, the middest, and last,
               And I am all in all,
               That all at all times ſhould on mee
               For helpe and mercie call.
               My grace is ſure full free and pure.
               Or elſe it were no grace,
               It can not ſtande at any hande,
               Where workes haue any place:
               My power infailleable and most incomparable
               Is of no force in deede,
               When it is made of others ayde
                     •
                  ,
               To ſtande in any neede:
               Therefore I call the worst of all,
               And leaue the righteous ſtill.
               That all may ſee my grace to bee
               According to my will:
               Therefore I bring both Clowne and King
               To dust, to death, to nought:
               That euery wight ſhould knowe my might,
               All things alone hath wrought:
               Wherefore bee ſtill and flee from ill,
               And doe well, but confeſſe
               My guiftes in thee both lent to bee,
               And marred more or leſſe:
               That ſtill my grace may ſerue in place
               All thy defaultes to mende,
               And that my power may euery hower
               
                  Ʋpholde thee to the ende,
               When there ſhalbe no ſinne in thee,
               Weaknes nor wante at all,
               But grace▪ might, wealth, peace, ioye, right,
               Health and glorie eternall.
            
            
               THus doeſt thou Lord direct my ſoule
               To quiet peace and reſte,
               Whereby I am aſſured all
               Shall fall out to the beſte:
               And that no ſhame can me defame,
               For why thou art my praiſe,
               In life and death and all in all,
               To me at all aſſaies,
               For thy great mercies ſake in Chriſt,
               In whom thou art well pleaſed,
               That heauie harted ſinners of
               Their burthens ſhould be eaſed,
               And made partakers of thoſe ioyes
               Vnſpeakable and rife,
               Which thou doeſt keepe in ſtore for them,
               After this wofull life:
               And in meane while the holy ghoſte
               Doeth keepe them ſafe and ſounde:
               No rage nor no reſiſtance can,
               Their happie ſtate confounde.
            
            
               Nowe whileſt mine enimies ſeeke to driue
               Mee into deſperation,
               Thou forceſt them againſt their willes
               To further my ſaluation:
               And thou doeſt turne all wiles and wrongs
               Vnto their owne diſgrace:
               Who ſeeke by all extremities,
               Thy ſeruauntes to deface.
               And thou doeſt turne all other things
               To my behoofe likewiſe,
               So that to better myne eſtate,
               My harte can not deuiſe.
               How euer wretched worldlings deeme,
               I am quite caſt awaye▪
               
               And myne olde friendes a loofe from me
               Doe ſtande as at a baye:
               Yet thou doeſt ſtande at my right hande,
               And compaſſe me about,
               And furniſhe me with diuers giftes,
               To make me ſtronge and ſtout:
               And outwarde giftes ſufficient,
               And meete for me and mine,
               To ſerue thy grace, and ſhewe thy power
               By prouidence diuine:
               Beyonde reaſon without deſert,
               Better then many moe
               Of thy deare Saintes who are content,
               And ſinge for ioye alſo:
            
            
               Lorde graunt wee pray that ſo we may,
               Since thou art ſtronge and kinde,
               (As in our conſcience and experience
               We euerie day doe finde)
               That by things all which doe befall,
               We may drawe neare to thee,
               Till thy ſweete face in heauenly place,
               For euer wee ſhall ſee.
            
            AMEN.
