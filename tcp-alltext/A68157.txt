            ¶ Iohan Bale to ye folowers of Christes Gospell.
            FOr thre consyderacyons chefely (dere bretherne) haue I put fourth thys treatyse of my vocacyon to the churche of Ossorye in Irelāde / of my harde chaūces therin / and of my fynall deliueraunce by the great goodnesse of God.Ossorie The first of them is / for that mē shulde wele knowe / that the office of a Christen byshop / is not to loyter in blasphemouse papistrie / but purely to preache ye Gospell of God / to his christened flocke.ye flocke The secōde is / that they shulde also vnderstande / that contynuall persecucyons / and no bodyly welthe / doeth folowe the same most godly office / in them which truly executeth it. The thirde is / that they myght beholde how gracyously our most mercyfull God wyth hys power wayteth vpon them / and fynally delyuereth them in most depe daungers.Deliueraunce.
            
            These .3. thynges notable / concerninge the electe membres of Gods congregacyon in thys life / comprehendeth muche matter in the scriptures of both testamentes / with abundaunce of examples from Abel the first to Iohan the euā
               gelyst

/ which was the last lyuer in the same. The examples also therof are both lyuely and innumerable / Exāples in the first propagacion and longe contynuaunce of the christen churche from hys tyme to thys our tyme / as the chronycles & hystoryes most abundauntly specifieth.
            First / as concernynge the examples of holye scripture.Iesus. Adam. Iesus the eternall sonne of the euerlastynge father / in the Godhede preached to Adam in paradyse terrestre / and constytute hym so wele an instructour as a father ouer hys posteryte. He proued him also after he had sinned / by dyuerse afflyctyons / and fynally promysed both to hym and to hys / deliueraūce in the sede of the woman / which at the lattre in hys owne persone he louingly ꝑfourmed.Christe Christe ye seyde sonne of God contynually still taught / by the mouthes of the fathers and prophetes / tyll suche tyme as he hymselfe came in the fleshe. Than was he aboue all others / of hys heauēly father appoynted / a vniuersall doctor ouer all the worlde / and commaunded to be hearde / Math. iij.Adoctor He folowed hys vocacyō in most ample wyse / very cruelly was he of the clergie thā persecuted / and gloriously delyuered in hys resurrectyon from deathe. The members of hys true churche / the prophetes and Apostles / were

in case like as he their head was / first called / than afflicted / and gracyously alwayes in the ende delyuered.Fathers He that shall marke the laboriouse procedinges of Abraham / Ioseph / & Moyses / of Dauid / Helyas / and Daniel / with the other olde fathers and prophetes / shall fynde it no lesse. He lyke wyse that shall dyscretely searche the doynges of Peter / Iames and Iohan / with the other of the Apostles and dysciples / shall wele perceyue the same.
            Hieremye for the olde lawe / Paule for the newe lawe / and Iohan Baptyst betwixt them both / were called from their mothers wombe to that heauenly offyce of preachynge. Hier. j.Called. Luce. j. Gala. j. yea / they suffered extreme persecucyons vndre tyrauntes / and fynally were deliuered / in this lyfe from parelouse daūgers▪ and in deathe / frō synne / helle / and dāpnacyō. To rehearce the exāples of the primatyue churche / and of the ages folowynge / Ages. concernynge these matters / it wolde requyre muche tyme / they are so manye / and therfor at thys present I omit thē. Thus ā I not alone in these 3. matters of vocaciō / persecucion / & deliueraūce / but haue on my syde an infinyte nōbre of exāples. Which maketh me the more a great dele to reioyce / like as I wishe them to do / The author. which haue

in these troublouse dayes the lyke. Neyther am I ashamed to tell my bretherne / what God hath most graciously done for me / nomor thā s. Paule was for hymselfe in hys owne Epistles / and Luke in ye actes for saint Peter / though I be farre vnlyke them.s. Peter For I fare lyke the byrde which is deliuered from the snare of the catcher. He flyeth to a bough / and reioyceth in his delyueraunce / and euen so do I. In the which reioyce / I make not only my selfe merye / but also all my louinge frindes. And as for my cruel enemyes the papistes / papistes if I make them sorye in the rehearsal of my delyueraunce / I am not yll apayde therof. For it is better (they saye in Northfolke) that yonge lyddernes wepe / than olde men. I call them yonge and not olde / for God is oldar than Sathan / if age maye be attributed to his eternyte / Daniel as Daniel sayeth it maye / and Christe oldar than the deuyls vycar at Rome / their vngracyouse father.
            As we are in most thinges contrarie to these papistes / so haue we reioyces cōtrary to theirs.papistes They reioyce in helthe / prosperite / riches and worldly pleasures for their bellies sake.
            We in our infirmytees / afflictions / losses / and sorowfull crostes / for Christes veritees sake. And thus maye we wele do / and boast of it also

without offence / for so ded the forenamed S. Paule.s. Paule 2. Cor. 11. and earnestly willed vs to be his folowers. Phil. 3. first he boasted of his vocacion / and sayde. God sorted me out and appoī

I shulde not do other wise than the truthe is. For I was put to it against my wille / by a most christen kynge / and of his owne mere mocion only / without sute of fryndes / mede / labour / expensis / or any other sinistre meane els. By his Regall power and authorite / which both were of God / Edward Ro. 13. was I both allowed and confirmed / and not all vnioyfully receiued of ye people / which causeth me in conscience to iudge my vocaciō iust. Yet was not my reioyce so muche in ye dignite therof / as in doinge for the time / the office therūto belonginge.Office. But now is it most of all in the leauinge of that bishopricke / the Gospell beinge so vnthankefully of the prestes receiued / I so terribly of them persecuted / and my seruauntes so cruelly slayne.
            
               
               S. Paule.Moreouer saint Paule boasted muche of his persecucions / & described them at large / concludinge thus in ye ēde / Very gladly (saith he) will I reioyce of my weakenesse / yt the strength of Christe maye dwell in me. Therfor haue I dilectaciō in infirmitees / in rebukes / in nedes / in persecucion / and anguyshes / for Christes sake.The Author. 2. Cor. 12. If I haue lyke wyse / felte a great meanie of the same afflictions / as I haue done in dede / maye not I also with him reioyce in them? Maye I not be glad / that I am in sorowes for the Gospell / lyke fashioned to him / & not pranked vp in pōpe & pleasures / lyke ye wantō babes of this worlde? As at this daye is lecherouse Weston / weston. which is more practised in the arte of breche burninge / than all ye whores of the stues / to the great infamye of his virginall ordre. The truthe of it is / that sens I toke that wayghtie office in hande / I haue bene sycke to the very deathe / I haue bene greued with the vntowardnesse of ministers.
            
               Troubles.I haue bene in iournayes and labours / in iniuryes and losses / in peines and in penuries. I haue bene in strifes and contencions / in rebukynges and slaunderynges / and in great daunger of poyseninges and killinges.
            I haue bene in parell of the heathen / in parell

of wicked prestes / in parell of false iustyces / in parell of trayterouse tenauntes / in parell of cursed tyrauntes / in parell of cruell kearnes and galloglasses.Tyrauntes.

            Sanct Paule also reioyced / that God had so miraculously delyuered him from so manye daungerouse ieopardyes / Parels. and spareth not so to report them. 2. Cor. 11. et. 12. Whie shulde I than shrinke or be ashamed to do the lyke / hauinge at Gods hande the lyke miraculouse deliueraunce? Are they not left to vs for example / that we shulde do the lyke whan we fele the lyke?Writtē. Whatsoeuer thinges are writtē afore tyme (sayth he) they are written for our learninge / that we through pacyence and confort of the scriptures might haue hope▪ Rom. xv. He in the cytie of Damascon / beīge layde waite for / by ye liefe tenaūt of Kinge Aretha / was lete downe at a windowe in a basket / & so escaped his handes. Act. ix.dubline. I ī ye cytie of Dubline / beīge assaulted of papistes / was cōuayed awaye in ye nyght in mariners apparell / & so escaped ye daunger by

Gods helpe.

            As Paule against his wylle / was put into a shippe of Adramitiū / coupled with other prisoners of Iewrie / cōuaied fourh into Italie / and there safely deliuered.Italie. Act. 27. and 28. So was I & my companyō Thomas against our willes taken īto a shippe of Zelāde / coupled with frenche prisoners / cōuayed furth īto flanders / and so at the lattre / safely there deliuered. As their shippe was caught betwixt Candia and Melita / and coulde not resyste the wyndes / ye winde so was ours betwixt Mylforde hauen / and Waterforde. As they had an excedynge tempeste vpon the sea / so had we lykewyse. As they were withoute hope of sauegarde / so were we also.
            
               As they feared Syrtes or daungerouse sandy places and rockes / so ded we. As they were almost famyshed and drowned / so were we.Cōfort. As God conforted them / so ded he vs. As they were in conclusion cast into an ylande / so were we into S. Iues in Cornewale. As the people shewed thē kyndnesse at Melita / so ded they vs at the seyd S. Iues. As Paule gaue thankes and brake breade amonge them / so ded we also. As the captayne Iulius courteously intreated hym and gaue hym lyberte to go vnto hys fryndes at Sydon / and to refreshe hym / Iulius. so ded our captayne Cornelis vse vs very gētilly with all fauour and lyberte / what though he had so currishely and cruelly intreated vs afore. As Paule was stonge of a bytyng vyper ād not hurte / so was I of that viperous Walter being most vniustly accused of treason afore ye iustices ther / Walter and yet through Gods deliueraūce / not hurte. As he appealed to Cesar / so ded I to the trone of God.
            As great dyspycyōs were amōg the Iewes at Rome concernīg Paule / Rome. so were there afterwarde amonge the shyppers in our returne to their shippe concerning vs. As the souldyers gaue counsell to kylle the prisoners / so were there some of our men that gaue counsell to haue drowned vs for our moneye / and of some to

haue delyuered vs vp to the counsayll of Englande / in hope of great rewardes.Publiꝰ. As Publius gentilly receiued Paule / and by hym was healed of all hys dyseases / so ded myne hoste Lambert receyue me also gentylly / and by me was delyuered from hys vayne beleue of purgatorye / and of other Popysh peltryes. As the people reported Paule to be a murtherer / and after changed their myndes / and sayde he was a God / A God. so our wycked maryners reported me to be a most haynous traytour / and yet afterwarde in my delyueraunce called me the seruaūt of God. As he was for the hope of Israel ledde īto captiuite / ād at last deliuered / so was I also for the same captiued / and in fyne delyuered into Germanie.Bretherne. As the bretherne met Paule with reioyce at Appij forum / so ded they me in diuerse partes of Duchelande / and lawded God for my so miraculouse deliueraunce. As he sayde that he had committed nothyng against the lawe of his fathers / so saye I also that I haue in this acte cōmitted nothyng against the Apostels ād Prophetes doctryne / I thāke my Lord God therof.The author. Thus had I in my troublous iournaye from Irelande into Germanye all those chaūces ī a maner that S. Paul had in his iournaie of no lesse trouble / frō Ierusalē to Rome /

They serued God in lyberte / and were fedde of their owne true labours. These serued Antichrist in bondage / and deuoured vp the labours of other. They were sumwhat ceremoniouse / but these altogyther suꝑsticiouse. Of this lattre swarme / after the first enteraunce of Augustine the Romish mōke, was Egbert, Egwine,

rather that Aethna ded swallowe me vp / thā to maīteine those wayes in religion / which might corrupte the same. For my daily desire is / in ye euerlastīge schole / to beholde the eternall sonne of God / both here and after this lyfe. And not only to see the fathers / fathers. prophetes and Apostles therī / but also for loue of ye doctrine / to enioye their blessid feliship herafter. And so muche the rather I traded thus with myselfe / yt I see than the kinges maiestie / ye arhebishopp of Canterbury / and the honourable lordes of ye counsell / so feruētly bēt ye waye / as to seke ye peoples helthe in ye same.Helthe. I thought it therupō no lesse thā my bounde dewtie / to shewe my selfe faithfull / studiouse / & diligēt in yt so chargefull a functiō.
            My first ꝓcedinges in yt doīge / were these. I earnestly exhorted ye people to repētaūce for sinne / & required thē to giue credite to ye Gospell of saluacion.ij. principles. To acknowledge & beleue yt there was but one God / & him alone wtout any other / sincerely to worship.One Christe To cōfesse one Christe for an ōly sauer & redemer / & to truste ī none other mānis praiers / merites / nor yet deseruīges / but in his alone / for saluaciō I treated at large both of ye heauenly & politicall state of ye christē churche / & helpars I foūde none amōge my prebēdaries & clergie / but aduersaries a great nōbre.

I preached the Gospell of ye knowledge & right inuocacion of God / I mayntened the politicall ordre by doctrine / obediēce & moued the cōmens alwayes to obeye their magistrates. But whā I ones sought to distroye the ydolatries / & dissolue the hypocrites yockes / than folowed angers / slaū
               ders / cōspiricyes / & in the ende the slaughter of men, Much a do I had with the prestes / for yt I had sayd amonge other / Idoles. yt the whyte Goddes of their makīge / such as they offered to the people to be worshipped / were no Goddes but ydoles / and that their prayers for the dead procured no redēpciō to the solwes departed / Redempcion of sowles beinge only in Christe / of Christe / & by Christe. I added yt their office by Christes strayght commaūdement / Preachinge. was chifely to preache / and instruct the people in the doctryne and wayes of God / and not to occupie so muche of the tyme in chauntynge / pypynge / ād syngynge.
            Muche were the prestes offēded also / for yt I had ī my preachīges / Wyues willed thē to haue wiues of their owne / & to leaue the vnshamefast occupienge / of other mēnes wyues / doughters / ād seruaūtes. But heare what āswere they made me alwayes / yea ye most viciouse mē amōg thē. What shulde we marrie (sayd they) for halfe a

yeare / & so loose our liuynges. Thinke ye not yt these men were ghostly inspired?Deuylish. eyther yet had knowledge of some secrete mischefe wurkīge in Englāde? I for my part haue not a little sens yt time marueled / whā it hath fallen to my remē
               braūce. Well ye truthe is / I coulde neuer yet by any Godly or honest persuasion / bringe any of thē to mariage / Adulterers. neither yet cause them whiche were knowne for vnshamfast whorekepers / to leaue that fylthye & abhomynable occupyenge what though I most earnestly laboured it. But sens that tyme I haue consydered by the iugement of the scriptures / that the impenytent ydolatour must therwith be also a fylthie adulterer or most detestable sodomite.Sodomites. It is his iust plage. Rom. 1. We can not stoppe it. Lyke wyse the dissemblinge hipocrite / in cōtemning Gods truthe / must nedes folowe errours and lyes in the doctrine of deuyls. 1. Timot. 4. to haue in ye ende the greatter confusion. Lete him yt is wicked (sayth ye Angell to S. Iohan) become more wicked / and he that is filthie / Wicked become more filthye / that hys damnacion maye be the depar / & his sorowes extremer. Apoca. 22.
            The lord therfor of his mercie / sende discipline wt doctrine / into his church.doctrine For doctrine wt
               out discipline & restraint of vices / maketh dissolute

hearers. And on the other syde / discipline without doctrine / maketh eyther hipocrites / or els desperate doars.Discipline. I haue not written this in disprayse of all ye prestes of Kylkēnye or there about. For my hope is yt some of them by thys tyme are fallen to repentaunce / though they be not manye. An other thinge was there / yt muche had dyspleased the prebendaryes and other prestes.Prestes I had earnestly / euer sens my first comminge / requyred them to obserue and folowe ye only boke of cōmen prayer / whych the kynge & hys coūsell had that yeare put fourth by acte of parlement. But that wolde they at no hāde obeye / Excuses allegynge for their vayne and ydle excuse / the lewde example of the archebysshop of dublyne / whych was alwayes flacke in thynges perteyninge to Gods glorie / allegīge also the wāt of bokes / and that their owne iustices and lawers had not yet cōsented therunto.Iustices As though it had bene lawfull for their iustices to haue denyed ye same / or as though they had rather haue hanged vpō thē / than vpon the kinges autorite and cōmaundement of his coūsell.
            In the weke after Eastre / whan I had ones preached .xij. sermons amōge thē / and established the people / sermōs. as I thought / in the doctrine of repentaūce and necessarie beleue of the Gospell

in the true worshyppynges of one God our eternall father & nomore / ād in ye hope of one redemer Iesus Christe and nomore. I departed from Kylkēnie to ā other place of myne .v. myles of / called Holmes court / where as / I remained tyll the assension daye.Holmes Court. In the meane time came sorowfull newes vnto me that M. Hugh Goodacker the Archebishop of Armach / that godly preacher and virtuouse learned mā / was poysened at Dubline / by procurement of certen prestes of his diocese / for preachinge Gods verite & rebukinge their cōmen vices.Poison. And letters by & by were directed vnto me / by my speciall frindes from thens / to be ware of the like in my diocese of Ossorie / which made me parauēture more circūspect thā I shulde haue bene.Kilkennie. Vpō ye assenciō daye I preached agaī at Kilkennie likewyse on Trinite sondaye / & on S. Peters daye at midsomer than folowinge.
            On the xxv daye of Iuly / ye prestes were as plesauntly disposed as might be / and went by heapes from tauerne to tauerne / to seke the best Rob dauie and aqua vite / which are their speciall drinkes there.A Ioie. Thei cawsed all their cuppes to be filled in / with Gaudeamus in dolio / the misterie therof ōly knowne to them / and at that time to none other els.
            
               
               K. Edward.Which was that Kynge Edwarde was dead / and that they were ī hope to haue vp their maskynge masses againe. As we haue in S. Iohns Reuelaciō that they which dwell on the yearth (as do our earthly minded masmongers) shulde reioyce and be glad / whan Gods true witnesses were ones taken awaye / and shulde sende gyftes one to an other for gladnesse / Giftes. because they rebuked them of theyr wycked doynges / Apca. xj. For ye must consydre that the prestes are commēly the first that receiue suche newes. The next daye folowinge / a very wicked iustice called Thomas Hothe / with the lorde Moūtgarret / resorted to the Cathedrall churche / requyrynge to haue a Communiō / in the honour of S. Anne.Idolat. Marke the blasphemouse blyndenesse and wylfull obstinacie of thys beastly papyst. The prestes made hym answere / that I had forbydden them that celebracion / sauynge only vpon the sondayes. As I had in dede / for the abhomynable ydolatries that I had seane therin.O Satā
                I discharge you (sayth he) of obedience to your Bishop in this point / & cōmaūde yow to do as ye haue done heretofore / which was to make of Christes holy cōmuniō an ydolatrouse masse / & to suffre it to serue for ye dead / cleane contrarye to the Christen vse of the same.
            
               Thus was the wicked iustice / not only a vyolatour of Christes institucion / A traitour. but also a contempner of his princes earnest commaūdement / and a prouoker of the people by his vngraciouse example to do the lyke. Thys coulde he do whith other mischefes more / by his longe beynge there by a whole monthes space / but for murthers / theftes / ydolatryes / and abhominable whoredomes / wherwith all that nacion habūdeth / for that time he sought no redresse neyther appointed any correction.Wicked The prestes thus reioycing yt the Kinge was dead / & yt they had bene that daye cōfirmed in their supersticiouse obstinacie / resorted to the forseyd false iustice the same night at supper / to gratifye him with Rob Dauye and Aqua vite / T. hoth for that he had bene so frendly vnto them / & that he might styll cōtinue in the same. The next daye after was the Ladye Iane Gylforde proclamed their Quene / with solemnite of processions / bonefyres / and banquettes / the seyd iustice / as I was infourmed / Blamed sore blamynge me for my absence that daye / for in dede I muche doubted that matter.
            So sone as it was there rumoured abrode yt ye Kynge was departed frō this lyfe / kearnes ye ruffianes of ye wilde nacyon / not only rebelled agaīst

the English captaines / as their lewde custome in suche chaunges hath bene alwayes / chefely no English deputye beinge within the lande / but also they conspired into the very deathes of so many English men and women / as were left therin alyue.English Myndinge / as they than stoughtly boasted it / to haue set vp a kinge of their owne. And to cause their wilde people to beare ye more hate to our naciō / very subtilly but yet falsely / they caused it to be noysed ouer all / that the yonge Earle of Ormonde / and Barnabe the barne of vpper Ossories sonne / were both slaine in the court at London.Rumours. Vpon this wylye practise of myschefe / they raged without ordre in all places / and assaulted the English fortes euery where.
            And at one of them by a subtyle trayne / they gote out .ix. of our men and slewe them. On the .xiij. daye of August / mastres Kinge. a gentill woman / the wyfe of Mathew kinge / hauynge a castell not farre of / her husbande than beinge at London / fleddde with her familie and goodes in cartes towardes the forseid kilkennye / and in the hygh waye was spoyled of all / to her very petycote / by the kearnes & galoglasses of the forenamed barne of vpper Ossorie Mihell patricke and of ye lorde Mountgarret / Tirauntes. which ought rather

to haue defended her. In this outrage had she after longe cōflicte wt those enemyes .iiij. of her cōpanie slain, besides other mischefes more.
            On the .xx. daye of August / was the ladye marye with vs at kylkennye proclamed Quene of Englande / Fraunce and Irelande / Marie. with the greatest solempnyte that there coulde be deuysed / of processions / musters and disgysinges / all the noble captaynes and gentilmē there about beinge present.Cōpulsion. What a do I had that daye with the prebendaryes and prestes abought wearinge the cope / croser / and myter in procession / it were to muche to write.
            I tolde them earnestly / whan they wolde haue cōpelled me therunto / that I was not Moyses minister but Christes / Gods wurde. I desyred them that they wolde not cōpell me to his denyall / which is (S. Paule sayth) in ye repetinge of Moyses sacramētes & ceremoniall sohaddowes Gal. v. wt yt I toke Christes testamēt in my hāde / & wēt to ye market crosse / ye people in great nōbre folowinge. There toke I the .xiij. chap. of S. Paule to ye Roma. declarīge to thē breuely / what ye autoritie was of ye worldly powers & magistrates what reuerēce & obediēce were due to ye same. In ye meane tyme had the prelates goten .ij. disgysed prestes / one to beare the myter afore me / ij. maskers.
               
and an other the croser / makinge .iij. procession pageauntes of one. The yonge men in the forenone played a Tragedye of Gods promises in the olde lawe at the market crosse / with organe plainges and songes very aptely. In the after none agayne they played a Commedie of sanct Iohan Baptistes preachinges / Comedies. of Christes baptisynge and of his tēptacion in the wildernesse / to the small contentacion of the prestes and other papistes there.
            On ye thursdaye next folowinge / which was S. Bartylmewes daye / I preached agayne amonge them / Last sermon. bycause the prebendaryes and other prestes there / had made their boastes / that I shulde be compelled to recante all that I had preached afore. And as I was entered into the pulpet / I toke this sainge of S. Paule for my thema. Non erubesco Euangelium. Virtus enim Dei est, in salutem omni credenti, &c. I am not ashamed of the Gospell.Gospell And whie? For it is the power of God into saluacion / to all them that beleue it. Rom. 1. Than declared I vnto thē / all yt I had taught there sens my first cōming thydre / the iustice bothe beīge present. As yt our God was but one God / & ought alone to be be worshipped.Christe And yt our Christe but was one Christe / & ought alone to be trusted to

for redēpciō of sinne. I earnestly charged ye people / to rest vpon these ij. principles firmely / as vpon the chefe stayes of their saluacion / as they wolde answere it at the dredefull daye / and not to suffre themselues to be led by a contrariouse doctrine of deceytfull teachers / into any other beleue from thēs fourth. Item concerninge ye sacrament of Christes bodye and bloude / wherī they had bene most ꝓdigiously abused / through the vnsaciable couetousnesse of the prestes.Sacrament. I required them very reuerētly to take it / as a sacrament only of Christes deathe / wherby we are redemed and made innocent mēbres of hys misticall bodye / and not to worship it as their God / as they had done / to the vtter derogacion of his heauenly honour.No worship. And as I came in the Vsuall prayer / to remembraunce of the dead. I willed thē to gyue harty thankes to God / for their redempciō in Christe / largely declaringe yt the sowles of ye righteouse were in ye hande of his mercye without cruell torment. Sap. 3. & yt the prestes with all their masses & funerall exequies / coulde nothīge adde to their redēpciō / if they had bene otherwise bestowed.Funerals.
            
            After the prayer / I toke ye Gospell of ye daye. Beati oculi qui vident quae vos videtis, &c. Luce. 10. Wherī I was occasioned to speake of

certē degrees of mē / as of kinges / ꝓphetes / lawers / iusticiaryes / & so fourth. As yt the kinges were desierouse to see Christe / the ꝓphetes to enbrace hī / ye swellinge lawers to rise vp agaīst him and to tempte him / and the ambiciouse iusticiaries to toye with him and to mocke him. The wounded mā to haue nede of him / the woū
                  ded mā. the preste to shewe no compassion / the leuite to ministre no mercye / and last of all the contēptuouse Samaritaine to exercise all the offices of pitye / loue / beniuolence / and liberall mercye / vpon the same wounded creature.
            As to resort to him / fauourably to see hī / with layser to beholde him / to haue compassion on hym / to bynde vp hys woundes / to poure in oyle and wyne / Iesus. to sett him on his owne beaste / to brynge hym to a place of confort / finaly to socour him and to paye his whole charges. All these matters I declared there at large / which were now to muche to repete here againe. The same daye I dined wt ye mayer of ye towne / whome they name their suffren / called Robert Shea / a man sober / wise / and godly / which is a rare thinge in that lande.R. shea.
            
            In the ende of our dyner / certen prestes resorted / Disputacion. and began very hotely to dispute wt me cōcerninge their purgatorye & suffrages for the

dead. And as I had alleged ye scriptures prouī
               ge Christes sufficiēcie for ye sowles discharge afore God / wtout their dirtie deseruinges. They brought fourth / as semed to them / cōtrary allegacions / yt there shulde apere no truthe in those scriptures. As S. Paule prophecied of thē.s. Paule Rō. 1 That suche as they were / shulde seke to turne the veryte of God into a lye. And whan I had ones deprehended chem in that theuerie / and agreed both our alleged scriptures / to the mayntenaūce of my first princyple / to their manifest reproche. I demaūded of them / what a Christē mānys office was / whan suche a scripture was vttered / as neyther mā nor angell was able to denie any truthe therof?Offyce. But they made me none answere. Than sayde I vnto them. Ye haue set me fourth a newe lesson / and taught me this daye / to knowe a good mā frō an hipocrite / & to discerne a true Christiane frō a wicked papist. The good man (sayd I) beleueth a truthe in ye scriptures / ye hipocrit denieth it / ij. sortes ye christiā ēbraceth it / ye papist doubteth & disputeth against it / as ded yt deuill ī ye wildernesse wt Christe / whā he sought by one scripture to cōfoūde an other.
            The next daye I departed frō thens & went home wc my cūpanye to Holmes court agayne.Holmes court.
            
            Where as I had knowledge the next daye

folowinge / that the prestes of my diocese / specially one Sir Richarde Routhe / treasurer of the churche of Kylkēnie / and one Sir Iames Ioys a familiar chaplaine of mine / Barnabe Bolgar. by ye helpe of one Barnabe Bolgar / my next neibour & my tenaūt at the seyd holmes court / had hired certen hearnes of the lorde Moūtgarret / and of the barne of vpper Ossorie / whom they knewe to be most desperate theues and murtherers / to slea me. And I am in full beleue / that this was not all without their knowleges also / for so muche as they were so desierouse of my landes in diuerse quarters / and coulde neyther obteine them by their owne importunate sutes / nor yet by the frendeshipp of others.tiraūtes As for the lorde Mountgarret / I suspect him by this.
            An horse grome of his / withan other of his brechelesse gallauntes besides / came into my court one daye / ij. theues. and made a stought bragge amonge my seruauntes / that he wolde both steele my horses / as it is there reckened no great faulte to steele / and also that he wolde haue my heade if I came abroade.
            I sent my seruaunt vnto him / not as one desierouse to be reuenged / but to knowe what cause his grome had / to vttre so muche malice.Malice. Yea / I afterwarde complayned therof my selfe / to

his owne persone / & had but a slendre answere / with no redresse at all. The Barne of vpper Ossorie / molested my pore tenaūtes in the quarter wher as he dwelte / most maliciously / & Barnabe Bolgar maryed his yonge doughter to one of those murtherers / A thefe. called Grace gracelesse / to helpe ye matter forwarde. For he thought by that meanes to haue ye full occupienge of Holmes court yet ones agayne.
            On the thursdaye after / which was the last daye of August / I beinge absent / ye clergie. the clergie of Kylkennie / by procurement of that wicked iustice hothe / blasphemously resumed agayne the whole papisme / or heape of supersticions of the bishop of Rome / to the vtter contempte of Christe and his holye wurde / of the kinge and counsell of Englande / and of all Ecclesiasticall and politike ordre / without eyther statute or yet proclamacion.Rebellions. They ronge all ye belles in ye cathedrall minstre and parrish churches / they flonge vp their cappes to the battlement of the great temple / with smylinges and laughinges most dissolutely / the iustice himselfe beinge therwith offended.

Christe our heauēly maistre and redemer / was wele contented that his most holy natiuite gaue place to an heathnysh Emprours obedience. Luc. 2. And yow disdaine

that daye to obeye a most christen kynge / counsell / & parlement / & yet ye are not ashamed to boast it / yt ye kepte the daie holye. O right Antichristes. On ye daye next folowīge which was saturdaye / tresurer in the afternone ye forseid treasurer a man vnlearned and therwith an outragiouse whorekepar / resorted to me with a nombre of prestes / to tempte me like as Sathā ded Christe in ye wildernesse / sauing yt Sathā to Christe offered stones / & that temptinge treasurer both apples & wyne. And as they had than cōpassed me in rounde about / temptacion. ye seid treasurer proponed vnto me / yt they were all fully mīded to haue solempne exequies for kynge Edwarde lately departed / lyke as ye quenes highnesse had had thē in Englāde. I axed them / how that was? They made me answere / with a Requiem masse & Dirige. Than axed I of them agayne / who shulde singe yt masse?a masse. And they answered me / yt it was my bounde dewtie to do it / beinge their byshop Than sayde I vnto them. Massinge is an office appointed of that Antichriste the bishopp of Rome / to whome I owe no obediēce / neither will I owe him any so longe as shall lyue.To preache. But if ye wyll haue me there / to do that office / which Christe the sonne of God hath earnestly cōmaū
               ded / whych is to preache hys holy Gospell / 

I will do it with all my harte.
            No sayde they / we will haue a solempne masse / for so had the Quene.Requiē. By my trouth sayde I / than must ye go seke out some other chaplayne. For truly of all generacions I am no massemongar. For of all occupacions me thinke / it is most folish.Massinge. For there standeth the preste disgysed / lyke one that wolde shewe some cōueyaūce or iuglyng playe. He turneth his back to ye people / and telleth a tale to the walle in a forē language.Toyes. If he turne his face to thē / it is eyther to receiue the offering / eyther to desyre thē to giue him a good wurde / with Orate pro me fratres for he is a poore brother of theirs / eyther to byd them God spede / with Dominus vobiscū / for they get no part of his banket / eyther els to blesse them with the bottom of the cuppe / with Benedictio Dei / whā all the brekefast is done. And of these feates (sayd I) can I now lyttle skille.Blessinges. With that the Treasurer beynge in hys fustene fumes / stoughtely demaunded a determinate answere / as though he came not thydre without autorite. Than suspected I somwhat the wickednesse of iustice hothe and such other Notwithstandinge I axed hī ones again / what profyght he thought the Kynges sowle to haue of those funerall exequies?Iustice. Hothe. Than āswered one

of the prestes / yt God knewe wel inough what he had to do. Yet you must appoint hī? sayde I
            If these youre suffrages be a waye for him to heauen / & that he can not go thydre wtout thē / ye are muche to blame / that ye haue diffarred them so longe.To blame. Ye had (sayd I) a commaūdement the last saterdaye / of the iustice hothe / to haue solempnised them yt nyght and the next daye after. But the deuyll which that daye daū
               sed at Thomas towne (for they had a processiō with pageaūtes) and the aqua vite & Kob Dauie withall / wolde not suffre ye than to do thē.ꝓcessō. I desire yow / considering that the last sondaye ye differred them to see the deuill daūce at Thomas towne / that ye will also this sondaie differre them / tyll suche tyme as I sende to ye Quenes cōmissioners at Dublyne / to knowe how to be discharged of the othe which I made to ye Kynge and hys counsell for abolyshement of that popish masse.Cōmissiones. For I am loth to incurre ye daunger of periurie. With that after a fewe wurdes more / they semed content / and so departed. The next daye came thydre a proclamacion / that they which wolde heare masses / shulde be suffered so to do and they that wolde not / shulde not trerunto be compelled.Proclamacion.
            
            Thus was that buyldynge clearly ouerthroowne

/ and that practyse of blasphemye wolde not take at that tyme / as God wolde
            And as I had continued there certen dayes / I chaunced to heare of manye secrete mutteringes / that the prestes wolde not so leaue me / but were styll conspiringe my deathe.Mutteringes.
            
            It was also noysed abroade / by the bishop of Galwaye and others / that the Antichrist of Rome / shulde be taken agayne for the supreme heade of the churche of Irelande.
            
               a chāge.And to declare a contemptuouse chaunge from religion to supersticion againe / the prestes had sodainly set vp the aulters and ymages in the cathedrall churche. Beholdinge therfor so many inconueniences to ensewe / and so many daungers towarde / hauinge also (which was worst of all) no English deputie or gouernour within the lande to complaine to for remedie / deputie I shoke the dust of my fete against those wicked colligyners and prestes accordinge to Christes commaundement / Math. 10. that it might stande against them as a witnesse at the daye of iudgement. The next daye early in the morninge by helpe of frendes / I cōuayed my selfe awaye to the castell of Lechline / To Lechlin. and so fourth to the cytie of Dubline / where as I for a certen time amonge frendes remayned.
            
               As the Epicurouse archebishop / had knowlege of my beīge there / olde George. he made boast vpon his ale benche wt the cuppe in his hāde / as I hearde the tale tolde / yt I shulde for nomānis pleasure / preache in ye cytie of his. But this neded not. For I thought nothinge lesse at yt time / than to poure out ye preciouse pearles of ye Gospell afore so brockish a swine as he was / becōmīge thā of a dissēblīge ꝓselite / a very ꝑniciouse papist.a papist And as towchinge learnīge / wherof he muche boasted amōge his cuppes / I knowe none yt he hath so perfightly exercised / as he hath ye knowne practises of Sardinapalꝰ.

And as for his wife / if ye mariage of prestes endureth not / he hath already prouided his olde shifte of conueyaūce / by one of his seruaūtes.olde shifte. But I wolde wishe yt amonge other studies / he remēbred olde debethes at Londō for surgerie. For ywys there is yet some moneie to be paied, and an Irish hobby also by promise.
            About thre yeares ago / he made interpellacyon to the Kynge in hys lente sermon / 

for his daughter Irelande / but now he commaundeth her to go a whoringe aganie / and to folowe the same deuyll that she folowed afore.Daughter. For that he ded than / was but only to serue the time. He neded lyttle than / to haue accused sir Antony Sellenger of treason / Accusacion. if ye marke him wele now / but that he thought by suche cōueyaunce to winne estimacion / and to obtayne the hygh primacie of Irelande from the archebisshoprycke of Armach / as he ded in dede. Full wele bestowed. Suche dissemblinge gluttōs / and swynysh papistes / are a sore plage to that lande / which for their wicked bellyes / make the people beleue / that sower is swete and darkenesse lighte / wt their aulters / masses / & ymages.Belligods. And yt causeth me to write this to his shame. The salte (sayth Christe) that is become vnsauerie / is frō thens fourth good for nothinge / but to be cast out at the dores / and troden vndre mennes fete / Math. 5. After certen dayes / wtin my hosteshowse / a yonge man of Estsexe called Thomas / was comminge and goynge / which for his maisters affayres into Scotlande / had hyred a small shippe / there called a pyckarde.Thomas. I reioyced at the chaūce / as one that had foūde great threasure / and thought it a thinge prouided of God / for my sauegarde and deliueraūce

at that present.Couenaūt. Anō I couenaunted with him / to paye the halfe charges of that shippe / that I might passe thydre with him / and deliuered to him out of hande the more part therof.
            I thought at all tymes by him / and by an other whome I there had also hearde of / hauīge their continuall occupyenges thydre / To knowe. to haue from tyme to tyme knowlege of the deputyes comminge ouer into Irelande / and so to resort againe to myne owne / in case all thinges were to my minde. As that the tirannouse bishop of Rome had not his primacye and olde doynges there againe / as it had bene boasted he shulde / and that the christen religion gaue not place to blasphemouse papistrie.Papistrie. And as he and I were togyther in the shippe / there tarrienge vpō the tyde for passage / ane Irishe pirate / yea / rather a cruell tiraunte of helle / called Walter / beinge Pylate as they call them / or loades man in a flemmish shippe of warre / made the couetouse Captaine therof to beleue that I was a frēche man / and that I had about me innumerable treasure.Captaine. The Captaine hearinge of this / with an excedīge fearcenesse inuaded our poore shippe / and remoued both the yonge man Thomas and me frō thēs into his great shippe of warre. Where as he searched vs both to the very skinnes

/ and toke frō vs al that we had in moneye / bokes / and apparell.roberie. He toke also from the maistre of our pickarde or lyttle shippe .v. pounde / which I and the seyd Thomas had giuen to him in part of payment / with all his beere and vitayles / notwithstandinge that he ꝑfightly knewe vs to be English men / & no frenche men.
            In the ende I loked fourth of the Captaines cabyne / a howse and behelde a fayre howse / as it had bene a mile from vs / and axed of the yonge man / whose howse that was? He made me answere / that it was the howse of one maistre Parker / the searcher there. I instauntly desired of the Captayne to be deliuered to him / but in no wise wolde he graunt it. I required anon after / as I behelde a farre of / ye citye of Dubline / dubline to be brought thydre for my honest tryall (for they had accused me of treason) but it might not be allowed. The next daye after / we came into the hauē of Waterforde / where as also for my tryall / I desired to go a lāde / but in no wyse wolde it be graunted.Halfe seas. After that we passed more than the halfe seas ouer / towardes Cornewale / and were driuen backe againe with so fearce and terrible a tempest / that ye whole seas to our syght and felinge / went ouer vs. And as we were come yet ones agayne into the hauen

of Waterforde / I sayde vnto the Captayne.Waterforde. God hath with violence brought vs hyther agayne (I perceyue it) that I shulde trye my innocencye. I desyre yow (sayd I) as I haue done hertofore / to deliuer me into the cytie of Waterforde / where as I am wele knowne. He refused vtterly so to do / and after certen other talke / he desyred me to content myselfe / and I shulde (he sayde) in the shippe / haue althinges to my mynde.Frendeshippe. Whie (sayde I) ye go not my waye / neither is it fitt for me to seke for pryses and to go a roauinge as yow do / but to sattle my selfe sumwhere.
            Sens ye came to our shyppe (sayde he) I hearde yow wishe yourselfe in Duchelande / & I promise yow / we will honestly brynge yow thydre / and not longe tarry by the waye.Duchelande. My chaunce was in dede / to fynde there amonge them / an Hollander / called Leonarde / which knewe me in Nortwyck / with maistre Iohan Sartorius. To him ī familiar talke / I had wished myselfe there at that present.A wishe But how will ye leade me (sayde I to the Captaine) as ye haue done hytherto / like a captyue prisoner / or lyke a free passenger? No / sayde he / I take ye now for no prisoner / but for a mā of worshipp / and for a most honest passenger / and so will I

deliuer yow there. But all this time he had my moneie in his owne kepinge.moneye Within .ij. dayes after / we were driuē īto S. Iues ī Cornewale / by extremite of wether. Where as the forseid wicked pyrate Walter / get him a lande afore vs / so fast as euer he coulde / & accused me there for an haynouse traitour / yea / for suche a one / as for that cause had fledde out of Irelande.Accusacion.
            
            And to bringe his wicked purpose to passe / of winninge sumwhat by me / for he thought than to haue halfe my moneye which was in ye Captaines handes / he fatched thidre one Downinges from .vij. myles of / downinges. by the coūsell of the mariners of that towne / which was noysed to be ye most cruell termagaūt of yt shire / yea / suche a one as had bene a begynnar of the last commociō there / both to examine me & apprehēde me.
            And as I was commen to that examinacion before one of the baylyfes / Examined. the constables / and other officers / I desired the seyd balyfe / apearinge to me a very sober mā / as he was in dede / to axe of the seyd Walter / how longe he had knowne me / and what treason I had done sens that tyme of his knowlege?Walter He answered / that he neuer sawe me / neyther yet had hearde of me / afore I came into that shippe of warre a iiij. or .v. dayes afore. Than sayde the baylife.

What treason hast thu knowne by this honest gentelman sens? For I promise the / he semeth to be an honest man. Marry sayde he / he wolde haue fledde into Scotlāde. Whie saith the baylyfe / and knowest thu any impediment / wherfor he ought not to haue gone into Scotlande?Scotlande. No / sayde the fellawe / but he was goinge toward Scotlande. If it be a treason (sayth the baylyfe) to go towardes Scotlande / a man hauinge businesse to do there / it is more than I knewe afore. And truly (sayth he) than are there manie traitours abroade in the worlde. Good fellawe (said he) take hede yt thy groūde be good / in accusinge this man / els art thu wurthie to suffre due ponnishiment for it.ye thrust of Iudas. For thu doest it els vpon some other affection / than desire of right. With that he stode still / and was able to saye nothinge / for he was as dronke as an ape / in hope of a bone viage.
            Than came in the Captaine and his purser / and reuiled the seyd Walter / reportinge him to be a very noughtye fellawe / and a commen drō
               karde / and that I was a very honest man.Walter a dronkarde. For they feared at that tyme / the discharge of my moneye out of their handes / I offeringe my selfe / for my tryall against him / to be brought to the sessions / which were than not farre of.

Thā sayde the forseid Downinges in great displeasure.Downinges. Gods sowle / what do I here? This is but a dronken matter / by the masse. And so went his waye in a fume / and for anger wolde not ones drinke with vs. So that I went clere awaye in this prodygiouse conflict. The next daye beinge sondaye / I resorted to the temple / to see the fashions there.ye tēple. As the peales were all ended / they sange / mattens / houres / holy water makinge / & masse / all in Latine. Nothinge was there in English but the poore Letanie / which the preste / a stought sturdie lubber sayde with least deuocion of all / A chāge muche of the people lamentinge to beholde so miserable a mutaciō / and saienge. A fore time might we haue learned sumwhat by our comminge to the churche / but now nothynge at all to our vnderstandynge. Alas / what shall become of vs?
            
               ye presteAfter dyner / that preste resorted vnto vs / as bolde as great Hercules / & after a little talke / fell to flat raylinge of good Myles Couerdale their bishop after this sort. Where is that heretyke knaue now (sayth he) and other of his companions / vagabondes / apostataes / and rū
               negates? With other vncomly wurdes. And as I was bent to haue made him an answere / A godly man. a gentilman of the cōtraie therabout / rubbed me

on the elbowe / and bad me in mine eare / to lete him alone / and I shulde heare wonders. And the seyde Gentilman brought him into an other talke of olde familiaritees. Wherī he cōfessed / that he had in one daye / bygettē .ij. mennis wyues / of that parishe with childe / to encreace the churches profyght in crisyms and offeringes / where as their husbādes were not able to do it.A good curate. Yea / mary sir / Iames sayth the Gentilman / & ye haue done more miracles than that. Went ye not one daye a fishinge? sayth he. Yes by ye masse ded I / sayde the preste againe / and made the fyshes more holye than euer the whoresons were afore.A howsellar of fyshes. For I sent out my maker amonge them / whome I had that daye receyued at the aulter. By the masse (quoth he) I was able to holde him no longar. Sens that daye / I am sure (quoth he) that our fyshars hath had better lucke / than euer they had afore.
            Thus whan he had raged / by the space of more than an houre / the last peale callinge him thens to euēsonge / ye Gentilmā sayde vnto me.A churchemā. These are the ghostly fathers / which now are permitted to be our spirituall gydes. Are not we (sayth he) wele apoynted thynke yow? The lorde be mercyfull to vs / A plage for it is sure a plage for our vnthanke fulnesse whyls we had the

truthe. Suche lewde bawdye prestes as this is (sayd he) doth wonderfully now reioyce / not for any vertue they loke for / but in hope to be mainteined in liberte of all wickednesse / more than of late dayes.A most vyle knaue. Whan supper was done / certen of the mariners resorted to vs / declaringe what an vncomly part the preste had played wt their pypar / as that he had pyssed in his mouthe / beinge gapinge a slepe in the churche after euensonge. This is the bewteouse face of our Irishe and English churches at this present. The poore people are not taught / Mockers. but mocked of their mynysters / their seruauntes abused / their wiues and doughters defyled / and all christen ordre confounded.
            As the wether waxed fayre / the Captayne went awaye with the shippe / Lyke himself. and was more thā ij. miles on his waie / mindinge (as it apeared) to haue gone awaye with all that I had / moneye / apparell / and bokes / if the winde had serued him wele. The costomers seruaunt / an Irishe man also / beinge admonished by his contreymā Walter / an other Iudas. of my moneye in ye Captaines handes / came to my lodginge in the morninge / and tolde me therof / thinkinge as I had bene in possession therof / if I had come to lande agayne therwith / to haue raysed newe rumours

vpon me / and so to haue depriued me therof. For he shewed himselfe very seruisable in prouidinge me a boate / and in bringinge me to the shippe.Displeased. But whan he ones perceiued / that I wolde not demaunde my moneye of the Captaine / and returne agayne with him / though I gaue him a crowne for his boate and paynes / yet went he awaye in great displeasure / with no small reproches. And at that present / was the forseid Walter bannished the shippe / for his only troublīge of me / so beniuolouse that houre was the Captaine vnto me.Walter
            
            The next daye after / I demaunded my moneye of the Captaine / and it was very honestly deliuered me / all scysmes / as I thought / pacified.moneie. Howbeit that wretched Mammō / most strongely wrought in the vnquietouse harte of the Captaine / so that continually after that time / he threttened to sett vs on lande / and maruele it was / that he threwe vs not both ouer ye borde. Alwayes were we wele contented / to haue gone to lande / Parell. but yet still he droue it of till we came into Douer roade / I not vnderstā
               dinge the misterie cōcerninge the seyd moneye / as that it was in my hande and not in the Captaines / which marred all the whole matter.roauers In the meane tyme they went a roauinge by a

whole wekes space and more. And first they toke an Englishe shippe of Totnes / goīge towardes Britaine and loaden with tinne / and that they spoiled both of ware and moneye vnder ye colour of Frenche mennis goodes. The next daye in the afternone / behelde they .ij. English shippes more / .ij. shippes. whome they chaced all ye night lōge / and the next daye also till .x. of the clocke / & of them they toke one by reason yt his topsaile brake / and that was a shippe of lynne. In this had they nothinge but apples / for he went for his loadinge.pirates. After yt traced they the seas ouer / more than halfe a weke / and founde none there but their owne contray men / beinge men of warre and sea robbers as they were.
            
               at douerAt the last they came to Douer roade / and there wolde the Captaine nedes to lande with his purser. My companion Thomas and I / takinge our selfes for free passengers / desyered to go a lande with them / but that might not be (he sayde) tyll he had bene there afore. Yes / sayth Thomas / I will go a lande / if any man go / for I haue nothinge to do here. Thu shalt not go (sayth the Captaine) but I will laye ye fast by the fete / if thu prate any more.Stoughtly. With yt one Cornelis stode fourth / and sayde. We are muche to blame / that we haue not dispatched

him ere this / and throwne him ouer the borde.a pyrate Than doubted I some mischefe in workinge amonge them. For one Martin an English pyrate / but yet a frenche man borne / beinge sumtyme Tompsons mā and after that Stranguyshes mā / and now one and their vnthriftie nō
               bre / had made them beleue / that I was he / Shamelesse lies wc not only had put downe the masse in Englāde / but also I had caused Doctour Gardiner / the bishopp of Winchestre to be kepte so longe in the tower / & yt also I had poysened (whome I loued & reuerenced aboue all mortall men) the kinge with many other most prodigiouse lyes.
            So went ye Captaine & his purser wt all these newes a lāde / hauinge also wt thē my bishoppes seale / & .ij. Epistles sent me frō 
               Conradus Gesnerus, and Alexander Alesius,
               .ij. Epistles. with commē
               dacions from Pellicanus, Pomeranus, Philippus Melancthō, Ioachimus Camerarius, Mathias Flacius, and other learned men / desierouse of the English churches Antiquytees and doctrines. Which letters I had receyued at Dubline / the daye afore I came to the shippe / and not yet answered them.No treason. These Epistles and seale / with an other letter sent to me from the counsell of Englande / concerninge my first callinge to that pastorall office / they had taken out

of my male / vnknowinge to me. For that they had seane the kinges armes in my seale / as the maner is of byshoppes seales / they layde to my charge the coūterfettinge of the kinges seale / .iij. slaū
                  ders. vpon the .ij. Epistles / heresie / and vpon the counsels letter / conspiricie against the Quene / so wele were they ouerseane in that malice for moneye. In Douer amonge all his cuppes / this captaine discouered these matters / as what a man he had gottē in the borders of Irelande / suspiciously passinge ouer from thens towardes Scotlande / with all the reest. And as he had perceiued some of the hearers desierouse of that praie / Craftie. he called a great pece of his tale backe againe / and sayde / that he had sett vs a lāde at Southamptō / and so letten vs go. His minde was to haue solde me / if any man wolde haue offered him a good somme of moneye.
            After midnyght he returned agayne to the shippe / pratinge amonge his cumpany / what he had done a lande / and how he had almost lost all / by his busye talke.A great acte. But he had hearde of me (he sayde) muche more than he knewe afore / and he trusted that I shulde be to him and to all the shippe / a ꝓfitable prise. The next daye in ye mornīge after his first slepe / he arose / and wt stought coūtenaūce boasted / yt he wolde

strayght to London with his most daūgerouse carrryage / To London. which were we .ij. poore innocent sowles that had done yll to noman / sauinge that we coulde not beare with the blasphemies of the papistes against God & his Christe. Muche to and fro was amonge them about that passage. In the ende they all concluded / that better it was to tarry still there with ye shippe / whyls one or .ij. of them went to the counsell of Englande / in massage and came againe / than thidre to trauaile with shippe and all..ij. massengers. To lāde goeth the pursar and an other besides / to hyer their horses towardes Londō / For moūtaines of golde wolde be gottē ye wayes / they sayde.
            As I behelde this madnesse / though I little thā cared for my life / yet saide I to ye Captaine.Captaine. Maistre Captaine, what do yow meane by these straūge turmoilinges? Thinke ye there is no God? Neither yet a reckeninge to be made at ye lattre daye / of these mad ꝓcedinges? The time hath bene sens our first metinge / that ye haue taken me for an honest passenger / and defended my innocencie against ye cruell pyrate Walter. How standeth it with equite than / that ye now proclame me / so haynouse a traitour?Equite. I am sure that ye 
                  •
               nowe now nomore by me / than ye ded afore. Your allegacions / that I had put downe

the masse / emprisoned Doctour Gardiner / & poysened the kinge / are most false / as all the worlde knoweth. My seale & my other letters are plaine argumentes of my truthe and honest estimacion / of truth and might be to your confusion / if I chaunced to haue righteouse hearers. I praie yow therfor in consciēce / that ye tell me / what euyll ye knowe els by me / that ye make here so terrible doynges? I can not see / sayth the Captaine / that ye will be ordered after anye good sort. My only misordre was than / that my moneye was in my purse / and not in his.moneye Wherunto I answered / wt an hart full of dolour & heauinesse / to beholde mennis so dampnable practises of mischefe for fylthie lucres sake.

Than I besought them / that I might haue at the least / an honest porcion therof / for payment of my charges / whils I shulde be prouidinge / of so great a raunsome / as they had layde to me.
            In fine they assented / that I shulde haue .vj. crownes of myne owne moneye allowed me / for my costes / tyll I had foūde out my frindes.Allowaunce. Than caused the Captaine a pece of ordinaūce to be fiered / and a gunne to be lete / to call backe the purser / and his companion. In whose returne there was muche to and fro.

So that our Captaine commaunded them at the last / to hoyse vp the sayles and spedily to passe towardes Flaūders. In the meane tyme was I poore sowle compelled / Faunders. to set my hande to a false bylle of their deuisinge / as that I had hyred their shippe in Irelande for fyftie pounde / to bringe me without delaye or tarriaunce into Zelande.

            As we came ones thydre / they brought me into the howse of one of the .iiij. owners of the shippe / Lābert. which was a man fearinge God / and his wyfe a woman of muche godlynesse also / which was to me carefull creature / a singular confort prouided of God.

I desiered to haue had liberte to go abroade / to seke my frīdes / but that coulde I not obtaine / though it were in my former couenaūt / whan the .vj. crownes were deliuered me. In ye afternone was it noysed abroade, by the dronken mariners all ouer / Drōkardes. that they had brought suche a one with them out of Irelande / as payed halfe an hondred pounde for his passage / to the wonderinge of all ye towne.

            The conclusion.
            I Wryte this vnto the / thu sorowfull churche of Englāde / yt in ye middes of thy afflictions thu shuldest not despayre. Beholde how gracyously / yea / if I maye so speake it / how miraculously and gloriously / ye autor. the heauenly lorde hath deliuered me / his most vnworthie seruaunt of all men / and an excedinge great sinner. He called me of grace to that office in his vyneyarde / by sore persecuciōs he proued me of loue / and at the lattre of mercye & goodnesse he preserued me from the deadly furye of most fearce enemies.Of mercye. Thy callinge to the Gospell is not vnknowne to the / thu carefull congregacion. Now suffrest thu persecucions diuersly / for not regardinge the time of thy visitaciō. Repent yet in the ende / and doubtlesse thu shalt haue a most prosperouse delyueraunce. They are no noble men / yt do vexe the at this present. They are but pilde peltinge prestes / knightes of the dongehill / though they be sir Swepestretes / maistre doctours / and lorde bishoppes.Repent. Loke vpon their faces / though thu measure not them by their frutes / & thu shalt sone knowe their vertues. They are fierye / hawtie / and lecherouse as gootes / the chastest amōge them. But that shall other mennis wyues knowe / & not thu.prestes. A wele papped Pygion of Paules / is

wholsome (they saye) for a tippetted gentilmā of the popes spialte / ī a darke euenīge / to coole the contagiouse heates of a coltish confessour.
            No noble men are they / which trouble the in this age / as I tolde the afore. For true nobylite neuer yet hated ye truthe of God / but hath aduaunced it by all ages.noiblite Examples we haue in Adam, Noe, Abraham, Moyses, Dauid, Iosias, Nycodeme, Ioseph, Kynge Lucius, Constantine, Iustinyane, Theodosius, kinge Arthour, AlPhrede, Ethelstane, Henry the seconde, Edwarde the thirde, and now last of all ye virgine Kynge Edwarde the .vj. which neuer was defyled with the popes ydolatryes.K.

Suche men (sayth the lorde) as worshipp me / will I make worshipfull / and they that despise me / shall become ignoble or wretched .j. Reg. 2. These will not take awaye the keye of knowledge from Gods people / as do the hypocrites / Math. 23. and as the wicked lawers do also / Luce. 11. wo to them for it.Noble men. But as the noble Dauid requireth / they will opē ye gates yt ye kinge of glorie maie entre. Open the gates (sayth he) O ye noble men / lete the euerlastinge dores be opened / that the kinge of glorie maye come in / Psalm. 24.

            God sayth.

               Epiphanius that worthie father of the churche / nombreth the worshippinge of our ladyes ymage amonge heresies. If we be of his opinion / we must iudge yow no lesse than most perniciouse heretikes. Moreouer it is now become a religion agayne in Englande / to call vpon dead men / with Sancte Petre ora pro nobis.Heretykes.

            Some men perauenture will maruele / that I vtteringe matters of Irelande / shulde omitt in this treatise / to write of Coyne and lyuerie. Which are so cruell pillages & oppressions of ye poore commens there / as are no where els in this whole earthe / Coyne & liuerie neither vndre wicked Saracene nor yet cruell Turke / besides all prodigiouse kindes of lecherie and other abhominacions therin committed. Thre causes there are / which hath moued me not to expresse thē here. One is / for so muche as they perteine nothinge to the tyttle of this boke / which all concerneth religion. An other is for that the matter is so large / as requireth a muche larger volume.3. causes The thirde cause is / for that I haue knowne .ij. worthie men / whome I will not now name / to haue done that thinge so exactly / as noman / (I suppose) therin can amende thē. But this will I vtter breuely / that the Irishe lordes and their vndrecaptaines / supportīge the same / are not only companions with theues / ij. bokes as the prophete reporteth / Esa. 1. but also they are their wicked maisters and mainteners. So that they both coupled togyther / the murtherer with his

I besiche God to sende suche protection a shorte ende / & their lordes & Captaines also / if they see it not sone amended.An ende For it is the vtter confusyon of ye lande / and a mayntenaunce to all vices.
            Thre peoples are in Irelāde in these dayes / prestes / lawers / and kearnes / which will not suffre faythe / truthe / and honestye to dwelle there. And all these haue but one God their Bellye / and glorie in that wicked feate to their shame / whose ende is dampnacion / Phil. 3.ij. threes I speake only of those which are bredde and borne there / and yet not of them all. These for the

more part / are sworne bretherne togyther in mischefe / one to maītaine an others maliciouse cause / by murther preuily procured. And to bringe their conceyued wickednesse to passe / they cā do great miracles in this age / by vertue of trāsubstanciacion belyke / for therin are they very conninge.preuily. For they can very wittely make / of a tame Irishe a wilde Irishe for nede / so that they shall serue their turne / so wele as though they were of the wilde Irishe in dede. Lyke as they ded properly and fynely / in the most shamefull and cruell slaughter of my .v. seruauntes / by ye lorde Mountgarrettes kearnes / and the Barne of vpper Ossoryes farye knightes.practyse By suche fyne conueniaunce of accusinge the wilde Irishe / and colour of the holy daye broken / as is writtten afore / they can alwayes apere to haue fayre white handes / and to be innocent maydes / what murther so euer is by thē committed. But I axe of the prestes / chefely of Richarde Routhe ye treasurer and of sir Iames Ioys his companion / Finely. what they ment by their so oft rydinge to that Barne of vpper Ossorie / whan I was dwellīge at Holmes court? Whome they neuerthelesse to me reported / to be the most errande thefe and mercilesse murtherer of all the lande. And what they haue ment also /

            Now must I saye sumwhat to the / thu carefull churche of Englande / cōcerninge thy misbehauer against thy most louinge Creatour. God chose the for his elect vyneyarde / yea / he plenteously pourged and prepared the.A churche. But whan thu shuldest haue brought hym fourth frute / for grapes thu gauest him thornes / Esa. 7.

/ and hate of the faithfull preachers therof / with other sower crabbes of dampnacion. Thu woldest faine be like the Malignaūt churche of the papistes / thornes prosperouse and welthye in worldly affaires / and therwith sumwhat gloriouse. But thy eternall father in heauen / will not so haue the / but by persecucions transfourmeth the into the very similitude of his derely beloued sōne / to whome he hath espowsed the / to reigne wt him at the lattre in eternall glorie.Lyke Christe
            
            God hath sufficiently declared in the scriptures / what his churche is in this worlde. As yt it is an afflicted and sorowfull congregacion / forsaken in a maner / and destitute of all humaine confort in this lyfe. It maye right wele be compared to a flocke of orphanes / ye churche. which beinge destitute of father and mother / are in this worlde subiect to manye sorowfull calamitees & miseryes. But because that poore churche shulde not vtterly discourage in her extreme aduersitees / the sonne of God hath taken her to his spowse / and hath promised her protectiō / helpe and confort / in all her afflictions and parels. So that she maye at all tymes confort herselfe with this verse of Dauid / Though my father and mother hath left me / yet hath the lorde takē me vp / for his / Psalm. 26.Helpe. In the first promyse
