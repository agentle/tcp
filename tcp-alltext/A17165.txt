            LONDON Printed by Valentine Sims dwelling in Adling street, at the signe of the white Swan, neare Bainards castel, 1595.
         
         
            
            
            To the right worshipfull sir Thomas Hilton knight, Baron of Hilton, and Captaine of the king and Queens maiesties castel of Tinmouth, William Bullein wisheth encrease of worship and health.
            
               
                  QVintus Curtius, the famous writer of the great battels that king Alexander, the sonne of Philip of Macedonie, had agaynst the most noble and rich king of the Medes and Persians, called Darius (right worshipful sir) declareth (that when one Philip the Phisition vnto the said king Alexander, and his most trustie subiect,) by sodain chaunce the king fell sore sicke, to the great heauines of all his royall armie, at which time with all speede this phisition did prepare a medicine, most excellent for his souereigne Lord, whom he so dearely loued, to this end, that the great vertue thereof might preuent his present sicknesse, and immenent danger: but malicious spite that wretched enemie, which neuer sleepeth but watcheth euer, to bring



vertue and good fame to destruction: Immediatly before this gentle Philip did present himselfe vnto the king with his medicine, Letters were sent to king Alexander, containing, that the said Philip was corrupted so with money from king Darius, that he had put most deadly poison and vncurable venom into Alexanders medicin. The king perusing the letters, kept them secret vntill he had drunke his medicin, and immediatly hee tooke his phisition by the hand, and deliuered him the letters that he might reade them, hauing in him so great confidence, that he did in no maner of case mistrust him. The cause why I haue alledged this most worthy prince king Alexander, and his excellent phisition Philip, is to declare the great trust in the one, and the fidelitie in the other, not forgetting the shamelesse conditions of the flattering Parasites, which euer walke with two faces in one hood, bearing fire in the one hand, and water in the other: sowers of discord, reapers of mischiefe: which be alwayes enemies vnto the disciples of Philip, whose venemous stings can not hurt them, which euer haue in store the precious, Iewell of pacience, and arme themselues to doe good



to euerie good man, for the preseruation of their liues, by the true rules of the Gouernment of health, which here I am so bold to present vnto your worship. For whereas there lacketh gouernment in a common wealth, the people doe eftsoones fall into ruine. The ships that lacke good gouernance, oftentimes be cast away vpon sands and rocks. And therefore there is nothing vnder heauen that hath life, but if it lacke good gouernment, it will quickly fall into vtter decay. For like as the Creator of all things hath formed the bodies of all men, into the goodliest shapes of euery liuing thing that euer was, or euer shall be: euen so hee hath ordained for man, hearbes, fruits, rootes, seeds, plants, gums, oyles, precious stones, beasts, foules fishes, for the preseruation of health, to be moderately vsed with discretion, which peserueth the bodie in good estate, without whose vertues the bodies cannot liue, for they bee the nourishers of life. But misusing or abusing them, bringeth to the bodie many diseases, as rheumes, cathers, dropsies, impostumes, gowts, flixes, opilations, vertigoes, blindnesse, ruptures▪ fransies, with many mo noisome diseases, which come thorowe the



corruption of meats and ill aire. For what auaileth riches, honours, costly buildings, faire apparell, with all the pompe of this worlde, and to bee honoured of the people, and in the meane time to bee eaten with wormes in the breast, or in the bellie, consumed with Agues, tormented with gowtes, sorenesse, bone-ach, &c. Well, I thinke an whole Codrus is better than a sicke Mydas.
               
                  Codrus, Mydas.
               
And seeing that to possesse health, is better than to gouerne golde, insomuch that health maketh men more happie, stronger and quieter than all maner of riches, lacking health: as example. Great princes, noble men, men of great substance, when they be wrapped and enclosed with many and sundry sicknesses, and in dayly daungers of death, in their extreme paines and passions, they do more greatly couet one drop of health, than a whole tunne of gold, crying out for the helpe and counsell of the Phisition. Whom Iesus Siracke in his godly booke did counsell all wise men to honour,

                and whom the almightie God did create and ordaine for the infirmitie of mankinde, and also medicine for his helpe, and that no wise man should despise them. Therefore yet againe (right worshipfull



knight) I shall most humbly desire you, to accept the good will of him, which wisheth the yeares of your prosperous life and health, to be equall to Nestor, Arganton,
               
                  Nestor. Galen. Arganton.
                and Galen, whose liues were long, healthfull and happie. And thus wishing the dayly encrease of your worship, with continuall health, to Gods pleasure: who euer be your guide and gouernor, Amen. Your worships to commaund.

               I know well your goodly expence of time, I wis it is no maruell, although you make your bellie your god, and boast of it. You sée that all lustie reuellers, and continual banket makers, come to great estimation, as for example, Varius Haelyogabalus,


                  
which was dayly fedde with many hundred fishes and foules, and was accompanied with manie brothels, baudes, harlots and gluttons, and thus it doeth appeare by your abhorring vertue, that of right you might haue claimed a great office in Haeliogabalus court,

               Good counsell is a treasure to wise men, but a verie trifle to a foole, if thou haddest seene those things which I haue séene, I knowe thou wouldest not be such a man, nor thus spend thy time.

               I haue séene many notable and grieuous plagues, which haue



fallen vpon gréedie gluttons, as wasting their substance, disforming their bodies, shortning their pleasant daies:The iust ceward of belly gods. and in this poynt to conclude with thée, whereas gluttonie remaineth, from thence is moderate diet banished: and those bellies that follow the lust of the eyes (in meates) in youth, shall lacke the health of all their bodies, in age if they liue so long.

It is the verie graine whereof commeth stinking vomits, sausy faces, dropsies, vertigo, palsies, obstructions, blindnes, flixes, apoplexis, caters, and rheumes, &c.

               Would to God dayly experience did not trie it, I doe perfectly know it. And once thou shalt be a witnesse thereof, if thou come to age.

                  Then I beseech thee gentle friend Humfrey, declare to mee, whie there is such diuision among Phisitions.
               
            
            
               Hum.
               Thou seest among the Theologians there is much varietie, and yet but one truth.Uarietie of opinions among men. Discords bee soone knowne of Musitions, and the Physitions be not ignorant of the generall natures of things. No diuision is although it doe so appeare: for regents, place, age, time, and the present state of mans nature must bée obserued, and not the olde rules in all poynts. For mans nature is sore altered and changed, into a viler sort than it was woont to bee.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  Some doe report that men of great estimation say: what needeth phisicke,
                  An obiection against physicke. 
                  it is but an inuention only for money, we see (say they) who liueth so wel, as they which neuer knewe phisicke, and so euill as these pothicarie men?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               Many men be more rich than wise, and more estéemed for titles of their honours and worships, than for any other vertue or cunning, such men in some pointes, be more ingratefull to naturall remedies than dogges:



which can elect or choose their vomitting grasse, or birdes which can choose grauell or stones for their casting. But to conclude with thée in this matter, Plinie the great clearke, hath a thousand reasons,God the authour of physicke. to proue them foolish that will obiect agaynst physicke. And the authour of all things did well foresée and knowe,The inestimable goodnes of God ordained hearbes for the health of man. what was good for mans nature, when hee stretched out so large a compasse round about the earth, with the noble Planets and signes, and their courses, influences and heauenly qualities, and garnished the earth with fruits, hearbs, flowers, leaues, graines, oyles, gums, stones, for mans comfort and helpe, and ordained the Physition for to helpe man. Thus the Almightie hath done (sayeth Salomon.) And in recompence,
                     Salomon.
                   God hath not appointed the Phisitions to be rayled vpon, or despised,
                     Eccle. 36. but honoured and rewarded: yea, estéemed of princes. And seeing good nature and wise men bee on my side: I force not of other mens phantasies, with whom neither good wisedome, nor good nature is guide.
            
            
               
               Ioh.
               
                  Why is phisicke of such great authoritie, or hath it bin in estimation among olde fathers, May that be proued of thy parte?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               Yea that I can.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  If thou canst bring in any reuerent fathers that loued phisick, I will not despise, but greatly esteme it, and desire counsell in demaunding of a fewe questions.

                  The praise and excellencie of phisicke.Phisicke hath beene in so hie an estimation, that the Gentiles did al consent, it came from the immortall gods. The Hebrues did well knowe it, as Moises in the most auncient booke,
                     Moises.
                   called Genesis primo, doth describe the worke of the almightie God: of herbs, fruites,
                     Adam.
                   and plantes, that Adam might teach the vertues of thē to his children.

their nature to others that followed him. After that came in Aesculapius, which did many most excellent cures. And Chiron, the instructer of Achilles,

                   whose name can neuer die as long as the herbe Centauri, groweth vpon the earth, which is called after his name. Podalirius, & Mechaon,

                   whose works will neuer die, for he brought in Phisicke, and digested it into faire bookes, for mans great health. Then came Galen,

                  I pray thee friend Humfrey, what is phisicke? I would bee glad to learne some of thy knowledge, for thou hast a good order in talking▪ and seeme to be grounded of authority. Therfore I am sory that I haue cōtended with thee:

                     Hippocrates in lib. de fla.
                  
                  Hippocrates in his booke of windes or blastes, saith that phisicke or medecine is but a putting to the body which it lacketh, or taking from the bodie things superfluous. And although our life be short,A definicion of physicke. yet the art of phisick is long, because great numbers of things be in it, and requireth much study, labour and practise, and first of all, it requireth much contēplacion or knowledge,
                     Hippocrates in primo
                   in studying good bookes, which is called Theoricha. Secondly the very effect of contemplation or study,
                     Aphoris.
                   
                  
                     Theoricha.
                   is practica or actiua, which is doing of the things, that learning hath taught, as reparing, amending, or preseruing the bodies of men, women and children, &c.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  It seemeth to be a goodly science.

                  Herodotus sayeth: they greatly erre that call it a Science, for it is an excellent Art in doing of notable things. And science is but to know thinges. There is also in this excellēt art sundry sectes of phisicions, some be



called Emperici, who suppose that only experience doeth suffise,
                     Emperic.
                   and so by vse and experience dooe take in hande to heale diseases, not knowing the cause of the said disease or sickenes.

                   which neither obserue tyme, place, age, state, nor condition: & think them things of smal profit, but onely their respect is to their disease: they loue not lōg study in phisick, & are greatly deceyued, because they would build without foundation: and haue the fruits before they haue planted the trées. These mens cures bee but by chaunce medly. One Sirus began this, which receyued certaine rules of Asclepiades.

                     Dogmatici.
                   These be the wise men which set not the cart before the horse, nor the rootes of the trées vpward. They doe prudently consider the chaunge of mans nature, the dwelling place, the alteration of



the aire, the time of the yeare, the custome of people, the maners of diseases, the fashions of mens diet. And this they will proue by true arguments and reasons, and will bee verie carefull for their patientes· The disciples of those men, be the best scholers, therefore I counsell thee Iohn to loue wel Hippocrates the prince of Phisicions,
                     Hippocrates.
                   which began the best maner to giue rules to al the louers of phisicke. Of this writeth Galen, much lauding Hippocrates and his followers, and in these daies Leonhardus Futchius, Matheolus, &c.

                  Phisicke deuided into fiue partes. The first is, to consider the nature of mans bodie. The second is, to kéepe the bodie in health, and to defend it from sickenes and infirmities. The third is, to know all the causes, rules, and seedes, whereof the sicknes doth grow. The .iiii is Crises or iudgemēt



of the disease of thinges present, past, and to come. The fifth is the best and most excellēt, for it sheweth the maner of healing, dieting, fashion, order, and way to helpe the sicke bodie, and preserue the same, as long as man doth remaine in the state of life.

               Fat nourisheth, and makes subtile inough.
               Stiptike or rough taste on the tongue,
               Bindeth and comforteth appetite long.
               Sweet things in clensing, is very good
               
                  It dissolueth much, and nourisheth blood.
               These things well vsed, nature will please,
               But abusing them beastly, bringeth disease.
            
            
               Iohn.
               
                  In good faith, me thinks thou sayest well, for there apeare perfite reasons in these thy prety rules. Now thou hast declared vnto mee, the signes of complexions of men: with the way and apt knowledge of meates by their tastes, I would faine learne, shortlie the temperaments and complections of mankinde.

               There was neuer so discreet nor wise phisition, that either feared God, or pitied mankind, or loued his owne honestie, would take in hand either to prescribe diet, or to minister medicin to any body, before he wel did consider, and wisely wey with himself, the temperament, mixture or cōplexion of mankind: first, whether he were hot or colde, moist or drie, fat or leane, or indifferent betwene them both:

                   tempered by health, or distempered by sicknesse, as the extremities of hotenesse, coldnesse, moistnesse, and drynesse. Therefore Iohn, these things may not bée forgotten: you must note also the



foure ages of mankinde, & first the tender state of children, which beginneth at the birth, & so continueth vntill xv. yeres next after their said birth: Their temperaments or complections, be hot and moist, very like vnto ye seed wherof they bee procreated, then next vnto childhood or innocēt age. Youth which is the second part of life, beginneth to reigne, his temperament or complection hath rather more firy heat, than perfite naturall heat, and this second age, continueth for ten yeares, as Galen sayth.
                     Gal. lib. 5. Aphor. commen. 9. Well, in these two first states of life, let all naturall fathers & mothers bring vp their youth, set God before their eyes,An earnest briefe exhortation for the bringing vp of youth. for they haue no smal charge committed vnto them, that must giue account to God, how they haue brought vp their children: and they that in these yeres do space correction, truly be grieuous enemies vnto their children, and at last shalbe recōpensed with shame, when they shall sée misfortune & wretchednesse fall vpon the fruites of their owne séeds. For men haue smal profite of their corne, which be choked and ouercome with Thistles, Bryers, and



Brakes which were not weeded in time, much lesse of their children, which haue receyued neyther correction nor honest learning in due season. If the kéepers of gardens be carefull ouer their late sowne séedes, and tender hearbes, which are in daunger to bee destroyed of euerie frost: What shoulde good fathers and mothers doe for their children, whose tender and youthfull yeares bee caryed away, and ouercommed of euerie foolish fantasie, and it is no maruaile. But this shall suffice for the wise, and smally profite the fooles: but to my matter which I tooke in hande, I will returne vnto the thirde age of mankinde, which is called the lustie state of life, and beginneth at xxv. yeares, and continueth vnto xxxv, This age is hote and drie, and verie cholericke, as Galen sayth:
                     Galen. in lib. Simp.
                   This part of life is subiect, to manie burning and extreeme feuers, and hote vlcers: therefore it is necessarie to knowe this temperament of complection, which is called cholericke, as plainely may appeare by age,



strength, diet, vrine, &c.
               This is the best time for mankind to trauell in, with godly exercise in science, arte, and profitable trauelles in his vocation, putting in practise, the vertues which he hath learned in youth, for this is the sommer part of life, wherein all goodly frutes do florish in euerie good occupation.The best time to prouide for age. This is the very haruest, to gather the precious corne, and the frute of their labours against the colde stormes and cloudie daies of their aged winter, wherein the bodie shallbe weake, and the eies sight decay, and the handes tremble, and therefore it is not comely to sée the state of age, without rest, which in the time of youth, did honestly trauell. For there is a grace giuen to many creatures vnreasonable, both beastes and foules: to make prouision before hande, what is then to be required of men reasonable, as foloweth in these verses.

The riots, surfets, sore labours, bearing of extreame burdens, wrestling, actes venerous with the abuse of youth, wil then spring forth, to the detriment of age and sodaine decay of life, in especiall of drunkardes.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  What, be the places of bloud, Choler, Fleugme, & Melancoly, naturall or vnnatrual? Thou hast not made a particular distinction of their proper places, but generally thou hast spoken well in thy song.
               
            
            
               Hum.
               There are also other descriptions of the foure humors very necessarie to bee knowen, and their places whereas they dwell within the



body, and first of bloud, as Galen saieth: in his first booke of effected places, bloud (saieth he) that is in the pulses, doeth greatly differ from the bloud of the veines, for the bloud of the pulses is thinner, yelower and hotter, and this bloud, may bée called the gouernor of life.The foure humours naturall and vnnaturall are described. The spring and fountaine of the bloud generall is in the liuer, which serueth euery veine of bloud, and this bloud in colour is verie redde. Fleugme is white, & is ingendred in the stomacke, and at length by the vertue of naturall heate, pure fleame is turned into bloud. There be also watrie, slimy, glassie, grosse, salt, sower, thicke, hard binding, and extreme cold fleames, which in dede be vnnaturall, that bée engendred thorowe surfets, coldnes or idlenes, bringing to the body many noisome deseases. There is also choler, which is yelowe, whose place in the body is the gall, which commeth of the clensing or purifying of bloud: and this choler is cleare, hote and drie, and the comforter of decoction. Greene choler, or choler myngled with fleugme, be vnnaturall, melancholie



naturall: in the Splene is nothing but the sixe degrées, or heauie residents of the bloud, the naturall melancholie is knowen by his blackenesse, the vnnaturall commeth of the burning of choler, and is lighter and hoter, browne of colour, sower of taste, and putteth the bodie in great daunger: as madnesse, blacke ianders, continuall feuers, and sodaine deadly diseases. Therefore my friend Iohn, remember this short description of humours,
                     Auicen in lib. can.
                   as the wordes of Galen and Auicen say.
            
            
               Iohn.
               
                  Thus I haue heard thy seuerall placing of the foure complections of bloud, Choler, Fleugme and Melancholie, and is there anie distinct hotenesse, coldnesse, moystnesse, and drinesse, in anie other creature besides man? tell me.
               
            
            
               Hum.
               Not onely in man, but in beastes, fish, foule, serpents, trées, hearbes, mettals, and euerie thing sensible and insensible, according to their natures, and bee equally mingled or tempered togither, which is called meane temperance, or else exceedeth



in degrées, which is called intemperance, hote and moist, may be compounded together, so may colde and drie, hote and drie, colde and moist: example, A cholericke man, hote and drie:
                     Galen. in lib. 4. de tempor.
                   a fleugmatike man, colde and moyst, &c. Of hearbes, as Hysope and Rew, hot and drie, Purslen and Cowcumbers, cold and moist, &c. But temperaments or complections of men, beasts, and trées, be some hoter, some colder, according to their natures. As a Lion is hoter than a cholericke man: Pepper is hotter than Cloues. And though there be degrées in more hotnesse or more coldnesse, yet they are called but hote or cold, as men after labour or trauell, they will say they are hot, but the fire which people warme them at, is hotter.
               Also there bee things repugnant to temperaments, as moyste and drynesse together, heate and coldenesse together, as fyre to bee colde, or the water of his owne nature to bee hote, which water peraccidence of the fire is made hote: and fire quenched by the water. And euerie



thing exceeding greatly with distemperaunce or wanting temperaunce or complexion, do eftsoones come to an end, as man by extreme sicknesses, surfets or woundes, or finally age. lacking naturall vertue. Of heate and moistnes of trees and hearbes, from whom iuice and sap is withdrawen,
                     Galen. in lib. 4. de tempor. Arist. de Gene.
                   these things of necessitie must needes die, and come to corruption, as Galen and Aristotle saie.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  Whether be men or women of colder complexion?

                     Auicen.
                   like as men be hot and drie, so be women colde and moist.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  Yea but Lucian saieth: they be perillous hot of their tongues & full of venim: though I am no phisicion, yet can I make a description of that member,
                  Whether this be true let the married iudge 
                  for I am oftentimes stinged with it, I would to God they had beene wormed when they were young, but when they are olde, they are past all cure: but the best medicine that I haue, it is a gentle herbe called Rewe, of which I am neuer without great store.

to this ende, that hee might cloathe himselfe with other creatures:Euery thing bringing his apparell with him, sauing man. which hee brought not into this world with him, as cloath, leather, harnesse made of iron, for his defence, because he is the chiefe creature. But horses of nature haue hard hooffes, Lions sharpe téeth, Porpentines sharpe prickes, which is their continuall and naturall armour, as thinges euer prepared to debate and strife, and by no Art can scant bee tamed. The Rose as pleasauntly as shee doeth appeare, and as swéetely as shee doeth smell, spring not further without a greate number of sharpe prickes. Therefore it is tollerable for men to beare with them whom nature hath sealed and marked for his owne.

                  Seeing thou wilt not describe me these particular members, of which wee haue spoken, I would bee glad to know the partes of mankinde, with a



short description of his members.
               
            
            
               Hum.
               Members be simple and also compound, the simples be ten in number, the cartillages, the gristles, the bones, veynes, and synewes, arteries, pannicles, lygaments, cordes, and the skinne. Members compounded,A definition of members. bee those that be ioyned and builded together of simple members, as the handes, face, feete, lyuer, and heart, and so compounded members be made of simple.
               Some of the compounded members be called principalles: as the heart from whence the arteries springs, the braine, from whence the sinewes springes, the liuer which is the well of the bloud, from whence the veines doe spring, and the stones of generation from whence the seed of life springeth: but those compounded members that bee principall bee all the other members except the simple, as the nose, the eares, the eies, the face, the necke, the armes and legges, and the braines and chiefe substaunce of our flesh, bee compounded members of sinewes, and couered with panacles which bee of a



sinew nature, but that sinewes giue féeling to all the whole bodie: euen as the arteries giueth spirituall bloud from the heart to euerie member. The whole body is couered with filmes and skinnes. Out of the head springeth hard matter issuing from the places called the pores, to purge vapours and smoke from the braine, which ascendeth out of the stomacke into the head, and is cleansed through pia mater, called the tender couering of the braine or spirites animall. And therefore as some partes of the bodie being diuided in sunder, be each like vnto the other, and yet called by the name of the whole, as for example: When the bones be broken in sunder, or the flesh cut into diuerse péeces, or the blood powred into sundrie vessels, a péece of flesh is still called flesh,A part is called by the name of the whole and not the whole by the part. a fragment of a bone, is called a bone, and a droppe of blood is called bloud: Euen so an hande, arme, veyne, or such like vnseparate partes beeing diuided into péeces, or called by the name of péeces, and not by the name of the whole part (as is before.) But my friend



                  Iohn, to make a large description of Anatomie, it were too long for mee, but shortly I will say some thing. And first, the definition thereof is, when the bodie of a dead man or woman, is cut and opened and the members diuided,What Annothomie is. or for the want of dead bodies to reade good bookes, as Galen, Auicen, &c. And it behooueth them that cutteth a deade corpse, to note foure things. First,Foure things considered in the bodie of man. the nutrimentall members, as the liuer with the veynes: the second is, the members spirituall, as the heart with the arteries:Example. the third is, the animall members, as the head, braines and sinewes: the fourth and last, be excrements of the bodie, as armes, legges, skin, haire, &c. Of these said members, with the bones, is all the bodie compounded. And like as euerie trée and hearbe, haue their rootes in the earth, and their braunches springeth vpward, euen so the rootes of mankinde, haue the beginning in the braine, and the sinew and branches groweth downeward: in the which braine, dwelleth the vertues of imagination, fantasie, memorie, &c.



And these animall vertues, be placed as it were heauenly aboue al the mē
                  bers, communicating their heauenly influences, down vnto the heart, as to a prince, or chiefe ruler within the body, which giueth life to euery part thereof Thou shalt consider, that the hart was the first that receiued life from the spirites, and shalbe the last that shall die. Note also, that as there be noble sences giuen to the body, as seeing, hearing, smelling tasting, féeling: euen so nature hath foure principall vertues, first Attractiue, the second Retentiue, the third Digestiue, the fourth Expulsiue. Attractiue is that by the which euery part of the body draweth the food of life, & serueth the vertue disgestiue, and the Retentiue doeth holde the meate vntill it be readie to be altered and changed. Digestiue doth alter, and maketh the foode like vnto the thing that it nourisheth, as fleme, bloud, &c. Expulsiue separateth them from the other, the good from the bad. Thou oughtest also most chiefly to learne the knowledge of the veines, and for what sicknesse, they must bée opened, and



what medicins either in sirups or pils thou must vse. And first marke this figure of the Anatomie here present before thee, with the heauenly signes, because I haue not painted at large the seuerall parts of the said Anatomie.
               
               
                  The middle veine of the forehead is good to be opened against Megrim, forgetfulnes, & passions of the head. And they that be let blood of this, or any other veyne, must first haue their head purged with pillule Chochi Rasis, or some purgation, but first vse thinges to extenuate matter, as syrruppe of Buglosse, &c.
               Against Leprosy and deafnes. Let bloud the two veines behind the eares, and vse the said pilles or els pillule Aurea Nicholai or Arabice, or cōfectio Hameth minor.
               
               Against replexion or too much blood, or bloud in the eies, flowing in the head, vpon the temple veines called Artiers, for they bée euer beating. And vse to purge with pillule Artritice Nicholai or puluis, ad epithema Hepatis.
               
               Against Squinancie, stopping the throte, and stopping of the breath: Let bloud the veines vnder the tongue. And for this vse Philoniūmaius Necholai and Gargarismes pilule Bechie and oxymel Simplex.
               
               Ueines called Originales, open not



without great counsaile of a learned Physicion, or cunning Chirurgion. They be in the necke, and haue a great course of bloud, that gouerneth the head, and the whole body.
               Against short winde, and euill bloud aproching to the heart, and spitting bloud. Open the vaine called Cordiaca, or heart veine, in the arme. Use thinges to extenuate, as Aromaticum, Chariophillatum Mesue, serapium ex Absinthij in colde time, serapium Boraginis hote time, and pillule stomachi.
               
               Agaynst palsie, yellow Iaundies, burning heats, and apostumations of the liuer. Open the liuer vein vpon the right arme. Take Serapium exendiue. Diamargariton frigidum Auicennie.
               
               Against dropsy,Dropsy. open the veine betweene the belly and the braunch, the right side against the said dropsy, and the left side against the passions of the milte, but bée not rash, vnlesse ye haue the consaile of one well seene in the Anothomie. Use pillule Hiere cum Agarico.

               Within twentie houres after one is infected with the pestilence, comming sodenly: Open the vein betwéen the wrest of the foote, and the great toe. Use Serapium Cichorij, and Pillule pestilentialis Ruffi.
               
               Against stinking breath: Open the veyne betwéene the lip, and the chin. Use for this Catharicum imperiale. Nicho. Alexandri.
               
               Against the toothake: Open the veine in the roofe of the mouth. And first purge with Pillule. Choci Rasis, or with pilles of masticke.

                  Against quartens, tercians, and paines of the left side: Open the splene veine, commonly called the low veine, with a wide cut, and not deepe: For Chirurgions nicely pricking or opening veynes, with little Scarisfactions, doe let out good pure bloud, and still retaine, grosse, colde, and drie earthly matter, to the great hurt of



their patients. And albeit many more veynes might here be spoken of, and their vtilities, yet this shall well suffice by Gods grace to kéepe all people in health, that vpon iust cause haue these veynes opened: except olde men, women with childe, and children, vnder xiiii. yeares of age, or men after diuerse agues. For bloud letting, will then engender perillous palsies, as verie excellent Phisitions haue well declared. And after one be infected with the pestilence xxiiii. houres, before hee haue receyued medicine,Miracle helpeth, but no medicine in this case. or bloud letting, miracle helpeth him, but truly no medicine hath vertue to doe it.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  This same figure although it appeareth in many bookes: yet verie fewe do vnderstand it in all points, such be the secrete workes of nature. And whereas thou hast well spoken of some veynes, and apt medicines for the body: I woulde faine see the true forme and shape of the bones.
               
            
            
               Hum.
               Oh Iohn, it were a long time to shewe the singular members with compounds, as Galen doth in his booke of the partes and bones. It requireth



onely one worke, but I haue taken in hand to teach thee but a Gouernment of health: notwithstanding at thy request, I will briefly rehearse the number of the bones, no lesse true than newe, which is, the verie timber, or postes whereupon our fraile flesh is builded, beginning in our mothers wombes, and ending in earth the mother of all things. And as the noble prince Auicen affirmeth, the number of all the bones, be two hundred fourty and foure, beside Sasamina, & Os laude.

                  Thou hast spoken of the opening of veynes, and medicins conuenient to cleanse the bloud, with the number of bones, but thou hast not spoken of conuenient time when to let blood, nor of the state or age of them whose veynes should be opened. Therefore I would be glad to learne, not onely time of bloud-letting, but also, of purging, the belly vomits, bathings, neesings, and rubbing of the bodie, &c.

                  Time for all things.Euery thing hath his time conuenient, and must bee done with sober discretion, and not with rash ignorance, which killeth an infinite



number. Therefore the cause must be knowne, and the time obserued, as Galen writeth in the Commentarie of the Afforismes of Hippocrates,

                        . Affor. 3. manie bodies be extinguished by suddē death, in whom is extreme fulnesse, or aboundance. For aboundance of blood or any other humor sayth Aristotle,
                  
                     Aristot. in pri. prob. 56. Auic. in 2. pri. doct. 2. cap. 6. is the cause of many sickenesses, and those men that vse much gluttonie in Winter, shall bee apt to receyue manie diseases in the Spring time. Therefore when the bodie hath extreme heat, fulnes of veynes, flushing, with sodain rednesse in the face, grosse and red vrine, and such burning heate in the night that let the sleepe, &c: then it is tyme to euacuate the bodie, with some purgation, bloud letting, or abstinence as the strength and age of the patient will serue. For manie diseases, be helped by discrete bloud letting, as Plurises, hot Feuers,
                     Galen in lib. de flobothomia.
                   Frensies, Repletion, or Surfets taken with ouermuch eating or drinking, as Galen sayeth, The letting of bloud dryeth vppe the superfluous moysture of the bellie, helpeth memorie,



purgeth the bladder, quieteth ye braine, warmeth the marrow, openeth the organs of hearing, helpeth digestion, induceth sleepe, &c. Unto this agréeth Rasis,
                  
                     Rasis in 4. alman. cap. 14. saying, it helpeth greatly against Leprosie, Squinances, Appoplexes, Pestilences, &c. But olde men, children, or women with childe, ought not to be let bloud, nor also those people that dwell in colde regions, may not be let bloud, because the bloud is the chief warmer of nature. The people that dwell in hot regions, if they be letten bloud, it will dry their bodies, for blood is the chiefe moister of nature. Therefore is the heate of Sommer, and the coldnesse of Winter, forbidden to open veynes, or let bloud, except for a stripe, or sudden chaunce,
                     Rasis in 4. allmen. cap. 14. as Rasis sayth, the spring of the yeare is the chiefe time to let bloud in the right arme, or right foote,The middle

with great discretion, and not rashly to be taken, for euerie trifle as thou hast heard me speake of bloud letting. So obserue the selfe same rules in purgation, as time, person, qualitie, or quantitie.
                     Hip. in 3. pri. doct. 2. cap.
                   For Hippocrates sayeth, without doubt it is needfull to purge the superfluitie of the bodie. As if bloud doe abound to take things to purge blood. If fleugme be superfluous, then take things to cleanse his superfluitie. If choler bée too ardent hote, vse things to extinguish: If melancholy be too extreme then taste things to bring him into a meane. And not to purge one humour with the medicines of an other,Vsurpation in medicine is euill. but to take them in due order and aptnes. For the said humors as Valarius Cordus. Mesue, and Nicholas, teach the maner of making of the most excellent purgations with their quantities.In the morning is best to let bloud, euill toward night. And as in blood letting sléepe must bee auoyded for viii. or xii. houres after them: so when your purgations be taken, aire is to be auoided and to be kept close for ii. or thrée daies or more as the malice of the disease, or power of the purgations be, & the counsaile



of Rasis must bee followed:
                     Rasis in 4. alman. cap. 15. which sayth, oftentimes to take Purgations or laxatiue medicines doeth make the bodie weake, and apt to the Feuer ethicke, and specially in verie leane or weake persons, they that bee verie fat haue small guts and veynes, purgations bee verie noisome vnto them. But strong bodies hauing large vessels, may sustaine purgations without any hurt, but strong purgations, either in pils or potions, if they any thing do excéede be verie hurtfull: therefore the doces or quantities may not excéede. And also they must bee made as pleasant as Art can doe them, vnlesse they offend the stomacke.Meates and medicines greeth not except pils
                        •
                      before supper. 
                  Hippocrates giueth counsell that men should not mingle medicins with meate, but to take them thrée or foure hours before meat, or else so long after. Unlesse they bee pils called Antecibum, which may bée taken at the beginning of supper, or else Pilli chochi, a little before sléepe, two hours after supper. The best time of purgations is in the spring time,Time to purge. as the doctors doth affirme: the apt dayes and signes are commonly knowne in



the English Almanacks, calculated into English. As in the writings of master Leonard Digges,
                  
                     Digges. Kenningham.
                   and of William Kenningham, a learned student both in Astronomie and Phisicke, with manie mo good men that taketh paynes to profite the common wealth. There is another maner of purging of the bodie by vomit,Vomits and their profits. for it clenseth from the midriffe vpward, if they haue large brests, and be cholericke persons. It is good against dropsies, & leprosies, & better in summer than in winter,
                     Hip. Sent. in 4. Aphoris.
                   as Hippocrates saith: and wholsomer one houre before supper than at any other time, and not to be vsed as a custome:Custome of vomit weakneth the stomacke. for the custome of vomits hurteth greatly the head and eies, and maketh the stomack so féeble, that it will scant beare anie meates or drinkes, but eftsoones cast them vp again. They which haue narrowe throtes and breastes, and long neckes, vomits be neither apt nor good for them. And Auicen saith,
                     Auicen in 4. Pri. cap. 13. that vomits ought to bee twise in the Moneth for the conseruation of health, but that which is more doeth hurt the bodie.Of bathes and their properties. There is another kinde of the



clensing of the body by sweating, as with hot drinkes, warme clothes, perfumes made of Olibalum brimstone, niter, &c. There is also bathes and sweating in hot houses for the pockes, scurffe, scabbes, hemerodes, piles, which hot houses haue the vertue of helping the saide diseases.The discommoditie of common hote houses. But if any that be of an whole temperate complexion do sweate in drie hot houses, it doth them much harme: as hyndring their eyesights, decaying their teeth, hurting memory. The best bathing is in a great vessel, or a litle close place with the euapuration of diuers sweete hearbes wel sodden in water, which haue vertue to open the poores softly, letting out feeble and grosse vapors, which lieth betwene the skinne and the flesh.To vse oyntments after bathings is good. This kinde of bathing is good in the time of pestilence, or feuer quarten: in the end of the bathes, it is good to anoint the body with some swéete oyle, to molifie and make soft the sinewes. And thus to conclude of bathing, it is verie holsome, so that it be not doone vppon an emptie stomacke,To bathe vpon an empty stomacke is perilous. palsies may come thereby, or to take



sodaine colde after it, there foloweth an other purgation, called neesing or sternutacion which is beneficial for the bodie if it be vsed vpon an empty stomacke.Of neesing Twyse or thrise in a morning with a leafe of Bittony, put into thy nose, it helpeth memory, good against opilation, stopping, and obstructions: Suppositers be good for weake people or children,Of suppositers made with Hieria Picra and hony,Boxing doth much good to the bodye. made in the length of a finger: Scarifiyng or boxing, as Galen saith, applied vnto the extreme partes, as the legges, and the armes, doth great helpe vnto the body, in drawing watery humour away from the body, but boxing is not good for the brest, applied thereto in hote feuers, is daungerous. Glisters made according to arte,I will speake more of Glisters in my booke of healthful medicines. be good for them whieh be too weake to take purgation. The maner of the said glisters, because they be not here to be spoken of at large, I entend by Gods grace to set forth in my next book of helthful medicins.Many practitioners of actes venerous. Purgations venerous, there be so many practicioners thereof, that I neede to write no rules but this, that affection, lust and

                  Plaine people in the countrie, as carters threshers, ditchers, colliers, and plowmen, vse seldome times to wash their hands, as appeareth by their filthynes, and as verie few times combe their heads, as it is seene by floxe, nittes, grease, fethers, strawe, and such like, which hangeth in their haires. Whether is washing or combing things to decorate or garnish the body, or els to bring health to the same?

               Hum.
               Thou séest that the deere, horse, or cowe, will vse friction or rubbing them selues against trees both for their ease and health. Birdes and haukes, after their bathing will prune and rowse them selues vpon their braunches and perkes, and all for health.The profit which cōmeth in washing the handes with cold water. What should man do, which is, reasonable but to kéepe himself cleane, and often to wash the handes, which is a thing most comfortable to coole the heate of the liuer, if it bee done often, the handes be also the instrumentes to the mouth & eies, with many other thinges commonly to serue the bodie.



To wash the handes in cold water is very holsome for the stomake and lyuer,Hot water is holsome to wash hands in but to wash with hot water engendreth rheumes, wormes and corruption, in the stomacke, because it pulleth away naturall heate vnto the warmed place, which is washed.Frication is holsom for the body. Frication or rubbing the bodie, is good to be done in mornings after the purgation of the belly with warme clothes, from the head to the brest, then to the belly, from the belly to the thighes, legges, and so forth. So that it be done downwarde, it is good. And in drie folkes to be rubbed with the oyle of camomill.Combing the head Kembing of the head is good in mornings, and doth comfort memorie, it is euil at night and openeth the pores. The cutting of the haire,Cutting of haire and paring of nayles be comly for men. and the paring of the nailes, cleane keepeing of the eares, and teeth, be not only thinges comely and honest, but also holsome rules of Phisicke for to be superfluous things of the excrements.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  The chiefe thing that I had thought to haue demanded, & the very marke that I would haue thee to shote at, is to tell me some thing of dieting



my selfe with meate and drinke, in health and sickenesse.
               
            
            
               Hum.
               
                  A consideration to be had in eating and drinking.There is to be considered in eating, the time of hunger or custome, the place of eating and drinking, whether it be colde or hote, also the time of the yéere, whether it bee Winter or Summer: also the age or complexion of the eater, and whether he bee whole or sicke: also the things which be eaten, whether they be fish or flesh, fruits or herbes. Note also the complections and temperaments of the said meates hot or colde, drie or moyst, and most chiefly, marke the quantitie, and so forth. And like as lampes doe consume the oyle, which is put vnto them, for the preseruation of the light, although it cannot continue for euer: so is the naturall heate which is within vs preserued by humiditie and moystnesse of bloud and fleugme, whose chief engenderer be good meates & drinkes. As Auicen saith de ethica. When naturall heate is quenched in the bodie, then of necessitie the soule must depart from the bodie. For the workman can not worke when his instrument is



gone. So the spirits of life,A cause why the soule departeth from the body. can haue no exercise in the body when there is no naturall heate to worke vpon. Without meate saith Galen, it is not possible for any man to liue, either whole or sicke: and thus to conclude, no vital thing liueth without refection and sustenaunce, whether it be animall reasonable, or animall sensible, without reason or any vital thing insensible, both man, beast, fish, and worme, trée, or hearb. All these things be newtrified with the influence or substaunce of the foure Elementes or any of them.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  Well Humfrey, thou knowest my complexion and disorder of my diet what remedy for me, that haue liued like a riotter?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               I know it well thou arte flegmatike,To eate both fish and flesh together hurteth the flegmatick. and therefore it is long yer thy meate be disgested. When thou dost eate fish and flesh together, it doth corrupt in thy stomack and stink, euen so doth hard cheese and cold fruits. And olde poudred meates, and raw hearbes ingender euil humors: so the diuersity of quality & quantity of diuers meats,



doth bring much paine to the stomack, & doth engender many diseases, as thou maist reade in the first booke of Galen: Inuementis membrorum. cap. iiij.
                  
                     Galen.
                   And the Prince himselfe sayeth in 3. prim. doct. 2. cap. 7.
                     Hippocrates.
                   Saying, nothing is more hurtfull than diuerse meates to be ioyned together. For while as the last is receyuing, the first beginneth to digest. And when the table is garnished with diuerse meates, some rosted, some fried and baked, some warme, some colde, some fish, some flesh, with sundrie fruites, and sallets of diuerse hearbes to please thine eye, remember with thy self, that the sight of them all is better, than the feeding of them all.
               
                  To féede of diuerse sorts of meats corrupteth the bodie.Consider with thy selfe thou art a man and no beast, therefore bee temperate in thy féeding, and remember the wise woordes of Salomon.
                  
                     Eccle. 27. Bee not gréedie, sayeth hée, in euerie eating, and bée not hastie vppon all meates: for excesse of meates bringeth sickenesse, and gluttonie commeth at the last into an vnmeasurable heate. Through surfet haue manie



a one perished, but hee that dieteth himselfe temperately,A good diet prolongeth life. prolongeth his life. Therefore grosse fish, lambs flesh, the in-meates of beastes, rawe hearbes, pigges braines, and all slimie meates, bee euill for thee: but late suppers is woorst of all, and specially if they bee long, for it causeth painfull nights to follow. But Galen sayeth in his Booke De ethimia, the meates which bee without all blame, bée those which bee betwéene subtill and grosse. Good bread of cleane wheat, flesh of capons or hennes, phesants, and partriches, pigeons, and turtle doues, blacke birdes, and small fielde birdes, rosted veale, or boyled mutton: These doe engender good bloud sayeth Galen. Note also,What kinde of meates doe cause good blood. that any other meate that thou doest eate at supper, although it séeme repugnant to a fleugmaticke stomacke, if thou sleepe well after it, and féele no paine, thou mayest vse it as a meate necessarie. And when thou canst not sleepe well, if the default came through meate, marke that meate or drinke, although it appeare pleasant, refuse it as an enemie.
               
                  And whereas thou hast vsed euill diet as a custome in abusing time, quantitie and qualitie, by little and little bring thy selfe into good order, and to time, both for thy breakfasts, dinner, and supper. Prouided alway to eate good things, but not many things. For like as repletion or abundaunce of meate is an enemie to the bodie, and the soule, and bringeth sodaine death: euen so is emptinesse a shortner of time,What hurt commeth of an emptie stomacke, when ye go to bed. a weakner of the braine, a hinderer of memory, an increaser of wind, choler, & melancholy. And oftentimes to many bringeth sudden death also, except nature haue some thing to worke vpon, as I did tell thée before: vse some light things at breakfast of perfite digestion, within foure houres after that receiue thy dinner obseruing the good order of diet, drinking wine or béere oftentimes, and little at once, eschewing great draughts of drinke, which is vsed among beasts, and mingle thy meate with mirth,An order of dieting. which is euer the best dish, at the boord, and be thankefull to God And so leaue with an appetite, passing ye time wiselie



betwéene dinner and supper, with exercise, labour, study or pastime, vnto the ende of sixe houres, and then begin thy supper, prouided that it bee shorter than thy dinner, eating thy meate by little and little: for gréedie and sudden eating is hurtfull to nature, as Galen sayth in his Diatorie. Note also,
                     Galen me trite.
                   that thou maist eate more meat in Winter than in Summer, because thy naturall heate is enclosed with thy bodie in Winter, but vniuersally spread in Summer. Also cholericke men may as lightly digest béefe, bacon, veneson, &c. With as much spéede and litle hurt as the fleugmatike man may eate, rabit chicken, and partridge, &c. But the melancholie man through the coldnesse of the stomacke hath not that strength in the stomacke as hee hath promtpnes in wil:The Melancholie. to eat things warm and moyst be good for him. The sanguine man is not so swift in this digestion, as the hote cholericke man is.The Sanguine. But notwithstanding, he hath good digestion through the humiditie and warmnes of bloud, and coueteth to eat swéete things, which greatly augment



the bloud: therfore sharpe sauces made with vinegar, onions, and barbaries bée wholesome. Purslen, sorrell, small fishes that féede vppon the stones in fayre running waters, cowcumbers and pure French wine partly delayed with water, bee good for the saide sanguine men: to kéepe them from much encrease of flesh.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  Thou hast shewed vnto me a very discrete and wholsome order of diet particular to my selfe, and partly to other complexions: but what rule or prety Gouernment is for sicke folks?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               They that be sodainlie vexed with sharpe sicknesses,An order for the dieting of such as bee sicke of sharpe feners. must haue thin diets, with water gruell, thin mutton or chicken pottage without any fat or thicknes, violet leaues, endiue leaues, and such like cooling hearbes, and let their drinkes be made of Tezantes, thus doe to them that haue hot sharpe sickenesses, occasioned of choler. And also colde siroppes of endiue, violets, sugar, water, and vinegar, sodden together bee verie wholesome. But if sickenesses bee long of continuance, their diet must bee the thicker, and



their meates made the stronger, specially if their diseases be cold: with the flesh of cocks, capons, temperate wine, stewed broath, with wholsome hearbs, as buglos, borrage, basill, parcely, and finkle rootes, with some maces, dates, damaske prunes, reisins of the sunne, and such like.Of syrops and drinkes. Sirops of Isope and citeron, prouided that they neyther take meate nor medicine immediately before, or soone after their fittes: posset ale with clarified hearbes, excepted, which they may take, for their comfort, according to the estate of their disease, for such as be sicke must haue meate, contrarie to their complexion. For they that be colde, must haue hote meate, and medicines. And they that be drie, must haue moyst thinges. But they that bée hote must haue colde thinges, for the ardent heate of the fire is quenched with the moystnesse of the water, and so the quantitie of one qualitie, ouercommeth the qualitie of an other. And in deede, Phisicke sayeth, the bodies that bee hote, must be fed with things like, as they that be moist, with moyst things to preserue



their moistnes. They that be hote, with hot things to preserue their heate and such like. But when they doe exceede in heate, cold, moist or drie, then let the qualities of moistnes, be tempered with drienes, and the coldnes with warmnes.As the complexion is, so man requireth. For like as man delighteth in things of like, as the cholericke man, cholericke things, euen so do beasts, and fruites, as the Colloquintida, which is bitter, delighteth in bitter ground. Hote spices delight to grow in hot ground, and euery fruit and hearbe doth delite in the thing that is of like: euen so doth man in his foode. But in al things let him beware of distemperaunce, surfites or repletion reare suppers and drunkennesse.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  But if a man feele great griefe after meates or drinkes, what way is there then for to helpe him?

For naturall heat that is drawen inwardly with warmnes, or heat hath power to digest. But if sleepe ease you not, prouoke vomit or fast it out, and this is the counsell of many learned men.

Sodayne great blushing or rednesse in your face, veines swelled and puffed vp, red vryne, and grosse skinne, extēded or stretched out with fulnes, like a blowen bladder and ful pulses, small desire to meat, il rest & griefe in sléepe, séeming in sléep to beare some intollerable burden, or dreaming to be spéechlesse: these be the euill & dangerous tokens of replection. And of this I giue you warning, for it hath slaine as manie by aboundance, as hunger hath killed through scarcitie.

                  I haue heard say that holsome aire is a great comfort to mans nature, but corrupt ayre doth much harme: I shall require you therefore to tell me of the good and the bad aire, that I may learne to vse the good, and refuse the bad.

                  Galen in lib. de Sectis. saieth: A wise phisicion ought to know the natures of men, of waters, of aire, of regions, and dwellings, generally, particularly to thy self, being a naturall



English man of birth and education: this land is very temperat. Howbeit, our dwellinges in this land, be variable as fennes, marishes, woods, heithes valleis, playnes, and rockie places, and neare the sea side.Note which be the most wholsomest aires to dwell in. But the said Galen geueth counsell in his regiment of health, saying: a good aire, which is pure and holsome, is that, which is not troubled in standing water pooles. Therefore marish grounds and places where hempe and flax is rotten, & dead carrions be cast, or multitudes of people dwelling together, or houses enuironed with standing waters, whereinto iakes or sinks, haue issues, or wallowing of swine,What aires corrupt the blood. or carion vnburied or foule houses, or such like places be dangerous, corrupteth the bloud, which is worse than infection of meate, for the prince, saith that al places of cōcauets, as sellers, vaults, holes of minerals where mettels be digged, or houses, or wals ioined togither where as the sun with reflexiō beateth in wc sodain heat, whose absence bringeth cold: this aire is distempered, but pleasant clear aire, swéete gardens, goodly hilles, in dayes



temperat when one may sée far off. These be good also,Corrupte aire bringeth sundry diseases. there be certaine stars called infortunates, in their exaltation, whose influence bringeth corruption to creatures, rot and pestilēce to man and beasts, poisoning waters, and killing of fish, blasting of fruite in trées, and corne in the fields, infecting men with diuers diseases, feuers palsies, dropsies, fransies, falling sicknesses, and leprosies. Against the said influences al christian men must pray to God to be their defence,Feruent praier vnto God, 
                        •
                     oth mittigate his wrath. for they be Gods instrumēts to punish the earth. Example we haue of mortall pestilence, horrible feuers, and sweating sicknes, and of late, a generall feuer, that this land is often greatly plaged withall.Sweete aire to be made in the time of sicknes Then one must make a fire in euerie chimney within the house, and burne swéete perfumes to purge this foule aire: and now in conclusion to answere thy question, for the health of dwelling, Auicen saith, to dwell vpon hils is cold. And in vallies comprised with hilles, is hote. Upon a hill side against the north, is cold and drie Towarde the west, grose, and



moist, verie subtill towardes the East. And cleare and warme towards the South. And Rasis saieth, in his first booke Afforien. A man dwelling néere the Sea side, or great waters, can not liue long, nor cannot be without weaknes of members, or blindnes, but the best building of a house, is vpon a drie ground,Situation best for a house and a hill towardes the west side, and southwest dores, and windowes open towards, the east, and north east, hauing neere vnto the said house, sweet springs of rūning waters from stonie or chaulkie ground, which is both pleasaunt and profitable to the house. For Hippocrates saieth in his booke of Aire and Water, the second chapter, cities and townes, which are placed toward the east, be more sure, then the townes builded towardes the north, for temperat aire or winde, and sicknesses be lesse. And in the said book Auicen greatly commendeth pleasant riuers, running towards the rising of the sunne,Pleasan

                      people. the dwellers in such places sayeth he, be fayre and well fauored: smothe skinned, cleare and sharpe voyces: and thus to conclude with thée,



this shal suffise at this time, what, and where, good and pleasant dwelling is. Note also, that thou must obserue aire in sicknes, as thou must do meate in sicknes, colde sicknesses, warme aire, drie sicknesses, moist aire, and so in the contraries to them that be sick and they that be hole, aire of like qualitie is moist holsom, they that haue long sicknesses, chaunge of aire is a great helpe, both in feuers, dropsies, falling sicknesses and rheumes.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  I haue found verie much disquietnes in my body, when my s
                        •
                     ruants and labouring familie, haue found case, and yet wee are partakers of one aire.
               
            
            
               Hum.
               The cause why thy labouring seruants in the fielde at plough, pastures,Moderate exercise a souerain thing. or woodde, haue such good health, is exercise labour, and thy disquietnes commeth, partly of idlenes, and lack of trauell, which moderatly vsed, is a thing most soueraign to nature.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  I pray thee tel me some thing of exercise.
               
            
            
               Hum.
               The well learned man Fulgentius,
                  
                     Fulgen. in lib. 2. saith: that exercise is a file and



chaufer of the heate naturall, which chaseth away sléepe, and consumeth superfluous strength.What profit commeth by exercise. Of the naturall vertues, redeeming of time, enemie vnto Idlenes, due vnto yong men, ioy of old men, and to say the truth, he which doth abstein from exercise shall lack the ioyes of health, and quietnesse both of body and minde. And Galen saieth in his regiment of health, if wee will keepe perfite health, wee must begin at labour and moderate trauell, and then to our meate and drinke, and so foorth to sléepe, and this is the cause why hawkers, shooters, hunters, and plowmen, gardeners, &c. haue so good disgestion and strength of bodie. Who be stronger armed men than Smithes, because of the exercise of their armes: stronger bodied, than carpenters, which lift great blockes: and masons which doe beare great stones, not onely in their youth, but such men will take maruellous trauels in age, which to idle people seeme verie painefull,Use maketh labour easie. vnto them selues that trauell, no paine but pleasure, because of custome?
               
                  These people can digest grosse meats, eating them with much pleasure, and sléeping soundly after them, whereas the idle multitudes in Cities, and noble mens houses, great numbers for lacke of exercise doe abhorre meates of light digestion and daintie dishes, Marie in deede they may bee verie profitable to Phisitions. But if trauaile be one of the best preseruers of health, so is idlenesse the destroyer of life, as Auerois writeth, and Hippocrates saying,
                     Apho.
                   euerie contrarie is remooued and helped by his contrarie, as health helpeth sicknes, exercise putteth away idlenesse,Idlenesse the mother of all mischiefe. &c. But euery light mouing or soft walking may not bee called an exercise as Galen sayeth, therefore tennis, dauncing, running, wrastling, riding vpon great horses, ordained, as well for the state of mens health, as for pleasure, whereunto it is now conuerted, rather to the hurt of many, than the profite of fewe, exercise doeth occupie euery part of the bodie, quicken the spirits, purge the excrements both by the reynes, and guts, therefore it must be vsed before meate,Exercise before 
                        〈◊〉
                     . for if strong exercise



bee vsed immediately after meate, it conueyeth corruption to each part of the bodie, because the meate is not digested: but when thou séest thy water after meate appeareth somewhat yellowe, then mayest thou begin exercise, for digestion is then well. But sicke folkes, leane persons, yong children, women with childe may not much trauaile. The exercise of dice, cardes, fighting, drinking knauish railing, of bauderie, and such like, rather may be called an exercise of diuels, than of men. And thus to conclude with Salomon, quam pretiosus sit sanitas thesaurus.
               
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  After painfull labor and exercise, or disquietnesse of the mind, there was neuer thing that hath done mee so much comfort as sleepe hath done.
               
            
            
               Hum.
               
                  Auicen saith, that sléepe is the rest and quietnesse of the powers of the soule, of moouings, and of senses,
                     Auicen in can. Of sleepe and waking. without the which man can not liue. And truely sléepe is nothing else but an Image or brother to death, as Tullie sayth.
                     Tulli. in lib. de sene.
                   And if by imagination thou didst perceiue sléeping & waking weied



in the ballance together, there thou shouldst sée them equall in weight, for Aristotle saith, that man doth sléepe as much as he doth wake.
                     Arist. in. lib. de so.
                   But this is to be considered in sléep, that natural heat is drawen inwardly, & digestion made perfite, the spirites quieted, and all the bodie comforted, if the true order of sléepe be obserued in sixe points. First, a quiet minde, without the which either there is no sléepe, or else dreadfull dreames, tormenting the spirites. Secondly, the time of sleepe, which is the night, or time of most quiet silence, for the day sléepes bee not good, most chieflie soone after dinner, except to sick persons or young children, in their tymes conuenient. Thirdly, the maner of sleepe,Sleepe after dinner not healthfull. that is, to eschew the lying on the backe, which bringeth manie grieuous passions, and killeth the sleeper with sodaine death. To lie vppon the left side is verie euill in the first sleepe, but tollerable in the seconde, but the most surest way to make the digestion perfite, is to lie vpon the right side, with one of the handes vpon the breast. Fourthly,



sléepe hath the quantitie which must be meane,Sleepe on the right side is best. for superfluous sléepe maketh the spirits grosse and dul, and decayeth memorie, sixe or eight houres will suffice nature. For, like as much watch dryeth the bodie, and is perillous for falling sicknes, and blindnes: euen so too much sléepe is as perillous, for extremes be euer ill. Fiftly,

                     . in the time of colde feuers, the patient must not sléepe vntill the trimbling fitte bee past, for then the hot fit that followeth will bee extremer than any other fit, and hard to helpe. Note furthermore, that those bodies that be full of hote inflamations sleepe not well, therefore they must vse things to extenuate and to make colde, as Tizantes and colde sirops, or gentle purging frō the bellie and liuer, or finally to haue the median veine opened according to time, state and age. Sixtly, the chamber must bee considered that it bee cleane, swéete, comely clothes fit for the time of the yeare, and the age of the people, & to kéepe the head warme, is very holsom, for in sléepe natural heat is drawne into the body, for the braine



of nature is colde & moyst.Thy lodging must be kept cleane. Windowes in the south part of the chamber be not good, it is best for them which haue colde rheumes, dropsies, &c. to lie in close lofts, & for dry bodies to lie in low chambers, and in the time of the Pestilence, often to shift chambers is healthfull, lying vpon the ground in Gardens, vnder trées, or neere vnto stinking priuies bee hurtfull to the bodie:Note that sléepers in fieldes in haruest shal be in daunger of quarteins in winter. and this shall suffice for thine instruction of sleepe, prouided, that thou doost not long retain thine vrine, for feare of the stone, and paine in thy reynes.

                  Once I fel into a great sicknes, and hitherto I am skant recouered of it, the surfit was so great, but counsell was giuen me, that I should not staie my selfe vpon the opinion of any one phisicion, but rather vpon three: then said I, to retaine three at once, requireth great charge, for those men to whome liues be committed, ought liberall reward to be giuen. Then said my frend, they are good gentlemen and no great takers. What be their names said I? he aunswered saying: The first was called doctor Diet, the second doctor Quiet:
                  Diet Quiet Meriman. 
                  the third doctor Meriman. I did writ their names, but yet I could not speake with them.

               Hitherunto I haue said some thing that shall well suffice for thee to know doctor Diat, as for Quiet, and Mery man, they lie in no phisicions handes to giue, but only in Gods.It were better to lacke riches, then to want quietnes and mir

And in the meane time, to want quietnesse, and myrth, which bee the chiefe friendes. Tenderest nourses wholsomest phisitions, most pleasant musitions, and friendliest companions to nature, pleasant birds singing in the branches, be more happier than rauening cormorants, and gréedie haukes, which with paines inchaseth their preyes. The quiet lambs be euer happier in their kinde,Many apt similitudes or metaphros. than the gréedie rauening foxes, wolues and lions, which neuer cease vexing themselues, to kill liuing thinges for their foode. The poore Oister, lurking vnder the rocke, or sande, which is neuer remooued of strong ebbes nor flouddes, is farder from trauell and continuall paines, than the horrible whale, most fearefull to fishes. The low shrubs, or bushes growing neare to the ground, be euer in more sauegarde than the lustie high flourishing trées, spredde with pleasant braunches, which bee subiect to euerie strong winde. The poore boats in harbour, bee in lesse perill than the rich fickle ships, tossed vp and downe on the cruell flouds.
               
                  What shall I say but this, that the miserable ragged begger called Irus, was more happier in his pouertie with quietnes and mirth, than was the gluttonous beast, & monstrous man king Sardanapalus, with all his golden glorie, court of ruffians, and curtizans which came to a shamefull ende. Diogenes, I warrant you was not inferiour to Alexander, in the state of happines, & haue left as great a fame behind him, sauing that Alexāder was a more cruell murtherer than Diogenes a chast liuer. In déed ye poore silly shepheard,The pleasure of poore men. doeth pleasantly pipe with his sheepe, when mighty princes doe fight among their subiects, & breake many sléepes in golden beds, when bakers in bags, & brewers in bottels, do snort vpon hard straw, fearing no sodaine mishap. The great paines and secrete griefes that disquieted mindes doe dayly sustaine, bee not much vnlike vnto the infernall tormentes that the wicked doe feele:The torments of the minde. Phisicke vnto an extreame troubled minde (say what they list:) helpeth as little, as to apply a playster to the breast,

or head of a dead body, to reuocate the ſpirites of life or ſoule againe. The ſicknes of the body muſt haue medicine, the paſſions of the minde muſt haue good counſel. Through thought many are killed. What pleaſure hath a condemned man in muſicke, or a dead man in phiſicke? Nothing at all God knoweth. Oh how many men haue béen caſt away by thought, and moſt for loſſe of eſtimation, and ſome of other affections of the minde, as inordinate loue, or coueting thinges that they cannot gette, or obtayning thoſe thinges that they cannot kéepe, or ire of other mens proſperitie or good hap! as Tully ſaith: Ire is a greuous paſſion.

                     •
                  ruent or bloody matter within the bodies of men or women. The powder of this hearbe is good in pessaries, for women causing



the dead childe to depart from the mother, and is wholsome against the pestilence, in the time of winter, and is hote and drie.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  Wee beautifie and make pleasant our windowes with Rosemarie, vsing it for small other purposes.
               
            
            
               Hum.
               
                  Of Rosemarie.Rosemarie is an hearbe of great vertue, hote and drie, sodden in Wine, and drunken before meate, it doeth heale the kings euill, or paines in the throate, as Dioscorides and Galen, sayth: the sauour of it doth comfort the braine and heart: the flowers of Rosemarie is an excellent cordiall called Anthos.
               
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  Is Puliol royal, an hearb of any value, or a weed of contemption?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               
                  The operation of Puliall royall,It is an hearbe of much vertue and profite: hote and drie in the thirde degrée. Dioscorides saith, if this hearbe be sodden with honie & Aloes, and drunke, it will cleanse the liuer, and purge the bloud: most chiefly it helpeth the lungs. Simeon Sethi saith, if women drinke it with white wine, it will prouoke and cleanse the termes menstrual, and is a very wholesome



pot hearbe.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  What saist thou vnto mustard?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               
                  Plinius doth greatly laud it,The operation of Mustard. saying, that there is nothing, that doth pearse more swiftlier into the braine than it doth. Honie, vineger, and mustard, tempered together, is an excellent Gargarisma, to purge the heade, téeth, and throate. Mustarde is good against all the diseases of the stomacke or lunges, winde, fleugme, or rawnes of the guts, and conduceth meate into the bodie: prouoketh vrine, helpeth the palsie, wasteth the quartane, dryeth vp moist rheumes: applied plaister wise vnto the head. Honie, and Mustard helpeth the cough, and is good for them that haue the falling sickenesse, notwithstanding the common vse of Mustard is an enemie to the eye. Many more vertues haue I read of Mustard, but the occasion of time hath vnhappily preuented, not onely my large discription in this, but also in many other simples, which hereafter, I intend largely to write vpō it, if it please God to permit me.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  They say that Buglos is verie



wholesome.
               
            
            
               Hum.
               It is an hearbe most temperate betwéene hote and colde,The vertue of Buglos. of an excellent vertue, a comforter of the heart, a purger of melancholy, a quieter of the frenzie, a purger of the vrine, holsome to be drunk in wine, but most effectual in sirup. Dioscorides and Galen doth greatly commend this hearb, and that doth dayly experience well proue.
            
            
               Iohn.

               Hum.
               This hearbe is warme in the second degree,The vertues of Basill. hauing the vertue of moystnesse, and if it be sodden in wine with Spicknard, and drunke, it is good agaynst dropsies, windes, fleugme, coldnesse of the heart, hardnesse of the stomacke: the sauour of Basill, doeth comfort the braine, and heart, the vse of this hearbe in meates, doeth decay the sight.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  The plaine people of the countrey will say, that those flowers which bee pleasant in smelling, bee oftentimes vnwholsom in working, the rose is pleasant in sense, what is it in vertue?
               
            
            
               
               Hum.
               It hath an odour most pleasant, and hath vertue to coole and bind.The vertue

                      Roses. The water is good to make Manus Christi, and many other goodly cordials, Roses and vineger applied vnto the forehead, doe bring sléepe: conserue of Roses, haue vertue to quench burning choler, and to stay the rage of a hote feuer, Oyle of Roses, Uineger, and the white of an egge beaten together, doth not onely quench sacra ignis, but also bring a madde man into quietnesse, if his foreheade bee well annoynted therewith, after the recept of Pilles of Chochi, in the time of the Pestilence, there is nothing more comfortable than the sauour of roses.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  What saiest thou of Sauerie?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               It is hote and drie in the third degrée,The vertue of Sauerie. if the gréene hearbe bee sodden in water or white wine and drunke, these be his vertues to make the liuer sort, to cleanse dropsies, colde coughes, cleanseth womens diseases, and separateth the dead child from the mother▪ as Dioscorides & Galen saith. Also Germander is not much vnlike



the vertue of this hearbe.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  But for troubling of you, I would be glad to know your minde of Time, and of a few other hearbes.
               
            
            
               Hum.
               It is vehement of heat with drinesse in the third degrée.The vertue of Time. 
                  Dioscorides saith, if it be drunk with vineger and salt, it purgeth fleugme, sodden with hony or meide, it hath vertue to cleanse the lunges, breast, matrix, reynes, and bladder, and killeth wormes.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  What saiest thou of Parsly and Saxifrage?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               They haue vertue to breake the stone. Parslie is hote in the second d

               Ioh.
               
                  What is thy iudgement of Liuerwort?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               It hath vertue to cleanse and coole.The vertue of Liuerwort. 
                  Dioscorides sayth, it doth heale the wounds of the liuer, & quencheth the extreme heat therof, tempred with honie, and eaten, doeth helpe a disease



called regius morbus, and paines of the thraote and lungs.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  What is Betonie?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               They be of diuerse kindes.The vertue of Betonie. 
                  Leonardus Futchius doth call the swéet Gilliflowers by the names of Betonie, but the one séemeth to talke of that which is commonly knowne of the people, called the lande Betonie, which hath the vertue to kill wormes within the bellie, and helpeth the quartaine, cleanseth the matrixe, and hath the vertue to heale the bodie within. If it bée brused, it is of great effect, if it bée sodden with wormewood in white wine to purge fleugme, and is hot in the first degrée, drie in the second.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  I haue heard small commendations of Beetes.
               
            
            
               Hum.
               They be of two kindes,The vertue of Beetes. and bée both prayse worthie. Simeon Sethy, wryteth, that they be hote and drie in the thirde degrée, the white Béete is the best, they haue vertue to cleanse, as Niter hath, but hath euill iuice. The iuice of this hearbe with honie applyed into the Nose, doe purge



the head, it is a wholesome hearbe in pottage, if it bee well sodden, or else it is noysome to the stomacke. If it be perboyled and eaten with vineger, it is good against the stopping of the liuer. Notwithstanding, the iuyce of this hearbe doe stop the belly, béeing simply taken.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  What is Maidenhaire?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               It is an hearbe betwéene hote and drie,The vertue of Maidenhaire. if it be sodden in wine, it breaketh the stone, it cleanseth the Matrix, bringeth downe the secondes, as Dioscorides and Galen saith, the best doth grow vpon hard rocks.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  What is Melilot?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               It hath vertue to ripe, and is more hoter than colde,The vertue of Melilot. Mellilot, flax séede, Rose leaues, Campher, and womans milke tempered together, doth make a goodly medicine agaynst the hote inflamation of the eyes. If this hearbe bée drunke with Wine, it doeth mollifie the hardnesse of the stomacke and liuer, the most excellent plaister against the pains of the splene doth Mesue describe, which is made of Melilot.
            
            
               
               Ioh.
               
                  Be pease and beanes any thing beneficiall to nature?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               Beanes be more groser and fuller of winde then pease be,The operation of pease and beanes. and maketh euill matter, except they bee well sodden and buttred, and so eaten, with the whitest and swéetest Onions that may be gotten. Because they bee hard of digestion: howbéeit, they do make fatte, and partly cleanse, yet they are not to bee compared with tender white peason well sodden and buttered, or else made in pottage with garden mints, and grosse pepper, which haue vertue to cleanse the reynes of the backe and bladder. Lentilles bee of the same vertue.But Hutels & tares be melancholy. Barlie being clean hulled and sodden with milke cleaue water and suger, maketh a verie comfortable and wholsome pottage for hot cholericke persons or young people. And of this is much vsed in the north parts of Englande, and is called bigge kele.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  What be the vertues of Leekes and rootes of Radish, Turneps, Persneps, Rapes or naues?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               Léekes bee euill, engender



painfull sléepe:Leekes and their properties. but eaten with honie, then they purge bloud: but rootes eaten rawe, bréedeth ill iuice, therefore being first sodden, and the water cast away, and then sodden with fat mutton,Of the vertues of Radish with other rootes. or tender fatte biefe, those rootes nourisheth much. Rapes and Naues be windie: Turneps, causeth one to spitte easilie that haue corrupt stomackes, but maketh rawe iuice. Carets doe expurse winde: Radish rootes prouoketh vrine, but be verie euill for fleugmaticke persons, hauing griefe in their bones or ioynts, and must bée eaten in the beginning of the meale, as Galen sayeth,
                     Galen de alimen.
                   but many doe vse them in the ende of meales, and finde ease, as sir Thomas Eliot that worthy knight and learned man reporteth, in his booke called The Castell of health. And thus I conclude of those hearbes and rootes that I haue written vpon.Hearbs ingendereth melancholie. Admonishing thée, that hearbes, pulse and rootes be all windie, engenderers of Melancholie, and ingrossers of the bloud, except Lettis, Bourage, and Purslain. Therefore the grosse binding together, and séething of hearbes



in brothes and pottage, be more holsomer than the fine chopping of them.
               Thus Iohn I haue declared vnto thée, the vertues of certaine hearbes, which if thou wilt follow, and obserue my rules in them, I doubt not but thou shalt receiue much profite thereby. I would haue also taught thée some prety waies for distillation of waters, but am preuented therein, and I am glad thereof, forasmuch as thou shalt sée verie shortly,

Ra. in lib. 2. ca. 3. that the flesh of oxen that be yong, doe much nourish and make them strong that be fed with them▪ but it bringeth melancholy, and melancholious diseases, it is colde and drie of nature, and hard to digest, except it bée of cholericke persons: but béeing tenderly sodden, it nourisheth much. Much béefe customably eaten of idle persons, and nice folkes that labour not, bringeth many diseases, as Rasis saith.

                   in his description of beastes, doeth write more of the vertues of Bulles, Oxen, Kine, and Calues, than anie other hath done. And thus to conclude, the flesh of the male beastes, is more better than the Female, and the gelded beastes be more commodious to nature, than any of them.



And the yong flesh more commendable than the olde, for it is more moyst, and a friend to the bloud,

Baked meates be very drie: Cleane boiled meates, with wholsom hearbs and fruits, be excellent to comfort the bodie, if they bee nutramentall flesh. Calues flesh doe greatly nourish and make good blood.

wife be not at home. Who is able to beholde such noysome spirites or helhounds?

Whereas thou hast spoken agaynst the vile nature of swine, calling them vnreasonable, thou dost vse more words than wit: for there is no beast that may bee called reasonable but man only.Beastes haue no reason And wheras God did prohibite the Iewes to eate swines flesh, it was a figure to abstain from vncleane things: which I leaue



to the Theologians. The Mahumites abhorre swines flesh, because their drunken false prophet, and Psewdo Apostle was torne and rent in péeces with swine, being drunken and fallen in the myre.

Fishes that swimme in fresh cleare Riuers, or stony places, where as the water is sweete, being fishes that beare scales, bee meruailous good. If they feede neare vnto places where much filth is daily cast out, there the fish is verie corrupt and vnholsome, as the said Haliabas saieth: Fishes that do feede in fennes, marishes, diches, & muddy pooles be very vnholsome, and do corrupt the bloud they be grosse and slymy, corrupt and windie.

New oile doth moyst, and warme the stomacke, but olde oile corrupteth the stomacke, and cleaueth to the lungs, and maketh one hoarse. Oile of roses and sharpe vineger, tempered together, is good to annoint the foreheades of them that are troubled wyth extreme heate or fransie, so that Buglos be sodden in their posset ale, or else drinke the sirops of Endiue or Buglosse.

Also waters running toward the east, be pure, comming out of hard stony rockes, and a pinte of that water is lighter than a pint of the standing water of welles or pooles. The lighter the water, the better it is. Also waters that are put in wine, &c. ought first to bee sodden ere it be occupied colde, and so the fire doth cleanse it from corruption. Standing waters, and water running neare vnto cities and towns, or marish ground, woods, and fennes bee euer full of corruption, because there is so much filth in them of carrions and rotten dung, &c. Ice and snowe waters be very grose, and bee hurtefull to the bodies of men and beasts. To drinke colde water is euill, for it will stoppe the body, and



engender melancholy. Salt water helpeth a man from scabbes, itch, and moist humours, it killeth lice, and wasteth bloud betweene the skinne and the flesh, but it is most hurtful to the stomacke, but the vapour and smoake of it is good for them that haue the dropsie.

Uineger tempered with oyle Oliue, or oyle of Roses, and sodden with vnwashed woll, helpeth a disease called Soda in the head, applied warme vnto the place, it doth helpe hot diseases in the head called Soda, it is good in sauce for all warme and moist men. Uineger with cleane clarified hony penidies and faire water sodden together, doth greatly helpe the paine in the throte or lunges, or stopping of the winde, and quencheth hot diseases. And sharpe vinegar mingled with salt, and put vpon the

They do greatly erre that ſay hony is hot and moiſt: but if it be clarified from the wax and droſſe and kept in a cloſe veſſel, there is nothing that is liquid vpon the earth that remaineth longer. And this precious iewel hony, hath beene euermore prayſed aboue ſuger, for it will conſerue and keepe any frute, herb, rote, or any other thing that is put into it an exceeding long time.

Milke of fatte beaſtes doeth nouriſh more than the leane beaſtes, and the milke of yoong beaſtes is better than of the olde. And the new milke is wholeſomer than that the which hath ſtoode in the aire,

                  Milke not good for foule ſtomackes. In Winter it is vnwholeſome for fleugmaticke perſons, or them which haue corrupt and foule ſtomackes. For if the milke be ſower, it doeth ingender the ſtone in the reines or bladder. Hip. in. li. de air. & aqua. Cowes milke is the thickeſt milke, and vnctious or full of butter. But the beſt milke that helpeth againſt conſumptions, is womans milke: the next is goates milke, which goates milke rather nouriſheth too much, if it be taken commonly. Sheepes milke is not very pleaſant vnto the ſtomacke. And note this, that Milke is not wholeſome to them which haue paines in the head or teeth. But the people that bee brought vp with milke, be faire coloured, and healthfull bodies.
               
                  Iſaac ſayeth, if honny and a little ſalte bee ſodden in the milke, then it is very wholeſome, and is not windie nor flegmatike.

It is good for yoong children when their teeth doth growe or ake. Butter milke if you crumme newe white breade into it, and suppe it off, there is no milke nourisheth so much, goates milke excepted. Cheese if it be new it is indifferently well commended, but hard salt cheese doth drie the bodie, and engendereth the stone, as Isaac and Auicene doe say,

againe. By this I gather, that cheese will engender the stone before any other meates. Therefore cheese shoulde bee made in Summer when the creame is not taken from the milke. And Bittonie, Saxifrage, and Parcely chopped together, be wholesome for to be mingled amongest the curdes. And thus I doe conclude with Haliabas, that old cheese is vnwholesome.

The third is in the manner of their rosting, potching, or seething. New laide egges of hennes potched and supped vppon an emptie stomacke, doeth cleanse the lungs and the raines of the backe. Harde egges are greately discommended, vnlesse it bee to stoppe flixes, but it were better for

to ſeethe egges hard in vinegar, and then vndoubtedly it will drie vp the flixe of the belly. Fried egges be very hurtfull for chollericke people, and them which haue the ſtone.

And generally there is no credence to be giuen to drunkards, although they be mightie men. It maketh men like to monsters, with countinaunces, like vnto burning coales: It dishonoureth noble men, and beggereth poore men: and generally killeth as many as be slaine in cruell battelles, the more it is to be lamented.

water, and verie well sodden, and stand fiue or sixe daies, vntill it be cleare. It is verie wholesome, especially for hot cholericke folkes, hauing hote burning feuers. But if Ale bee very sweete and not well sodden in the brewing, it bringeth inflammation of winde and choller into the belly: If it be very sower, it fretteth and nippeth the guts, and is euill for the eies. To them that be verie flegmaticke, ale is verie grosse, but to temperat bodies it encreaseth bloud: It is partely laxatiue, and prouoketh vrine. Cleane brewed beere if it be not very strong, brewed with good hops, clenseth the body from corruption, and is very wholsome for the liuer, it is an vsuall or common drinke in most places of England, which indeede is hurt and made worse with many rotten hops, or hoppes dried like dust which commeth from beyond the sea. But although there commeth manie good hoppes from thence, yet it is knowen that the goodly stilles, and fruitfull grounds of England, do bring forth to mans vse, as good hops as groweth in any place of this world, as by proofe I know in many places of

               The best Bread is made of cleane sweete wheate which groweth in claie ground, and maketh but little branne when it is ground, light leauened, meanely salted, and the bread to be baked in an ouen not extremely hot, for burning of the bread, nor les then meane h

                   it is the wholsomer, as Auerrois and Rasis saieth. And also



bread must neither be eaten new baked, nor verie stale or old,

The best bread is that which is of a day olde, and the loues or manchets may neither be great nor little, but meane, for the fier in small loues drieth vp the moistnes or vertue of the bread, and in great loues it leaueth rawnesse and grosnesse.

               Hum.
               There be many opinions in the vertue thereof, but I shall stay my selfe with the iudgement of Auicen:
                     Auic. in 2. cap. 500.78. Rise saith he, is hot and drie and hath vertue to stop the belly, it doth nourish much, if it bee sodden with milke, but it ought to be steeped in water a whole night before: if blanched Almondes be stamped and with Rosewater streined into them, and sodden with cowes milke, it is verie nutrimentall.
            
            
               Ioh.
               
                  What be almondes?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               The bitter Almondes be hotter then the sweete Almondes. Drie Almondes be hurtfull, the milke of moist Almonds, wherein burning steele is quenched, stoppeth the flix: To eate almondes before meate, preserueth against drunkenes.Of walnuts. Walnuts be wholsome when they be new, to bee eaten after fish, for they hinder engendring of fleugme. Simeon Sethi saith they are hote in the first, and drie in the second degree, not wholsome before meate,

Chesnuttes if they bee rosted and eaten with a little hony fasting, they helpe the cough, if they be eaten raw, although they greatly nourrish the brdy, yet they be hurtfull for the splene and fill the belly, full of winde.Of nutmegs.

They that drinke of this roote sodden in wine, shall haue remedie of the white morphew, and recouer good collours. And this haue I proued, it helpeth crampes and sickenesse in the sinewes, being drunke in wyne, sodden with sage, it helpeth the splene, the liuer and raines, and will clense the secret termes of women, and augmenteth naturall seede.

In Summer to drinke it with whey, in Winter with white wine: but the cleane yellowe rubarbe sliced, and put into infusion al the night with whey, white wine, or endiue water, and streyne it in the morning, doth greatly purge the blood and liuer: thrée or foure drams with Spikenard a dram or more.

               There be two kinds of Aloes, one is named Succo trina, which is



like a liuer, cleare, brittle, bitter, coloured betwéene red and yellow, this is best for medicines. A little of this being tempered with Rose water, being put vnto the eies, helpeth the dropping and watery eyes. Also it is put in many excellent medicines laxatiue, as saffron, myrrhe, aloes, mingled together. In the forme of pilles, is the most excellent medicine against the pestilence, as it is written in this booke folowing. Honie and aloes mingled togither, doe take away the markes of stripes and also doth mundifie sores & vlcers, it doeth cleanse the abundance of choler & fleugme from the stomacke. It is not good to be taken in Winter, for Auicen doeth forbid it,
                     Auicen in li. de sim.
                   but in the spring time or haruest, the powder thereof. The weight of a french crown mingled with the water of honie or mead,

but if aloes be cleane washed, it is the wholsomer, many vnwashed aloes wil cause emerodes.

               Ioh.
               
                  I would be glad to heare of that



precious triacle and his vertues.
               
            
            
               Hum.
               This excellent triacle Methridatum is next in qualitie and vertue to Theriaca, and so differ but little, but onely Theriacha is a little hotter and stronger against venom of snakes, adders, and serpents. It helpeth all paines of the head of men or women if it be come of cold, most chiefly of melā
                  cholie and feare. It helpeth megrime, falling sicknes, and all paines of the forehead, dropping of eyes. It helpeth toothake, paines of the mouth, chéekes, if it be put in maner of a plaister, or else annoint the pained place. It helpeth paines of the throte called Squinancie, and also cough, appoplexia, and passion of the lunges, and manie grieuous dolors and pains within the bodie, drunke with the decoction of the flowers of Pomgranats or Plantine, it helpeth and stoppeth flixes in the Ilias and long guts winds or collicke. The extention or cramps be helped very much with this Methridatū, drunken with stilled waters, palsies, sickenesses in the midriffe, the liuer, reines and bladder be cleansed therby



it prouoketh the menstrual termes in womē, being drunk with posset ale. If Isop or Germander bee sodden in the said ale, it is excellent against the pestilence or poison, if it be drunke but a little quantitie thereof, according to the disease, strength or age of the person. It is very good against the stone, or for womē which haue a new disease peraccidents called the gréene sicknes, there is nothing better against the biting of a mad dogge, than to drinke of this, and to annoint the wound. If it be giuen in drinke to any sicke bodie a little before the accesse or comming of the olde fittes of quotidians, tercians, or quarteins, so that it be drunke with wine temperately warmed.Of the excellent triacle called Mithridatū.
                   This Methridatum is a medicine of no small price: Democrates hath a goodly composition of it: an other excellent composition is of Cleopatre, as Galen writeth. An other, and the most excellent is the description of Andromachus, phisition vnto king Nero, but the chief father of this act, was king Mithridatus, the noble king of Ponthus, after whose name it is called.
            
            
               
               Ioh.
               
                  Indeed this is an excellent medicine, but I pray thee where shall I buy it?
               
            
            
               Hum.
               The blind (fellow Iohn) doe eate many a flie, and the plaine meaning man is oft deceyued. There is no trust in some of the Apothecaries, for although the vsurpation of quid pro quo is tollerable, for their Succidanes, yet to abuse their simples or compounds, it is not onely theft to rob simple men, but also murther to kill the hurtlesse.

                  Of late time we haue beene so afflicted with sundrie sickenesses and strange diseases, that in many places we could get no physitions to helpe vs, and when men be sodainly sicke, 200. miles from London, Cambridge, or Oxford▪ it is too late for the patient to sende for helpe, being infected with the pestilence. I pray thee tel me some good regiment for me & my family, if it please God that it may take place.
               
            
            
               Hum.
               I shall be glad forasmuch as thou hast taken paines to heare me all this while, to teach thée a pretie regiment for the pestilence.

               Hum.
               Certainly the occasion of this most feareful sicknesse commeth many waies, as the change of the aire from a good vnto an euill qualitie, taking his venemous effect of the vital spirits which incontinent with all spéede corrupteth the spirituall blood. And sodenly (as it were) an vnmercifull fire, it quickly consumeth the whole bodie ouen vnto death, vnlesse the wholsome medicine doe preuent and come to the heart, before the pestilent humor. And because it is a very strong sicknes, it is requisite to haue a strong curing medicine. For weake things will not preuail against so strong a matter. Therfore I pray you note these six sayings, as aire, diet, sléepe, or watch, quietnes, or trouble, and finally medicine. First, walk not in stinking mists,Good aire. nor by corrupt marrish ground, nor in extreme hot weather, but in fair cleare aire vpon high ground in swéet fields or gardens, hauing fire in your chāber, with swéet perfumes of the smoke of Olibanum, or Beniamen Frankensence, being



cold weather. And in hote weather, roses, willow branches sprinkled with vineger, & often shifting the chamber is wholsom, fléeing the South winde. Secondly, diet, moderate eating meate of good digestion, as all that haue pure white flesh, both of beasts, and foules, good bread of wheate, partly leauened. Eate no raw hearbs, purslein, Lettise,Yong lettise yong Lettish, or sorrel, except with vineger. Drinke of cleare thin wine, not chaunged and vse often times vineger with your meates, and mingle not fish and flesh together in your stomacke, & to drinke a tisant of barly water, rose water, & sorrell water, betwene meals is good, eight spoonfuls at once. Thirdly, beware you sléepe not at noone, it bringeth many sicknesses,Noone sleepe and giueth place to the pestilence, and abateth memory. For as the marigold is spred by the day, and closed by the night: euen so is man of nature disposed, although through custome otherwise altered vnto great domage and hurt of body. Eight hours sléepe suffiseth well to nature,Sleepe. but euery complexion hath his proper qualities, to sléepe vpon the



right side is best, euill vpon the left, and worse vpon the backe. Fourthly, vse moderate exercise and labor for the euacuation of the excrements,Exercise. as swift going vp hilles, stretching forth armes and legges, lifting weightes not verie ponderous, for by labour the first and second digestion is made perfite, and the bodie strengthened, and this is a mightie defence agaynst the pestilence, and many mo infirmities, wheras through idlenesse be engendered all diseases both of the soule and bodie, whereof man is compounded & made. Fifthly, aboue all earthly thinges, mirth is most excellent,Mirth. and the best companion of life, putter away of all diseases: the contrarie in plague time bringeth on the pestilence, through painefull melancholie, which maketh the body heauy & earthly. Company, musicke, honest gaming, or any other vertuous exercise doeth helpe agaynst heauinesse of mind. Sixtly, medicine, the partie being chaunged in nature and condition, trembling or burning, vomiting with extreame paine in the day,

imaginations, &c. Apt to sléepe, when these signes doe appeare, giue him medicine before xij. houres, or else it will be his death.

For the retaining the said bloud, would all turne to venom and incurable poison: And note this, that blood bee lette vpon the same side that the sore doth appeare. If any appeare for many causes, and sléep not viij. houres after, and vse this most excellent pill oftentimes.

            The Epilogue.
            
               HEre I haue presented vnto thee (gentle reader) a simple Gouernment of health, beseeching thee most heartily for to accept it as an argument of my good will, as one vnfeynedly that greatly doe couet the good estate, and happie health of mankinde, which by dayly casualties, surfets and age do decay, and fall into many grieuous and painfull sicknesses. For which cause, although perhaps I cannot in all points answer to thy request, in this little Regiment: yet I shall desire thee to accept mee among the fellowship of the botchers, which do helpe to repaire things that fall into ruine or decay: Euen so bee the practitioners of phisicke, no makers of men, but when men doe decay through sicknesse, then the counsell of the Phisition, and the vertue of medicin is not to bee refused, but most louingly to bee embraced, as a chiefe friend in the time of aduersitie: if thou readest this little booke, and obserue it, I trust it will pay as



much as it doth promise. And because I am a yong man, I would not presume to take such a matter in hand, although the wordes bee fewe, but did consiliate and gather things together, which of my selfe I haue practised, and also read and noted in the workes of Hippocrates, Galen, Auicen, Plinie, Haliabas, Auenzoer, Rasis, Dioscorides, Leonhardus Futchius, Conradus Gesnerus, &c. And thus I leaue thee to the companie of this my little booke, wishing thee health, and all them that shall reade it.
