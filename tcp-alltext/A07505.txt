demur; your Suites hang not long here after Candles be
lighted: Why we call this play by ſuch a deere and chargeable
Title, Michaelmas Tearme? Knowe it conſents happilye
to our purpoſe, tho perhaps faintlie to the interpretation
of many; for he that expects any great quarrels in Lawe
to bee handled here, will be fondly deceaued, this onely preſents
thoſe familiar accidents, which happend in Towne in
the circumference of thoſe ſixe weekes, whereof Michaelmas
Terme is Lord: Sat ſapienti, I hope there's no fooles

               But now vnto my preſent buſines, the Daughter yeildes, and
Quomodo conſents, onely my miſtris Quomodo, her mother
without regard runs full againſt mee, and ſticks hard! Is there
no law for a woman that will run vpon a man at her owne apperill.
Why ſhould not ſhee conſent, knowing my state, my ſudaine fortunes,
I can command a cuſterd, and other bakemeats, death of
ſturgeon, I could keepe houſe with nothing, what friends haue I?
how wellam I beloued, ee'n quite throughout the ſcullery, not conſent?
tis ee'n as I haue writ, Ile be hang'd, and ſhee loue mee not
herſelfe & wold rather preſerue me, as a priuate friend to her own
pleaſures, than any way aduance her daughter vpon me to beguile
herſelfe, then how haue I relieued her in that poynt, let me peruſe
this letter. Good miſtris Quomodo, or rather as I hope ere
the Terme end, mother Quomodo, ſince only your conſent keeps
a loofe off and hinders the copulation of your daughter, what may I
thinke, but that it is a meere affection in you, doating vppon ſome
ſmall inferiour vertue of mine, to draw me in vpon your ſelf, if the
caſe stand ſo, I haue comfort for you: for this you may well aſſure
your ſelfe, that by the marriage of your daughter I haue the better
meanes and opportunity to your ſelfe, and without the leaſt ſuſpition.
This is moouing ſtuffe, and that workes best with a Citizens
wife, but who ſhall I get to conuey this now: my Page I halent
forth, my Pandar I haue imployd about the country, to looke
out ſome third ſiſter, or entice ſome diſcontented Gentlewoman
from her husband, whōe the laying out of my appetite ſhall maintaine,
nay Ile deale like an honourable Gentleman, Ile bee kinde
to women, that which I gather i'th day, Ile put into their purſes at
night, you ſhall haue no cauſe to raile at me, no faith, Ile keepe
you in good faſhion Ladyes, no meaner men then knights ſhall ranſome
home your gownes, and recouer your ſmocks, Ile not dallye
with you—ſome poore widdow woman would come as a neceſſary
bawd now: and ſee where fitly comes—my mother! curſe off

pouerty do's ſhee come vp to ſhame me, to betray my birth, and caſt
ſoyle vpon my new Suite, let her paſſe me, Ile take no notice of her,
Scuruye—murrey—Carſey!

                  Which driues me moſte into a ſhamefull feare:
                  Woe worth th' infected cauſe that makes me viſit

                  And how ſoone Maides are to their Ruins won
                  One minute, and aeternally vndone:
                  So in mine may it: may it not be thus?—
                  Though ſhe be poore, her honours preceous,
                  May be my preſent forme, and her foud feare,
                  May chace her from me, if her eye ſhould getme,
                  And therefore as my loue and wants aduiſe.
                  Ile ſerue vntill I finde her in diſguiſe.

Atturneyes, finding a hole in my leaſe, goe about to defeate
me of my right.
               
               
                  Sho.

                  The moſte vnciuilſt part that you haue ſeene, I know

                  Sho.
                  Cannot a Gentleman purchaſe a little fire to thawe
his appetite by, but muſt you that haue beene dayly ſindg'd
in the flame, be as greedy to beguile him on't? how can it appeare
in you but maliciouſly, and that you goe about to engroſſe
hell to your ſelues? he auen forbid, that you ſhould not
ſuffer a ſtranger to come in, the Deuill himſelfe is not ſo vnmannerly,
I doe not thinke but ſome of them rather will be
wiſe enough to beg▪ Offices there before you, and keepe
you out, marry all the ſpite will bee they cannot ſell e'm agen.

                  A worſe and a worſe diſgrace.

                  A Gentlewoman muſt ſwagger a little now and then
I perceiue, there would bee no ciuilitie in her Chamber elſe,
though it be my hard fortune to haue my keeper there a coward,
the thing that's kept is a Gentlewoman borne.
               
               
                  Sho.
                  And to conclude a Coward, infallible of your ſide,
why doe you thinke yfaith I tooke you to be a Coward? doe I
thinke youle turne your backe to anye man liuing? youle be

                  But that man ſhowes himſelfe a Knaue, for he dares
not ſhowe his owne face when hee does it, for ſome of the
common Counſell in Henry the eights daies thought it modeſtie
at that time, that one Vizzard ſhould looke vppon another.

                     t's ſo firme I dare it now to miſſe.
                  Now ſhall I be diuulgde a landed man,
                  Throughout the liuerie:—one points, another whiſpers,
                  A third frets inwardly: let him fret and hang,
                  Eſpecially his enuie I ſhall haue,
                  That would be faine, yet cannot be a knaue,

                  Bleſſe maiſter Quomodo.

                  Why la you now Serjeants, did I not tell you you mistooke?

                  Did you not heare me ſay. I had rather ha had maſter
Blaſtfield, the more ſufficient man a great deale?

                  Verie true ſir,—but this Gentleman lighting into
our hands firſt—
               
               
                  Quo.
                  Why did you ſo ſir?
               
               
                  Sho.
                  Wee thought good to make vſe of that oportunitie,
and hold him faſt.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  You did well in that I muſt needes ſay, for your owne
ſecurities, but twas not my minde maſter Eaſie to haue you
firſt, you muſt needes thinke ſo.
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  I dare ſweare that maſter Quomodo.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  But ſince you are come to me, I haue no reaſon to refuſe
you, I ſhould ſhow little manners in that ſir.
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  But I hope you ſpake not in that ſence ſir, to impoſe

the bond vpon mee.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  By my troth that's my meaning ſir, you ſhall finde
mee an honeſt man, you ſee I meane what I ſay, is not the
day paſt, the money vntendred, you'd ha me liue vprightly
maiſter Eaſie?
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  Why ſir, you know maiſter Blaſtfield is the man.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  Why ſir, I know maſter Blaſtfield is the man, but is
he any more then one man? two entred into bond to mee, or
I'me fowly coozn'd.
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  You know my entrance was but for faſhion ſake.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  Why, ile a gree to you, you'l grant tis the faſhion likewiſe
when the Bond's due to haue the money paid agen.
               
               
                  Sho.
                  So we told him ſir, and that it lay in your worſhips
curtezie to arreſt which you pleaſe.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  Marie do's it ſir, theſe fellowes know the law,—
beſide, you offred yourſelf into Bond to me you know, when
I had no ſtomake to you, now beſhrew your heart for your
labour, I might ha had a good ſubſtantiall Citizen, that
would ha paid the ſumme roundly, altho I think you ſufficient
enough for ſeauen hundred pound, beſide the forfeyture,
I would be loath to diſgrace you ſo much before Serjeants.
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  If you would hathe pacience ſir, I doe not thinke but
maſter Blaſefield is at Carriers to receiue the money.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  He wil proue the honeſter man then, & you the better
diſcharged, I wonder he ſhould breake with me, t'was neuer
his practiſe, you muſt not bee angry with mee now, tho
you were ſomewhat hot when you entred into Bond, you
may eaſily go in angerly, but you cannot come out ſo.
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  No, the Diuels in't for that.
               
               
                  Sho.
                  Do you heere ſir, a my troth we pittie you, ha you any
ſtore of Crownes about you?
               
               
                  Eaſ.

                  Sho.
                  Hee's a ſuch a nature, looke?—Let him owe any man

                        •
                      what's his courſe: he will lend him mony to day, a

Cittizens to baile you ſpite on's heart, and ſet you at libertie

                  What's it you require me maiſter Quomodo?
               
               
                  Quo.
                  You know that before this time I hope ſir, preſent
money, or preſent impriſonment.
               
               
                  Sho.
                  I told you ſo.
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  We nere had money of you.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  You had commodities, an't pleaſe you
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  Well, may I not craue ſo much libertie vpō my word,
to ſeeke out maiſter Blaſtfield?
               
               
                  Quo.
                  Yes, and you would not laugh at me: wee are ſometimes
Gulls to Gentlemen▪ I thanke 'em; but Gentlemen are
neuer Gulls to vs, I commend 'em.
               
               
                  Sho.
                  Vnder your leaue maſter Quomodo, the Gentleman
craues the furtherance of an houre, and it ſorts well with our

occaſion at this time, hauing a little vrgent buſines at Guildhall,
at which minute weele returne, and ſee what agreement
is made.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  Nay take him along with you Serjeant.
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  I'me vndone then.
               
               
                  Sho.
                  Hee's your priſoner; and being ſafe in your houſe at
your owne diſpoſing, you cannot denie him ſuch a requeſt:
beſide, he hath a little faith in Ma. Blaſtfields comming ſir.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  Let me not be too long delaid I charge you.
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  Not an houre yfaith ſir.
               
               Exeunt.
               
                  Quo.
                  O maiſter Eaſie, of all men liuing I neuer dream▪
you would ha done me this iniurie: make me would my credite,
faile in my commodities, ring my ſtate into ſuſpition:
for the breaking of your day to me, has broken my day to
others.
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  You tell me of that ſtill, which is no fault of mine maſter
Quomodo.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  Oh whats a man but his honeſtie maſter Eaſie, and
thats a fault amongſt moſt of vs all,—Marke but this note,
Ile giue you good counſell now,—as often as you giue
your name to a bond, you muſt think you chriſten a child, and
take the charge on't too: for as the one, the bigger it growes
the more coſt it requires: ſo the other the longer it lies, the
more charges it puts you too, onely heer's the difference a
childe muſt bee broke, and a bond muſt not, the more you
breake children, the more you keep 'em vnder: but the more
you breake bondes, the more theyle leape in your face, and
therefore, to conclude, I would neuer vndertake to bee Goſſip
to that bond which I would not ſee well brought vp.
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  Say you ſo ſir?—Ile thinke vpon your counſaile
hereafter for't.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  Ah foole, thou ſhouldeſt neere ha taſted ſuch witte
but that I know tis too late.
               
               
                  Tom.
                  The more I grieue:
               
               
                  Quo.
                  To put all this into the compaſſe of a litle hoop Ring
                  Make this account, come better dayes or worſe,
                  So many bonds abroad, ſo many boyes at nurſe.
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  A good medicine for a ſhort memorie:—but ſince,

you haue entred ſo farre, whoſe children are deſperate depts
I pray?
               
               
                  Quo.
                  Faith they are like the of-ſprings of ſtolne luſt, put to
the hoſpital, their fathers are not to be found, they are either
too far abroad, or too cloſe within, and thus for your memories
ſake.
                  The deſperate Debter hence deriues his name,
                  One that has neither money, land nor fame,
                  All that he makes, proue Beſtards, and not Bonds,
                  But ſuch as yours, at firſt are horn

                  Eaſ.
                  But all that I beget heereafter 
                        •
                     le ſo one diſinherit
Maiſter Quomodo.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  In the meane time heeres a ſhrewd knaue will diſinherit
you.
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  Well, to put you out of all doubt Maiſter Quomodo,
ile not truſt to your curtezie, I ha ſent for bayle.

                  Eaſ.
                  Since the worſt comes to the worſt, I haue thoſe friends
'ith Cittie, I hope that will not ſuffer me to lye for ſeauen
hundred pound.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  And you tolde me you had no friendes heere at all,
how ſhould a man truſt you now?
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  That was but to trie your Curteſie M. Quomodo.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  How vncōſcionably he gulls himſelf—they muſt
be wealthye ſubſidie-men ſir, at leaſt fortye pound 'ith
Kings Bookes I can tell you, that doe ſuch a feate for you.
               
               Enter Shortyard and Falſlight, like wealthy Cittizens
in Sattin ſutes.
               
                  Eaſ.
                  Heere they come what ſo ere they are.
               
               
                  Quo.
                  Berlady Aldermans Deputies, I am verie ſorrye for
you ſir, I cannot refuſe ſuch men.

                  Are you the Gentleman in diſtreſſe?

                  Hee ſpeakes truer then he thinkes, for if he knew,
The hearts that owe thoſe faces—a darke ſhop's good for
ſomewhat.

                  That was all ſir.

but to be baile to ſea
                        •
                     en hundred pound action, is a matter
of ſhroud weight.
               
               
                  Eaſ.
                  Ile be bound to ſecure you.
               
               
                  Shor.

                  Fal.
                  I haue no great ſtomacke too't, it will appeare in vs

                  We haue neither poſteritie in Towne nor hope for
any abroad; we haue wiues, but the markes haue beene out

forgetfull of hir firſt Husband, that ſhe marryed agen within
the tweluemonth, nay ſome berladye within the month:
there were ſights to be ſeen, had they my wiues true ſorrows
ſeauen nor ſeauen yeares would drawe e'm to the ſtake, I
would moſte tradeſmen had ſuch a wife as I, they hope they
haue, wee muſt all hope the beſt: thus in her honour.
               
               A modeſt wife is ſuch a Iewell,
               Euerie Gold-ſmith cannot ſhow it:
               He that's honeſt, and not cruell,
               Is the likelyeſt man to owe it.
               And that's I, I made it by my ſelfe, and comming to her as a
Beadle for my reward this morning, ile ſee how ſhee takes
my death next her heart.
