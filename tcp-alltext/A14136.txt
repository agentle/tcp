For as moch as thou art sure and hast an evidente token thorow soch persecucion that it is the true worde of God.

And for as moch as contrary wise thou art sure that the Popes doctrine is not of God which (as thou seist) is so agreable vnto ye worlde / and is so receaved of the worlde or which rather so

receaveth the worlde and the pleasures of the worlde / and seketh no thinge but the possessions of the worlde / and auctorite in the worlde / and to beare a rule in ye worlde / and persecuteth ye worde of God / and with all wilynes driveth the people from it / and with false and sophisticall reasons maketh thē aferde of it: yee curseth them and excomunicateth them / and bringeth them in belefe that they be damned / if they loke on it / and that it is but doctrine to deceave men / and moveth the blynde powers of ye worlde to sley with fyre / water & swerde all that cleve vnto it. For the worlde loveth yt which is his / and hateth that which is chosen out of the worlde to sarve God in ye sprite. As Christ sayeth to his disciples Iohānis. xv. Yf ye were of the worlde / the worlde wolde love his awne. But I have chosen you out of the worlde and therfore the worlde hateth you ¶A nother confort hast thou / that as the weake powers of the worlde defende the doctrine of the worlde so the myghty powere of God defendeth the doctrine of God.God defendeth his doctrine him selfe. Which thinge thou shalt evidētly perceave / yf thou call to mynde ye wonderfull deades which God hath ever wrought for his worde in extreme necessite sens the worlde began beyounde all mans reason. Which are written as saith Paul (Romanorum. xv.) for oure lerninge

It began at Abell and hath euer sens cōtinued and shall / I doute not / vntyll the last daye. And the ypocrites have allwaye the worlde on their sydes / as thou seist in tyme of Christe.How oure master christ was entreated. They had the elders / that is to were the rulers of the Iewes / on their syde. They had Pilate and the emperours power on their syde. They had Herode also on their syde. Moare over they brought all their worldly wisdome to passe and all yt they coulde thinke or imagen to serve for their purpose. Fyrst to feare the people with all / they excomunicated all that beleved in him / and put them out of the temple / as thou seist Iohn. ix.The crafte of the ypocrites. Secondly they founde the meanes to haue him condemned by the Emperours power and made it treason to Ceser to beleve in him. Thridly they obteyned to have him hāged as a thefe or a mortherer / which after their bely wisdome was a cause above all causes / that no man shulde beleve in him. For the Iewes take it for a sure token of everlastinge damnacion yf a man be hanged. For it is written in their lawe. Deuteromion. xxj. cursed is whosoever hangeth on tree. Moyses also in ye same place commaundeth / yf any man be

hanged / to take him downe the same daye and bury hym / for feare of pollutinge or defylinge the contrey / that is / lest they shulde bringe the wrath and curse of God apon them. And therfore the weked Iewes them selves / which with so venoumous hate persecuted the doctrine of Christ and did all the shame that they coulde doo vnto him (though they wolde fayne have had Christe to hange still on the crosse and there to rotte / as he shulde have done by the Emperours lawe / yet for feare of defylinge their sabboth and of bringinge the wrath and curse of god apon them) bedgett of Pylate to take hym downe. Iohn. xix. Which was agenst them selves. Fynally when they had done all they coulde and that they thought sufficiente / and when Christ was in the herte of the erth and so many bylles and pollaxes aboute hym / to kepe hym downe / ād when it was past mās helpe: then holpe God. When mā coulde not brīge him agayne / Gods trueth worketh wonders and maketh the wisdome of the ypocrites folishnes. Gods trueth fette hym agayne.

No man can serve two masters God and māmon / that is to saye / weked riches also Mathe. vj. Thou must love christ above all thinge. But that doest thou not yf thou be not ready to forsake all for his sake / yf thou have forsake all for his sake / thē art thou suer that thou lovest him.How is the pope sure which taketh all for Christes sake but forsaketh noughte: Tribulacion is oure righte baptim and is signified by plunginge in to the water / we that are baptised in the name of Christe (saith Paul Ro. vj.) are baptised to dye with hymTribulatio

            The spirite thorow tribulacion purgeth vs and killeth oure fleshly witte / oure wordly vnderstondinge and bely wisdome / and filleth vs full of the wisdome of God. Tribulacion is a blessinge that cometh of God / as witneseth Christe Mathei. v. Blessed are they that sofre persecuciō for rightewesnessis sake / for thers is the kyngdome of heven.Tribulation is a blessynge Ys this not a confortable worde? Who ought not rather to chose and desyre to be blessed with Christe in a litle tribulacion / than to be cursed perpetually with the worlde for a litle pleasure?
            
               
               Prosperite is a curse:Prosperite is a right curse and a thinge that God geveth vnto his enymies. Wo be to you rich saith Christe Luke. vj. Lo ye have youre consolacion / woo be to you that are full / for ye shal hongre / woo be to you that laugh / for ye shall wepe / woo be to you when men prayse you. For so did their fathers vnto the false prophetes: yee and so have oure fathers done vnto the false ypocrites. The ypocrites with worldly preachinge have not goten the prayse only / but even the possessions also and the dominion and rule of the whole worlde.
            Tribulacion for rigthteousnes is not a blessinge only.Tribulation is the gyfte of God. But also a gyfte that God geveth vnto none save his speciall frendes. The apostles / Actes. v. reioysed that they were counted worthy to sofre rebuke for Christes sake. And Paul in the seconde pistle and thred chapter to Timotheum saith. All that will lyve Godly in Christe Iesu must sofre persecucion. And in the first chapter of his pistle to the Philippiens he saith. Vnto you it is geven not only to beleve in Christe: But also to sofre for his sake. Here se
                  •
               st thou that it is Gods gyfte to sofre for Christes sake. And Peter in the fourth Chapter off his first Pistle saith. Happy are ye / yf ye sofre for the name of Christ / for the glorious sprite of God resteth in you. Is it not an happy thinge to

be sure that thou arte sealed with Gods spirite vnto everlastinge lyfe? And veryly thou art sure therof / yf thou sofre paciently for his sake whereby then ar the pope ād bisshappes sure?. By sofrīge art thou sure. But by persecutinge canst thou never be sure.
            ¶For Paul in the fyft chapter to the Romayns saith. Tribulacion maketh fealīge / that is / it maketh vs feale the goodnes of God and his helpe and the workynge of his sprite. And in the twelfe chapter of the seconde pistle to the Corrinthyans the Lorde sayde to Paul / my grace is sufficiēte for the. For my strength is made perfecte thorow wekenes. Lo Christ is never stronge in vs / tyll we be weke. As oure strength abateth / so groweth the strēgth of Christ in vs / when we are clene empted of oure awne strength / thē are we full of Christes strēgth. And loke how moch of oure awne strength remayneth in vs / so moch lacketh there of the strength of Christe. Therfore saith Paul in the said place of his seconde Pistle to the Corrintheās. Very gladly will I reioyse in my weaknes / that the strength of Christ maye dwell in me. Ther fore haue I delectaciō saith Paul in infirmytes / in rebukes in neade / in persecucions and in anguysh for Christes sake. ffor when I am weake / then am I stronge / meanynge that the weakenesse of the flesh is the strength of the sprite.Flesh: And by flesh vnderstande witt / wisdome

and all that is in a man before the sprite of God come / and what so ever springeth not of the sprite of God and of Gods worde. And of lyke testimonyes is all the scripture full.
            Beholde God setteth before vs a blessinge and also a curse. A blessinge verely and that a glorious & an everlastinge / yf we will sofre tribulacion and adversite with oure lorde and savioure Christ. And an everlastinge curse / yf for a litle pleasures sake we withdrawe oure selves from the chastisinge and nurtoure of God / wherwith he teacheth all his sonnes and fascioneth them after his godly will and maketh them perfecte (as he did Christe) and maketh them apte and mete vessels to receave his grace and his sprite / that they myght perceave and feale the exceadinge mercy which we have in Christe and the innumerable blessinges / and the vnspeakeable enheritaunce where vnto we are called and chosen and sealed in oure savioure Iesus Christe / vnto whom be prayse for ever Amen.
            Finally whom God choseth to regne everlastingly with Christe hym sealeth he with his myghtie sprite and powreth strength in to his herte to sofre affliccions also with Christ for beringe wittenes vnto the trouth.The difference betwene the childern of God and of the deuell. And this is the difference betwene the childerne of God and of saluacion and betwene

the childerne of the devyll and of damnaciō / that the childerne of God have power in their hertes to sofre for gods worde which is their lyfe and saluacion / their hope and trust and wherby they lyve in the soule and sprite before God. And ye childerne of the devyll in tyme of adversite fle from Christe whom they folowed faynedly / their hertes not sealed with hys holy and myghty sprite / and gett them to the stondert of their right father the devell / and take The devels w

My sonne despice not ye chastisinge of the lorde / nether faynte whē thou art rebuked of hym. For whom the lorde loveth him he chasteseth: yee and he scourgeth All Gods childern are vnder chastisynge. every sonne whom he receaveh Loo persecucion and adversite for the trueth sake is Gods scourge and Gods rodde and pertayneth vnto all his childerne indifferently. For when he saith / he scourgeth every sonne / he maketh none excepcion. Moare over saith the texte / yf ye shall endure chastysynge / God offereth him selfe vnto you / as vnto sonnes. What sonne is it that the father chastiseth not? Yf ye be not vnder correccion (where of all are partetakers) then are ye bastardes and not

sonnes.

How God sens the beginnynge of the worlde / before a generall plage / ever sente his true prophetes and preachers of his worde / to warne the people / and gave them space to repente. But they for the grettest part of them hardened their hertes and persecuted the worde that was sente to save thē. And then God destroyed them vtterly and toke them cleane from the erthe.

But they waxed herde harted. And God sente his plages & pestilences amonge them / and sente their enimies in apon them on every syde and destroyed them vtterly.
            Marke also how Christe threatneth thē that forsake hym for what so ever cause it be: Whether for feare / eyther for shame / eyther for losse of honoure / frendes / lyfe or goodes? He that denieth me before men / him will I denie bifore my father that is in heven. He that loveth father or mother moare thē me / is not worthy of me. All this saith he Math the tenth. And in the .viij. of marke he sayeth. Whosoever is ashamed of me or my wordes amonge this advoutours and synnefull generacion: of him shall the sonne of man be ashamed / when he cometh in the glorie of hys father with his holy angels. And Luke. ix. also: None that layeth his hande to the plowe and loketh backe / is mete for the kyndome of heven.

and so the trueth of God springeth of ye trueth of man. Thus Antichriste turnith the rotes of the trees vppwarde.Antichrist turneth the rotes of the tre vpward. What is ye cause that we damme some of Origenes workes and alowe some? How knowe we that some is heresy and some not? By the scripture I trowe.

A man must fyrst be well sene in Aristoteles yer he can vnderstonde the scripture saye they. Aristotell Aristoteles doctrine is / that the worlde was without begynnynge and shalbe without ende / and that the fyrst man never was and the last shall never be. And that God doeth all of necessite nether careth what we doo nether will aske any accomptes of

that we doo. Without this doctrine how coulde we vnderstonde the Scripture scripture that sayeth / God created the worlde of nought / and God worketh all thinge of his fre will and for a secret purpose / and that we shall all ryse agayne / and that God will have acomptes of all that we have done in this lyfe. AristotellAristotle saith. Geve a man a lawe and he hath power of hym selfe to doo or fulfyll ye lawe and becometh righteous with workynge righteously.Paul But Paul and all the scripture saith / that the lawe doeth but vtter synne only and helpeth not. Nether hath any man power to doo the lawe / tyll the sprite of God be geven hym thorow fayth in Christ. Is it not a madnes then to saye yt we coulde not vnderstōde the scripture without Aristotle.Aristotell Aristotles righteousnes & all his vertues springe of a mās fre will. And a turke and every infidele and ydolater maye be righteous and vertuous with that righteousnes and those vertues. Moare over Aristoteles felicite and blessednes stondeth in avoydinge of all tribulacions / and in riches / health / honoure / worshepe / frendes & autorite / which felicite pleaseth oure spiritualty well.

            By this meanes then / thou wilt that no man teach a nother / but that every man take the scripture & lerne by hym selfe. Naye verely / so saye I not.

moveth the very hertes of vs to rebelle agenste the ordinaunces and will of God / and prove that no man is righteous in the sight of God / but that we are all damned by the lawe. And then (when thou hast meked them and feared them with the lawe) teach them the testamente and promises which God hath made vnto vs in Christe / & how mercyfull and kynde he is / and how moch he loveth vs in Christe. And teach them the principles and the grounde of the fayth and what the sacramentes signifye and then shall the sprite worke with thy preachinge and make them feale. So wolde it come to passe / that as we know by naturall witte what foloweth of a true principle of naturall reason: even so by the principles of the fayth and by the playne scriptures and by the texte / shulde we iudge all mens exposicion and all mens doctrine / and shulde receave the best and refuse the worst. I wolde have you to teach them also the propirties and maner of speakinges of the scripture / and how to expounde proverbes and similitudes. And then if they goo abroade and walke by the feldes and medowes of all maner doctours and philosophers they coulde catch no harme.

one saith this place is holier / Place and a nother that place is holier / and this religion is holyer then that / and this saynte is greater with God then that and an hundred thousande lyke thinges. Mans

Ephe. vj. And j. Pe. ij. servaūtes obeye your masters with all feare not ōly if they be good & courteous: but also though they be frowarde.

In what so ever kynde therfore thou art a seruaunte / duringe the tyme of thy covenauntes / thy master is vnto the

For thou art his good and possession / as his oxe or his horse in so moch that who so ever doth but desyre the in his herte from him without his love & licēce is cōdēned of God / which sayeth Exodi. xx. se thou once covet not thy neybours servavntes.
            
               Oure spiritualte reteyne mens sarvauntes not to honoure God but there traditions ād ceremomonies only.Paule ye Apostle sent home Onesimus vnto his master (as thou readest in the pistle of Paul to Philemō) In so moch yt though the said Philemon with his servaunte also was converted by Paul & owed vnto Paul and to the worde that Paul preached / not his servaunte only / but also him selfe: yee & though that Paul was in necessite and lacked ministers to minister vnto him in the bō
               des which he soffered for the Gospels sake: yet wold he not retayne the servaunt necessary vnto ye furtheraunce of the Gospell without the consent of the master.
            
               Christes doctrine and the popes differ:O how sore differeth ye doctrine of christ and his Apostles from the doctrine of the Pope and of his Apostles. For if any man will obeye nether father ner mother / If thy master please the not shave the selfe a monke a frere or a prest. nether lorde nor master / nether kynge ner prince / ye same nedeth but only to take the marke of

the beest / that is / to shave him selfe a monke / a frere or a prest / and is then immediatly fre and exempted fro all service and obediē
               ce due vnto man. To obeye no man ys a spirituall thynge. He that will obeye no man (as they will not) is most acceptable vnto them. The moare disobedient that thou arte vnto Gods ordinaunces / the moare apte and mete arte thou for theirs. Nether is the professinge / vowinge and sweringe obedience vnto their ordinaūces any other thinge / then the defienge / denienge and forsweringe obediēce vnto ye ordinaunces of God.

And agayne (said David) God be iudge / and iudge betwene the and me ād behold ād plete my cause / & geve me iudgemēte or right of the.
            And in the .xxvi. Chapter of the same boke / when Saul persecuted David agayne. David came to Saul by night / as he slepte and all his men / and toke awaye his spere and a coppe of water from his hedde. Then said Abisai Davids servaunte / God hath delyvered the thine enemie in to thine hande this daye / lat me now therfore naile hī to the grounde with my spere and geve him but even one stripe and no moare. David forbad him sainge.God provideth a meanes to take the evell out of the waeye whē they have fulfilled there wekednes kyll him not. For who (said he) shall laye handes on the lordes ā

            Why did not David sle Saul / seinge he was so weked / not in persecutīge david only / but in disobeyenge Gods cōmaūdmētes ād in yt he had slayne.Why David slewe not Saul. lxxxv. of Gods prestes wrongfully? Verely for it was not lawfull. For if he had done it / he must have sinned agenste god.The kinge is in the rowme of god in this world. For God hath made the

kīge in every realme iudge over all / ād over him is there no iudge. He yt iudgeth the kinge iudgeth God & he that layeth hādes on the kīge layeth hāde on God / ād he that resisteth the kinge resisteth God and dāneth Gods lawe and ordinaūce.

            And in the fyrst Chaptour of the seconde boke of kinges David cōmaunded the younge mā to be slayne / which broughte vnto him the croune ād bracelet of Saul ād said to please David with all / that he him selfe had slayne Saul.

But Christe condemned their dedes and also the secret thoughtes of all other that consented there vnto sayenge: excepte ye repēte ye shall like wise perishe. As who shuld saye / I knowe that ye are within in youre hertes soch as they were outwarde in their deades / and are vnder the same damnacion: excepte therfore ye repēt betymes / ye shall breake out at the last in to lyke deades / and lyke wise perishe / as it came afterwarde to passe.

Nether cā the profession of monkes and freres or anye thinge that the Pope or Bisshoppes cā laie for thē selves / excepte them from the swerde of the Emperoure or kinges / yf they breake the lawes.

               There is no powere but of God (by power vnderstōde the auctorite of kinges and princes) The powers that be / are ordened of God. Whosoever therfore resisteth power resisteth God: Yee though he be Pope / Bisshope / monke or frere. They that resiste shall receave vnto them selves damnacion. Why? For Gods worde is agaynst them which will have all men vnder the power of the temperall swerde.
               For rulers are not to be feared for good workes but for evyll. Hereby seist thou yt they yt resiste ye powers or seke to be exēpte frō their auctorite have evyll cōsciēces & seke libertie to sinne vnpunesshed & to be fre frō bearīge payne with ther bretherne.
               Wilt thou be

without feare of the power? So doo well and thou shalt have laude of the same (that is to saye of the ruler) With good livynge ought the spirituallte to ridde thē selves frō feare of the tēporal swerde / & not with craft and with blindinge the kynges and bringinge the vengeaunce of God apon thē ād in purchasinge licēce to sinne vnpunisshed.

            GOd requireth the law to be kepte of all men let them kepe it for what soever purpose they will. Will they not kepe ye lawe:Thre natures. so vouchsafeth he not that they enioye this temperall life. Now are there. thre natures of men / one all to gether beestly which / in no wise receave the lawe in

their hertes / but rise agenst princes & rulers when so ever they are able to make their partie good. Thes are signified by thē that worsheped the golden calfe. For Moyses brake the tables of the lawe yer he came at them.
            The seconde are not so beestly / but receave the lawe / and vnto thē the lawe cometh: but they loke not Moyses in ye face. For his coūtenaūce is to bright for thē / that is / they vnderstonde not yt the lawe is spirituall ād requireth the herte. They loke on the pleasure / profit and promocion that foloweth the kepinge of the lawe / and in respecte of the rewarde kepe they the lawe outwardly with workes / but not in the herte. For if they might obteyne lyke honoure / glorie / promociō and dignite and also avoyde all incōvenientes / yf they broke the lawe / so wolde they also breake the lawe & folowe their lustes.
            The thred are spirituall and loke Moyses in the open face & are (as Paul saith the seconde to the Romains) a lawe vnto them selves and have the lawe writtē in their hertes by the spirite of God. Thes neade nether of kinge ner officers to drive thē / nether that any mā profer thē any rewarde for to kepe the lawe. For they do it naturally.
            The first worke for feare of the swerde only. The seconde for rewarde. The thred worke for love frely. They loke on the excedī

They cōsente vnto the lawe that it is holy and iust and that all men ought to doo what soever God commaūdeth for no other cause / A christē mā seketh no moare but gods will but because God commaundeth it. And their great sorow is / because that there is no strength in their membres to doo that which their herte lusteth to do and is a thurst to do.
            Thes of the last sworte kepe ye lawe of their awne accorde and that in the herte / and have professed perpetuall warre agaynste the lustes and appetites of the fleshe / tyll they be vtterly subdued: yet not thorow their awne strength / but knowynge and knowlegynge their wekenes crye ever for strength to God which hath promysed assistence vnto all that call vpon him. These folow God and are led of his sprite. The other two are led of lustes and appetites.
            Lustes and appetites are divers and many and that in one mā:Lustes ye and one luste contrarie to a nother and the greatest lust carieth a mā all to gether awaye with him. We

are also chaunged frō one lust vnto a nother Otherwise are we desposed when we are childern / otherwise whē we are youngmē and other wise when we are olde / otherwise over evē & other wise in the morninge: ye somtymes altered .vj. tymes in an howre.

Because yt the will of mā foloweth the witte & is subiecte vnto the witte and as the witte erreth so doith the will / ād as the witte is in captivite / so is the will / nether is it possible that ye will shuld be fre where the witte is in bondage.

The rote of al evill the greatest damnaciō and most terrible wrath and vengeaunce of God that we are in / is naturall blindnes. We are all out of the right waye / every man his wayes: One iudgeth this best / a nother that to be best. Now is Worldly witte. worldlye witte no thinge else but craft and sotilte to obteyne that which we iudge falsly to be best. As I erre in my witte / so erre I in my will.The will is bond and led. When I iudge that to be evyll / which in dede is good / then hate I that which is good. And when I suppose that good which is evill in dede / then love I evill. As yf I be perswaded and borne in hande that my most frende is myne enemye then hate I my best frende: and yf

I be brought in belefe that my most enimie is my frende / Then love I my most enimie Now when we saye / every man hath his fre will / to doo what him lusteth I saye verely that men doo what they lust. Not with stondynge to folow lustes is not fre

If God open any mans wittes to make hym feale in his herte / that lustes and appetites are damnable / and geve hī power to hate and resiste them / then is he fre even with the fredome where with Christ maketh fre / ād hath power to doo the will of God.Fredome.
            
            Thou maist hereby perceave that all that is done in the world (before the spirite of God come and geveth vs light) is damnable sinne / and the moare glorious the moare damnable:All is synne that sprēgeth not of the spirite of god ād all that is not done in the lighte of gods worde. so that that which ye worlde counteth most glorious is moare damnable in the sighte of God / then that which the whore / the thefe and the mortherer doo. With blinde reasons of worldly wisdome maist thou chaūge the myndes of youth and make them geve them selves to what thou wilt eyther for feare / for prayse or for profit:Soo doo our spiritualte in all there workes. and yet doist but chaunge them from one vice to a nother. As the persuasions of her frendes made lucrece chast. Lucrece beleved yf she were a good huswife and chast / that she shulde be most glorious / & that all the world wolde geve her honoure / and

prayse her. She soughte her awne glory in her chastite and not Gods. When she had lost her chastite / then counted she her selfe most abhominable in the sighte of all men / ād for very payne & thought which she had / not that she had displeased god / but that she had lost her honoure / slew her selfe. Loke how great her payne and sorow was for the losse of her chastite / so greate was her glorie and reioysinge there in / and so moch despiced she them that were other wise / and pitied them not. Which pride god moare abhorreth thē the whordome of any whore.

               And Math. xvij. both Christe and also Peter paye tribute / where the meaninge of Christes question vnto Peter is: yf princes take tribute of straungres only and not of their childern / then verily ought I to be fre which am the sonne of God / whose servauntes and ministres they are and of whom they have their auctorite. Yet because they nether knewe that nether Christe came to vse that auctorite / but to be oure servaunte and to beare oure burthen and to obeye all ordinaunces / both in right and wronge for oure sakes and to teach vs: therfore said he to saynt Peter. Paye for the and me lest we offende them. Moareover though that Christe and Peter (because they were pore) might have escaped / yet wold he not for feare of offendinge other and hurtinge their consciences. For he might well have geven occasion vnto the tribute gatherers to have iudged amisse bothe of him and his doctrine: ye & ye Iewes might happely have byn offended thereby and have thought that it had not be lawfull / for them to have

paid tribute vnto hethen princes and ydolaters / seinge that he so greate a prophet payde not: Ye and what other thynge causeth the laye so litle to regarde there princes / as that they se them both dispised ād disobeyed of the spiritualte?Whē the spiritualte payeth tribute But oure prelates which care for none offendinge of consciences and lesse for Gods ordinaunces / will paye nought: but when princes must fighte in oure most holy fathers quarell and agenst christe. Then are they the first. There also is none so pore that then hath not somewhat to geve.
               
                  Shamelesse iugulars.Marke here how past all shame oure scole doctours are (as Rochester is in his sermon agenst Marten Luther) which of this texte of Mathew dispute that Peter because he payd tribute / is gretter then the other Apostles / and hath moare auctorite and power then they / and was heed vnto them all / contrary vnto so many cleare textes / where Christe rebuketh them sayenge: that is an hethenesh thinge that one shuld clyme above a nother or desyre to be greater To be greate in the kyngdome of heven is to be a servaunte / and he that most humbleth him selfe and becometh a servaunt vnto other (after the ensample of Christe I meane and his Apostles and not of the Pope and his Apostles oure Cardinales and Bisshopes) the same is greatest in that kyngdome.

Yf Peter in payenge tribute became greatest / how cometh it / that they will paye none at all? But to paie tribute is a signe of subiection veryly / and the cause why Christ payed was because he had an howsholde / and for the same cause payed Peter also. For he had an house / a shippe and nettes / as thou readest in the Gospel. But let vs goo to Paul agayne.
               
                  Wherfore ye must neades obeye / not for feare of vengeaunce only: but also because of consciēce. That is though thou be so mighty (as now many yeres oure Pope ād prelates every where are) that thou neadest not to obeye the temperall swerde for feare of vē

And thus it behoved Christe to sofre and to rise ageyne the thrid daye.

Then brought they forth the keye of the swete promises sayenge: repente and be baptised every one of you in the name of Iesus Christe for the remission of sinnes / and ye shall receave the gyft of the holy gooste. For the promise was made vnto you & vnto youre childern and to all that are a ferre even as many as the lorde shal call. Of lyke ensamples is the Actes full & Peters pistles / & Pauls pistles & all the scripture / The popis auctorite: ys to preach gode word only nether hath oure holy father any other auctorite of Christ or by the reason of his predicessor Peter thē to preach Gods worde.

            To preach Gods worde is to moch for half a mā. And to minister a tēporall kīgdome is to moch for half a mā also. Ether other requireth an hole man. One therfore can not well doo both.

            Vnderstonde therfore that one thinge in the scripture representeth divers thinges. A serpente figureth Christe in one place ād the devell in a nother. And a lyon doeth lykewise. Christe by leven signifieth Gods worde in one place / ād in a nother signifieth

therby the tradiciōs of the Phareses which sowred ād altered Gods worde for their avauntage. Now Moyses verely in the said place representeth Christe / Aarō ys every true preacher. & Aarō which was not yet hye prest / represented / not Peter only or his successoure / as my lorde of rochester wolde have it (for peter was to litle to beare Christes message vnto all the worlde) but signifieth every disciple of christe ād every true preacher of gods worde. For moyses put in Aarons mouth / what he shulde saye / and Aarō was Moyses prophete and spake / not his awne message (as the pope ād Bisshopes doo) but that which Moyses had receaved of God and delivered vnto him Exodi. iiij. and also .vij. So ought every preacher to preach Gods worde purely and nether to adde nor minishe. A true messenger must doo his message truly and saye nether moare nor lesse then he is commaunded.

When Moyses was gone Vp in to the mounts

and Aaron left behynde and made the golden calfe / there Aaron representeth all false preachers and namely oure most holy father the Pope / which in like maner maketh vs beleve in a bulle / as ye Bisshope of Rochester fullwell alegeth the place in his sermō.

What is ye cause yt oure Bisshopes preache the pope ād not Christe seinge the Apostles preached not Peter / but Christe.The apostels preached not peter: But christe Paul .ij. Corīthe. iiij. saith of him selfe and of his fellowpostles: we preach not oure selves / but Christe Iesus the lorde: and preach oure selves youre servantes for Iesus sake. And .j. Corin. iij.

            Moare over the Apostles were sent immediatly of Christe and of Christe receaved they their auctorite / as Paul bosteth hym selfe every where. Christe (saith he) sent me to preach the Gospell .j. Cor. i. And I receaved of the lorde that which I delyverd vnto you .i. Corinth. xi And Gala. i. I certifie you brethern that the Gospell which was preached of me / was not after the maner of mē (that is to wete carnall or fleshly) nether receaved I it of man / nether was it taught me: but I receaved it by the revelacion of Iesus Christe. And Galath. ij. he that was myghty in Peter in the Apostleshep over the circumcision / was myghty in me amonge the gentiles. And .i. Timoth. i. Readest thou lyke wise. And Iohn. xx. Christe sent them forth indifferently and gave them lyke power. As my father sent me (saith he) so sende I you: yt is to preach and to sofre / as I have done / and not to cō
               quere empyres and kyngdomes and to subdue all temperall power vnder you with

disgysed ypocrisie. He gave them the holy gooste to bynde and lowse indifferently / as thou seist: ād afterwarde he sente forth Paul with lyke auctorite / as thou seist in the Actes. And in the last of Mathew saith he: all power is geven me in heven and in erth goo therfore and teach all nacions baptisinge them in the name of the father and of the sonne ād of the holy goost / teachīge thē to observe what so ever I commaūded you: The auctorite The auctorite that Christ gave was to preach Christes worde. that Christe gave them was to preach / yet not what they wold imagen / but what he had commaunded.

Seinge also that the office of an Apostle is to preach only / how can the Pope kalēge with right / any auctorite where

he preacheth not?. How cometh it also that Rochester will not let vs be called one congregacion be the reason of one God / one Christe / one sprite / one Gospell / one fayth one hope / and one baptim / as well as because of one pope?

               e / ☞ that one is greater then a nother / because that in congregations one is sente of a nother / as we se in the Actes. I answere that Peter sent no man / but was sent hym selfe / and Iohn was sent / and Paul / Sylas and Barnabas ware sent. How be it soch maner sendinges are not worldly / as princes sende their Ambasadours no ner as freres send their limyters to gather there bretherhedes which must obeye whether they will or will not. Here all thinge is fre and willingly. And the holy goost bringeth them to gether which maketh their willes fre and ready to bestow them selves apon their neybours profit. And they that come / offer them selves and all that they have or can doo / to serve the lorde and their brethern. And every man / as he is founde apte and mete to serve his neyboure / so is he sente or put in office. And of the holy goost are they sent with the consent of their brethern and with their awne consente also. And Gods worde ruleth in that congregacion / vnto which

worde every man confirmeth his will. And Christe which is all waye presente is the hed. Why bisshopes make thē a god on erth But as oure Bisshopes heare not Christes voyce / so se they him not presente: and therfore make them a God on the erth / of they Aaron made a calfe. And the Pope maketh bulles kynde (I suppose) of Aarons calfe. For he bringeth forth no other frute but bulles.
            For as moch also as Christe is as greate as Peter / why is not his seate as greate as Peters? Had the heed of the empyre byn at Iherusalem / their had byn no mencion made of Peter. It is verely / as Paul saith in the eleventh Chapter of the seconde Pistle to the Corinthyans. The false Apostles are desceatefull workers / and fassion them selves lyke vnto the Apostles of Christe. That is the shaven The shaven nacion hath put christ out of his rowme and all kynges and the emperoure. nacion preached Christe falsly / ye vnder the name of Christe preached them selves ād raygne in christes stede: have also takē awaye the keye of knowlege ād have wrapped the people in ignoraūce ād have taught thē to beleve in thē selves / in their tradiciōs & false cerimonies: so yt christe is but a vayne name.Christ is but a vayne name. ād after they had putt christe out of his rowme / they gate thē selves to ye Emperoure & kynges ād so lōge ministred their busines tyl they have also put thē out of their rowmes & have gott their auctorites frō thē & raygne also in their stede:Proper ministers so yt ye emperoure & kīges are but vayne

            Let vs se a nother poynte of oure greate clerke.Rochester ys proved both ignorāt and malicious A little after the beginnynge of his sermon / entendinge to prove that which is clearer then the sonne and serveth no moare for his purpos then Ite missa est serveth to prove that oure lady was borne without originall sinne: he allegeth a saynge that Martē luther sayth / which is this yf we affirme that any one pistle of Paul or any one place of his pistles perteyneth not vnto the vniversall chirch / that is / to all the congregaciō of them that beleve in Christe / we take a waye all saynte Pauls auctorite. Where apon saith Rochester. Yf it be thus of the wordes of saint Paul moch rather it is true of the Gospels of Christe and of every place of them. O malicious blindnes First note his blindnes. He vnderstondeth by this worde Gospel no moare but the foure evangelistes Mathew / Marke / Luke and Iohn and thinketh not that the Actes of the apostles and the pistles of Peter / of Paul and of Iohn and of other lyke are also the Gospel Paul calleth his preachinge the Gospell.The pistles of Paul are the Gospell: Roma. ij. and .j. Cori. iiij. and Gal. j. and .j. Timoth. j. The Gospell is every wheere one

though it be preached of divers ād What Gospell signifieth. signifieth glad tidinges / that is to wete / an open preachinge of Christe and the holy testamē
               te and gracious promises that God hath made in Christes bloude to all that repente and beleve. Now is there moare Gospell in one pystle of Paul / that is to saye / Christe is moare clerely preached ād moo promises rehersed in one pistle of Paul / thē in ye .iii. first Evāgelistes. Mathew / Marke & Luke.
            Considre also his maliciousnes / how wekedly and how craftily he taketh awaye the auctorite of Paul. It is moch rather true of the Gospells and of every place in thē then of paul. One Gospell one spirite: one trueth. Yf that which the foure Evāgelistes wrote be truer then that which Paul wrote / then is it not one Gospel that they preached / nether one sprite that taught them. Yf it be one Gospell ād one sprite / how is one truer then the other? The auctorite of paul ād of hys Gospell: Paul proveth his auctorite to the Galathians and to the Corinthians / because that he receaved his Gospell by revelacion of Christe and not of man / and because that when he comuned with Peter and the hye Apostles of his Gospell and preachinge / they coulde improve no thinge / nether teach hym any thinge: and because also that as many were converted ād as great miracles shewed by his preachinge as at the preachinge of the hye Apostles / and therfore wilbe of no lesse auctorite / 

then Peter and other hye Apostles. Ner have his Gospell of lesse reputacion thē thers
            Fynally that thou mayst knowe Rochester for ever and all the remaunte by hym / what they are with in ye skynne / marke how he playeth bo pepe with the scripture.Rochester playeth bo pepe. He allegeth the beginnynge of the tenth chapter to the Hebrues. Vmbram habens lex futurorum bonorum / the lawe hath but a shadowe of thinges to come. And immediatly expoundeth the figure cleane contrary vnto the chapter folowinge and to all the hole pistle / makynge Aaron a figure of the Pope whom the Epistle maketh a figure of Christe.
            He allegeth halfe a texte of Paul. j. Timoth. iiij. In the later dayes some shall departe from the fayth gevīge hede vnto sprites of errore and develish doctrine: but it foloweth in the texte / gevinge attendaunce or hede vnto the develish doctrine of them which speake false thorow ypocrisye and have their consciences marked with a hote yeron / forbiddinge to mary and commaundinge to absteyne from meates which God hath created to be receaved with gevinge thankes. Which two thinges who ever dyd save the Never man forbade to mary save the pope Pope Rochersters God / makynge synne in the creatures which God hath created for mans vse to be receaved with thankes. The kyngdome of heven is not

meate and drinke / saith Paul / but righteousnes peace and Ioye in the holy goost. For who so ever in these thinges serveth Christe pleaseth God and is alowed of men Roma. xiiij. Had Rochester therfore not a consciē
               ce marked with the hote yeron of malice / so that he can not consente vnto the will of God and glorie of christe / he wolde not have so alleged the texte which is contrarye to none save them selves.
            He allegeth an other texte of Paul in the seconde chapter of his seconde pistle to the Tessaloniens. Erit disessio primum / that is saith Rochester / before the comynge of Antychrist there shalbe a notable departinge from the fayth. And Paul saith. The lorde cometh not excepte there come a departinge first. Pauls meaninge is that the last daye cometh not so shortly / but that antychrist shall come first ād destroye the fayth and sit in the temple of God and make all men whorshepe hym and beleve in him (as the Pope doeth) and then shall Gods worde come to lyghte agayne (as it doeth at this tyme) and destroye hym and vtter his iuglynge and then cometh christe vnto iudgemente. What saye ye of this crafty convayar? Wolde he spare / suppose ye to allege & to wreste other doctours pestilētly / which feareth not for to iugle with ye holy scripture of god expoūdinge yt vnto antychrist which

Paul speaketh of Christe? No be thou sure. But evē after this maner wise perverte they the hole scripture and all doctours wrestinge thē vnto their abhominable purpose cleane contrary to the meanynge of the texte ād to the circumstaunces that goo before and after. The cause why they wil not have the scripture in english. Which develish falsheed left the laye men shuld perceave / is the very cause why that they / will not sofre the scripture to be had in the englysh tonge / nether any worke to be made / that shulde bringe the people to knowleage of the trueth.
            He allegeth for the Popes auctorite saynt Cipriane / saint Augustine / Ambrose / Hierom and Origene: of which never one knew of any auctorite yt one Bisshope shulde have above a nother. And saint Gregory allegeth he which wolde receave no soch auctorite above his brethern when it was proferd him. As the maner is to call Tully chefe of oratours. Tully chefe of Oratours for his singuler eloquence / ād Aristotle chefe of philosophers and Virgill chefe of Poetes for their singuler lernynge / and not for any auctorite that they had over other: so was it the maner to call Peter chefe of the Apostles for his singuler activite and boldnes / ād not that he shulde be lorde over his brethern contrary to his awne doctrine. Yet compare that chefe Apostle vnto Paul / and he is founde a great waye inferior. This I saye not that I wolde that any

man shulde make a God of Paul / contrary vnto his awne lernynge.

Thessal. ij. I answere that Paul taught by mouth soch thinges as he wrote in his pistles.

A lyke argumente (which I suppose to be rather true) I make▪ Rochester and his holy brethern have brunt Christes testamēte: an evident signe verely that they wold have brunte Christe himselfe also if they had had him.

If Rochester be soch a iuguler: What suppose ye of the reste▪ let Rochester be an example therefore to iudge them all Which texte he this wise englisheth: faith which is wrought by love / ād maketh a verbe passive of a verbe deponente. Rochester will have love to goo before and fayth to sprīge out of love. Thus Antichrist turneth the rotes of ye tre vpwarde. I must fyrst love a bitter medicine (after Rochesters doctrine) and then beleve that it is wholsome. When by naturall reason / I fyrst hate a bitter medicine / vntyll I be brought in belefe of the phisicion that it is wholsome and that the bitternes shall heale me / and then afterwarde love it of that belefe. Doeth the childe love the father fyrst and then beleve that he is his sonne or heyre or rather because he knoweth that he is his sonne or heyre and beloved / therfore loveth agayne?

Now by fayth are we sones as Iohn saith in the fyrst chapter of his Gospell. He gave them power to be the sonnes of God in that they beleved on

his name. And Paul sayth / in the thred Chapter of his Pistle to the Galathiens / we are all the sonnes of God by the fayth which is in Iesus Christe. And Iohn in the said chapter of his Pistle saith. Here by perceave we love / that he gave his lyfe for vs. We coulde se no love ner cause to love agayne / excepte that we beleved that he died for vs and that we were saved thorow his deeth. And in the chapter folowinge saith Iohn. Here in is love: not that we loved God: but that he loved vs and sente his sonne to make a grement for oure synnes.

He must be well reaported of them that are without / lest he fall in to rebuke and in to the snare of the evill speaker / that is / lest the infideles which yet beleve not shulde be hurte by hī and dreven from the fayth / yf a mā that were defamed were made hed and overser of the congregacion.

A nother cause is / that chastite is an exceadinge selden gyfte / and vnchastyte exceadinge perelous for that degre. In as moch as the people loke as well vnto the

lyvinge as vnto the preachinge / and are hurte at once yf the lyvinge disagre / and fall from the fayth and beleve not the worde.
            This oversear because he was taken from his awne busynes and laboure / to preach Gods worde vnto the paresh / hath ryght by the auctorite of his office / to calenge an honest lyvinge of the paresh / as thou mayst se in the Evangelistes and also in Paul.What the prestes dutie ys to do: and what to have For who will have a servaunte and will not geve him meate / drynke and raymente and all thinges necessary?

And in soch dayes / as we now offer / so gave they every mā his porcion acordinge to his abylite and as God put in his herte / to the mayntenaunce of the prest deakon and other comune ministers and of the pore and to fynde lerned men to teach / and so forth. And all was putt in the handes of the deacon / as thou mayst se in the lyfe of saynte Laurence and in the histories Why landes were geven vnto the spirituall officers before we fell from the fayth.

Christe referreth him selfe vnto the scriptures Iohn

v. And in the .xj. Chapter of Mathew / vnto the question of Iohn Baptistes disciples he answered. The blynde se / the lepers are clēsed / the deed aryse agayne &c. meanynge that if I doo the workes which are prophesied that Christe shulde doo whē he cometh / why dowte ye whether I be he or no as who shuld saye / axe the scripture whether I be Christ or no and not my selfe. How happeneth it then that oure prelates will not come to the light also that we maye se whether their workes be wrought in God or no? Why feare they to lett the laye men se what they doo? Why make they all their examinacions in darkenes?☜ Why examine they not their causes of heresye openly / as the laye men doo their fellons and mortherars? Wherfore did Christ and his Apostles also warne vs so diligently of Antychriste and of false Prophetes that shulde come? Because that we shulde slomber or slepe carelesse 
                     •
                   or rather that we shulde loke in the light of the scripture with all diligens to spie them when they came / and not to sofre oure selves to be disceaved ād led out of the waye? Iohn biddeth iudge the spirites. Whereby shall we iudge them but by the scripture? How shallt thou know / whether the Prophet be true or false or whether he speake gods worde or of his awne heed yf

thou wilt not se the scriptures? Why said David in the seconde psalme be lerned ye that iudge the erth lest the lorde be angry with you ād ye pereshe frō the righte waye?Be lerned ye that iudge the erth:

               The Emperoure and kynges are no thinge now a dayes but even hangmen vnto the Pope ād Bisshopes / to kyll whosoever they condemne / with out any moare a doo / as Pilate was vnto the scribes and pharises and the hie Bisshopes / to hange Christe.The kynges are become Antichristes hangemen. For as those prelates answered Pilate (whē he axed what he had done) yf he were not an evyll doer we wolde not have brought hym vnto the. As who shuld saye / we ar to holy to doo any thinge amisse / thou mayst beleve vs well ynough: ye and his bloude on oure heedes / sayed they / kyll hī hardly / we will beare the charge / oure soules for thine: we have also a lawe by which he ought to dye / for he calleth him selfe Gods sone.

               MAtrimonie or wedlocke is a state or a degree ordined of god & an office where in ye husbāde serveth ye wife & ye wife ye husbōde. It was ordined for a remedy & to encrease the worlde / and for the man to helpe the woman and the woman the mā with all love and kyndes / and not to signifie any promise

that ever I herde or redde of in ye scripture.Matrimony was not ordeyned to signyfy any promyse. Therfore ought it not to be called a sacramente. It hath a promise that we synne not in that state / yf a man receave his wife as a gyft geven to him of God / and the wife her husbōde lyke wise: as all maner meates and drinkes have a promyse that we synne not / yf we vse them measurably with thankes gevinge. Yf they call matrimonie a sacrament because the scripture vseth the similitude of matrimonie to expresse the mariage or wedlocke that is betwene vs ād christe (For as a woman though she be never so pore / yet when she is maried / is as rych as her husbande: even so we when we repente and beleve the promises of God in Christe / though we be never so pore synners / yet are as rich as Christe / all his merites are ours with all that he hath) Yf for that cause they call it a sacramente: so will I musterde seed / leven / a net / keyes / bred / water and a thousande other thinges which Christe and the prophetes and all the scripture vse / to expresse the kyndgome of heven and Gods worde with all.

Yf they minister their offices truly / it is a signe that Christes sprite is in them / if not / that the devyll is in them. Are thes all sacramentes / or which one of them? Or what thinge in them is that holy signe or sacramente? The shavinge or the anoyntinge? What also is the promise that is signified therby? But what wordes printeth in them that character Character. that spirituall seale? O dreamers ād naturall beestes without ye seale of the sprite of God: but sealed with the marke of the beeste and with cancred consciences.
               There is a worde called in latine sacerdos in greke hiereus / in hebrue cohan / Sacerdos. that is a minister an officer / a sacrificer or a prest / as Aaron was a preste and sacrificed for the people and was a mediator betwene God and them And in the english shulde it have had some other name then preste: But Antychrist hath deceaved vs with vnknowen and straunge termes / to bringe vs in to cō

vnto God. For Christe hath brought vs all in into the inner temple within the vayle or forehanginge / and vnto the mercy stole of God. And hath coupled vs vnto God / where we offer every man for him selfe the desyres and petitions of his hert / and sacrifice and kyll the lustes and appetites of his flesh with prayer / fastinge and all maner godly livinge.

This wise is no mā prest but he that is chosē / save as in tyme of necessite every person christeneth so maye every man teach his wife and houshold and the wife hir childern. So in tyme of neade if I se my brother synne I maye betwene him and me rebuke him and damne his deade by the law of God. And maye also conforte them that are in dispayre with the promyses of God / and save them if they beleve.

nother can not improve. For they are all out of the waye and without the sprite of God to iudge spirituall thinges. How be it to this I answere / yt when Christ called .xij. vp in to the mountayne ād chose them / then immediatly without any annoyntynge or ceremony were they his Apostles / that is to wete / ministres chosen to be sent to preach his testamente vnto all the whole worlde. And after the resureccion when he had opened their wittes and geven them knowleage to vnderstonde the secretes of his testamente and how to bynde & lowse and what he wold have them to doo in all thinges / then he sent them forth with a commaundement to preach and bynde the vnbelevinge that contynue in synne / and to lowse the belevinge that repent.The cōmaundemente maketh prestes. And that commaundemēt or charge made them Bisshopes Prestes / Popes and all thinge.

               PEnaunce is a worde of their awne forginge to disceave vs with all / as many other are. In the scripture we fynde penitentia repentaunce. Agite penitentiam / do tepente / Peniteat vos / let it repente you. Metanoyte in greke / forthinke ye / or let it forthinke you. A poynte of practise. Of repentaunce they / have made penaunce / to blynde the people ād to make thē thinke that they must take payne ād doo some holy deades to make satisfactiō for their synnes / namely soch as they enioyne them.☞ As thou maist se in the cronycles / when greate kynges and Tyrantes (which with violence of swerde conquered other kynges lōdes and slew all that came to honde) came to them selves & had conscience of their weked deades / then the Bisshopes coupled them / not to Christe: but vnto the Pope and preached the Pope vnto them / and made them to submitte them selves and also their realmes vnto the holy father the Pope and to take penaunce / as they call it / that is to saye / soch iniuncions as the Pope and Bisshopes wolde commaunde them to doo / to byld abbays / to endote them with lyvelode / to be prayd fort for ever: and to geve them exemptions and prevelege and licens to doo what the luste vnpunished.

the waye to Christe and to the promises. For christ cometh not / but vnto them that se their synnes in the law and repent. Repentaunce that is to saye / this mornynge and sorowe of the herte lasteth all oure lyves longe. For we fynde oure selves all oure lyves longe to weake for Gods lawe / and therfore sorowe & morne lōginge for strēgth Repētaunce is no sacramente: as fayth hope / love / and knowleginge of a mans synnes are not to be called sacramentes. For they are spirituall and invisible. Now must a sacramēte be an outwarde signe that maye be sene / to signifie / to represente and to put a man in remembraunce of some spirituall promyse which can not be sene but by fayth only. Repentaunce and all the good deades which accompanie repentaunce to sley the lustes of the flesh are signified by Repentaunce is signified by baptim. baptim. For Paul saith Roma. vj. (as it is above rehersed). Remembre ye not (saith he) that all we which are baptised in the name of Christe Iesus / are baptised to dye with him? we are buried with him in baptim for to dye / that is / to kyll the lustes and the rebellion which remayneth in the flesh. And after that he saith / yee are deed as concerninge synne but lyve vnto God / thorow Iesus Christe oure lorde.☜ If thou loke on the profession of our hertes and on the spirite ād forgevenes which we have receaved

thorow Christes merites / we are full deed: but if thou loke on the rebelliō of the flesh we do but begynne to dye and to be baptised that is / to dround and quench the lustes / ād are full baptised at the last mynute of deeth And as concerninge the workinge of the sprite we begynne to lyve and growe every daye moare and moare both in knowleage and also in Godly lyvinge / accordinge as the lustes abate. As a chyld receaveth the full soule at the fyrst daye / yet groweth dayly in the operations and workes therof.

               COnfession is divers? One foloweth true fayth inseperably. One cōfession is to knowlege where in thou puttest thy truste. And is the confessinge and knowleginge with the mouth / wherin we put oure trust and cō

This confession is necessary vnto all men that wil be saved. For Christe saith Mathew x. he that denyeth me before men him will I denie before my father that is in heven. And of this confession saith the holy Apostel

Paul in the .x. chapter / The belefe of the herte iustifieth: and to knowleage with the mouth maketh a man safe. This is a wonderfull texte for oure philosophers or rather sophisters / oure wordly wise / enimies to the wisdome of God / oure depe and profunde welles with out water / oure cloudes without moysture of rayne / that is to saye / naturall soules without the sprite of God and fealinge of godly thynges. To iustifie and to make safe are both one thinge. And to confesse with the mouth is a Good worke and the frute of a true sayth / as all other workes are.
               Yf thou repente and beleve the promyses then Gods trueth iustifieth the / that is / forgeveth the thy synnes and sealeth / the with his holy sprite and maketh the heyre of everlastinge lyfe thorow Christes deservynges.

And who soever doeth knowlege his sinnes receaveth forgevenes (as saith Iohn. in the fyrst of his first Pistle) Yf we knowlege oure synnes he is faythfull & iust to forgeve vs oure sinnes & to clense vs from all vnrighteousnes / that is / because he / hath promised / he must for his truethes sake doo it. This confession is necessarye all oure lyves longe / as is repentaunce. And as thou vnderstondest of repentaunce / so vnderstonde of this confession for it is lyke wise included in the sacramēte of Baptim. For we all wayes repente and all wayes knowleage or cō
                  fesse oure synnes vnto god / and yet dispeare not: but remembre that we are washed in Christes bloude / which thinge oure baptim doth represente & signifie vnto vs.
               
                  Shrifte.Shrifte in the eare is verely a worke of sathan and that the falsest that ever was wroughte and that most hath devoured the fayth. It began amonge the grekes ād was

not as it is now / to reken all a mans synnes in the prestes eare: but to axe coūcel of soch doutes as men had / as thow maist se in saint Hierom and in other autours. Nether went they to prestes only which were very fewe at that tyme / no moo thē preached the worde of God / for this so greate vauntage in so many masses sayenge was not yet founde: but went indifferently / where they sawe a good and a lerned mā.Shrifte was put downe for knave

But we Antichristes possessiō / ye moare knavery we se growe therfore dayly / the moare we stablysh it. A christē man is a spirituall thinge and hath Gods worde in his herte and Gods sprite to certifie him of all thinge. He is not bound to come to any eare. And as for the reasons which they make are but persuasiōs of mans wisdome. Fyrst as perteyninge vnto the keyes and maner of byndinge and loosinge is ynough above rehersed and in other places. Thou maist also se how the Apostles vsed them in the Actes and in Paulus pistles / how at the preachinge of fayth the sprite came and certified their hertes that they were iustified thorow belevinge the promises.How a man shall know that his synnes are forgeven.
               
               When a man fealeth that his herte

consenteth vnto the law of God / and fealeth him selfe meke / pacient / curtous and mercyfull to his neyboure / altered and fascioned lyke vnto Christe / why shuld he doute but that God hath forgeven him and chosen hym and put his sprite in hym / though he never cromme hys synne in to the prestes eare?
               
                  Blynd reason is there gyde and not gods spirite.One blynde reason have they sayenge. How shall the prest vnbynd / loose and forgeve the synne which he knoweth not? How dyd the Apostles? The scripture forsake they and runne vnto their blynde reasons and draw the scripture vnto a carnall purpose. When I have tolde the in thine eare all that I have done my lyfe lonhe / in ordyr and with all circumstances after the shamefullest maner / what canst thou doo moare / then preach me the promyses sayenge: Yf thou repente and beleve / Gods trueth shall save the for Christes sake? Thou seist not myne herte / thou knowest not whether I repente or no / nether whether I consente to the lawe / that it is holy righteous and good. Moare over whether I beleve the promyses or no / is also vnknowen to the. Yf thou preach the law and the promyses (as the Apostles dyd) so shulde they that God hath chosen repent and beleve and besaved: even now as well as then. How be it Antychrist must

know all secretes to stablesh his kyngdome and to worke hys mysteries with all.
               They brynge also for them the storie of the .x. lepers. which is writtē in the .xvij chap. of Luke.Lerne to know them for they are verely lepers in their hertes. Here marke their falsheed and lerne to knowe them for ever. The fourtene sondaye after the Feest of the Trinite the begynnynge of the .vij. lesson is the said Gospell and the .viij. and the .ix. lessons with the rest of the seventh ys the exposicion of Bede apon the said Gospell Where / saith Bede / of all that Christ healed of what so ever disease it were / he sent none vnto the prestes / but the lepers. And by the lepers enterpreteth folowers of false doctrine only / which the spirituall officers / and the lerned men of the congregacion ought to examine / and rebuke their lerninge with Gods worde ād to warne the congregacion to be warre of them Which / yf they were afterwarde healed by the grace of Christe / ought to come before the congregacion and there openly confesse their true fayth.
               But all other vices (saith he) doeth God heale within in the conscience. Though they this wise reade at matens / yet at hye masse / yf they have any sermon at all / they lye clene contrary vnto this open trueth. Nother are they ashamed at all. For why they walke all to gether in

darkenes.

For Christe came not to make vs moare bonde / but to loose vs and to make a thousande thinges no synne which before were synne and are now become synne agayne.

               AS perteynynge vnto satisfaccion / this wise vnderstonde / that he that loveth god hath a cōmaūdmēt (as saint Iohn saith in ye fourth chapter of his fyrst pistle) to love his neyboure also whō if thou have offended thou must make him amendes or satisfaccion or at the lest waye yf thou be not able / axe hym forgevenes / and yf he will have mercy of God / he is bounde to forgeve the. Yf he will not: yet God forgeveth ye / yf thou this submitte thy selfe.Christ is an everlastinge satisfaccion. But vnto Godwarde Christe is a perpetuall and an everlastinge satisfaccion for ever moare.
               As oft as thou fallest thorow fraylte / 

repente and come agayne and thou art safe and welcome / as thou maist se by the similitude of the riotuous sonne Luke. xv. If thou be lopē out of sentuary come in agayne. Yf thou befallen from the waye of trueth come therto agayne and thou art safe / yf thou begone astraye come to the folde agayne and the sheperd Christ shall save the yee and the angels of heven shall reioyse at thy comynge / so ferre it is of that any man shall beate the or chyde the. Yf any Pharisey envye the / grudge at the or rayle apon the / thy father shall make answere for the / as thou seist in the fore tehersed lykenes or parable. Who so ever therfore is gone out of the waye by what so ever chaunce it be / let hym come to his baptim agayne and vnto the profession therof and he shalbe saffe.Baptim l

As Paul is past and gone / never the lesse the worde that Paul preached lasteth ever and saveth ever as many as come therto with a repentinge herte and a stedfast fayth.
               Here by feist thou that when they make pennaunce of repentaunce and call

it a sacramente and divide it in to contricion / confession and satisfaccion they speake of their awne heedes and lye falslye.
            
            
               ¶Absolucion.
               THeir absolucion also iustifieth no mā from sinne. For with the hert do men beleve to be iustified with all / saith Paul Romna. x. that is thorow fayth and belevinge the promises / are we iustified / as I have sufficiently proved in other places with the scripture. Fayth (saith Paul in the same place) cometh by heringe / that is to saye / by hearinge the preacher that is sent frō God and preacheth Gods promises. Now when thou absolvest in latyne the vnlerned heareth not. For how / saith Paul .j. Corint. xiiij. when thou blessest in an vnknowen tō
                  ge / shall the vnlerned saye Amen vnto thy thankes gevinge? for he wotteth not what thou saist. So lyke wise the laye wotteth not whether thou loose or bynde / or whether thou blesse or curse. In lyke maner is it if the laye vnderstāde latyne or though the prest absolve in englishe. For in his absolucion he reherseth no promise of God: but speaketh his awn wordes sayēge: I by the auctorite of Peter and Paul absolve or loose the frō all thy synnes. Thou saist so / which art but a lyinge man and never moare then now verely.
               Thou saist I forgeve the thy sinnes / & the

scripture saith (Iohn the first) that Christe only forgeveth and taketh awaye the synnes of the worlde. And Paul and Peter and all the Apostles preach that all is forgeven in Christ and for Christes sake. Gods worde only looseth and thou in preachinge that mightest loose also and else not.

               THey allege for them selves the sayenge of Christ to Peter Math. xvj. what so ever thou byndest on erth / it shalbe bonde / and what so ever thou loosest / it shal be looset / and so forth.Of byndynge and loosynge and of the popis auctorit
                        •
                      or power. Lo saye they / what so ever we bynde and what so ever we loose here is no thīge excepted. And a nother texte laye, they of Christ in the last of Mathew All power is geven to me saith Christ / in heven and in erth: goo therfore and preach &c. Preachinge leaveth the Pope out and saith loo all power is geven me in heven and in erth.The pope calēgeth power not over man only but over God also. And therapon taketh apon him temporall power above kynge and Emperoure / and maketh lawes ād byndeth them. And lyke power taketh he over Gods lawes and dispenseth with them at his lust / makynge no synne of that which God maketh synne ād maketh synne where God maketh none: yee and wypeth out Gods lawes cleane ād

maketh at his pleasure / and with him is lawfull what he lusteth. He byndeth where God looseth ād looseth where God byndeth. He blesseth where God curseth and curseth where God blesseth. He taketh auctorite also to bynde and loose in purgatory.Purgatory is the popis creature he maye therefore be bold there. That permitte I vnto him: for it is a creature of his awn makynge. He also byndeth the angels. For we reade of Popes that have commaunded the angels to fett dyvers out of purgatory.The pope bindeth the angels. How be it I am not yet certified whether they obeyed or no.
               
                  The true binninge and loosynge.Vnderstonde therfore that to bynde and to loose / is to preach the law of God and the gospell or promyses / as thou maist se in the thred chapter of the second pistle to the Corintheans Where Paul calleth the preachinge of the law the ministration of deeth and damnation / and the preachinge of the promyses thē ministrīge of the sprite ād of righteousnes. For when the law is preached all men are founde synners and therfore damned: and when the Gospell and glad tydinges are preached / then are all that repente ād beleve / founde righteous in Christ. And so expounde it all the olde doctours. Saynt Saynt Hierō agenst bisshopes ad prestes. Hierom saith apon this texte / what so ever thou byndest / the bisshopes ād prestes saith he / for lacke of vnderstondinge / take a litle presumption of the phareses apon them.

And thinke that they have auctorite to bynde innocētes and to loose the weked / which thinge our Pope and Bisshopes doo. For they saye the curse is to be feared / be it right or wronge.The curse ys to be fered. Though thou have not deserved yet yf the Pope curse the thou art in perell of thy soule as they lye: yee and though he be never so wronfully cursed / he must be fayne to bye absolutiō.The ryghte maner of loosynge. But saynt Hierō saith as the prest of the olde law made the lepers cleane or oncleane / so byndeth and vnbyndeth the prest of the new law☜
               
               The prest there made no man a leper nether clensed any man / but God: and the prest iudged only by Moyses law who was cleane and who was vncleane / when they were brought vnto him.
               So here we have the law of God to iudge what is synne and what is not / and who is bounde and who is not. Moare over if any man have synned / yet if he repente and beleve the promise / we are sure by gods worde that he is loosed and forgeven in Christ Other auctoryte then this wise to preach / have the prestes not. Christis Apostles had no nother thē selfes as it appereth thorowout all the new testamente. Therfore it is manyfest that they have not.
               Saynt Paul saith .j. Corinth. xv.Christ vnderstode this texte all power is gevē me en hevē ād 
                        •
                     n erth and also vsed it ferre other wise thē the Pope. When we saye all thīges are vnder Christ / he is to

be excepted that putt all vnder him. God the father is not vnder Christ / but above Christe and Christes heed .j. Corinth. vi. Christe saith Iohn. xij. I have not spoken of myne awn heed but my father which sente me / gave a cōmaundemente what I shulde saye / and what I shulde speake. What so ever I speake therfore / even as my father bade me so I speake. If Christ had a law what he shulde doo / how happeneth it / that the Pope so runneth at large lawlesse? Though that all power were geven vnto Christ in heven and in erth. Yet had he no power over his father ner yet to raygne temporally over temporall princes: but a commaundmente to obeye them. How hath the Pope then soch temperall auctorite over kinge and Emperoure? How hath he auctorite above Gods lawes and to commaunde the angels / the sayntes and God him selfe?
               Christes What auctorite christ gave his apostles auctorite which he gave to his disciples / was to preach the law and to bringe synners to repētaunce / and then to preach vnto them the promyses which the father had made vnto all men for his sake. And the same to preach only sente he his Apostles The righte byndinge and loosynge. As a kynge sendeth forth his iudges and geveth them his auctorite sayenge: What ye doo that doo I. I geve you my full power. Yet meaneth he not by that full power / that they shulde destroye any

towne or Cite / or oppresse any man or doo what they lyste or shulde raygne over the lordes and dukes of his Realme and over his awne selfe. But geveth them a law with them and auctorite to bynde and loose / as ferforth as the law stretcheth and maketh mencion: that is / to punesh the evyll / that doo wronge / and to avenge the pore that sofre wronge. And so fer as the law stretcheth / will the kynge defende his iudge agenst all men. And as the temperall iudges bynde and loose temperally / so doo the prestes spiritually and no other wayes. How be it by falsheed and sotyltye the Pope regneth vnder Christe / as cardinals and Bisshopes do vnder kynges lawlesse.How the pope regneth vnder christ.

And if he repente we ought with all mercy to receave hī in agayne. This maist thou se Math. xviij. and .j. Corin. v. &. ij. Corī. ij.

The popes sacramentes are doume. Contrary wise Antychristes Bisshopes preach not and their sacramentes speake not / but as the disgysed Bisshopes mum / so are their supersticious sacramentes doume. After that the Bisshopes had left preachinge

/ then fayned they this dome ceremonie of confirmacion to have somewhat at the lest waye / wherby they myght regne over their dioceses.Christenynge of belles. They reserved vnto them selves also the christeninge of belles and coniuringe or haulsoninge of churches and churchyardes / and of altares and superaltares / and holowinge of chalices and so forth / what so ever is of honoure or profitt. Which confirmacion and the other coniuracions also they have now committed to their Why sofregās a

One kepeth the privey seale / a nother the greate seale / the thryd is confessoure / that is to saye / a privey traytar and a secret Iudas / he is presidente of the princes councell / he an ambassadoure / a nother sorte are of the kynges secret councell. Woo is vnto the Realmes where they are of the councell. As profitable are they verely vnto the Realmes with their councell / as the wolves vnto the shepe or the foxes vnto the gysse.
               
                  Cerimonies bringe not the holy goosteThey will saye that the holy goost is geven thorow soch ceremonies. Yf God had

so promysed so shulde it be / but Paul saith Galat. in the thrid chapter / that ye sprite is receaved thorow preachinge of the fayth. And Actes in the tenth chapter / while Peter preached the fayth / the holy goost fell on Cornelius ād on his houshoulde· How shall we saye then to that which they will laye agenst vs / in the eghre chapter of the Actes of the Apostles.Puttynge on of handes▪
                   Where Peter and Iohn put their handes on the samaritanes and the holy goost came? I saye that by puttinge or with puttinge or as they put their handes on them / the holy goost came. Never the lesse the puttinge on of the handes did nother helpe ner hynder. For the texte saith they prayd for them that the myght receave the holy goost.
               God had made the Aopstles a promise / that he wolde with soch miracles confirme their preachinge and move other to the fayth. Mar. the lest. The Apostels therfore beleved and prayed God to fulfill his promise / and God for his truethes sake even so did. So was it the Prayer of faith doeth the myracles. prayer of fayth that brought the holy goost / as thou maist se also in the last of Iames. Yf any man be sycke sayth Iames / call the elders of the congregacion / and let them praye over him annoyntynge him with oyle in the name of the Lorde / and the prayer of fayth shall heale the sycke. Where a

promyse is there is fayth bolde to praye / and God true to geve hir hir peticion. Puttinge on of the hondes is an indifferē
                  te thinge. For the holy goost came by preachinge of the fayth / and myracles were done at ye prayer of fayth as well with out puttinge on of hondes as with / as thou seist in many places. Puttinge on of the hondes was the maner of that naciō / as it was to rente their clothes / and to put on sacke / and to sprinkle them selves with asshes ād erth / when they herde of or sawe any sorowfull thinge / as it was Pauls maner to stretch out his hande / when he preached. And as it is our maner to holde vp our handes / when we praye / and as some kysse their thome nayle and put it to their eyes / and as we put our handes on chylders heedes / when we blesse them sayenge: Christ blesse the my sonne / and God make the a good man: which gestures nether helpe ner hynder. This maist thou wel se by the .xiij. of the Actes / where the holy goost commaunded to seperate Paul and Barnabas / to go and preeache. Then the other fasted and prayed and put their handes on their heedes and sent them forth. They receaved not the holy goost then / by puttinge on of hondes / but the other as they put their handes on their heedes prayed for them / that God wolde go with them and strength them / ād

coraged them also / biddinge thē to be stronge in God / and warned them to be faythfull and diligent in the worke of God and so forth.
            
            
               ¶Anoylynge.
               LAst of all cometh the anoylynge with out promyse / and therfore without the spirite and with out profitt / but all together vnfrutefull and supersticious. The sacramentes which they have imagined are all without promise / and therfore helpe not. For what so ever is not of fayth is synne. Roman. xiiij. Now without a promyse can there be no fayth.The latyne tonge destroyeth the fayth. The sacramentes which Christ him selfe ordeyned / which have also promyses and wolde save vs if we knew them and beleved them / them minister they in the latyne tonge. So are they also become as vnfrutefull as the other. Yee the make vs beleve that the worke selfe without the promyse saveth vs which doctrine they lerned of Aristotell.That the worke with out the promyse saveth ys improved. And thus are we become an hundred tymes worse then the weked Iewes which beleved that the very worke of their sacrifyce iustified them. Agenst which Paul fyghteth in every pistle / provinge that nothinge helpeth save the promyses which God hath sworne in Christ.The people beleve in the worke with out the promyse. Aske the people what they vnderstande by their baptim or washinge. And thou shalt se that they beleve / how that the very plunginge

in to the water saveth them: of the promyses they know not / ner what is sygnifyed therby. Baptim is called volowīge in many places of Englonde / because the prest saith volo saye ye.Uolowinge. The child was well volowed (saye they) yee and oure vicare is as fayre a volower as ever a prest within this twenty myles.
               Behold how narowly the people loke on the ceremony. Yf ought be left out / or if the chyld be not al together dipt in the water / or if / because the chylde is sycke / the prest dare not plūge him into the water / but powre water on his heed / how trīble they? how quake they? how saye ye sir Ihon / saye they / is this child christened ynough? hath it his ful christendom? They beleve verely that the chylde is not christened:☞ ye I have known prestes that have gone vnto the orders agayne supposinge that they were not prestes / because that the bysshope left one of his cerimonies vndone. That the call cōfirmation / the people call byshopynge. They thinke that yf the bysshope butter the chyld in the foreheed that it is saffe.The worke saveth not but the worde that is to saye the promyse. They thīke that the worke maketh saffe / and lyke wise suppose they of an oylinge. Now is this false doctrine verely. For Iames saith in the fyrst chapter of his Pistle. Of his good will begate he vs with the worde of lyfe / that is / with the worde of promyse In which are we made Gods

sonnes and heyres of the goodnes of God before any good workes. For we can not worke Gods will tyll we be his sonnes and know his will and have his sprite to teach vs. And saynt Paul saith in the fyft chapter of his pistle to the Ephesiās. Christe clēsed the congregation in the fountayne of water thorow the worde. And Peter saith in the fyrst of his fyrst pistle. Ye are borne anew / not of mortall seed / but of immortall seed / by the worde of God which lyveth ād lasteth ever. Paul in every pistle warneth vs that we put no trust in workes / ād to beware of persuasions or argumentes of mans wisdome of superstitiousnes / of cerimonies of Pope holines and of all maner disgisinge. And exhorteth vs to cleve fast vnto the naked and pure worde of God ☜ The promyse of God is the ancre that saveth vs in all temptations. Yf all the world be agenst vs / Gods word is strōger then the world. Yf the world kyll vs / that shall make vs a lyve agayne. Yf it be possible for the world to cast vs in to hell from thence yet shall Gods worde bringe vs agayne. Hereby seist thou that it is not the worke but the promyse that iustifieth vs thorow faith. Now where no promyse is there can no faith be and therefore no iustifienge though there be never so glorious workes. The sacramente of Christes body after this wise preach they. Thou

must beleve yt it is no moare bred / but the very body of Christe / flesh / bloude and bone / even as he went here on erth / save his cote.In all thynge they leve out the promyses For that is here yet / I wott not in how many places. I praye the what helpeth al this? Here is no promyse. The devels know that Christ dyed on a fredaye and the Iewes also. What are they holpe therby? We have a promyse that Christ and his body and his bloude and all that he dyd and sofered / is a sacrifice / a raunsome and a full satisfaction for our synnes: that God for his sake will thinke no moare on them / yf we have power to repente and beleve
               Holy werkmen thinke that God reioyseth in the deade selfe without any forther respecte. They thinke also that God as a cruell tyrant / reioyseth and hath delecration in oure payne takynge without any forther respecte. And therfore many of them marter them selves without cause / after the ensample of Baals prestes which (iij. Regū. xviij) cut them selves to please their God with all and as the olde hethē pagās sacrificed their childern in the fyre vnto their Gods. The mōkes of the charterhouse thinke that the very eatīge of fish in it selfe pleaseth God and referre not the eatinge vnto the chastenynge of ye body. For whē they have slayne their bodies with colde fleme of fysheatinge: yet then will they eate no flesh and sley thē selves

before their dayes. we also when we offer oure sonnes or doghters and compell or persuade them to vowe and professe chastite / thinke that the very payne and that rage and burnynge which they sofre in absteyninge from a make pleaseth God / and so referre not oure chastite vnto oure neybours profit. For when we se thousandes fall to innumerable diseases therof and to dye before their dayes: yee though we se thē breake the commaundmentes of God dayly and also of verry impatiency worke abhominations agenst nature to shamefull to bespoken of: yet will we not let them mary / but compell them to cōtinue still with violēce. And thus teach oure devines as it appereth by their argumentes. He that taketh most payne / saye they / is greatest and so forth.
               The people are throuly brought in beleve that the dede in it selfe without any forther respecte saveth thē if they be so lōge at church or saye so many pater nosters & rede so moch in a tonge which they vnderstōde not or goo so moch a pilgremage and take so moch payne or fast soch a supersticious fast / or observe soch a superstitious observaunce nether profitable to him selfe ner to his neyboure: but done of a good entente only / saye they to please God with all: ye to kysse the paxe they thinke it a meritorious deade / when to love their neyboure and to forgeve him / which

                   and have wrapped them in darknes and have rocked them a slepe in blyndnes and ignorancy. Now is all soch doctrine false doctrine / and all soch fayth false fayth. For the deade pleaseth not / but as fer forth as it is applied vnto oure neybours profit or the tamynge of oure bodies to hepe the cōmaundmente.
               Now must the body be tame only / and that with the remeadies that God hath ordened / and not kylled. Thou must not forswere the naturall reamedy which God hath ordened and brīge thy selfe in to soch case that thou shuldest ether breake Gods commaundment or kyll thy selfe or burne nyght & daye without rest so that thou cāst not ones thinke a Godly thoughte: nether is it lawfull to forsake thy neyboure and to withdraw thy selfe from servinge hym and to get the in to a denne and lyve ydely profitable to no man but robbinge all men / first of fayth and thē of goodes and lāde and of all he hath with makynge hym beleve in the ypocresy of thy superstitious prayers ād Pope holy deades The prayer of fayth and the deades ther of that sprīge of love are accepted before God

The prayer is good accordinge to the proportiō of fayth and the deade accordinge to the measure of love. Now he that bydeth in the worlde / as monkes call it / hath moare faith then the cloysterar. For he hangeth on God in all thinges. He must trust God to sende hym good speede / good lucke / favoure helpe / a good master / a good neyboure / a good servāte / a good wife / a good chapmā marchand to sende his marchaundise saffe to londe and a thousande like. He loveth also moare / which appereth in that he doeth service all wayes vnto his neyboure. To praye one for a nother are we equally bound and to praye is a thinge that we maye all wayes doo / what so ever we have in hande and that to doo maye no man hyre a nother Christes bloude hath hyred vs all ready. Thus in the deade deliteth God as ferforth as we do it ether to serve oure neyboure with all / as I have said / or to tame the flesh / that we maye fulfill the commaundmente from the bothom of the herte.
               And as for oure payne takinge God reioyseth not therin as a tyraunte: but pitieth vs and as it were morneth with vs and is all waye ready and at hande to helpe vs / yf we call / as a mercyfull father and a kynde mother. Never the later he sofereth vs to fall in to many temptacions and moch adversite: yee him selfe layeth

the crosse of tribulaciō on oure backes / not that he reioyseth in our sorowe / but to dryve sinne out of the flesh which cā none other wise be cured: as the phisicion and surgion doo many thinges which are paynefull to the sycke / not that they reioyse in the paynes of the pore wretches: but to persecute and to dryve out the diseases which can no other wyse be healed.
               Whē the people beleve therefore yf they do so moch worke or sofre so moch payne or goo so moch a pylgremage / yt they are saffe / is a false fayth. For a christen man is not saved by workes / but by fayth in the promises before all good workes / though that the workes (when we worke Gods commaundmente with a good will and not workes of oure awne imaginacion) declare that we are saffe ād that the sprite of him yt hath made vs saffe is in vs: yee and as God thorow preachī
                  ge of fayth doeth purge and iustifie / even so thorow workynge of deades doeth he purge and iustifie the membres / makynge vs perfecte both in body and lykenes of Christe.A christē man neadeth not to goo a pylgremage to be saved thereby.
               
               Nether neadeth a christen man to runne hither or thither / to Rome / to Hierusalem / or saynt Iames or any other pilgremage fer or nere / to be saved thereby / or to purches forgevenes of his synnes.Saluacion is with in vs. For a christen mans health and saluacion is with in him: even in his mouth.

Yf ought be agenst them / doo they never so evyll / then move they their captives to warre & to fight and geve them pardons to sley whom they will have taken out of the waye. They have with falsheed taken from all kynges ād emperous their ryght and duties / which now they call their fredomes lyberties and priveleges and have perverted the ordinaunces that god left in the worlde / ād have made every Kynges be sworn to the bisshopes and not the bisshopes vnto the kynges. kynge swere to defende their falsheed agenst their awn selves. So that now if any mā preach Gods worde truly & shew the fredome & libertie of the soul which we have in Christ / or entende to restore the kynges agayne vnto their duties and right ād to the rowme and auctorite which they have of God / and of shadowes to make them kynges in deade / and to put the world in his order agayne: thē ye kīges delyver their swerdes & auctorite vnto ye ypocrites to sley him So drōkē are they with ye wine of ye whore. ¶The text that foloweth in Paul will they happly laye to my charge ād others.How shall they preach excepte they be sent ys expounded.

Dome ceremonies are no sacramentes / but superstitiousnes. Christes sacramentes preach the fayth of Christ as his apostles did and therby iustifie. Antichristes dome ceremonies preach not the fayth that is in Christ / as his Apostles our

How fer he hath promysed so fer is he bounde to them that beleve and forther not. A fayth without gods promise is ydolatrie: To have a fayth therfore or a trust in any thinge / where God hath not promysed ys playne ydolatrye and a worshepinge of thine awne imaginacion in stede of God.

            Also in the collectes of the saītes with which we pray God to save vs thorow the mentes or deservinges off the Sayntes

Never the lesse I praye you do it for soch a servauntes sake: yee I praye you for the love that you owe to my father do that for me for soch a servauntes sake. Yf I this wyse made my peticion / wolde not men thinke that I come late out of Saynt Patrikes purgatory / and had left my wittes behynde me. This do we.

I doute not but that they will make a saynte of my lorde Cardinall after the deeth of vs that be a lyve and know his iugglinge and crafty conveyaunce and will shrine him gloriously / for his myghtyly defendinge of the right of holy church / excepte we be diligente to leave a cōmemoracion of that Nimroth behind vs.
            The reasons where with they prove their doctrine are but fleshly and as Paul calleth them / The reasons which they make for the worshepīge of sayntes are solved. entysinge wordes of mans wisdome / that is to wete / sophistry and blawlinge argumentes of men with corrupte myndes and destitute of the trouth / whose God ys their bely / vnto which ydole whosoever offereth not / the same is an herytike / and worthy to be brunte.
            The saynte was greate with God when he was a lyve / as it appereth by the myracles which God shewed for hī / he must therfore he greate now say they. This reason appereth

wisdome / but is very folyshnes with God ☞ For ye myracle was not shewed that thou shulde put thy trust in the sainte / but in the worde which the saynte preached / which worde yf thou belevedest it / wold save y• / as god hath promysed & sworne / & wolde make y• also greate with God / as it did the saynte.
            If a man have a mater with a greate man or a kinge / he must goo fyrst vnto one of his meane servauntes and then hier ād hier tyll he come at the kynge. This enrysynge argumente is but a blinde reason of mans witte It is not lyke in the kyngdyme of the worlde and in the kyngdome of God and christ.
            
               It is not lyke with kynges and God.With kynges for the most parte we have none accoyntaunce nether promise. They be also most comenly mercylesse. Moare over yf they promyse / they are yet men as vncō
               stante as are other people ād as vntrue. But with god / yf we have belefe / we are acomted and have an open waye in vnto him by the dore Christ which is never shutt but thorow vnbelefe / nether is there any porter to kepe any mā out. By him saith Poul Ephe. ij. that is to saye / by christe we have an opē waye in vnto the father. So are ye now no moare straungers and forenars (saith he) but cetysens with the sayntes & of the housholde of God. God hath also made vs promyses and hath sworne: ye hath made a testamente or a covenaunt and hath bound

him selfe ād hath sealed his obligaciō with Christes bloude and confirmed it with myracles. He is also mercyfull ād kynde / and complayneth that we will not come vnto hī He is myghtye and able to performe that he promiseth. He is true and can not be but true / as he can not be but God. Therfore is it not lyke with the kynge and God.
            We be synners saye they / God will not heare vs. Behold how they fle from god as from a tyraunte mercylesse. Whom a man counteth most mercyfull vnto him he sonest fleeth. But these teachers dare not come at God. Why? For they are the childern of cayn. Yf the sayntes love whom god hateth / then God and his sayntes are devided. Whē thou prayest to the sayntes / how doo they know / excepte that god / whom thou countest mercylesse / tell them? Yf god be so cruell and so hateth the it is not lykely that he will tell the sayntes that thou prayest vnto them.
            When they saye we be synners:Christ is no synner▪
                I answere / that Christ is no synner / save a satisfaction / and an offeringe for synne. Take Christ from the sayntes and what are they? What is Paul without Christ? ys he any thynge save a blasphemer / a persecuter / a murtherer / and a sheder of Christen bloud?
            But as sone as he came to christ he was no moare a sīner but a mnister of righteousnes

he went / not to Rome to take penaūce apō him / but went and preached vnto his brethern the same mercy which he had receaved fre / without doinge penaunce or hyringe of sayntes or of monkes or freres. Moare over if it be Gods worde that thou shuld put thy trust in the sayntes merites or prayers / then be bold▪ For Gods worde shall defende the and save the. Yf it be but thine awne reason / then feare. For God commaūdeth by Moyses Deuteronomion. xij. sayenge: what I cō
               maunde you that observe and doo / and put no thynge to / ner take oughte therfro: yee & Moses warneth straytly in an hundred places that we doo that only which God commaundeth and which semeth good ād righteous in his sighte ād not in oure awne sighte. For nothinge bringeth the wrath of god so sone and so sore on a man / as the ydolatry of his awne imagination.
            Last of al thes argumentes are contrary to the argumētes of Christ and of his apostles. Christ disputeth Luke. xj▪ sayēge: yf the sonne axe the father bred / will he geve him a stone? or yf he aske him fysh / wil he geve him a serpēte? and so forth. Yf ye then (sayth he) which are evell can geve good gyftes to youre childerne / how moch rather shall youre hevēly father geve a good sprite vnto thē that aske him? And a litle before in the same chapter he saith. Yf a man came never s
                  •
               
               
out of season to his neyboure to borowe bred: even when he is in his chambre and the dore shett / and all his servauntes with him. Never the lesse yet if he contynue knockynge and prayenge / he will ryse and geve him as moch as he neadeth / though not for love / yet to be rydd of him that he maye have rest: As who shuld saye / what will god doo yf a man praye him: seynge that prayer over cometh an evyll man? Aske therfore (sayth he) and it shalbe geven you / seke and ye shall fynde / knocke ād it shalbe opened vnto you. And Luke. xviij. he putteth forth the parable or similitude of the weked iudge which was overcome with the importune prayer of the wedowe. And cōcludeth sayenge: Heare what the wycked iudge dyd. And shall not God avenge his electe which crie vnto him nyght and daye? Whether therfore we cōplayne of the intollerable oppressiō & persecuciō yt we sofre / or of ye flesh yt cōbreth ād resisteth ye sprite / God is mercifull to heare vs ād to helpe vs. Seist thou not also how Christ cureth many & casteth out devyls out of many vnspoken to / how shall he not helpe / if he be desyred and spoken to?
            When the old phareses / whose nature is to dryve synners from Christe / asked Christe why he did eate with publicanes and synners. Christ answered that the whole neaded not the phisicion but the sycke.

That is / Christ ys a gyft gevē to synners. he came to have conversacion with synners to heale them▪ He was a gift gevē vnto synners / & a treasoure to paye their dettes. And Christ sente ye cōplayninge & disdayning phareses to the prophete God loveth mercy. Oseas sayē
               ge / goo and lerne what this meaneth / I desyre or require mercy and not sacrifice. As who shuld saye / ye phareses love sacrifice ād Ipocrites love offerynges offeringe for to fede that God your belyes with all / but God commaundeth to be mercyfull. Synners are ever captives and a praye vnto the phareses and ypocrites / for to offer vnto their belies / and to bye merytes / pardons and forgevenes of synnes of them And therfore feare they them awaye from Christ with argumentes of their bely wisdome. For he that receaveth forgevenes free of Christe will by no forgevenes of them. I came (saith Christ) to call / not ye rightwes / but the synners vnto repentaūce. The phareses are righteous & therfore have no parte with Christ / nether neade they. For they are gods thē selfe & savars. But synners yt repēte pertayne to Christ. Yf we repente / Christ hath made satisfaccion for vs all ready.
            God so loved the worlde / that he gave his only sonne / that none that beleve on him shuld peresh / but shuld have everlastinge lyve. For God sente not his sonne in to the worlde / to condemne the worlde / but that the worlde thorow him might be saved.

He that beleveth on him shall not be damned / but he that beleveth not he is damned all ready. Iohn. iij.
            Paul. Ro. v. saith. Be cause we are iustified thorow fayth / we are at peace with god thorow oure lorde Iesus Christe / yt is / because that God / which can not lye / hath promysed and sworne to be mercyfull vnto vs and to forgeve vs for Christes sake / we beleve and are at peace in our consciences / we runne not hither and thither for pardon / we trust not in this frere ner that monke nether in any thinge save in the worde of God only. As a chyld when his father threatneth him for his faute / hath never rest / tyll he heare the worde of mercy and forgevenes of his fathers mouth agayne / but as sone as he heareth his father saye / goo thy wayes / do me no moare so / I forgeve the this faute / then is his hert at rest / thē is he at peace / then runneth he to no man to make intercession for him. Nether though ther come any false marchaunde sayenge / what wilt thou geve me & I will obtayne pardō of thy father for ye / will he sofre hī selfe to be begiled / no he will not bye of a wily fox that which his father hath gevē him frely.
            It foloweth. god setteth out his love yt he hath to vs / yt is / he maketh it appere / yt mē may perceave love / if they be not moare thē stocke blynde. In as moch saith Paul as

while we were yet synners / Christ died for vs. Moch moare now / saith he (seinge we are iustified by his bloude) shall we be preserved from wrath thorow him. For if whē we were enemyes we were reconsyled to God by the deeth of his sonne: moch moare seinge we are reconsiled / we shalbe preserved by his lyfe. As who shulde saye / yf God loved vs when we knew him not / moch moare loveth he vs now we know him. Yf he were mercyfull vnto vs while we hated his law / moch moare mercyfull will he be now / seinge we love it and desyre strngth to fulfill it. And in the .viij. he argueth. Yf God spared not his awne sonne but gave him for vs all / how shall he not with hī geve vs all thinges also?
            Christ prayed Iohn. xvij. not for ye Apostles only / but also for as many as shulde beleve thorow their preachīge and was herd / what so ever we aske in his name ye father geveth vs Io. xvj. Christe is also as mercifull as ye saītes. Why we come not to Christ. Why goo we not streght waye vnto hī? Verely because we feale not ye mercy of god nether beleve his trouth. God will at ye lest waye (saye they) heare vs ye soner for ye sayntes sake. Thē loveth he the saynte better thē Christe & his awne trueth. Heareth he vs for the sayntes sake? so heareth he vs not for his mercy. For merites and mercy can not stonde together.
            
               Finally if thou put any trust in thine awne deades or in the deades of any other man of any saynte / thē mynishist thou the trouth mercy and goodnes of God. For yf God loke vnto thy workes or vnto the workes of any other man or goodnes of the saynte: thē doeth not he all thinges of pure mercy and of his goodnes & for the truethes sake which he hath sworne in Christ. Now saith Paul in the last to Titus. Not of the righteous deades which we did: but of his mercy saved he vs.
            Oure blynde disputers will saye / yf our god deades iustifie vs not / yf God loke not on oure good deades nether regard thē ner love vs ye better for thē what neade we to doo good deades?God loketh on oure good deades. I answere God loketh on our good deades ād loveth them / yet loveth vs not for their sakes. God loveth vs fyrst in Christ of his goodnes and mercy / and powreth his sprite in to vs / and geveth vs power to do good deades. And because he loveth vs / he loveth our good deades: yee because he loveth vs / he forgeveth vs our evyll deades which we doo of fraylte and not of purpose or for the nonce. Oure good deades do but testyfie only that we are iustified and beloved. For excepte we were beloved and had Gods sprite we coulde nether doo ner yet consent vnto any good deade. Antychriste turneth the rote
                     •
                   of the tre vp Warde. Antichrist turneth the rotes of the trees vpwarde

He maketh the goodnes of God the braunches ād our goodnes the rotes. We must be first good after Antichristes doctrine / and move God and cōpell him to be good agayne for our goodnesses sake: so most Gods goodnes springe out of our goodnes. Naye veryly Gods goodnes is ye rote of all goodnes and our goodnes / if we have any / springeth out of his goodnes.
         
         
            ¶Prayer.
            OF prayer and good deades ād of the order of love or charite I have habundantly written in my boke of the iustifyenge of fayth. Never the later that thou maist se what the prayers and good workes of oure mōkes and freres ād of other goostly people are worth / I will speake a worde or two and make an ende. Paul sayth Gal. iij. All ye are ye sonnes of God thorow fayth in Iesu Christe. For all ye that are baptised have put Christ on you (that is ye are become Christe hī selfe) There is no Iew (sayth he) nether greke: nether bōde ner fre: nether man ner woman: but ye are all In christe we are one as good as a nother equaly beloved and indifferently hearde· one thinge in Christe Iesu. In Christ there is nether frēch ner english: but the frenchman is the englishmans awne selfe / and the english the frenchmans awne selfe. In Christ there is nether father / ner sonne: nether master: ner servant: nether husbande / ner wife: nether kynge / ner subiecte: but the father is the

sonnes selfe and the sonne the fathers awne selfe / and the kynge is the subiectes awne selfe / and the subiecte is the kynges awne selfe / and so forth. I am thou thy selfe and thou art I my selfe and can be no nere of kynne. We are all the sonnes of God all Christes servauntes bought with his bloude and every man to other Christ his awne selfe. And Collo. iij. Ye have put on the new man which is renued in the knowleage of God after the image of hym that made hym (that is to saye Christe) where is (saith he) nether greke ner Iewe / circuncision ner vncircuncision / barbarous or sythian / bonde or fre: but Christ is all to a christē man. Christ is all in all thinges. I love the not now because thou art my father and hast done so moch for me or my mother and hast borne me and geven me sucke of thy brestes (for so do Iew
                  •
               s and saracenes) but because of the great love that Christ hath shewed me. I serve the not be cause thou arte my master or my kynge / for hope of rewarde or feare of payne / but for the love of Christe. For ye childerne of fayth are vnder no lawe (as thou seist in the Pistles to the Romayns to the Galathians / in the firste to Timoth. but are fre.The childern of faithe worke of love and nede no law to compell thē. The sprite of Christ hath written the lively lawe of love ī their hertes which driveth thē to worke of their awne accorde frely & willingly / for the greate loves sake only which they

se in Christe / and therefore nede they no law to compell them. Christe is all in all thinges to them that beleve / and the cause of all love. We are all christ

                     •
                  arve Christ. Paul sayth (Ephes. vj.) servaūtes obeye vnto youre carnall or fleshly masters with feare and tremblinge / in singlenes of youre hertes as vnto Christe? not with eye service as men pleasers: but as the servātes of Christe: doinge the will of God from the herte: even as though ye served the lorde and not men. And remēbre that what so ever good thinge any man doeth / that shall he receave agayne of the lorde / whether he be bonde or fre. Christe thus is all in all thinges & cause of all to a Christen man. And Math. xxv sayth Christe: in as moch as ye have done it to any of ye lest of thes my bretherne / ye have done it to me. And ī as moch as ye have not done it vnto one of the lest of these / ye have not done it to me. Here seist thou yt we are Christes brethern and even Christe hym selfe / and what so ever we do one to a nother that doo we to Christe. Yf we be in Christe we worke for no wordly purpose / but of love. As Paul sayth .ij. Corint. v. The love of Christ compelled vs (as who shuld saye we worke not of a flesly purpose) For (saith he) we knowe hensforth no mā flesly: no though we once knew christ fleshly we doo so now no moare. We are other wise mynded / then when Peter drewe his swerde to fyght for

Christe. we are now ready to sofre with Christ and to loose lyfe and all for oure very enimies to brynge them to Christe. Yf we be in Christ we are mynded lyke vnto Christe / Christ knoweth no thinge worldly no not his very mother. which knew no thīge flesly or after the will of the fleshe / as thou seist Matth. xij. when one said to hym. Loo thy mother and thy brethern stōde without desyringe to speake with the. He answered / who is my mother and who are my bretherne? And stretched his hande over his disciples sayenge: se my mother and my bretherne. For who so ever doeth ye will of my father which is in hevē / the same is my brother my sister & my mother. He knew not his mother in that she bare him / but in that she did the will of his father in heven. So now as God the fathers will and cōmaundmēt is all to Christ even so Christ is all to a Christen man.
            Christe is the cause why I love the why I am ready to doo the vttermost of my power for the / and why I praye for the And as longe as the cause abydeth / so longe lesteth the effecte even as it is all waye daye / so lōge as the sone shyneth. Do therfore the worst thou cāst vnto me: take awaye my goodes: take awaye my good name: yet as longe as As longe as christ abydeth so longe a christē mā loveth. Christe remayneth in myne herte / so longe I love the not a whit the lesse and so longe arte thou as dere

               nto me as myne awne soule / and so longe

am I ready to doo the good for thyne evyll and so longe I praye for the with all myne herte. For Christe desireth it of me & hath deserved it of me. Thine vnkyndnes compared vnto his kyndnes is nothīge at all / ye it is swalowed vp / as a litle smoke of a mightie winde / ād is no moare sene or thoughte apō Moare over that evyll which thou doist to me / I receave not of thine hande / but of the hande of God / and as Gods scorge to teach me pacience and to nurtoure me. And therfore have no cause to be angry with the moare then the child hath to be angre with his fathers rod or a sicke man with a soure or bitter medicine that healeth him / or a prisoner with his fetters or he that is punished lawfully with the officer that punisheth him. Thus is Christe all ād the whole cause why I love the / And to all cā nought be added Therfore can not a litle money make me love the better or moare bound to praye for the ner make Gods commaundmente gretter.Money byndet

And therfore I am ready to geve the myne and not to take thine from the yf I be able I will doo the service frely / yf not / then if thou ministre to me agayne / that receave I of the hande of God which ministerith it to me by the: For God careth for his and ministreth all thinges vnto them and moveth turkes and saracenes and all maner infidels to doo thē good / God careth for his. as

thou seist in Abrahā / Isaac & Iacob / & how god wēt with Ioseph in to Egipte & gate hī favoure in the prysō & in every place / which favoure Ioseph receaved of ye hāde of God & to God gave ye thākes. This is God & Christ all in all: good & bad receave I of God. Thē that are good I love / because they are in Christe & the evyll to bringe thē to Christe.

            But contrary wise vnto monkes / freres / and to the other of oure holy spiritualte the bely is all ī all & cause of all love.The bely is a God and cause of all vnto oure spiritualte.

For them that geve litle are they litle bound and them they love litle and for them that geve moch are they moch bounde and them they love moch. And for them that geve nought are they nought bounde and them they love not at all. And as they love the when thou gevist: so hate they the when thou takest awaye from them / and runne all vnder a stole and curse the as blacke as pitch.

They laboure not but lyve ydely of the swet of the pore.

            THey devide ye scripture ī to iiij. senses / ye literall / tropologicall / allegoricall anagogicall. The literall sence is become nothīge at all. For

the pope hath takē it cleane awaye ād hath made it his possession. He hath partly locked it vp with ye false & counterfayted keyes of his tradicions cerimonies & fayned lyes And partly dryveth mē frō it with violence of swerde. For no man dare abyde by ye litterall sense of ye texte / but vnder a protestaciō / yf it shall please ye pope. The tropologicall sence perteyneth to good maners (saie they) and teacheth what we ought to doo. The allegory is appropriate to fayth / & the anagogicall to hope and thinges above. Tropologicall & anagogicall are termes of their awne faynynge and all together vnnecessary. For they are but allegories both two of thē and this worde allegorie comprehendeth them both and is ynough. For chopologicall is but an allegory of maners and anagogicall an allegory of hope. Allegory and what it signifieth▪

As when we saye of a wātā childē / this shepe hath magottes in his tayle / he must be anoynted with byrchī salve which speach I borow of the shepardes ¶ Thou shalt vnderstōde therfore y• the scripture hath but one sence which is ye literall sence.The scripture hath but one sense.

Never the later the scripture vseth proverbes / similitudes / redels or allegories as all other speaches doo / but that which the proverbe / similitude / redell or allegory signifieth is ever the literall sence which thou must seke out dilgently. As in the english we borow wordes and sentences of one thinge and apply them vnto a nother ād geve thē new significaciōs We saye let the see swell and rise as he will yet hath God appoynted how f

He is a pontificall fellow / that is / prowd and statly. He is popish / that is / supersticious & faythlesse. It is a pastime for a prelate

It is a pleasure for a pope. He wolde be free and yet will not have his heed shaven. He wolde that no man shulde smyte hym & yet hath not the popes marke. And of hī y• is betrayd ād woteth not how / we saye / he hath bene at shrifte▪ she is master parsons sisters doghter▪ he is ye byshopes systers▪ sonne / he hath a cardinal to his vncle / she is a spiritual whore / it is the gentle womā of ye parsonage / he gave me a Ryrieleyson.

And of him that will not be saved by Christes merites / but by the workes of his awne imaginaciō we saye it is a holy worke mā. Thus borow we and fayne new speach in every tonge.

not a lambe that beareth woll / but a meke and a paciente lambe which is beaten for other mens fautes. Christ is a vine / not that beareth grapes: but out of whose rote the braunches that beleve / sucke the sprite of lyfe ād mercy and grace and power to be the sonnes of God and to doo his will. The similitudes of the Gospell are allegories borowed of wordly matters to expresse spirituall thinges. The Apocalipse or revelaciōs of Iohn are allegories whose litterall sense is herde to fynde in many places.
            Beyond all this / The righte vse of allegories. whē we have found out the litterall sence of the scripture by the processe of the texte or by a lyke texte of a nother place▪ Thē goo we & as ye scripture boroweth similitudes of wordly thīges evē so we agayne borow similitudes or allegories of ye scripture ād apply thē to oure purposes / Allegories are no sense of scripture. which allegories are not sence of the scripture: but fre thinges besydes the scripture and all to gether in the liberte of the spirite. Which allegories I maye not make at all the wilde adventures: but must kepe me with in the compasse of the fayth and ever apply myne allegory to Christ and vnto the fayth.☜ Take an ensample / thou hast the story of peter how he smote of Malchuses eare and how Christ healed it agayne. There hast thou in ye playne texte greate lerninge / greate frute & greate edifienge which I passe over because of tediousnes.

Then come I / when I preach of the law and the gospell / and borow this example to expresse the nature of the law and of the Gospell and to paynte it vnto the before thine eyes. And of Peter and his swerde make I the law and of Christ the Gospell sayenge / as Peters swerde cutteth of the eare so doeth the law. The law damneth / the law kylleth / and mangleth the conscience.
            There is no eare so righteous that can abyde the hearinge of the law. There is no deade so good but that the law damneth it. But Christ / that is to saye the Gospell / the promyses and testamente that God hath made in Christe healeth the eare and conscience which the law hath hurte. The Gospell is lyfe / mercy and forgevenes frely / and al together an helinge playster. And as Peter doeth but hurte and make a woūde where was none before: evē so doeth the lawe. For when we thinke that we are holy and righteous and full of good deades yf the law be preached a ryght / oure righteousnes and good deades vanesh awaye / as smoke in the winde and we are left dānable synners only And as thou seist how ye Christ healeth not tyll Peter had wonded / & as an healinge playster helpeth not tyll ye corrosy hath trobled the woūde / evē so ye Gospell helpeth not / but when the law hath wonded

And lyke wise doo we borow likenesses or allegories of the scripture / as of Pharao and Herod and of the scribes and pharises / to expresse oure miserable captivite and persecucion vnder Antychrist the Pope.The fayth was loost thorow allegories.
            
            The greatest cause of which captivite ād the decay of the fayth and this blyndnes wherein we now are / sprange fyrst of allehoryes. For Origen and the of his tyme

Whos ensample they that came after folowed so longe / tyll at the last they forgat the order / and processe of the texte / supposinge that the scripture sarved but to fayne allegories apon. In so moch that twenty doctours expounde one texte .xx. wayes / as childern make descant apon playne songe Chopologicall sophisters.

But it is not their gyse to loke on ye order of any texte but as they fynde it in their doctoures so allege they it and so vnderstōde it The letter kille this expounde. Paul maketh a compareson betwene the law and the Gospell and calleth the law the letter / because it was but letters graven in two tables of colde stone. For the law doeth but kyll and damne the consciences / as longe as there is no lust in the herte to doo that which the law commaundeth.

To love the law is righteousnes. Now as sone as the herte lusteth to doo the law / then are we righteous before God and oure synnes forgeven. Never thelesse the law of the letter graved in stone and not in the hertes was so glorious / that Moysesis face shone so bryghte that the childerne of Israell coulde not beholde his face forbryghtnes.

Wherapon Paul maketh his comparison sayenge: yf the ministration of deeth thorow the letters figured in stones was glorious / so that the childern of Israell coulde not beholde ye face of Moses for the glory of his countenaunce: why shall not the administracion of the sprite be glorious? And agayne: if the administration of damnacion be glorious: moch moare shall the administration of righteousnes excead in glory: That is / if the law that kylleth synners and helpeth them not be glorious: then the Gospell which pardoneth synners and geveth them power to be the sonnes of God and to over come synne / is moch moare glorious. And the texte that goeth before is as clere.
            For the holy Apostel Paul sayeth / ye Corinthians are oure Pistle / which is vnderstonde and red of all men / in that ye are knowē how that ye are ye pistle of Christ ministred by vs and written: not with ynke (as Moyses lawe) but with the sprite of the lyvinge God: not in tables of stone (as the ten commaundmētes) but in the fleshy tables of ye herte / as who shulde saye / we write not a deed law with ynke & in parchemente / ner grave that which damned you in tables of stone: but preach you yt which bringeth the sprite of lyfe vnto youre brestes / which sprite

writeth and graveth the lawe of love in youre hertes and geveth you lust to doo the will of God. And forthermoare / sayth he oure ablenes cometh of God which hath made vs able to mynistre the new testament / not of the letter (that is to saye not of the law) but of the sprite. For ye letter (that is to saye the law) kylleth: but ye sprite geveth lyfe (that is to saye the sprite of God which entereth youre hertes when ye beleve the glad tydinges that are preached you in Christe / quickeneth youre hertes and geveth you lyfe & lust and maketh you to do of love and of youre awne accorde with out compulsiō / yt which the law compelled you to doo and damned you because ye coulde not doo with love and lust and naturally.

               ge this worldli similitude He yt taketh most

payne for a man deserveth most and to hym a mā is most bounde / so like wise must it be with God ād so forth: now the wedow ād virgyn take moare payne in resistinge their lustes then the maryed wife / therfore is their state holyer. Fyrst I saye / that in their awne sophistry a similitude is the worst and feblest argumēte that can be and proveth lest and sonest disceaveth.Similitudes are no good argumētes amō

For though I had a thousande brethern ād did moare thē they all / yet do I not my dutie. The fathers and mothers also care most for the leest ād wekest and them that can do leest: ye for the worst care they most and wold spende / not their goodes only: but also their bloude to bringe them to the righte waye. And evē so is it of ye kingdome of Christe as thou maist well se in the similitude of the riotous sonne Luke. xv. Moare over Paul saith .j. Cor. vij. It is beter to marie then to burne. For the persone yt burneth can not quietly serve God in as moch as his mynde is drawen awaye and the thoughtes of his herte occupied with wonderfull and mōstrous imaginacions. He can nether se / ner heare / ner reade but that his wittes are rapte and he cleane from hym selfe. And agayne / saith he / circuncision is nothinge vncircuncision is no

thinge: but the kepynge of the commaundmentes is all to gether. Loke where in thou canst best kepe the commaundmentes thither get thy selfe and therein abyde / wheder thou be wedow wyfe or mayde / and then hast thou all with God We must cure oure īfirmites withe the reamedies that god hath ordened and not tempte God. Yf we have infirmites that draw vs from the lawes of God / let vs cure them with the remedies that God hath made. Yf thou burne mary For God hath promysed the no chastite / as longe as thou maist vse the remedy that he hath ordened: no moare then he hath promysed to flake thine hongre without meate
            Now to aske of God moare then he hath promysed cometh of a false fayth and is playne ydolatry: and to desyre What temptinge of God ys▪
                a myracle where there is naturall remedy / is temptinge of God. And of payne takynge this wyse vnderstande. He that taketh payne to kepe ye commaundmentes of god is sure ther by that he loveth god ād that he hath gods sprite in him. And the moare payne a man taketh (I meane paciently ād without grouginge) the moare he loveth God and the perfecter he is ād neare vnto that health which the soules of all christen men longefore and the moare purged from the infirmyte and synne that remayneth in the fleshe: but to loke for any other rewarde or promocion in heven or in the lyfe to come thā that which God hath promysed for Christes sake and

which Christe hath deserved for vs with his payne takynge / is abhominable in the syght of God. For Christe only hath purchesed the rewarde / and oure payne takynge to kepe the commaundmentes doeth but purge the synne that remayneth in the flesh / and cerrifie vs that we are chosen & sealed with Gods spirite vnto the tewarde that Christe hath purchased for vs.
            I was once at the creatinge of doctours of divinite / where the oponente brought the same reason to prove that ye wedow had moare merite then the vigin / because she had greater payne for as moch as she had once proved the pleasures of matrimony. Ego ne go domine doctor said the respondente. For though the virgen have not proved / yet she imagineth that the playsure is gretter then it is in deade and therfore is moare moved and hath greater temptacion ād greater payne. Are not these disputers they that Paul speaketh of in the sixte chapter of ye first pistle to Timotheum. That they are not / contente with the wholsome wordes of oure lorde Iesus Christ / and doctrine of godlinesse. And therfore know no thinge: but wast their braynes aboute questions and strifte of wordes / wherof springe envy / stryfe and raylinge of men with corrupte myndes destitute of the trouth.

One thinge are we sure of / that they are where God hath leyde thē. ☜ Yf they be in hevē / we have never the moare in Christe: Yf they be not there / we have never the lesse. Oure dutie is to prepare oure selves vnto the commaundmentes and to be thankefull for that which is opened vnto vs / and not to sherch the vnsherchable secretes of God. Of Gods secretes can we know no moare then be openeth vnto vs. Yf God shutte / who shall open? How thē cā naturall reasō come by ye knowlege of that which God hath hyd vnto himselfe?
            Yet let vs se one of their reasons where with they prove it. The chefe reason is this / every man doeth moare for his mother / saye they / then for other / in lyke maner must Christe do for his mother / therfore hath she this preheminence / that hir body is in heven. And yet Christ in the twelf chapter of Mathe. knoweth hir not for his mother: but as ferforth as she kepte his fathers commaundmentes. And Paul in the seconde Pistle to the Corintheans in v. chap. knoweth not Christe himselfe fleshly or after a worldly purpose. Last of all god is fre & no forther boūde thē he bīdeth hīselfe:

yf he have made hir any promyse he is bounde / yf not / then is he not. Finally yf thou set this above rehersed chapter of Math. before the where Christe wolde not know his mother / and the seconde of Iohn where he rebuked hir / and the secōde of Luke where she loost him and how negligente she was to leve him behinde her at Ierusalem vnwars ād to goo a dayes Iorney yer she sought for him thou mightest solve many of their reasons which they make of this matter / and that she was without originall synne: reade also Erasmusis annotations in the said places. And as for me I committe all soch maters vnto those ydle belies which have noughte else to doo / then to move soch questiōs and geve thē fre libertie to holde what they lyste / as longe as it hurteth not the fayth / whether it be so or no: exhortīge yet with Paul all that will please God ād obtayne that saluacion that is in Christe / that they geve no hede vnto vnnecessary and braulynge disputacions / and yt they laboure for the knowlege of those thinges without which they cā
               not be saved And remēbre yt the sonne was geven vs to gyde vs in our waye and workes bodyly. Now yf thou leave the naturall vse of the sonne & will loke directly on hym to se how brighte he is and sochlike curiosite then will the sonne blynde the. So was the scripture gevē vs to gyde vs in our waye

and workes goostly. The waye is Christe ād the promises in him are oure salvacion yf we longe for them. Now if we shall leave that righte vse and turne oure selves vnto vayne questions and to sherch the vnsherchable secretes of God: then no doute shall the scripture blinde vs as it hath done oure scole mē and oure sotle disputers.
            ANd as they are false prophetes which prove with allegories / similitudes ād wordly reasons that which is no where made mencion of in the scripture. ☜ Even so counte them for false prophetes which expounde the scriptures drawinge them vnto a worldly purpose cleane contrary vnto the In expoundinge of the scripture we must have a respecte vnto the lyvinge and practisinge of christ ād of his apostels and prophetes· example / lyvinge / and practisinge of Christe and of his Apostles and of all the holy prophetes. For saith Peter. ij. Petri. j. no prophesy in the scripture hath any private interpretation. For the scripture came not by the will of man: but the holy men of God spake / as they were moved by the holy goost. No place of the scripture maye have a private exposition / that is it maye not be expounde aftyr the will of man or aftyr the will of ye flesh or drawē vnto a wordldly purpose cō
               trary vnto the open textes and the generall articles of the fayth ād the whole course of the scripture and contrary to the lyvinge ād practisynge of Christe and the Apostles and holy prophetes. For as they came not by the

will of man so maye they not be drawen or expound after the will of man: but as they came by the holy goost / so must they be expounde and vnderstonde by the holy goost. The scripture is that where with God draweth vs vnto him and not where with we shuld be leade frō him. The scriptures springe out of God and flow vnto Christe / and were geven to leade The scripture was geven to leade vs vnto Christe. vs to Christe. Thou must therfore goo alonge by the scripture as by a lyne / vntyll thou come at Christ / which is the wayes ende and restynge place. Yf any man therfore vse the scripture to drawe the from Christe and to nosell the in any thinge save in Christe / the same is a false prophete. And that thou maist perceave what Peter meaneth / it foloweth in the texte. ☞ There where false prophetes amonge the people (whose prophesies were bely wisdome) as there shalbe false teachers amō

Covetousnes Covetousnes ād desyre of honoure ys the ende of all false doctrine ād that which false prophetes seke. is the conclusion: for covetousnes and ambicion that is to saye / lucre and desyre of honoure is the fynall ende of all false prophetes and of all false teachers. Loke apon the Popes false doctrine / what is the ende therof and what seke they there by? Wherfore serveth Purgatory. purgatory? but to purge thy purse and to polle the and robbe both the and thy hyeres of house and landes and of all thou hast / that they maye be in honoure.

And of their false expoundynge the scripture and drawynge it contrary vnto the example of Christe and the Apostles and holy Prophetes vnto their damnable covetousnes and fylthy ambicion take an example.An example of false expoundinge the scriptures.
            
            Math. xvj. When Peter saith to Christ thou arte the sonne of the lyvinge God / 

and Christe answered / thou arte Peter and apon this rocke I will bylde my congregaciō. By the rocke interpret they Peter. And then cometh the pope and wilbe Peters successor / whether Peter will or will not / yee whether God will or will not and though all the scripture saye nay to any soch succession / and sayeth / loo I am the rocke / the foundaciō ād heed of Christes church Christe the faith and Gods-word is the rocke and not the pope Now sayeth all the scripture that the rocke is Christe / the fayth and Gods worde. As christe sayeth Math. vij. he yt heareth my wordes & doeth therafter is lyke a man yt byldeth on a rocke. For the house yt is bylde on Gods wordes will stōde / though hevē shulde fall. And Iohn. xv. Christe is ye wine & we ye braūches / so is Christe ye rocke / ye stocke & fundaciō where on we be bylde. And Paul. j. Cor. iij. calleth Christe oure fundacion & all other / whether it be Peter or Paul / he calleth oure servātes to preach Christe & to bylde vs on hī. Yf therfore ye pope be peters successoure / his duty is to preach Christe only ād other auctorite hath he none.The auctorice of peters successoure is but to preach. And .ij.xj. Paul marieth vs vnto Christe and dryveth vs from all trust ād confidence in man And Ephesio. ij. sayeth Paul. Ye are bylde on the fundacion of the Apostles and prophetes / that is on the worde which they preached / Christe beinge / sayth he / the hed corner stone / in whom every byldinge coupled

to gether groweth vp in to an holy temple in the lorde / in whom also ye are bylde together and made an habitaciō for God in the spiryte. And Peter in the seconde of his fyrst pistle bildeth vs on Christe / contrary vnto the Pope which byldeth vs on hym selfe. Hell gates shall not prevayle agenst it / that is to saye / agenste the congregation that is bylde apō Christes fayth and apon Gods worde. Now were the Pope the rocke / hell gates coulde not prevayle agenste him. For the housse coulde not stonde if the rocke and foundacion where on it is bylde did perish: but the contrary se we in oure Popes. For hell gates have prevayled agenste them many hūdred yeres / and have swalowed them vp: if Gods worde be true & the stories that are written of them: yee or if it be true that we se with oure yes. I will geve the ye keyes of heven saith Christ / and not I geve. And Iohn. xx. after the resurrection payed it and gave the keyes to thē all indifferently. What soever thou byndest on erth / it shalbe boūde in heven / and what soever thou lousest on erth it shalbe loused in heven. Of this texte maketh the Pope what he will / and expoundeth it contrary to all the scripture / contrary to Christes practysinge / and the Apostles / and all the prophetes. * Now the scripture geveth recorde to him selfe and ever expoundeth it selfe by an other open texte. Yf the

Pope then can not brynge for his exposicion the practysinge of Christe or of the Apostles and prophetes or an open texte / then is his exposicion false doctrine.That exposicion ys false which is agēst the epen scripture or agenst the practisinge of christ ād of his apostles.. Christe expoundeth him selfe. Mathei. xviij. sayenge: Yf thy brother synne agenste the rebuke him betwixt him and the alone. Yf he here the thou hast wōne thy brother: but yf he here ye not thē take with ye one or two & so forth as it stādeth in ye text he cōcludeth sayēge to thē all what so ever ye bynde in erth it shalbe bounde in heven and what soever ye louse on erth it shalbe loused in heven. Where byndinge is but to rebuke them that synne and lousynge to forgeve them that repente. And Iohn. xx. Whose synnes ye forgeve they are forgeven and whose synnes ye holde they are holden. And Paul. j. Corinthiorum. v. bindeth / and .ij. Corinthiorū. ij. louseth after the same maner.
            Also this byndinge and lousinge is one power / and as he byndeth so louseth he:Byndynge ād lowsinge is one power. yee and byndeth first yer he can louse. For who can louse that is not bounde. Now what so ever Peter byndeth or his successoure (as he wilbe called and is not / but in deade the very successoure of Satan) is not so to be vnderstonde / that Peter or the Pope hath power to commaunde a man to be in deedly synne or to be damned or to goo in to hell sayenge: be thou in deedly synne / be

thou damned / goo thou to hell / goo thou to purgatory. For that exposicion is contrary to the everlastinge testamēte that God hath made vnto vs in Christe. He sente his sonne Christe to louse vs from synne and damnacion and hell / and that to testifie vnto the worlde sente he his disciples Actes. j. Paul also hath no power to destroye / but to edefie .ij. Corithiorum. x. and .xiij. How can Christe geve his disciples power agēst him selfe and agenst his everlastinge testamente? Can he sende them to preach salvacion and geve them power to damne whom they luste? What mercy and profite have we in Christes deeth and in his Gospell / yf the Pope which passeth all men in wekednesse hath power to sende whom he will to hell / and to damne whom he lusteth? we had thē no cause / to call him What Iesus signifieth. Iesus / that is to saye saver: but myghte of ryghte call him destroy ar. Wherfore then this byndinge is to be vnderstōde as Christe interpreteth it in the places above rehersed and as the Apostles practysed it What byndī
                  ge meaneth· and is nothinge but to rebuke men of their synnes by preachinge the law. A man must first synne agenste Gods lawe yer the Pope can bynde him: yee and a man must fyrste synne agenste Gods law yer he nede to feare the Popes curse. What cursynge meaneth. For cursinge and byndinge are both one and * no thynge save to

rebuke a man of his synnes by Gods lawe. It foloweth also then that the lousynge is of lyke maner / and is no thinge 
                  〈◊〉
                forgevinge of synne to them that repente thorow preachinge of ye promyses which God hath made in Christe in whom only we have all forgevenes of synnes / What low synge meaneth. as Christe interpreteth it and as the Apostles and prophetes practysed it. So is it a false power that the pope taketh on him to louse Gods lawes / as to geve a man licence to put awaye his wife to whom God hath bounde him / and to bynde them to chastite which God commaundeth to mary / that is to wete them that burne and can not lyve chaste. It is also a false power to bynde that which Gods worde maketh fre / makynge synne in the creatures which God hath made for mās vse.
            
               ☞The Pope which so fast lowses and purgeth in purgatory / can not with all the low synges and purgacions that he hath ether lowse or purge our appetites and lust and rebellion that is in vs agenst the law of God And yet the purginge of them is the right purgatory. Yf he can not purge them that are a lyve / where with purgeth he them / that are deed? * The Apostles knew no other wayes to purge / but thorow preachinge Gods worde which worde only is that that purgeth the herte / as thou mayst se Ihon xv. Ye are pure / saith Christe / thorow the

worde. Now the Pope preacheth not to thē whom the fayne to lye in purgatory / no moare thē he doeth to vs that are alyve. How then purgeth he them? The Pope is Robyn goodfelow. The Pope is kynne to Robyn goodfellow which swepeth the howse / washeth the disshes ād purgeth all by nyghte. But when daye cometh ther is no thinge founde cleane.
            Some man will saye the Pope byndeth them not / they bynde them selves. I answare he that byndeth him selfe to the pope and had lever have his lyfe & soule ruled by the Popes will thē by the will of God & by the Popes worde then by the worde of god / is a fole. And he that had lever be bonde then fre is not wise. And he that will not abyde in the fredome wherin Christe hath sette vs / is also madde. And he that maketh deedly synne where none is and seketh causes of hatered betwene him and God is not in his right wittes. Forther moare no man can bynde him selfe further then he hath power over him selfe. He that is vnder the power of a nother man can not bynde him selfe without lycence / as sonne / doghter / wife / servante and subiecte. Nether canst thou geve God that which is not in thy power. Chastite canst thou not geve God further then God lendeth it the / yf thou can not live chaste thou arte bounde to mary or to be damned. Last of all for what purpose thou

byndest thy selfe must be sene. Yf thou do it to obtayne therby that which Christ hath purchased for the frely / so arte thou an infidell and hast no parte with Christe and so forth. Yf thou wilte se moare of this mater loke in Deuteronomion ād there shalt thou fynde it moare largely entreaded
            Take an other ensample of there false expoundynge the scripture. Christ saieth Mathei. xxiij.A nother example. The scribes and the phareses sitte on Moyses seate / what soever they byd you observe / that observe and doo: but after their workes doo not. Loo saye oure sophisters or ypocrites / lyve we never so abhominably / yet is oure auctorite never the lesse. Do as we teach therfore (saye they) and not as we doo. And yet Christ sayth they sitte on Moses seate / yt is as lōge as they teach Moyses do as they teach. For the law of Moyses is the law of God. But for their awne tradicions and false doctrine Christ rebuked them and disobeyed them and taught other to be ware of their leven. So if oure phareses sitte on Christes seate ād preach him / we ought to heare them: but when they sitte on their awne seate / then ought we to beware as well of their pestilente doctrine as of their abhominable livinge.
            Lyke wise where they fynde menciō made of a swerde / they turne it vnto the popes power. The disciples said vnto Christe Luke

xxij. Loo here be two swerdes. And Christe answered two is ynough. Loo / saye they the Pope hath two swerdes / the spirituall swerde and the temperall swerde. And therfore is it lawfull for hym to fyghte and make warre.
            Christ a litle before he wente to his passion / axed his disciples sayenge: when I sente you out without all provision lacked ye any thinge. And they sayed nay. And he answered / but now let him that hath a walet take it with hym and he that hath a scrippe lyke wise / & let hī that hath never a swerde sell his cote and by one: As who shulde saye / it shall goo otherwise now then then. Then ye wente forth in fayth of my worde and my fathers promyses and it fedde you and made provision for you and was youre swerde and shilde and defender: but now it shall goo as thou readest Zacharias. xiij. I will smyte the sheparde and the shepe of the flocke shalbe scatered. Now shall my father leave me in the hādes of ye weked & ye also shal be forsakē ād destitute of fayth / & shall trust in youre selves & in youre awne provision & in youre awne defence. Christ gave no commaundemente / but prophesied what shuld happen. And they because they vnderstode hym not / answered here are two swerdes. And Christe to make an ende of soch babylynge answered two is ynough. For yf he had

commaunded every man to by a swerde / how had two bene ynough? Also yf two were ynough / and pertayned to the Pope only / why are they all commaunded to byevery man a swerde? By the swerde therfore Christe prophesied that they shulde be lafte vnto their awne defēce. And two swerdes were ynough: yee never a one had bene ynough. For yf every one of them had had ten swerdes they wolde have fled yer mydnyghte.
            In the same chapter of Luke not .xij. lines from the forsaid texte. The disciples evē at the last soper axed who shulde be the greatest And Christ rebuked thē ād said it was an hethenish thinge & ther shulde be no soch thinge amonge them / but that the greatest shulde be as the smallest / and that to be greate was to do service as Christ did. But this texte because it is brighter then the sonne / that they can make no sophistry of it / therfore will they not heare it ner let other know it
            FOr as moch now as thou partly seist the falshed of oure prelates / how all theyr study is to disceave vs and to kepe vs in darknes / to sit as Gods in oure cō

open textes / nether contrary to the general articles of the fayth / nether contrary to the livinge and practisinge off Christ and off his Apostles.Fathers fathers. And when they crye fathers fathers / remembre that it were the fathers that both blinded and robbed the whole worlde and brought vs in to this captivite where in these enforse to kepe vs styll. Forther moare as they off the olde time are fathers to vs / soo shall these fowle monsters be fathers to thē that come after vs / and the ypocrites that folowe vs will crye of these and of their doinges fathers fathers / as these crye fathers / fathers / of them that are past. And as we feale oure fathers / so did they that are past feale their fathers: nether were there in the worlde any other fathers then soch as we both se ād feale this many hundred yeres / as there decrees beare recorde and the stories and cronycles well testifye. Yf Gods worde appered any where they agreed all agenst it. When they had brought that a slepe / then strove they one with a nother aboute their awne traditions and one pope condemned a nothers decrees and were some tyme two / yee thre popes attonce. And one bisshope went to law with a nother and one cursed a nother for their awne fantasies and soch thinges as they had falsly goten. And the greatest sayntes are they that most defended the liberties of

the church (as they call it) which they falsly gote with blyndinge kynges / nether had the worlde any rest this many hundred yeres for reforminge of freres and monkes and ceasinge of scismes that were amonge oure clergy. And as for the holy doctours as Augustine / Hierom / Cipriane / Chresostomus and Bede / will they not heare. Yf they wrote any thinge negligently (as they were men) that draw they cleane contrary to their meaninge and therof trihumphe they. Those doctours knew of none auctorite that one Bishope shuld have above a nother / nether thought or once dreamed that ever any soch shuld be / or of any soch whisperīge or of pardons / or scouringe of purgatory / as they have fayned.
            
               Miracles miracles.And when they crye myracles myracles remembre that God hath made an everlastinge testamente with vs in Christes bloud / agenst which we maye receave no myracles no nether the preachinge of Paul hym selfe yf he came agayne / by his awne teachinge to the Galathiens / nether yet the preachinge of the aungels of heven. The woman of lēster was a solem miracle Wherfore ether they are no myracles but they have fayned them (as is the myracle that saint Peter halowed westmester) or else / yf there be myracles that confirme doctrine contrary to Gods worde / then are they done of the devell (as the mayde of ypswich

and of kent) to prove vs whether we will cleve fast to Gods worde and to desceave them that have no love to the trueth of Gods worde ner lust to walke in his lawes.The armoure of the spiritualte.
            
            And for as moch as they to disceave with all arme them selves agenst the with argumentes and persuasions of fleshly wisdome / with worldly similitudes with shadowes / with false allegories / with false exposicions of the scripture contrary vnto the livinge and practisinge of Christe and the Apostles / with lyes and false myracles / with false names / dome ceremonies / with disgisinge of ypocresy / with the auctorites of the fathers and last of all with the violence of the temperall swerde: The armure af a christē mā ys gods word and fayth. therefore do thou contrary wise arme thy selfe / to defende the with all / as Paul teacheth in the last chapter to the Ephesians Gyrde on the the swerde of the spirite which is Gods worde and take to the the shilde of fayth / which is not to beleve a tale of Robyn hode or Gestus Romanorum or of the Cronycles / but to beleve Gods worde that lasteth ever.
            And when the Pope with his falsheed calēgeth tēperall auctorite above kynge and Emperoure: set before the fyve and twenty Chapter off Saynte Mathew. Where

Christ cōmaundteth Peter to put vp his swerde. And set before the Paul. ij. Corin. x. Where he saith the wepons of oure warre are not carnall thinges but myghty in god to bringe all vnderstandinge in captivite vnder the obedience of Christ / that is / the wepons are Gods worde and doctrine ād not swerdes of yeron and stele / and set before the ye doctrine of Christe ād of his Apostles and their practise
            And when the Pope calengeth auctorite over his fellow Bisshopes and over all the congregacion of Christe by succession of Peter set before the the fyrst of the Actes where Peter for all his auctorite put no mā in the rowme of Iudas / but all the Apostles chose two indifferently and cast lottes desyringe God to temper them that the lotte myght fall on the most ablest. And Actes viij. the apostles sente Peter / and in the .xj. call hym to rekenynge and to geve acomptes of that he hath done.
            
               ☞And when the Popes law cōmaundeth sayenge: though that the Pope lyve never so wekedly and draw with hym thorow his evell ensample innumerable thousandes vnto hell / yet se that no man presume to rebuke him / for he is hed over all and no man over hym: set before the Galath. ij. Where Paul rebuketh Peter openly. And se how both to the Corinthians ād also to the Galathiens

he will have no superior but Gods worde and he that coulde teach better by Gods worde. And because when he rehersed his preachinge and his doynges vnto the hye Apostles / they coulde improve no thinge / therfore will he be equall with the best.
            And when the freres saye / they doo moare then their dutie when they preach and moare then they are Freres be not bound to preach· bounde to:☜ to saye oure service are we bounde (saye they) and that is oure dutie and to preach is moare then we are bounde to. Set thou before the how that Christes bloud shedinge hath bounde vs to love one a nother with all oure myghte and to doo the vttemost of oure power one to a nother. And Paul sayeth .j. Corinth. ix. Wo be vnto me yf I preach not: yee wo is vnto hym that hath where with to helpe his neyboure and to make him better and doo it not. Yf they thinke it moare then their dutie to preach Christe vnto you then they thinke it moare then their dutie to praye that ye shuld come to the knowlege of Christe. And therfore it is no mervell though they take so great laboure: ye and so great wages also to kepe you styll in darkenes.
            And when they crye furiously hold the heretikes vnto the wall and if they will not revoke burne them without any moare a doo

reason not with them / it is an article condemned / by the fathers. Set thou before the the sayenge of Peter. j. Petri. iij. To all that axe you be ready to geve an answere of the hope that is in you and that with meakenes. The fathers of the Iewes ād the bisshopes / which had as great auctorite over thē as ours have over vs / cōdemned Christ and his doctrine. Yf it be ynough to saye the fathers have condemned it then are the Iewes to be holde excused: yee they are yet in the ryght waye and we in the false. But and yf the Iewes be bounde to loke in the scripture and to se whether their fathers have done right or wrōge / thē are we lyke wyse bounde to loke in the scripture whether oure fathers have done right or wronge / and ought to beleve no thinge with out a reason of the scripture and auctorite of Gods worde.
            And of this maner defende thy selfe agenst all maner wekednes of oure sprites / armed all waye with Gods worde ād with a stronge and a stedfast fayth ther vnto. Without Gods worde doo nothinge. And to his worde adde nothynge nether pull any thynge there from / as Moyses every where teacheth the. How god oughte to be served. Serve God in the sprite / and thy neyboure with all outwarde service.☞ Serve God as he hath appoynted the and not with thy good entente and good

zele. Remembre Saul was cast awaye of God for ever for his good entente. God requyreth obedyence vnto his worde and abhorreth all good ententes and good zeles which are without Gods worde. For they are nothynge else then playne ydolatry and worshepinge of false Goddes.In Christ ys rest of consciē

            And remembre that Christ is the ende of all thynge. He only is oure restinge place and he is oure peace. Ephesiorum seconde chapter. For as there is no salvacion in any other name / so is there no peace in any other name. Thou shalt never have rest in thy soule nether shall the worme of conscience ever cease to gnaw thyne herte tyll thou come at Christ: tyll thou heare the glad tydynges / how that God for his sake hath forgeven the all frely. Yf thou trust in thy workes there is no rest. Thou shalt thynke / I have not done ynough. Have I done it with so greate love as I shulde doo? Was I so glad in doynge as I wold be to receave helpe at my neade? I have left this or that vndone and soch lyke. Yf thou trust in confession / then shalt thou thynke. Have I tolde all? Have I tolde all the circumstances? Did I repente ynough? Had I as greate sorowe in my repentaunce for my synnes as I had pleasure in doynge them? Lyke wyse in our holy pardons and pylgremage / 

gettest thou no rest. For thou seist that the very Gods them selves which sell their pardone so good chepe or some whiles geve thē frely for glory sake / trust not therin them selves. The byld colleges and make perpetuites to be prayed for for ever and lade the lyppes of their beidmen or chaplaynes with so many masses and diriges and so longe service / that I have knowen of some that have byd the devell take their founders soules for very impaciencye and werynes of so paynefull laboure.
            
               Doo good deades ād trust in Christ.As perteyninge to good deades therfore / do the best thou canst ād desyre God to geve strēgth to do better dayly / but in Christ put thy trust and in the pardon and promyses that God hath made the for his sake / and on that rocke bylde thine howse and there dwell. For there only shalt thou be sure from all stormes and tempestes and frō all wyly assaltes of oure weked spirites which stody with all falsheed to vndermyne vs. And the God of all mercy geve the grace so to doo / vnto whom be glorie for ever. Amen.
         
         
            ¶A compendious rehersall of that which goeth before.
            
               
               I Have described vnto you the obedience of childerne servantes / wives ād subiectes. Thes iiij. orders are of Gods makynge and the rules therof are Gods worde. He that kepeth them shalbe blessed: yee is blessed all ready and he that breaketh them shalbe cursed. Yf any person of impaciency or of a stoburne and rebellious mynde withdraw him selfe from any of these / and gete him to any other order: let him not thinke therby to avoyd the vengeaunce of god in obeyenge rules and tradicions of mans imaginacion. Yf thou polledst thine heed in the worshepe of thy father and breakest his commaundmentes / shuldest thou so es
                  •
               ape? Or yf thou payntedst thy masters image on a wall ād stekedst vp a candle before it / shuldest thou there with make satisfaction / for the breakinge of his commaundmentes. Or if thou wareste a blew rote in the worshepe of the kynge and brakest his lawes shuldest thou so go quyte? Let a mans wife make hir selfe a sister of the charterhouse and answere hir husband whē he byddeth hir holde hir peace / my brethern kepe sylence for me / ād se whether she shall so escape. And be thou sure God is moare gelouse over his commaundmentes thē mā is over his or thē any mā is over his wife.
            Because we be blynde / God hath apoynted

in the scripture how we shulde serve him and please him. As perteyninge vnto his awne person he is abundantly pleased when we beleve his promyses and holy testamente which he hath made vnto vs in Christe / ād for the mercy which he there shewed 
                  •
               s / love his commaundmentes. All bodyly service must be done to man in gods stede. We must geve obedience / honoure / tolle / tribute / custome / and rente vnto whom they belonge. Then if thou have ought moare to bestowe / geve vnto the pore which are left here in Christes stede that we shew mercy on them. Yf we kepe the commaundmentes of love then are we sure that we fulfull the law in the syghte of God and that oure blessinge shal be everlastinge lyfe. Now whē we obeye paciently and without grudginge evell princes that oppresse vs and persecute vs and be kynde and mercyfull to them that are mercylesse to vs and doo the worst they can to vs and so take all fortune paciently and kysse what so ever crosse God layeth on oure backes: thē are we sure that we kepe the commaundmente of love.
            I declared that God hath taken all vengeaunce in to his awne handes / and will avenge all onryght himselfe: ether by the powers or officers which are appoynted there to or else / yf they be negligente / he will sende his curses apon the transgressours and

destroye them with his secret iudgementes. I shewed also that whosoever avengeth him selfe is damned in the deade doinge and falleth in to the handes of the temperall swerde / because he taketh the office of God apon hym and robbeth God of his most hie honoure in that he will not paciently abyde his iudgemente. I shewed you of the auctorite of princes / how they are in Gods stede and how they maye not be resisted do they never so evell / they must be resarved vnto the wrath of God. Never the later yf they commaunde to doo evell we must then disobey and saye we are other wise commaundet of God: but not to ryse agenste them. They will kyll vs then sayest thou. Therefore / I saye is a christen called / to sofre even the bitter deeth for his hopes sake and because he will doo no evyll. I shewed also that the kynges and rulers be they never so evell are yet a great gyfte of the goodnes of god / and defende vs frō a thousande thinges that we se not.
            I proved also that all men without excepcion are vnder the temperall swerde / what so ever names they geve them selves. Because the prest is chosen out of the laye men / to teach this obedience / is that a lawfull cause for hym to disobeye? Because he preacheth that ye laye mā shulde not stele / is it therfore lawfull for hī to stele

vnpunished? Because thou teachest me that I maye not kyll / or yf I doo the kynge must kyll me agayne / is it therfore lawfull for the to kyll ād goo free? Other whether is it rather mete that thou which art my gyde to teach me the righte waye shuldest walke therin before me? The prestes of the olde law with their hye Bisshope Aaron and all his successours / though they were annoynted by Gods commaundmente and appoynted to serve God in his temple and exempte frō all offices and ministeringe of wordly matters / were yet never the lesse vnder the temporall swerde / yf they brake the lawes. Christe saith to Peter / all that take the swerde / shall perish by the swerde. Here is none exception. Paul saith all soules must obeye. Here is none excepcion. Paul hym selfe is here not exēpte. God saith Gene. ix. Who so ever shedeth mās bloude / by mā shal his bloude be shede agayne. Here is none excepcion.
            Moare over Christe became pore to make other men riche / and bonde to make other fre. He left also with his disciples the law of love. Now love seketh not hir awne profitte: but hyr neybours: love seketh not hyr awne fredome / but becometh suertye ād bonde to make hir neyboure fre.The pope hath a law that none of his sprites maye be suerty. Damned therfore are the spiritualte by all the lawes of God / which thorow falshed and disgised

ypocrisy have soughte so great profite / so great riches / so greate auctorite and so greate liberties / and have so bedgerd the laye and so broughte them in subieccion and bondage and so despice them / that they have set vp frauncheses in all townes and villages for whosoever robbeth / morthereth or sleyeth them / ād even for traytours vnto the kynges person also.
            I proved also that no kynge hath power to graunte them soch libertie: but are as well dāned for their gevinge / as they for their false purchasinge. For as God geveth the father power over his childern: even so geveth he hym a commaundmente to execute it / and not to sofre them to doo wekedly vnpunished but vnto his damnacion / as thou maist se by Hely the hye prest &c. And as the master hath auctorite over his servauntes: even so hath he a commaundmente to governe them. And as the husbande ys heed over his wife: even so hath he commaundmente to rule hyr appetites and is damned yf he sofre hyr to be an whore ād a misse lyver / or submit hymselfe to hyr and make hir his heed. And evē in lyke maner as god maketh ye kīge heed over his realme evē so geveth he hym cōmaūdment to execute the lawes apon all men indifferently. For the law is Gods and not the kinges. The kynge is but a servaunte to execute the law of god ād

not to rule after his awne imaginacion.
            I shewed also that the law and the kynge are to be feared / as thinges that were geven in fyre and in thōder and lyghtenynge and terreble signes. I shewed the cause why rulers are evell ād by what meanes we myght obtayne better. I shewed also how wholsome those bitter medicines evyll princes are to ryghte Christen men.
            I declared how they which God hath made governers in ye worlde oughte to rule yf they be christē. They ought to remēbre ye they are heedes & armes / to defende ye body to mynister peace health & wealth ād evē to save ye body / ād yt they have receaved their offices of god to mynister & to doo service vnto their brethern. Kīge subiecte / Master servaūte / are names in ye worlde: but not in christe. In Christe we are all one & evē brethern No mā is his awne but we are all christes servaūtes bought with christes bloude. Therfore oughte no mā to seke hym selfe or his awne profite: but Christe and his will. In Christe no man ruleth as a kynge his subiectes or a master his servauntes: but serveth as one hande doeth to a nother and as the handes doo vnto the fete and the fete to the handes / as thou seist .j. Cori. xij. We also serve not as servaūtes vnto masters: but as they which are bought with Christes bloude serve Christe hym selfe. We be here all servauntes

vnto Christe. For what so ever we doo one to a nother in Christes name that doo we vnto Christe / and the rewarde of that shal we receave of Christe. The kynge counteth his comens Christe hym selfe and therfore doeth them service willingly sekynge no moare of them then is sufficiente to mayntene peace and vnite and to defende the Realme. And they obeye agayne willingly & lovingly as vnto Christ. And of Christe every man seketh his rewarde.
            I warned the iudges that they take not an ensample how to minister their offices / of oure spiritualte / which are bought ād solde to do the will of Sathan: but of the scripture whēce they have their auctorite. Let that which is secret abyde secret tyll God opē it / which is ye iudge of secretes. For it is moare then a cruell thinge to breake vp in to a mans hert and to compell hym to put ether soul or body in ieoperdy or to shame hym selfe. Yf Peter ye great piller for feare of deeth forsoke his master / ought we not to spare weke consciences?
            I declared how ye Kynge oughte to rydde his realme frō the wily tyrany of ye ypocrites & to bringe ye ypocrites vnder his lawes: yee & how he oughte to be lerned & to heare & to loke apō ye causes hī selfe which he will punysh & not to beleve ye ypocrites ād to geve them hys swerde to kyll whom they will
            
               The kynge oughte to count what he hath spent in the Popes quarell sens he was kynge. The fyrst viage cost apon .xiiij. hundred thousande poundes. Reken sens what hath be spent by see and londe betwene vs and french mē and scottes and then in tryhumphes and in Ambasiasies and what hath bene sent out of the Realme secretly and all to mayntene oure holy father / and I doute not but that will surmounte the some of .xl. or .l. hundred thousande poundes. For we had no cause to spende one peny but for oure holy father. The kynge therfore oughte to make them paye thys money every farthinge / and fette it out of their myters / croses / shrines and all maner treasure of the church / and paye it to his comens agayne not that only which the Cardinall and his Bysshopes compelled the comens to lende and made them swere with soch an ensample of tyranny as was never before thought on: but also all that he hath gadered of thē. Or else by the consente of the comens to kepe it in store for the defence of the Realme. Yee the kynge oughte to loke in the cronicles what the popes have done to kynges in tyme past and make them restore it also / And ought to take awaye from them their londes which they have goten with their false prayers and restore it vnto the ryght heyres agayne or with consente and

advisemente turne them vnto the mayntenynge of the pore and bringynge vp of youth vertuously and to mayntene necessary officers and ministers for to defende the comen welth.
            Yf he will not doo it: thē oughte the comens to take pacience & to take it for Gods scorge and to thinke that God hath blynded the kynge for their synnes sake & committe their cause to God: And then shall God make a scorge for thē & dryve thē out of his temple after his wōderfull iudgemente.
            ON the other syde I have also vttered the wekednes of ye spiritualte / ye falsheed of the bysshopes & tuggulīge of the Pope / & how they have disgysed thē selves / borowīge some of their pōpe of ye Iewes & some of ye gētyles / & have with sotyll wyles turned ye obediēce that shuld be gevē to Gods ordinaunce vnto them selves. And how they have put out Gods testamēte ād Gods trueth and sette vp their awne tradicions and lyes / in which they have taught the people to beleve & there by sitte in their consciences as God / and have by that meanes robbed the world of londes and goodes / of peace and vnite / and of all temporall auctorite / and have broughte the people in to the ignoraunce of God and have heped the wrath of God apon all realmes and namely apon the kynges. Whom they

have robed (I speake not of worldly thynges only) but even of their very naturall wittes. They make them beleve that they are most Christen / when the lyve most abhominably and will sofre no man in their Realmes that beleveth on Christ / and that they are defenders of the fayth / when the burne the Gospell and promyses of God / out of which all fayth springeth.
            I showed how they have mynistred Christe / kynge and Emperoure out of their rowmes / and how they have made them a severell kyngdome which the gote at the fyrst in deceavynge of princes / and now perverte the whole scripture to prove that they have soch auctoryte of God. And lest the laye men shuld se how falsely the allege the places of the scripture / is the greatest cause of this persecucion.
            
               Confession▪
               They have fayned confession for the same purpose to stablysh their kyngdome with all. All secreates know they therby. The Bysshope knoweth the confession of whom he lusteth thorow out all hys dioses. Ye and hys chaunceler commaundeth the gostly father to delyver it written. The Pope / his Cardinals and Bisshopes know the confession of the Emperour kynges and of all lordes. And by confessiō they know all their captives. Yf any beleve in Christe / by confession they know hym.

Shrive thy selfe where thou wilt / whether at sion charterhousse or at the observauntes thy confesson is knowen well ynough. And thou / yf thou beleve in Christe / arte wayted apon. Wonderfull are the thinges that therby are wrought. The wife is feared and cō
               pelled to vtter not hir awne only but also the secrettes of hir husbande and the servaunte the secretes of his master. Besydes that thorow confession the quench the fayth of all the promises of God and take awaye the effecte & vertue of all ye sacramētes of Christe
            They have also corrupte the sayntes lyves with lyes and fayned myracles and have put many thinges out of the sentence or great curse / as reysinge of rente and fines & hyringe men out of their houses / and what soever wekednes they them selves doo and have put a greate parte of the stories and cronycles out of ye waye lest their falsheed shulde besene. For there is no myscheve or disorder / whether it be in the temperall regimēte or else in the spirituall where of they are not the chefe causes and even the very founteyne & springes & as we saye / the well heed so that it is impossible to preach agēste any mischeve excepte thou begynne at them or to sette any reformacion in the worlde excepte thou reforme them fyrst. Now are they indurate & tough as Pharao & will not bow vnto any ryghte waie or ordre. And therfore

persecute they Gods worde and the preachers therof / and on the other syde lye awayte vnto all princes and stere vp all misheve in the worlde and sende them to warre and occupie their myndes there with or with other voluptuosnes / lest they shuld have leyser to heare the worde of God and to sette an order in their realmes.
            By thē is all thynge ministerd and by thē are all kynges ruled: yee in every kynges cō
               science sit they yer he be kynge and persuade every kynge what they lust and make thē both to beleve what they will & to doo what they will. Nether can any kynge or any realme have rest for their busynesses. Beholde kynge Henry the fyft whom they sente out for soch a purpose as they sente out oure kynke that now is. Se how the Realme is inhabited. Axe where the goodly townes and their walles and the people that was wonte to be in thē are become & where the bloud ryall of the realme is become also. Turne thyne eyes whither thow wilte & thou shalt se no thinge prosperous but their sotle pollynge. With that it is flowinge water: yee & I trust it wilbe shortly a full see.
            In all their doinges though they pretēde outwardly ye honoure of God or a comē wealth / their entente and secret councell is only to brynge all vnder their power ād to take out of the waye whosoever letteth them

or is to myghty for them. As when they sende the princes to Hierusalem to conquere the holy londe and to fyghte agenst the Turkes. What so ever they pretende outwardly their secret entēte is / while the princes there conquere them moare bysshoperikes / to conquere their landes in the meane season with their false ypocresy and to bringe all vnder them / which thou maist easely perceave by that they will not let vs know the sayth of Christe. And whē they are ones on hye / then are they tyrauntes a bove all tyrauntes / whether they be turkes or saracenes. How minister they provinge of testamētes? How causes of wedlocke? or yf any man dye intestate? Yf a pore mā dye and leave his wife and halfe a dosen younge childern and but one cow to fynde them / that will they have for a mortuary mercylesse: let come of wife and childern what will. Yee let any thinge be done agenst their pleasure and they w

            Reade the cronycles of Englōde (out of which yet they have put a greate parte of their wekednisse) and thou shalt fynde them all wayes both tebellious & disobediente to the kynges & also churlysh & vnthākefull / so that / whē all ye realme gave the kynge some what to mayntene hym in his ryghte / they wolde not geve a myte. Cōsidre the story of

kynge Iohn / where I doute not but they have put the best and fayrest for thē selves and the worst of kīge Iohn / For I suppose they make the cronycles them selves. Compare the doinges there of holy church (as they ever call it) vnto the lernynge of Christe and of his Apostles. Did not the legate of Rome assoyle all the lordes of the realme of their due obedience which they oughte to the kynge by the ordinaunce of God? wolde he not have cursed the kynge with his solemne pompe / because he wolde have done that office which God commaundeth every kynge to doo and wherfore God hath put the swerde in every kynges hande? that is to wete / because kynge Iohn wolde have punished a weked clerke that had coynned false money The laye mē that had not done halfe so greate fautes must dye / but the clerke must goo scapfre. Sēt not the Pope also vnto the kynge of France remission of his synnes to goo and cōquere kynge Ihons realme. So now remission of synnes cometh not by fayth in the testamēte yt God hath made in Christes bloude: but by fyghtinge & murtheringe for the popes pleasure. Last of all was not kinge Iohn fayne to delyver his crowne vnto the legate & to yeld vp his realme vnto ye Pope / wherfore we paye Peter pēce. They myght be called ye pollinge pēce of false prophetes well ynough. They care not by what myscheve

the come by their purpose. Warre ād conqueringe of lādes is their hervest. The wekeder the people are the moare they have the ypocrites in reverēce / the moare they feare thē and the moare they beleve in thē. And they that conquere other mens lādes / whē they dye / make thē their heyres / to be prayed fore for ever. Let there come one cōquest moare in the realme / and thou shalt se thē gete yet as moch moare as they have (yf they can kepe downe Gods worde that their iuggulinge come not to lyghte) yee thou shalt se them take the realme hole in to their handes and crowne one of thē selves kynge thereof. And veryly I se no other lykelyhode / but that the lond shalbe shortly conquered. The starres of the scripture promyse vs none other fortune / in as moch as we denye Christ with the weked Iewes and will not have hym regne over vs: but wilbe styll childern of darknes vnder Antichrist ād Antichristes possession / burnynge the Gospell of Christ and defēdynge a fayth that may not stond with his holy testament.
            Yf any man shede bloud in the church / it shalbe interdited / tyll he have payd for the halowīge. Yf he be not able the parysh must paye or else shal it stonde all wayes interdited. They wilbe avenged on them that never offended. Full wel prophesied of them Paul in ye secōde pistle to Timothe. iij.

Some man will saye / woldest thou that mē shulde fight in the chruch vnpunished? Nay but let the kinge ordeyne a punishmente for them / as he doeth for them that fyght in his palace and let not all the parish be troubled for ons faute. And as for their halowīge is the iuggelinge of Antichrist. A Christē mā is the temple of God and of the holy goost / and halowed in Christes bloud. A Christen mā is holy in him selfe by reason of the sprite that dwelleth in hym and the place wherein he is / is holy be reason of hym / whether he be in ye felde or towne. A christē husbande sanctifieth an vnchristen wife and a christen wife an vnchristen husbande (as concernynge the vse of matrimony) sayth Paul to the Corinthians. Yf now whyle we seke to be halowed in Christ / we are founde vnwholy ād must be halowed by the grounde or place or walles / then died Christ in vayne. How be it Antychrist must have where with to sitte in mens consciences ād to make them feare where is no feare and to robbe them of their fayth and to make them trust in that can not helpe them / and to seke holynes of that which is not holy in it selfe.
            After that the olde kynge of ffraunce was brought downe out of Italy / marke what pageauntes have be played and what are yet a playenge to seperate vs from the

Emperoure (lest by the helpe or ayde of vs he shulde be able to recover his ryght of the Pope) and to couple vs to the French men whose myght the Pope ever abvseth to kepe the Emperoure from Italy. What prevayleth it for any kynge to mary his doughter or hys sonne or to make any peace or good ordinaunce for the wealth of his Realme? For it shall no lenger last then it is profitable to them. Their treason is so secret that the worlde can not perceave it. They dissimill those thinges which they are only cause of and simyll discorde amonge them selves when they are most agreed. One shall holde this and a nother shal dispute the contrary: But the conclusion shalbe that most maynteyneth their falsheed / though Gods worde be never so contrary. What have they wrought in oure dayes / ye and what worke the yet / to the perpetuall dishonoure of the kinge and rebuke of the Realme ād shame of all the nacion in what so ever Realmes they goo?
            I vttered vnto you partly the malicious blindnes of the Bisshope of Rochester / his iuggelinge his conveyenge / his foxy wilenes / his bo
                  •
               epe / his wrestynge / rentinge and shamfull abvsinge of the scripture / his oratory and alleginge of heretikes and how he wolde make the Apostles auctours of blynde cerimonies without significacion

cōtrary to their awne doctrine / & have set him for an ensample to iudge all other by. What so ever thou art that readest this. I exorte the in Christ / to cōpare his sermō and that which I have written and the scripture together & iudge. There shalte thou fynde of oure holy fathers auctorite / ād what it is to be greate ād how to know the greatest.
            Thē foloweth ye cause why laye mē cā not rule temperall offices which is the falsheed of the Bisshopes. There shalt thou fynde of miracles and cerimonyes without significacion / of false annoyntynge and lyenge signes and false names ād how the spiritualte are disgised in falsheed / and how they rowle the people in darknes & do all thinge in the latine tōge ād of their pety pyllage / Their pollinge is like a sokynge consumciō where in a mā complayneth of feblenes ād of fayntynes and wotteth not whence his discease cometh: it is lyke a pocke that freateth inwarde and consumeth the very mary of the bones.
            There seyst thou the cause why it is impossible for kynges to come to the knowleage of the trouth. For the sprites laye awayte for them and serve their appetites at all poyntes and thorow confession by and sell and betraye both them / and all their true frendes and laye beytes for them and never leve them tyll they have blynded them

with their sophistry and have broughte them in to their nettes. And then when the kynge is captive they compell all the rest with violence of his swerde. For yf any mā will not obeye them be it ryght or wronge they cyte hym / suspende him and curse or excomunicate hym. Yf he then obey not they delyver him to Pilate / that is to saye / vnto the temporall officers to destroye him. Last of all there fyndest thou the very cause of all persecucion / which is the preachinge agenst ypocrisy.
            Then come we to the sacramentes / where thou seyst that the worke of the sacramente saveth not / but the fayth in the promyse which the sacramente signyfieth iustifieth vs only. There hast thou that a prest is but a servaunte to teach only and what so ever he taketh apon hym moare then to preach and to mynister the sacramentes of Christ (which is also preachinge) is falsheed.
            Then cometh how they iuggle thorow dome ceremonyes and how they make marchaundice with fayned wordes / penaunce / a pena et a culpa / satisfaccion / attricion / character / purgatory pyckepurse and how thorow cōfession they make the sacramētes and all the promise of none effecte or valve. There seist thou yt absoluinge is but preachinge the promises ād cursinge

or excommunicatinge preachinge the law / and of their power / and of their keyes / of false miracles and of prayenge to sayntes. There seist thou that cerimonies did not the miracles but fayth: evē as it was not Moses rodde that did the miracles but Moses fayth in the promise of God. Thou seist also that to have a fayth where God hath not a promyse is ydolatrye. And there also seist thou how the Pope exalteth him selfe above God ād commaundeth him to obeye his tyranny. Last of all thou hast there that no man ought to preach but he that is called.
            Then foloweth the bely brotherheed of monkes and freres. For Christ hath deserved nought with them. For his sake gettest thou no favoure. Thou must offer vnto their belyes and then the praye bitterly for the. There seist thou that Christ is the only cause: yee ād all the cause why God doeth ought for vs and heareth oure complaynte. And there hast thou doctrine how to know and to be sure that thou arte electe & hast Gods sprite in the. And hast there lernynge to trye the doctrine of oure spirites.
            Thē folow the foure senses of the scripture of which thre are no senses ād the fourth that is to wete the literall sence which is the very sence hath the Pope taken to hym selfe. It maye have no other meanynge then as it pleaseth his fatherhode. We must abyde

his interpretaciō. And as his belles tynke so must we thinke / though it be impos
                  •
               ible to gather any soch meanynge of the scripture. Then hast thou the very vse of allegoryes and how they are nothinge but ensamples borowed of the scripture to expresse a texte or an open conclusion of the scripture & as it were to paynte it before thyne eyes / that thou maist feale the meaninge and the power of the scripture in thine herte. Then cometh the vse of worldly similitudes / and how they are false prophetes which bringe a worldly similitude for any other purpose / save to expresse moare playnly that which is cōteyned in an opē texte. And so are they also which draw the scripture cōtrary to the open places and contrary to the ensample lyvinge ād practisinge of Christ / the Apostles and of the holy Prophetes. And then finally hast thou of oure holy fathers power and of his keyes and of his byndinge and excomunicatinge and of his cursynge and blessinge with ensamples of every thinge.
