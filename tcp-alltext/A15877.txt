So that oftētymes for because of ye perfait perfeccion & vnite of the persone / those thinges whiche onely belonge vnto the godhed be attrybuted vnto the manhed: & those that pertayne vnto the manhed be spoken of the godhed. He sayde hymselfe to be the sone of man descended from heauen, when yet his bodye had neuer ben there. And Peter sayth yt christ suffred death for vs whē it was onely his manhed that suffred it,Ion̄. vi. But because of the inseperable vnite of the

persone / it is sayde verely. That the sone of god had suffred / & the sone of man forgaue synnes. For euen Christe whiche is the sone of god and man one persone / as concernīge the propertie of his diuine nature and godhed / forgyueth synnes, As whē we saye / this man is wyse / whiche consisteth of bodye and soule / but as concerning his body / there is no wysdome in it at all / but his bodye is rather poyson and impediment both vnto wysdome knowledge and all vnderstanding. Agayne / we saye the same man to be woūded / whē only it is his body that may receyue the wounde / and the soule can not be towched. Because of this maner of speche / yet noman sayth that two ꝑsones be made of one man, when thus (as ye maye se) vnto eyther parte in man his owne propertye be referred and attributed / neyther can they say that both ye natures / that is to wytte the bodye and soule be both mixte & confounded togyther / when that thyng is spokē by the hole man because of the vnyte of the parsone / whiche because of the propertye of the one parte alone / parteyneth but to the one part. Paul sayth, whē I am syke / then am I most strong. Vvho is here syke: Paul. And who is it that is also so stronge▪ Paul. But is not here great repugnance

and contradiction in Paule to be both syke▪ and hole / both at once? No verely. For Paule though he be but one parsone, yet is he of two natures. Vvherfore▪ when he sayth I am syke, verely the same persone speaketh which is Paul: but that same syknes is not appropriated vnto both his natures, but onely vnto his body. And where he sayth also. I am stronge, albeit the parson of Paule speke it, yet is it his soule onely whiche is in the syknes of his body so stronge. So we say the sone of God is deade, euen the very same which for that so perfyte vnite of his persone is both god and man, but yet as concerning onely his humanite and manhed, he dyed. Thus, not I alone do beleue, but so dyd all the catholyke faythfull both olde & newe beleue bothe of the Godhed, of the persones and humane nature taken and assumpte of the sone of god oure sauyoure Christe. And thus beleue they that now professe & aknowlege the truth vnfaynedly.

               ¶ The .v. article.
               Fyfthlie, hereby it is manifeste that yf we be restored in Christ the secōde Adam vnto lyfe as we were gyuen ouer in the fyrste Adam vnto death, that then be we to fole hardye to dampne any chyldren borne of christen parē
                  tes, yea or yet the heathen mennes chyldren (thoughe they dye without baptisme or cyrcū
                  cision) for yf Adam were able to lese all mankynde

by one synne, & christ by his deth hath not reuyued and redemed all mankynde frō that plage gyuen thorughe Adam, then was there not lyke health gyuen throughe christe neyther can it be lyke trewe (whiche God forbyd) that as in Adam all were dead, euen fo in christ all be restored to lyfe. But howe so euer men diffyne of the chyldren of the infydeles: thus verely do we constantly affirme through the vertue & power of the health gyuen by christ, that they pronoūce and speake without the boke: whiche iudge thē to be dāpned standyng both the sayd cause of our reparacion, & also the fre election of god: whiche election foloweth not fayth, but fayth foloweth thelection. Of whiche thynge we shall treate in tharticle folowynge. For who so are elect of euerlastīge, are elect doubteles before theyr fayth. They ought not therfore to be so temerariously dampned of vs, whiche yet for lacke of age haue not fayth. For although as yet they haue not fayth, yet is the election of god hyd from vs, with whō yf they be electe, we be to hasty to iudge yt we knowe not. But as touchynge the infantes of the christen mē we diffyne otherwyse. That is thus. The infantes of the christē people are of the churche and of the people of god, partes and mēbres

of his cōgregacion. Vvhiche thynge thus we proue. It is promysed by the testymonies all moste of all the prophetes, that the church of the gentyles shuld be gathered togyther and vnyte vnto the church of the people of God, And Christe hymselfe sayd they shulde come from the easte & weast and syt downe to eate with the God of Abraham Isaac & Iacob.Mathe. viii.

It is therfore vndoubted suer hym to be the chosen chylde of God that thus is assured and perswaded of the spyrite, for they that beleue are ordayned and predestined vnto lyfe euerlastīge.

Vvherfore verelye / aswell doth baptisme as circumcission (we speke of the sacramente of baptisme) nothynge els require then the one of these two either the aknowlegīge or name gyuyng, or

For after them, he that receiueth this grace by the sacramētes, either he himselfe prepareth hym selfe, or els is he prepared of the spirit
                     •
                  , yf he prepare hym selfe, then may we of our selues do that same thynge whiche grace goyng before (which they call gracia preueniēs) shulde do, & so is gracia preueniēs put out of office.The sacramentes represent the analogy of the thynge īuisibly done by the spirite. If he be prepared of the spirit to receyue this grace, then I aske whether this be done by the inducynge of the sacrament or withoute the sacrament, yf it be done by the meanes of the sacrament, thē must man be prepared vnto one sacrament by another, and so shall we neuer come to the fyrst sacramēt but procede into infinite sacramentes, for no man can be (after this wayes) prepared to a sacramente withoute another former sacrament, & yf we be withoute a sacramēt prepared vnto the receyuyng of the sacramentall grace thē must the spirite be present with his benygne grace before the sacrament be gyuen and grace receyued before the sacramēt be mynistred. Of whiche we gather (whiche thynge I do gladlye

admytte in the sacramētes) that the sacramentes be gyuen into an open testimonie of that pryuate grace whiche is fyrst present in euery priuate man.Sacramentes are testimonies, by whiche we shew vs to the churche to haue receyued forgyuenes of our synnes. So is baptisme gyuen before the congregacion, vnto hym whiche before he receyue the sacrament either he cōfessed the relygion of Christe, or els he hath the worde of promyse wherby it is knowne, hym to pertayne vnto the churche. And for this cause, when we baptise one waxen, we aske hym whyther he beleueth. And yf he answere ye, then he receyueth baptisme. Vvherfore it is playne that he had fayth or he receiued the sacramēt of baptisme. And thus it appereth manyfest that fayth is not gyuē by baptisme And yf an infante be offred to be christined, it is asked whyther his parentes offer hym to be baptised, & when they answere by the wytnesses that so is theyr wyll: then is the chylde baptyzed. Vvhere it is playne yt the promyse of God preceded (wherby they be rekened to be of the church as well as thynfantes of the Hebrwes. For when these men whiche are of the churche offer theyr infantes, they presēte thē because they be christen mennes chyldren and so rekened by the promyse of god to be amonge the mēbres of the churche. By baptisme therfore the church openly receyueth hym

whiche was fyrst receiued by grace, wherfore baptisme bringeth not grace, but it testyfieth to the churche that grace is gyuen before to hym yt is baptized. I beleue therfore (oh Ceasar) the sacramēt to be ye sygnificacion of an holy thīge, euen of grace & forgiuenes before graūted vs. I beleue yt visible figure or forme of baptisme, that is to say, that visible exemple to be ye forme of that inuisible grace whiche is made and gyuē by the benefyte of god, which example representeth in a maner a certayne analogie and proporcion of the thyng done by the spirite,The sacramē
                     
                        •
                     s represēt the analogie of the thynge inuisiblye done by the spirite. I beleue the sacramēt to be an open testimonye. As when we be baptized, the body is wasshed with the moste clene Element, but by this it is sygnified, that we, by the fauourable & gracious goodnes of God are receyued into the feloweshyp of the churche and people of god, amōge whom we professe to lyue puerly and innocētly. Thus doth Paule expounde this sacrament & mysterie of baptisme. Ro. vi. Vvherfore, the persone nowe baptized, testifyeth hymselfe to be of the churche of god, whiche must nowe worshyp his lorde god in thyntegrite of fayth, & in pure lyuyng. And for this cause, the sacramentes, whiche are holye ceremonies (for the worde cōmeth vnto the element, and the Sacramēt

is done or made (are religiously to be reuerēted, that is, to be had in hyghe estimacion, & entreted honorablye. For albeit they may not make & gyue grace, yet do they associat vs vysiblie vnto the churche, into whiche before we were inuysibly receyued. Vvhiche thynge as it is pronounced and promulged togyther with the wordes of Gods promyse in the action of the wordes and sacrament so is it with hyghe relygion, feare, and reuerence to be honoured. For yf we shuld any otherwyse thynke and beleue of the sacramentes: that is to wyt, that they outwardly adhibited and admoued, shulde pourge vs within, then were there nowe cōmen agayne amonge vs the very Iudaisme & ryte of relygion of the Iewes. Which by theyr dyuerse & manyfolde vnctions, oyntmentes, oblacions, washyngꝭ brente sacryfices, and banketes before theyr aulters and images, beleued theyr synnes to be pourged, and grace (as it were) boughte & goten. Whiche thynge the prophetes, especyallye Isay and Ieremy, dyd alwayes moste cōstantly entreat and confute: teaching, that the promises and benefyts, as grace and forgyuynes were gyuen by the mere mercy & lyberalite of god: and not for the desertes & merytes of any outwarde ceremony. Also I

beleue, these catabaptistes, in that they deny the infantes of the faythfull theyr baptisme, shamfully to erre, & not onely in this poynte, but also in many other, whiche there is nowe no tyme nor place to speke of. Agaynst whō with great perell, but yet with gretter healpe of god, I my selfe fyrst dyd both teache, preche and wryte, that men myght the soner and better auoyd both theyr folisshnes and malyce. So that nowe, throughe the goodnes of God that contagiō is greatly remytted and swaged amonge our nacion. So far of is it, that I at any tyme receyued ought of yt sedicious faction, either preached it or defēded it.
            
            
               ¶ The .viii. article.
               Eyghtly, I beleue that in the holy Supper of thankes gyuyng,Of the holy supper of the lord. the very body of Christe is presente at the eyes and contemplacion of oure fayth. That is to wyt, that they whiche gyue thākes vnto the Lorde for that benefyt gyuē vs in his sone, aknowlege hym to haue had taken vnto hym very manhed, in it verelye to haue suffered, and verelye to haue had wasshen awaye our synnes in his bloud, and so euery thynge done by Christe to be as it were present vnto them at the eye and contē
                  placion of theyr fayth. But that the very naturall bodye of Christe eyther shulde be essencially

corporally and really in the supper, or eaten with our mouthes & teeth in the forme of breade as the papistes dreame or in the breade as som men imagen, which yet sytte & loke bak vnto, & for the pottes full of fleshe oute of Egipte. This we do not onely deny, but we affyrme it constantly to be an errour whiche is playne against the worde of God. Vvhiche thynge by gods helpe (moste noble Emperour) I shall make it as cleare in fewe wordes vnto youre Maiestie as the sonne.
               Fyrste bringyng for me the worde of god, secondarely, pressynge as it were with engynnes vnable to be resisted agaynst our aduersaries: that is, with argumētes taken & groū
                  ded of the scriptures. And laste of all declarynge the olde diuynes to haue euer ben in this same our sentence. Thou therfore in the meane tyme (oh holy spirit the creator) be present, and illumyne the myndes of thyne, fyll the brestes whō thou haste created with grace and lyghte. Christe hymselfe the mouth and wysdome of the father God almyghtie thus sayth.Ioā. xvi Pore men shall ye euer haue with you but me shall ye not haue alwayes. Here is onely the presēce of his body denyed to be euer with vs: but as touchynge his godhed he is euer presente with vs. For so is he euer euery

where accordyng to his other saying, I wyll be with you vntyll the worldes ende,Mathe. the last, that is as touchyng his godly power and goodnes. Austen is of this our sentēce in his .l. tretyse vpon Ihon. Nether can our aduersaries by any cauyllacion proue ye humanite and manhed of christ to be where soeuer is his godhed, or els to saye that his person shulde be deuyded, for so to saye, were to take awaye the very manhed of Christe, for nothynge maye be euery where but the godhed. The manhed to be in one place & the godhed euery where, doth not deuyde the person, nomore then the sone to haue assumpted the manhed, deuideth not the vnite of the essence. Yea it shulde be more able to seperate the vnite of thessence, whyle one person adsumeth vnto hym a creature, whiche the other in nowyse take not, then the humanite to be in one place and the diuynite euerye where shulde deuyde the person: when euen in the creatures we see the bodyes to be bounde to one place, and yet theyr power and vertue to be spred excedyngly wyde. As is an ensāple in the sonne whose bodye is but in one place, and yet is his vertue and powre stretched ouer all places.
               And the mynde of man wrandreth euen aboue the starres and sercheth the depest of the

earth, whyle his body is but in one lytle place Agayne yet sayth christ, yet agayne I leaue the worlde & I go to the father. Here is this worde, LEAVe, as before was this worde, HAVE / so that our aduersaries can not say and glose it out addyng we haue hym not visiblye. For when he spake a lytle before of the visyble subtraction and withdrawyng of his bodye, he sayd thus, for a lytle whyle ye shall not se me, &c. who wolde here contēde of this sayinge (ye shall not se me) his bodye to be present, but yet inuysible? verelye none, excepte suche as wolde iugle with his sayinges and his presence and absence bodely. Vvherfore shulde he fle mennes syght which wolde be here, and shewed hymselfe so ofte vnto his disciples after his resurrection / But it is expedient (sayth he) that I go my waye.Iohan. xvi. But and yf he were here styll, it shuld not be expedient that we shulde not se hym, syth as ofte as his disciples doubted of his bodely presēce he exhibited and offerd hymselfe manyfestly that neither sense nor mynde shuld not suffre any lacke of hym nor he diceyued, but fully and certainly adsuered of his presence, hymselfe sayinge vnto them: fele and touche me, and feare not. For it is I my very selfe. And vnto Mary he sayd. Touche me not. Albeit

he shewed hymselfe to her visibyle. And whē he was nowe goynge hence and shulde commende his disciples vnto his father he sayd.the text hath pusillum,, for post 
                        •
                     ac. After this tyme I shall not be in the worlde. Here is a verbe substantyue, after this I am not in the worlde, as well as is in these wordes. This is my bodye. So that nother here can our aduersaries say, that there can be no trope, whiche denye that verbe substantyues maye receyue any trope. But the thynge it selfe nedeth no suche euasiōs, for it foloweth But these are in the worlde, whiche Antithesis and contraposicion teacheth playnelye, hymselfe as concernyng his manhed, not to be in the worlde after that his disciples shuld be in it. And to knowe whē he went his way (not as they rather fayne & lye expoūdynge it that he shuld but make hymselfe inuisible) thus sayth Luke.Luke the last. And when he shulde take his leue at them: he wente his waye from them & was taken pv into heauen. He sayth not, he vanysshed out of theyr syghtes or made hīselfe inuisible. Of which thynge Marke thus wryteth. The Lorde after that he hadde spoken vnto them: he was taken vp into heauen, and sytteth on the ryght hande of God: he saythe not he taryed here styll, and made his body inuisible, agayne, Luke in the actes

when he had sayde these thynges, they beholdynge hym, he was borne vp and eleuated, and the cloude toke hym oute of theyr syght.Actes, i. The cloude couered hym, which cloud it had ben no nede of, yf he had but onely haue had withdrawne the syghte of hymselfe and so to haue had ben here styll presente onely inuisible, neyther had it haue ben neade to haue so ben borne vp and eleuated. And euen there in the same place, it is wrytten. This same Iesus whiche is taken vp from you into heauen euen thus shall he come, as ye haue sene hym go hēce into heauen. Vvhat can be more clere & manifest then these wordes? Frō you (saith he) he is taken vp, wherfore he can not se styl with them after his manhed, nother visiblye nor inuisibly. But whē we shall se hym come agayne, euen as he thus went his waye, then shall we knowe hym to be presente in dede both bodely and visibly. But so longe as he thus yet come not agayne, we muste nedes beleue that as concernynge his humayne nature, that is his māhed, he sitteth on the right hande of the Father vntyll he come agayne to iudge the lyuynge and the deade.
               And as for them that denye Christes bodye to haue a place, sayinge that it is not in any place / let thē loke howe openly they go blīdfolde

agaynste the truthe. For he was in the kryb, vpon the crosse, and in Hierusalem whē his parentes sought hym, in the sepulcre, and without the sepulcre, for the aungell sayd, he is rysen, he is not here, behold the place where they had layd hym. And yet leaste they wyll saye, his body to be euery where, let thē heare this. The dores shutte, Iesus came & stode amonge them, what nede were it for a bodye to come and to go from place to place, that is in all places? what nede was it for hym to saye I shall go before you into Galile syth his body was there already, yf suche a body shulde be euery where, & that but inuisiblye? He shuld haue left out these wordes, he came and I shall go before you, and haue sayd, I beynge euery where presente wyll shewe my selfe visible here & there, &c. But awaye with these tedious sophisticall vanites, which take awaye from vs the verite, both of the humanite of Christe, and also of holye Scripture. These testimonies proue euydently christes body to be nowhere present but in heauen to speake orderly and ryghte accordynge to the scriptures of the nature & properte of the bodye of christe adsumpt & taken vnto the person. And as touchyng the conferēce of scriptures that apere contrarye, what soeuer they

tell vs of the myraculouse powre of god, yet oughte we neuer so to wreste them, to make vs beleue that God doth any thyng cōtrary to his owne worde, for that were his impetē
                  cye agaynst his power & not with his power. Also, that the naturall bodye of Christe is not eaten with our mouth, himselfe declareth it when he sayd (the Iewes stryuynge & murmurīge vpon the bodely eatyng of his fleshe) The flesh, whose eatyng ye mysse vnderstād profytethe nothynge at al,Onely the spirite gendreth spirituall thynges. that is to eate it naturally, but to eate it spiritually by fayth it ꝓfyteth moche for it gyueth lyfe. Vvhat soeuer is borne of fleshe, it is but fleshe, & what is borne of the spirite, is spirite. Nowe yf the naturall bodye of Christe be eaten with oure mouth, what els but fleshe is it that cōmeth of that naturall fleshe so eaten / & least this argumēt seme but lyght to some mē, let vs heare the tother parte, what so euer is borne of ye spirite, is spirite: ergo what soeuer is spirite, it must be borne of the spirite: yf thē the fleshe of christ be so holsom and suche saluacion vnto the soule, it must nedes be eaten spiritually and not carnally, that is to say with fayth and not with oure teth. And this pertayneth vnto the matter & substāce of the sacramētes that the spirite is begotē by the spirite, & not

by any bodely thynge, as we touched it before. Paule warneth vs of this thīge in that he sayth.ii. Cor. v. Albeit he knewe christ somtyme after the fleshe, yet nowe he knoweth hym nomore concernyng the fleshe. By these places we are cōstrayned to confesse, that these wordes. This is my bodye, must nedes be taken not naturally but sygnificatiuelye sacramē
                  tallye & in sygne as are these. This is the pasouer or passynge fore bye: spokē of the pascall lambe. For that same lambe so eaten yearly in that solempne feste holden, was not the selfe passynge foreby, but it dyd sygnify that passage and oyntynge of the Hebrews somtyme done. Vnto this agreith well, the succession & imitacion, for the supper succeded the lambe. Vvhiche thynge teacheth & warneth vs that Christe dyd vse lyke wordes in a lyke phrase, for the succession obserueth the imitacion. Vnto this agreeth the selfe same cōposicion and ordre of the wordes, the tyme also speaketh & cōsenteth to the same & maketh all for it, so the olde passouer is but remembred and the newe thankes gyuyng is instituted, also the very propertie of all the memorialles and remembraunces, all make for this same sence, whiche callyng them the name of the same thynge wherof they make the

memoriall or remēbraunce. So dyd the Athenienses call thalleuacion or the easmente of theyr cōmon dette, not as though yerely their dettes shuld be eased or paid: but because thei celebrated that thynge perpetually that Solon had in tyme past made, and the selfe same celebracion or feaste they orned and honested with the name of the selfe thynge. And euen so the thynges whiche are the sygnes and memorials of the verye body & bloude of christe are called his bodye and bloude. Now here foloweth argumētes. Lyke as the body can not be fed with any spirituall thīge, nomore can the soule be fed with any bodely thyng. But and yf the naturall body of christe be eaten, thē I wolde wyt whither it fede the bodye or the soule, it fedeth not ye bodye / ergo it fedeth the soule / yf it then fedeth the soule, thē doth the soule eate fleshe, and so is it false that the spirite is borne onely of the spirite. Secondarely I aske, what thynge is it, that the body of christ naturally eaten, maketh it perfyt effectuously / If it remytteth syn as one parte wytnesseth, ergo the disciples got remission of theyr synnes by eatynge it in the maūdye: and then christe dyed for them in vayne But yf his bodye eatē dispenseth and distributeth the vertue of Christes passion,One & the s

And yf it fedeth the bodye that it shuld be healed to ryse agayne (as a certayne other māfull folisshly affyrmeth) then moche more shulde it heale our bodye & lyfte it vp agayne from syknes. But Ireneus otherwyse vnderstandeth this sentence, yt is to wyt, our bodyes to be fed & nourysshed with the body of christe to ryse agayn deifyed vnto lyfe. For his myndes, that the hope of our lyfe to come & resurrection, is stablyshed by the resurrection of christe, beholde this faier maner of speche. Thyrdly, yf the naturall body of christi was gyuē the disciples at his supper: then must it nedes folowe that they eate it euen as it thē was theyr beyng and lyuynge: but then was it a passible and a body that myght suffre / wherfore they eate a body that myght be wounded and suffer death,A preuē

But yet when they saye, that they eate the same body, but not as it was passible, but euen suche one as shuld be after his resurrection: then obiect we thus: ergo Christe had then two bodyes at once, one that was not yet glorifyed by his death & resurrection, and another that shuld be gloryfied: or els was that same one selfe

bodye at the same tyme both passible and impassible. And so syth in his agony his māhed feared the death, it might be gathered that he suffered not, but that the body endewed with this gyfte of impassibilyte, vsed and enioyed it. Vvherfore it maye be thought that it suffered not, but apered to haue had suffred deth, which opinyon of these blynde sophisters opē vs the waye vnto Marcions heresye.

For in the Maister of the Sentences and in the olde wrytten bokes and in the decrees canonycall out of whiche the prynte was fetched and this sentence of S.

For christ forbode not Mary mawdelen to powre forth her oyntmente vpon hym althoughe the couetousnes and infydelite of Iudas dyd swell agaynste it proudlye. But the Images whiche stande forth to be worshypped, I reaken them not amonge these ceremonies,Images where perell is lest they be worshypped oughte to be taken awaye. but to be of the noumbre of those thynges whiche dyrectlye fyght agaynst the worde of god. But suche as are not setforth to be worshipped, or where there is no perell that they shulde in tyme to come be worshypped, so farre of am I that I wold dampne them, that I aknowlege that science and crafte in paintyng and karuynge to be the verye gyftes of God.
