            Ad fratrem de Insignibus
suis Epigramma.
            AMhigo, cur bicolor nostrae Leo stirpis alūnus!
            Bestia cur, frater, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                tua est!
            Num quia purpurei nostrum sit stemma reatus
            Expers, suspiciens candida, nigra premens?
            Num quia conueniant, Insignia dissona, in vnum
            Tam genus Austrinū, quam Boreale genus?
            Vel quia Caucaseo similem de monte Leonem
            Prostrarit dextro vis proauitae Ioue?
            Forte Molorchaeus leo talis ab Hercule cesus;
            Talis natus erat Maenaliisque plagis.
            Sed quî sit nostrum, seu qua ratione colorent
            Parte priore album, posteriore nigrum:
            Causa latet, Let he mysteria tanta colorum
            Abluit, haec centum noscere lustra vetant.
            Macte Leone tamen, frater charissime, macte
            (Stemmate Kiffini) Thermodoonte tuo.
         
         
            
            To the Right worshipfull,
my louing brother, Sir Iohn
Vaughan of Goldengroue,
Knight.
            
               CAto of Vtica (as
Plutarch writeth) being
demaunded whom
he loued best, answered,
his brother then
the other still continuing to aske
him, and who next, he likewise answered,
his brother. And so againe
the third time, he answered,
his brother. Thrice in like sort
was I ask'd, & yet vnask'd, ask'd of
my selfe, though vnask'd of others,
whether to one or three I would
dedicate this my threefold booke.

To this my self vnto my self made
answere: to whō more fitly should
I dedicate my first booke treating
of Vertue, then to my vertuous
brother? to whom my second of a
Familie, then to my familiar brother?
to whō my third of Ciuility,
then to my ciuil brother? The consideration
of which points (deare
brother) moued me to present vnto
you alone, and not to three this
Groue of mine, cōformed as nere
as I could, like vnto that golden
groue of the ancient Hesperides.
VVherein I could be said to imitate,
the Philosopher Athenodorus,
who parted with his elder brother
Zeno all his goods, & gaue
vnto him the one half, for what is
more agreeable to nature, thē that

one brother should to his power
reciprocally aid another? & what
more prodigious, thē that one brother
should bee a wolfe vnto another?
this plainly and wisely was
specified by the Greeke poet Euripides,
who said: questionlesse he
that loueth not his brother, loueth
neither him, that begat him, nor
her, that hare. And againe confirmed
by Antigone in Sophocles:
I must (quoth she) loue my brother
better then my sonne, by reason
that hereafter I may very well
haue more sonnes, but, my father
& mother being both dead, neuer
more brethren. Standing, I say,
vpon these termes, & hammering
in my mind on the anuill of our mutuall
loue, I thought it part of my
duty to impart vnto you the iust

halfe of my substāce, nay, in a maner
all my substance, desiring you
withall, that, euē as a skilful Geometriciā
at the games of Olympus
by the bignesse of Hercules foot
gessed of the stature of his whole
body: so by the outward view of
this my triple treatise, you will
measure the willingnesse of mine
inward mind. As for barking sycophants
and enuious caitifes, to
whose controlling check the very
best of all scholers haue bene subiect,
I passe not for them, namely,
let them make tennis balles of my
bookes, yea, and bandy them quite
away, if they can▪ Onely this is my
wish at this present, that you, most
louing brother, will diligently peruse
thē ouer, & shelter thē vnder

the vaile of your fauourable censure.
Almighty God (that I may
now ende) giue you your hearts
Christian contentment, while as a
Pilgrime you remaine in this
earthly groue, & make your mind
pliable and ready for the contemplation
of that golden and euerlasting
Groue prepared for the
Godly in the world to come. Frō
Iesus Colledge in Oxford.
            
               Your louing brother,
William Vaughan.
            
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               GEntle Reader, my two
yeeres silence since the edition
of my last Latine
poems argueth me in thy
censure, eyther to haue ouerslept
my selfe with Epimenides, or to
haue plaid the micher amongst the obscure
Antipodes. Which inconueniences
(I confesse) the worldes ingratitude,
being a great discouragement, and the
burthen of my professiō, a necessary imployment,
made me with diligent care to
attend another Cynosure, by which the
course of my studies might be directed.
In consideration whereof fearing some
patent of concealement I breake forth
at length, and am come to plead mine
own tenure in a more familiar language.
And this I do, aswell because euery one
may perfectly know my meaning, as
that I might craue pardon of mine auditory,
if either I goe awrie, or chaunce to
trip, no mā goeth so vpright, but he may
by some casualty or other kisse the
ground. It is a good horse, that neuer
stūbleth. Erre I may in writing, but it is
thy part (courteous Reader) to brooke
mine errours with patience.
            
               
As for the subiect of my discourse, it
resembleth the hearbe Muscouy, in that
as it being ioyned to other flowers doubleth
the sweetnes of thē: so these fruits
of mine being now growne to a Groue,
will augment each other sauour to the
sence-pleasing comfort of the reader. If
any man delight to haue himselfe shine
with a glorious shewe of vertue, I haue
giuen him the toppes of moral behauior;
if to haue his house and family wel beautified;
I haue yeelded him diuers braunches
for that purpose; if to haue his coū
               trey
flourish, I haue sent him the deep-grounded
stemme of policy. And if the
greatest Gardener of the best manured
Eden had vouchsafed me the settes of
Diuiner worth, such as bloomed in the
holy and golden groues of his Prophets,
I would haue offred vp a sweet smelling
sacrifice of the purest choise; but since
that glorious Paradise for the first mans
offence hath bene shut vp from any entraunce,
I thought good to present thee
with such fruites, as this earth affoords, a
three leau'd bud, not onely of incōparable
sweetnes to him, that hath it, but also
of infinit admiration to him, that beholdeth
it.
            
               
In conclusion, wheras in these bookes
I make often mention of my Comentaries
vpon Persius, thou shalt-vnderstād,
that I haue had thē ready together with
a most easie Paraphrase in English and
Latine to be printed aboue a tweluemoneth
agoe, but for certain respects, I caused
thē to be closed in a case of delay &
reiourneied, till I find better leasure to
put thē forth. For euen thus & thus must
we take opportunity for ye publishing of
our labours, howsoeuer they may chaūce
to please the curious sort but so and so. If I
could promise my selfe kind & gracious
acceptāce, I would promise our age the
like Cōmentaries vpon a Satyrist of the
like vaine, euen the learned Iuuenal,
thereby to stirre vp other men,

                  —quos aequus amauit
                  Iuppiter, aut ardens euexit ad aethera virtus
               
to giue light to his gloomie and hidden
excellency. In the meane time view ouer
this Golden-groue seriously, and, if
thou reapest, any good thereby, glorifie
the great Lord of Hierarchies, who for
thy sake gaue mee grace to frame it.
Farewell.

            Be thought a precious and a golden Groue.
            The morall Nymph with deep discretion goes,
            The Oeconomick with a carefull eye;
            The Politike the state of kingdoms knowes;
            Treating of Nations, counsels, maiestie.
            The seuerall places of their best renowne,
            And obiects are the heart, ye house, the crown.
            Now let the heart estraunged at the last,
            (If any such the Golden-groue inherite)
            Behold the seat where Equity is plac'd
            With due regard of an impartiall spirit.
            And so preferre an honest Ethicke praise,
            Before he come to Politike essayes.
            Then let this house for Occonomicks worth
            Deserue the title, which it long hath borne.
            No drossie excrement from gold comes forth;
            Then golden as it is, O let it scorne,
            That any dregs or blemishes be found
            To spring frō out that Groue, & fruitful groūd.
            
               
Let Policie defend the lawfull right,
            Since Countries perish by the hand of wrong.
            Vaughan, the world in censure is vpright,
            Esteeming thee amongst the learned throng.
            If any stonie friend vniustly deale,
            Tis no true Diamond in golden seale.
            Thy worke shall liue, so shal thy Brothers fame,
            But much the more, if he regard thy paine,
            And gratifie thy Muse, that makes his name
            The note of all eternitie to gaine.
            Three ages Nestor liu'd; now (as they be)
            The Muses giue thy Legend three times three.
            
               Thomas Storer, Master of Arts.
            
         
         
            In commendation of the Golden-groue,
and the Authour thereof.
            WHo so do wish Philosophie displaid,
            Garnishd in colours of most perfect hiew,
            Refin'd againe, that lately was decaid,
            And this againe laid out to all mens view,
            Which in disgrace erst bad the world adiew,
            (So things suppres'd, and troden low to groūd,
            With great applause do to the starres abound.)
            Let such draw neer and view this Golden-groue,
            Whereof the rootes are, vertues of the mind:
            The trunks & stalks, that grow these roots aboue,
            
               
Ioint vertues are to priuate rule assign'd:
            The boughs, the publick sway of kingly kind.
            Vertue the root, Rule priuate is the stemme,
            The branches are, the golden Diademe.
            All which are done by learned Vaughans pen,
            Thereby deseruing well eternall fame,
            Who tooke great paines to benefite all men,
            That would with singlenesse peruse the same;
            Thus hath he got himselfe a golden name.
            And thus we see this stately Golden-groue,
            Whereof the motiue was, his Brothers loue.
            
               Samuel Powel, Master of Arts.
            
         
         
            To the Authour.
            THy selfe a tendrer of that Golden-groue,
            To which thou send'st this golden Groue of thine,
            How truly that so called was dost proue:
            How truly this: it needs no proofe of mine.
            It is no gilt, it is a golden booke,
            Fit for that gemme thy Brother on to looke.
            The gold whereof, as pure as euer shone,
            (Let Enuie speake, she can it not denie)
            Feares not to touch the learneds Lydian stone.
            Who buyes this Gold, too deare it cannot buy;
            It is refin'd in furnace of thy braine,
            In fire then to trie it, were but in vaine.
            
               
Some say Prometheus man of clay did make,
            But beastlike passions put into his heart:
            Vaughan, beleeue them not, for they mistake,
            To make men was not his, but is thine Art.
            Thou hast effected what he ne're began,
            Thou hast made maners: maners make the mā.
            Gold-gutted Crassus, were he now aliue,
            Might here find gold to find an host of men:
            Rich-finger'd Midas might here learne to thriue,
            Not by his owne rich touch, but by thy pen;
            Which Chimick-like (I hope) wil turn to gold
            Our iron times, and make them as of old.
            
               Iohn Raulinson, Master of Arts.
            
         
         
            In praise of the Golden-groue, moralized
by master Vaughan.
            AMid the vale of Iedas bushie groue,
            Before a bribed Iudge (such was their fate)
            A Trinitie of Goddesses once stroue:
            Gold caus'd their strife (the cause of all debate.)
            Now a new Iudge their quarrell hath acquited,
            Attoning this late-iarring Trinarie,
            And, sith in groues and gold they first delighted,
            Hath built a Golden-groue for this faire three.
            Where Pallas first vnfoldeth vertuous sawes,
            Which Venus doth conuey to families.
            
               
Then Iuno tempreth both with rightful lawes,
            And those themselues with heauenly policies,
            So these, whom Gold & groues first set at strife,
            This Golden-groue combines in blessed life.
            
               Charles Fitz-Geffrey.
            
         
         
            In commendation of this Golden-groue.
            SOme write of th'isle of the Hesperides,
            Where golden fruit in greatest plentie grew;
            A pretie fiction, and no doubt did please
            The Authour selfe, although it were not true.
            If by our dayes we measure those of old,
            (For now men loue if but to dreame of gold)
            No more a fiction, now no more a toy;
            Vaughan hath made that true, which they but faign'd;
            By Vaughans Art it is that we enioy
            That, which but onely they in shew obtain'd,
            A Golden-groue, a harbour of delight,
            Against the storms of Fortunes weaker might.
            What gracious gift can Sophia now bestow,
            On Vaughan worthy his industrious paine,
            Vnlesse of boughs, which in his Groue do grow,
            With goldē wreaths she crown his learned brain.
            Fortune cannot reward desert of wit,
            But honour, onely she doth nourish it.

things infinite and not subiect to sence

able to imprint their likenes in my feeble
and shallow braine?1.

                     No man hath
seene God at any time,
                     Cic. lib. 1. de natura Deorum. 
                     yet we know him by
his miraculous workes. To come neerer
his description, I find that God is a most
pure, essentiall, and actiue forme, without
mixture of matter & forme, or distinction
of partes, euery where alike, and the very
same. And againe, God is vncreate, perpetuall,
that is, he euer was, and euer wil
be,Arist. l. 1. Physic. Lucr. lib. 1. de rerū natura, Persius satyr. 3. & B
                           •
                        et. lib. 5. de consolat. philosop. he was not made of nothing, for nothing,
according to the Philosophers saying,
is made of nothing.
                  
                  The Gentiles, albeit wāting the light

to vnderstand perfect truth, were yet all
of them for the most part amazed at the
excellēt glory & power of God. Pythagoras
said, that God was a liuely mind,
that pearced into al things, of whom al liuing
creatures receiued their being. Thales
esteemed him to be an vnderstāding,
that created all things of the element of
water. Chrysippus called him a naturall
faculty endued with Diuine reason.
                  Thus we see, that there is engrauen in
the hearts of men a certaine feeling of
Gods nature, which cā neuer be rooted
out. And although swinish Atheists doe
laugh at that, which I haue written touching
the Godhead,Calu lib. 1. Instit. cap. 2. 
                     yet that is but a
laughter from the teeth outward, because
inwardly the worme of conscience gnaweth
them much more sharply then all hote searing
irons.
                  
                  Finally, to leaue the Gentiles opiniōs,
I iudge it not amisse, if wee satisfie our
selues to beleeue, that God is almighty,
his might vnsearchable, & his power admirable.
And asArist. li. 2. de Anima. 
                     the soule is wholy both in
the whole body, & also in euery mēber of it:
                     Casus li. 8. Cōm. Phys. ca. 10.
                     so God is wholy both in the world, & likewise
wholy in euery part of the same.

Chapt. 2.
                  DIagoras and Theodorus were not
ashamed to dispute against the Deitie.
Neither (as I heare) do some of our
brazen-faced Caualeers cease to blaspheme
God by denying most impudētly
his euerlasting essence. O foolish men!
when they see a faire house, they immediatly
presuppose some one or other to
haue built it. So in like maner whē they
behold one another, will not they sometimes
euē by natural discourse aske, who
made them? The heathen Oratour saith,
thatCic. li. 1 Tuscul. there is no natiō so sauage, no people
so sēceles, which wil not cōfesse that
there is some God: & euen they that are
Libertines, Epicures, and in other points
of their liues differing little from bruite
beasts, do reserue some seed of religion:
Also,Iam. 2. 19. the very Deuils beleeue, that
there is a God, and do tremble, as saith
the Apostle. Yea,Calu. li. 1. Instit. cap. 2. the very obstinacy
of the wicked is a substanciall witnesse
that the Deitie is knowen, which with
their furious striuing yet cā neuer wind
themselues out of the 
                        •
                     eare of God. But

what need I dally thus with doltish Atheists?
let them read the holy scripture,
& they shall find fiue generall meanes,
whereby God is made manifest vnto
man.
                  The first, are the framed things, wherin
God did first reueale himself, forPsal. 19 the
heauens declare the glory of God, and
the firmament sheweth his hādy worke.
The secōd is the sparke of nature, wherby
all men as it were by naturall instinct
obtaine the infallible admonition of the
truth. The third way whereby God is
made knowen, is the verball will, which
successiuely from time to time in some
countrey or other hath bene holden vp
by worldly blessings, apparitions, ceremonies,
prophesies, and last of all by the
presence of the Messias himselfe. The
fourth is the holy Ghost, who openeth
our misty eyes, wherby we embrace the
true and Apostolicall doctrine. The fift
meanes, whereby God is knowen, are
his miracles, at the sight of which the very
Atheists themselues being affrighted
must exclaime with Iulian the Apostata:Nazian. in Iulian. Orat. 2.
O God, O Galilaan, thou hast ouercome
our vnbeleefe.
                  
               
               
                  
                  Of Atheists. Chap. 3.
                  OF Atheists there are two sorts: the
inward, and the outward. The inward
Atheist is he, that slyly carieth the
countenaunce of a sheepe, and yet is no
sheepe, but a sheep-biter. He swaloweth
vp aduowsons, hospitals, and other mens
goods vnder pretence of simplicity. He
raiseth rents, incloseth commons, and
enhaunceth the price of corne. With
his wooll or wealth hee vseth to snarle
& deceyue honest-minded men, whom
at length hee notwithstanding hauing
Scripture in his mouth snatcheth at most
greedily, & clappeth in irons. This kind
of Atheist I will decipher hereafter.
                  The outward Atheist on the other
side openly professeth nature to be his
God. And euen as the spider infecteth
with poyson the fragrantst liquours hee
suckes; so the outward Atheist most
wickedly extracteth common places out
of the secretes of nature, and turning
them to his owne vse, hee blasphemeth
God, whom he neuer knew.
                  Is there any rayne without a clowd?

any apples without trees? any portraiture
without a painter? any kingdome
without rulers? can the heauens moue
without a mouer? say, thou viper, (for
a better name thou deseruest not) wilt
thou not beleeue that, which thou beholdest
with thine eies? wherfore, I pray
thee, was the world framed? was it not
for man? what idiot, when hee passeth
through a village, though halfe ruinous,
will not presently suppose, that it was
contriued by some or other? Much rather,
O sensuall beast, shouldst thou imagine,
that a quickning maker, euē God,
hath created not onely thee, but all the
world besides.
                  If no reason will persuade thee, yet,
me thinkes, the extraordinary punishments
of God, which alwaies, such Atheists,
as thou art, haue felt, should be of
force, to recall thee from thy most damnable
opinion. It is written of Diagoras
one of the first authours of this sect,
that being fledde from Athens, and his
bookes burnt by vniuersall consent, he
was slaine by certaine men, whom the
Athenians had hired for that intent.
Pliny the elder, one likewise of the same

stampe, while hee was ouercurious in
searching ye
                      causes of nature, was choakt
neere to the mountaine Vesuuius with
smoake, and with the smell of brimstone
issuing out of the same. Pope Leo the
tēth, who often said, that Moses, Christ,
and Mahomet were three of the greatest
dissemblers, was by the iust iudgement
of God sodainly strooken dead
with an extreame laughter. Likewise, an
Italian Captaine of late daies in the low
countries, leading his company to skirmish
with the enemy, thus encouraged
them: Sirs, quoth he, remember the former
glory of our nation, and fight valiantly:
as for your sinnes, if you die, you
shall vnderstād, there is no God. Which
when he had said, he fought, & was the
first man that was slaine. Not inferiour
to these was one Christopher Marlow
by profession a play-maker, who, as it is
reported, about 7. yeeres a-goe wrote a
booke against the Trinitie: but see the
effects of Gods iustice; it so hapned, that
at Detford, a litle village about three
miles distant from London, as he meant
to stab with his ponyard one named Ingram,
that had inuited him thither to a

feast, and was then playing at tables, he
quickly perceyuing it, so auoyded the
thrust, that withall drawing out his dagger
for his defence, hee stabd this Marlow
into the eye, in such sort, that his
braines comming out at the daggers
point, hee shortlie after dyed. Thus
did God, the true executioner of diuine
iustice, worke the ende of impious
Atheists.
                  Furthermore, some of our worldlings
may worthily bee ranged in the
forefront of this hellish route. They, I
say, that belch out this accursed theoreme
of Machiauel,Machia. in prin
                           •
                        
                        cipe. namely, that the
heathenish religion made men couragious,
wheras our religiō makes men fearfull.
O foolish sots
                        •
                      is the feare and loue
of God become the cause of your foolish
feare? Nay, rather it is your consciences,
that bring feare into your hearts. The
more wicked ye be, the more you feare.
Me thinks, that albeit ye had no demō
                     stration
of God, yet this ought to satisfie
you, which proceedeth of a natural fear.
For whosoeuer feareth, sheweth necessarily,
that there is some supreme power
which is able to terrifie & hurt him. As

contrariwise, he that is assured, that nothing
can appall or diminish his valour,
is altogether free from feare.
               
            
            
               The second part.
               
                  Of Man. Chap. 4.
                  ABdala one of the wise men of Arabia,
being on a time demaunded,
what was the most wonderfull
thing in the world? answered,
Man. Hermes Trismegistius termed mā
the great miracle. Others called him the
little world. Likewise, the wisest Philosophers
agreed, that mans body is composed
of the foure elements, and of all
their qualities. For the flesh agreeth fitly
with the earth: his vitall spirites with the
aire & the fire: and his humours with the
water. The sense of touching consenteth
with the earth. The sense of seeing
with the fire: that of smelling with the
aire and fire: that of tasting with the water:
& that of hearing with the aire. Yea,
there is no part in the whole body of mā
wherein one of the elements doth not
interpose his vertue, albeit one of thē is

alwayes predominant ouer the rest. And
most certaine it is,Ce. 1. 27 that Man is a creature
made of God after his owne Image, well
disposed by nature, composed of bodie
and soule. In this sort man had his beginning
and being of the great and eternall
builder of the world; of whom likewise
hee was created so noble for three
reasons. The first, that by this meanes
man knowing howe God hath placed
him aboue all other liuing creatures, he
might be induced dayly to loue and honour
him, as is meete. And therefore did
the Lord place the eies in mans bodie to
behold his wonderfull workes. And for
this cause also did he fasten eares to mans
head, that hee shoulde vnderstand and
keep his commandements. The second,
to the ende, that acknowledging the noble
place & race from whence he came,
hee might feare to staine his name and
fame with dishonest & vnlawfull deeds.
The third, that hee, not being ignorant
of his owne excellencie, shoulde extoll
himselfe in God, and in him, & through
him he should iudge himselfe worthy of
heauenly felicitie.
                  What should I rippe vp the good discipline

of liuing, the lawes, customs, arts
and sciences by man inuēted, to furnish
life with the three sorts of good, namely,
honest, pleasant, and profitable? According
to which, there be also three sortes
of companies; one for honestie, as the
learned and vertuous; another for pleasure,
as, yong folks, and maried men; a
third for profite, as Marchants. Wherefore
by good reason man holdeth the
soueraigntie, and chiefest roome in this
world.
               
               
                  Of the soule. Chap. 5.
                  THe infusion of the soule into the
bodie by God the Creator, is a most
admirable thing: seeing that the soule,
which is inuisible, is cōprehended within
the body being palpable: that which
is light and of celestiall fire, within that,
which is earthy, cold & corruptible: that
which is free, within that which is base &
bound. This alone is the instrument, that
can bring vs to the vnderstanding of
God and our selues. This is speculatiue
and actiue at one and the same instant.
This is she, that for her beautie hath the
foure cardinal vertues; & for her actions,

reason, iudgement, will, and memorie.
Briefly, this is she, about whom the wisest
of the world haue occupied their curious
and fine wits.
                  Pythagoras affirmed, that the soul was
a nūber moouing it self. Plato said, that
the soule was a portiō taken frō the substance
of celestial fire. The prince of the
Peripatetickes writeth,Arist. li; 2. de anima. ca. 1. that the soule is
the motiō or act of a natural body, that may
haue life. Our Diuines define the soule
after this maner. The soule of man is a
spirit, that giueth life and light to the bodie,
wherevnto it is knit, and which is
capable of the knowledge of God, to
loue him, as being fit to be vnited vnto
him through loue, to euerlasting happinesse.
               
               
                  That a man hath but one soule.
Chap. 6.
                  EVen as in euery bodie there is but
one essentiall kind of nature, whereby
it proceedeth to be that, which it is:
so in euery liuing creatures bodie there
is but one soule, by the which it liueth.
In the scripture we neuerread, that one
mā had mo soules thē one.Gen. 2. 7 
                     Adam being

created by God,Gen. 46. 26. 
                     was a liuing soule. All
the soules that came with Iacob into Egipt,
and out of his loines (beside his sonnes
wiues) were in all threescore and six soules,
that is, threescore and sixe persons. Also
the sonnes of Ioseph,
                     Ibid. 27. 
                     which were borne him
in Egipt, were two soules. Steuen being
stoned by the Iewes, called on God, and
said,Act. 7. 39. 
                     Lord Iesu, receiue my spirit. Saint
Paul raising Eutichu
                        •
                      from death, sayde,
his life is in him. Our sauiour Christ likewise
complained vnto his Disciples, saying,Mar. 14. 34.
                     My soule is verie heauie, euen vnto
the death. Hereby we may note, that one
man hath but one soule.
                  How greatly therefore are those Philosophers
deceyued, who affirme, that
one man hath three distinct soules, to
wit, reasonable, sensitiue, and vegetatiue?
wherof these two last are in a bruit
beast, as well as in a man: and the vegetatiue
in plants, in beastes, and in man.
This opinion of pluralitie of soules seemed
so damnable vnto the ancient fathers,
that Augustine, Damascenus, and
the fourth Councell of Constantinople
proclaimed them to be excommunicated,
which would hold one man to haue

many soules. Briefly, to leaue this errour,I thinke, Arist: li. 2. anim. cap. 3
it falleth out with the soule,
as it doth with figures: for euen as the
trigon is in the tetragon, and this tetragon
in the pentagon: so likewise the vegetatiue
power is in the sensitiue, and
this sensitiue is in the reasonable soule.
                  
                     Obiection.
                     We see yong infants hauing vegetatiue,
and sensitiue soules, and not possessing
the reasonable soule, before they
come to yeares of discretion.Arist. li. 2. de Generatione animal. cap. 3. Moreouer,
it is well knowne, that a man liueth first
the life of plants, then of beasts, and last of
all of man: therefore a man hath three
soules, distinct aswell by succession of
time, as in essence, and formall property.
                  
                  
                     Answere.
                     I grant, that the faculties of mans soule
are by their operations successiuelie
knowne, as the vegetatiue power is
knowne more plainly in the beginning:
then the sensitiue: & last of al the reasonable
soule. But frō thence to conclude,
that infants haue no reasonable soule, I
deeme it meere madnesse. For the whole
soule is infused within them in the beginning,
but by the sacred power of

God it is not made as then manifest, vntill
they attaine to elder yeres. Touching
your proofe (that a man liueth the life of
plants; then the life of beasts; and last, of
a reasonable man) I answere, that it is
meant of the vitall powers; and not of
the soule: and so I yeeld, that a man at
first exerciseth the powers vegetatiue,
and sensitiue, and then he hath the benefite
of the reasonable soule.
                  
               
               
                  Of the immortaltiie of the soule. chap. 7.
                  ATheists, and the hoggish sect of the
Epicures; who would faine stay in
their bodily senses, as beasts do, deride
the holy scriptures, saying, that it is not
known what becomes of their soules afthe
deth of their bodies, or to what coast
they trauell, by reason that none returned
at any time backe from thence to
certifie them. This is their childish reason.
Which truly in my iudgemēt sprūg
vp of their negligence, in not ferreting
out the end of the soule. For to what end
els was the soule created, but that knowing
God her Creator, and worshipping
him for that great benefite, shee might
stand in awe and loue of him, and at

length attaine to euerlasting life, which
is appointed for her end? Al other liuing
creatures God made for mans vse; but
man he created to the end, that the light
of his wisdome might shine in him, and
that hee might participate with him his
goodnesse. Admit therefore, that mans
soule were corruptible: what difference
then, I pray thee, would there bee betweene
a man and a bruite beast? nay
then consequently it must follow, that
man was created without cause.
                  Wherefore did God create man of
stature straight, and erected towardes
the aspect of heauen, the originall place
of his true pedegree, but that he should
perswade himselfe that he is of a heauenly
nature? surely Calu. lib. 1. Instit. cap. 15.the conscience, which
discerning betweene good and euill,
answereth the iudgement of God, is an
vndoubted signe of an immortall soule.
For how could a motiō without essence
come to the iudgement seate of God, &
throwe it selfe into feare by finding her
owne guiltinesse? Further, if the soule
were mortall, what rewarde is left to the
iust? what punishment to the wicked?
Also, if this were true, the wicked haue

that, which they most desire, and the iust
that, which they most abhorre. But shall
punishment bee inflicted on the iust,
whereas it ought to bee executed on the
wicked? Many reasons I could alleadge,
but of all others this is most forcible,
which God hath giuen vs in the resurrection
of his sonne our sauiour Iesus
Christ, whereby his soule was vnited againe
to his body, and taken vp into heauen
in the sight of his Disciples. Likewise
we reade that▪ God sayde to Moses:Exo. ca. 3▪ ver. 6
                     I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Iacob, wherhence our sauior Christ concluded,
that Abrahā, Isaac, & Iacob, do
liue yet after their death, seeing that
* God is the God of the liuing,
                     Matth. ca. 22. verse 32 Persius satyr. 3. 
                     and not of the
dead. Now to be breefe, I may fitly compare
these Epicurian hogges vnto drunkards,
who so long being drunke, vntil
they haue by sleepe, sufficiently alayed
the furious force of the wine which they
drunk, know not whether they haue any
wit or conscience, any soule or sence.
                  
                     Obiection.
                     Men, as Plinie writeth,Plinius lib. 7. ca. 
                              •
                           5. breathe no otherwise
then beasts do, for wee see nothing
of the soule of either of them: therfore

the soule as wel of men as of beasts,
being nothing els but a breth, is mortall.
                  
                  
                     Answere.
                     Plinie seeing smoake come out of the
mountaine Vesuuius, iudged that there
was fire within, although hee behelde it
not: also he knew by his nose that there
was brimstone issuing out of the same,
albeit hee sawe it not: howe chanceth it
then, that when by his sences he perceiued
somewhat more in men, then in
beasts, hee was not brought thereby to
beleeue, that consequently there must
be somewhat within, which causeth men
to differ from bruit beasts? Furthermore,
men discourse learnedly of all naturall
things, they are endued with reason, and
their speech followeth reason, which
are such things, as haue a resemblance of
Gods spirit shining in them: but beastes
haue not in them this apprehension, for
that they are produced out of the power
of that matter, whereof they are ingendered.
Finally, the soule of man is bred
in the bodie by God, aboue all the matter
of the same.

                  Of Vertue, Chap. 8.
                  
                     WHosoeuer meanes to sowe a godly
field with corne,
                     Boetius lib. 3. de consolat. philoso. metr. 1. 
                     must first rid the
same field of thornes and shrubs,
and cut away the fernes with his
sithe, that the new corn may grow with ful
cares: so likewise, O mortall man, thou
hauing beene all the daies of thy life, as
it were in a goldē dreame, awake at last,
and withdraw thy selfe from that fonde
delight, that vertue which is surer & better
then all Arts, may the sooner enter
into thy minde. Be not like vnto a child,
who seeing a bable wherwith he plaieth,
taken out of his hand, powtingly throweth
away that which he hath in his other
hand, although it bee far better then the
former. Al worldly things, be they neuer
so glorious, do fade away, yea, & worldlings
themselues are so soone suffocated
and choaked with euerie small moth,
that they are ready to stumble at euerie
straw, and to become daunted at euerie
trifling cause. But cōtrariwise, they which
are bedewed with the sweet droppes of

Vertue, wil neuer be ouerturned, eyther
with worldly guiles, or with the losse of
life and bloud.
                  Vertue is alway permanent: shee is
quiet in most stormie times, & shineth in
the darke: beeing driuen from her seate,
she neuerthelesse remaineth in her coū
                     try,
she giueth continual light, and neuer
becōmeth spotted with any filth. Euerie
thing that is atchieued by her meanes, is
good and soueraigne. For her loue, Anacharsis
the Philosopher left his kingdom
of Scythia to his yonger brother, & went
into Athens to find her there. This also
moued the Emperor Maximili
                        •
                      the 2. in
the yeere of our Lord 1574. to answer a
Dutchman that craued his Letters Patents
to make him a nobleman: It is in
my power, quoth he, to make thee rich, but
Vertue must make thee noble. Happy therfore
is he that wooeth her, & thrise happy
is he that is contracted to her: for euen
as the prowesse & valour of a horse maketh
him apt and fit for his rider to attend
couragiously the onset of the enemy:
so vertue strengthneth her owner against
cōcupiscēce, & restoreth him ready
to abide any brūts of variable fortune

Moreouer, (a) Piccolom grad. 4 de virtu. moral. 
                     vertue is said to be three
manner of waies in man, either infused by
God, or planted by nature, or gotten by pains
and industrie. Vertue is infused by God,
when we call her either faith, hope, or
charitie: (b) Arist. lib 1. Rhetor. 
                     she is by nature, whē we terme
her nobil

                        : Shee is saide to bee gotten
through paines and industrie, when wee
name her either morall, as iustice, truth,
magnanimitie, fortitude, temperaunce,
magnificence, liberalitie, clemencie, modestie,
affabilitie, friendship, & patience;
or intellectuall, as Art, science, vnderstā
                     ding,
prudence, and wisedome, al which
together with their extremes and subordinate
qualities I wil decipher hereafter.
                  Wherfore, to be breefe, let vs embrace
vertue, so pretious and manifold a palme
tree, which the more it is pulled downe,
the more it returneth vpward; let vs, I say
follow her, who hath this singular propertie
in al-her actiōs,Plutar. in vita Periclis. namely, that c she maketh
the man that knoweth her, so to affect
her, that forthwith hee liketh all her
actions, and desireth to imitate them that
are vertuously disposed.
               
               
                  Of Vice. Chap. 9.
                  EVen as a vertue is the beautie of the

inward man,August. Epist. 35 & the way to attain vnto an
happie life: so vice is the sicknes therof,
and fighteth against nature. (d) Propert. lib. 2. 
                     All

                     He is best, that is

neither fire nor feare doth carry a man away
so violently as vices. They onely
haue beene the vndooers of all cōmonwealths,
and as soone as they once haue
entred into the mind, they wil neuer forsake

to him yt

vertuous. chap. 10.

which seek to shrowd their vices vnder
this cloake, that they mean to amend
al in time, Persius Satyr. 5.

                     vntil God, in whose hands the moments
of time are, doth shut them out of all
time, and doth send them to paines eternall
without time. Little do they thinke, that
their vices are by wicked custome fortified,
and as it were with a beetle, more
strongly rammed into their harts & midriffes.
It is an vsuall prouerbe, that whatsoeuer
is bred in the bone, will neuer

for a time deferred, becōmeth infectious
and past cure. Why then, O mortal
men, doo yee builde on such a weake
foundation? why doo yee not at this instant
without any further procrastinations,
prostrate your selues before the most

We see by common experience, that if
a man deliuer a reasonable petition vnto
an earthly King, he may perhaps attend
a yeere or two, before he be fully
satisfied. What then shall yee expect of
the heauenly King, whom yee haue a
thousand times most wilfully displeased?
Is it possible for you, after you haue obstinatly
resisted him all the dayes of your
liues, to sue vnto him at the period of
your yeeres, and to obtaine remission?
No, no, it is not presumptuous delay,
that worketh vnfaigned repentaunce.

Like as the Poetes say of Titius, so shall
you, being as it were food vnto death,
confume in hell, and yet reuiue againe,

so that still ye may be euer dying. Then
shall yee crie vnto the mountaines, and
say,Luke 23. & Apoc. 6. O you mountaines fall vpon vs, &
you hilles couer vs. Then shall you repent

happinesse for your reward. Repentaunce
that is done at the last day,
most cōmonly is done vpon feare of future
tormentes. Besides,Iere. 13. the Aethiopian

                  My selfe haue knowen a young Gentleman,

                  Remedies against vice.
Chap. 11.
                  THe roote of vice is the originall corruption,
wherewith mankind hath
bene ouerwhelmed euer since the fall of
Adam. Which corruption in processe of
time beyng growne by continuall custome
into a sinfull habite, becommeth
damnable three maner of waies. First,
by thoughts; next by wordes, as, swearing,
lies; lastly, by deedes, as murther,
adulterie.
                  Now for the curing of this Hydralike
malady, sixe things are to be obserued.
First, we must oft consider, that the
actes of vertues themselues cannot bee
of any value with God, except we continually
exercise our selues therein. For
the longer wee delay,Resol. li. 1. part. 2 cap. 5. 
                     the more is the
kingdome and power of the Diuell established
and confirmed in vs. Secondly, wee
must once or twice a day at least call to
remembrance our vices, & with a contrite
heart aske God forgiuenes. Thirdly,
we must waigh with our selues, how
that we are wandring pilgrimes in this
world, and like vnto them, that vpon

their iourneys abide not in those Innes,
where they are well lodged, but after
their baite do depart homeward, vttering
these words of the Prophet: * Woe is
me,
                     Ps. 120. 
                     that I remaine in Mesech, and dwell in
the tents of Kedar. The fourth remedy
against vice is, that we thinke on the manifold
miseries of this life, & on the end
thereof. The fift, wee must oftentimes
repeat that fearful saying of the Apostle:
* If the iust shall scarce be saued,
                     1. Pet. 4. 
                     where shal
the wicked man and sinner appeare? The
sixt, we must muse vpō the day of iudgemēt,
at which timeGal. 6. 
                     euery one must beare
his owne burthen, and sinners must1. Pet. 4.

sith the order of a ciuill society is the
law, & iudgemēt is nothing els, but the
decision of that, which is iust. This vertue,
as the Diuine Philosopher writeth,
Plato li. 4. de Republ.is the chiefest gift, which God gaue vnto
men. For if she were not amongst vs,
what would our commonwealth be, but
a receptacle for theeues? From whence
Plin. lib. 2. natur. histor.the sect of Democritus concluded, that
there were 2. things, which rule ye whole
world, namely, Reward & Punishment.
                  Some say, that Iustice is more resplē
                     dent
then the Sunne, for hee lighteneth
the world only by day, whereas she shineth
both night and day: the sunne illuminateth
the eyes of the body, Iustice
the eyes of the minde: the Sunne molesteth
vs by his continuall presence, but
of Iustice we shal neuer be weary, wherupon
othersome affirme, thatPiccolomi. grad. 5. de virtut. moral. ex Nigidio. Figulo. 
                     shee is
placed in the Zodiake betweene the signes
of Leo and Libra, whereby her equality
and courage are vnderstood. To come
neerer our owne time, let vs commune
with our selues, and forethinke, what

should become of vs, if there were no
gallows for murtherers and heinous offendors,
no whips for rogues, nor fines &
amercements for affraies and such like
crimes. Surely, we should not liue together.
The wild Karnes & Red-shanks of
Irelād would not be more sauage thē vs.
                  Wherfore, O ye, which are seated in
the throne of Iustice, respect not your
owne priuat cōmodities:2. Chron. 19. 
                     for you execute
not the iudgements of man; but of God, and
he will be with you in the cause and iudgement.
Lay before your eies the exāple of
that zealous Iudge, who feared not to
cōmit the Prince of Wales (afterwardes
king H. the fift) for his assault into the
prison of the Kings bēch. For which act
of Iustice, that noble Prince, when hee
came to the crowne, yeelded him great
thanks, & during his warres in Fraunce,
left the said Iudge his substitute ouer this
whole Realme. To be briefe, wash your
hands cleane from bribes, & administer
iustice vnto all men without any kinde
of affection, vaine-pitie, or fauour, lest
that, they prying into your liues, in stead
of honor, you be brāded in the forehead
with the perpetuall note of infamie.
               
               
                  
                  Of Iniustice. Chap. 13.
                  INiustice is a kinde of iniurie, vsed by
such as be in authority, ouer the weaker
sort,Aristot. lib. 5. Ethic. ca. 1 
                     who also assume vnto themselues,
more then law or right permitteth
them. This vice of all others is most repugnant
to mans nature, because thatPlato in Gorgia. 
                     a
man, as long as he benefiteth, and executeth
iustice, is like vnto God, but practizing iniustice,
he separateth himselfe farre enough
from God. Woe therefore be vnto you,
landlords, who forgetting your selues,
and your duty towards God, do flay and
vexe your tenants and inferiours with
extraordinary imposts, with asking of
beneuolences, letherwits, and such like.
Woe be vnto you, heires and elder brethren,
who make dish-cloutes and no
reckoning of your younger brethren,
but suffer them to be idle and forlorne,
which destroyeth them both body and
soule: woe, I say, be vnto you, that extort,
&Ezec. 22. 
                     like rauening woolues do robbe &
take praies to shedde bloud, and to destroy
soules for your owne couetous gaine, so that
you areIuuenal. satyr. 10 
                     not cōtent to be infected with one
haynous offence, but moreouer you rayse

vp sundry mischiefes, & molest your already
distressed bretheren with many
and iniust taxations. For the which, God
will proceed in iudgement against you,
Ezech. 22.he will powre out his indignation vpon
you, & consume you with the fire of his
wrath: your owne waies will he render
vpon your heads. Then in cōclusion shal
you perceiue, how thatSeneca Epist. 98 no wickednesse
escapeth scotfree, by reason that the punishment
of one consisteth in another.
               
               
                  Whether it be lawfull for a man to
kill himselfe. Chap. 14.
                  NOthing is more damnable, nothing
more vngodly, then for a man to
slay himselfe. For if an homicide be dā
                     ned
for killing another: so in like māner
he that killeth himselfe is guilty of murther,
because he killeth a member of the
commonwealth. Yea, this is a greater
sinne. For we liue here in this world altogether
according to Gods prescriptiō.
Gen. 1.We are created of God after his owne
image: and shall wee endamaging our
selues, wrong our Creator? No, if we do,
our owne consciences will accuse vs as
murtherers & traitours before the tribunall

seat of GOD. It is reason that he,
which sent vs into the world for the setting
forth of his glory, should call vs out
of the world to yeeld an account of our
bayliwike,Sydn. li. 4 Arcad. 
                     he hath appointed vs Captaines
of our bodily fortes, which without treason
to that maiesty are neuer to be deliuered
ouer, till they be redemaūded. Besides,
despaire cannot beare the title of valour,
by reason it proceedeth of an abiect and
weake mind. Now therefore if we be valiant,
let vs make our valour manifest
vnto Gods and our countries enemies,
that if we die in such attempts, the Almighty
may canonize vs holy martyres,
and crowne vs with eternall glory in his
blessed kingdome.
                  
                     Obiection.
                     Nature graunted no longer vnto Cato
a patent of his life, for Pompey and
his Complices were ouerthrowen, and
if he himselfe had bene taken captiue by
Cesar, he had lost his honour and life:
therefore it was lawfull for him to effect
that, which, if hee had not, another
would.
                  
                  
                     Answere.
                     Nature gaue Cato a life not voluntarily

to lose, but to sustaine and nourish.
Besides, nature and violence are
opposite.Cas. lib. 3 specul. moral. cap. 7. In briefe, it had bene better for
him to haue bene tormented in Phalaris
brazen bull, then desperately to kill himselfe.
                     
                  
               
               
                  That wee should not patiently endure
all iniuries. Chap. 15.
                  MAny, as the Anabaptistes, doubt,
whether it be lawfull or no for one
Christian to sue or strike another, groū
                     ding
their opinion vponMatth. cap. 6. Epistol. ad Rom. cap. 12. & Epistol. ad Cor. ca. 6 
                     the authoritie
of the Scripture. Yet, this schismaticall
doubt in my iudgement might quickly
be blotted out, if they knew what iniury
meant, for a man may haue iniury offred
either to his person, to his goodes, or to
his credite. Now concerning our person
and goodes, it is certaine, that vertue
permitteth vs to repell violence with
violence, or els embracing patience,
to remitte all to the Magistrates, in
whose hands the sworde of Iustice remaineth.
As for the reprehension of the
Corinthians, I answere, that they were
rebuked for going to law vnder those

magistrates, which were not Christians,
and * in that they brought the Gospell in
slaunder among the vnbeleeuers.
                     Caluin. li. 4. Instit. cap. 20. In like
sort I think it meeter for vs Protestants
to endure all iniuries whatsoeuer, then
to commence suites one against another
vnder any Popish or hereticall
Iudge. But on the contrarie, if the Magistrate
be of our religion, what other
order by the lawe of GOD and man is
prescribed, then to sue vnto him, and to
craue satisfaction for the iniurie which is
done vnto vs?Cic. act. 5. in Verrem. 
                     Euery reproach hath a certaine
sting, which wise and good men
can hardly tolerate. Moreouer, it is holden
for a principle, thatArist. li. 2. Rheto. 
                     no man is vilified
and despised in his owne conceit. And
therefore hee cannot chuse, but for reasonable
causes goe to law, and so haue
the pleas handled, that he may liue afterwards
in more securitie: for experience
sheweth vnto vs, how that those
iniuried persons, which most are silent,
as confessing themselues ouercome by
their stronger, do abide continuall molestations,
and liue in intolerable thraldome.
                  Touching the last way, wherby iniury

is offred vnto our credit, my sentence is,
that it can neuer be impaired in an honest
man, by reason that vertue, which
shineth with vndefiled honours, will euer
patronize & protect it. What auayleth
it then, that a man go to law for such
a trifle, & haue his aduersary punished,
namely,L. lex Cornel. § 10. ff. de iniur. 
                     noted with infamy? Beleeue
me, it is better for you, O contentious
witals, to end such cauillations of your
wronged credit at home, then to trauell
to London, and there to feed the rauening
Lawyers with the sweat of your
browes. Pursue not therefore one another
with vnappeasable stifnesse, but rather
end your doubts at home vnder an
indifferent arbitratour without rancour
or malice.
               
            
            
               The fourth part.
               
                  Of Trueth. Chap. 16.
                  TRueth is that infallible vertue,
which reuealeth the creation of
the world, the power of God, his
blessing for the godly, & vengeaunce
for the wicked. This is she, which
rightly may be termed the cēter, wherin

all things repose themselues, the mappe,
whereby we saile, and the balme whereby
we are healed. This is she,Ouid. Epist. 19. 
                     whom God
respecteth more then all sacrifices. To be
short, this is she, whichCicero orat. in Vatin. 
                     hath so great
power, that no engine, wit, or art can subdue:
and although she hath no atturney to
defend her cause, yet notwithstanding shee
is defended by her selfe. According to our
beleefe in God, Truth is named faith: in
agreements betweene man and man.
Trueth is called promise: of seruants towards
their masters she is termed loyalty.
But in what estimation she is in these
accursed times, I trēble to speake therof.
For many there be, that outface & deny
their owne superscriptions: & vnlesse an
honest man bring with him multitude of
witnesses to testifie the truth, he is like to
be defrauded of his due. O how farre do
we degenerate frō the auncients! They
were woont in times past to lend money
vpon a mans naked & bare promise, and
likewise to passe their conueyances and
state of lands in few lines: whereas now
on the contrary a dozen skins of parchment
will scant serue their turne; for
what do they els but hammer quirckes

and crochets, and inuent twenty apish
trickes to circumuent one another? Promooting
petifoggers are the mouers of
all these fallacies. They are the caterpillers,
which exclude truth, and would
make her a wandering vagabound. Beware
of them, O yee which are honestly
bent. Through their illusionsSilius Ital. li. 2. 
                     breake not
the league of amity, neither preferre yee
kingdomes before truth. Take away this
vertue, and our commonwealth is become
a piracy. The losse of wealth is nothing
to the losse of truth. For which
cause, the Philosopher doubted not to
affirme, thatAristot. lib. 1. Ethic. ca. 6. 
                     wise mē ought to contradict
themselues for verities sake, yea, and to engage
their credite for her conseruation.
Thinke vpon this, O Lawyers, & consider
with your selues, howEurip. in Phoen. 
                     the speach of
Truth is simple, and needs not sundry explications
and cauillations.
                  
               
               
                  Of Lies. Chap. 17.
                  OF lies there bee three sortes: The
first I call an officious lie, which is
vsed, when otherwise an heynous offence
cannot be eschued, as we read in
the booke of Kinges,1. Sam. 9 where * Michol

Sauls daughter saued her husband Dauid
by the same meanes. The second kind of
lies is named iesting, which men vse at
table, not of any premeditatiō or malice,
but rather for to delight the company.
Howbeit amōg Christians it is not much
laudable. The third kind of lies is named
hurtfull or odious, which extendeth to
the harming of one or other. This sort
of lying is most detestable in the sight of
God and man.
                  Furthermore, a lie is a base vice, & worthy
to be cont
                        •
                     ned of all mortall men, &
especially of those, that are wise, forArist. li. 1. Sophis. elenchor. cap. 1. the
duties of a wise man are two, wherof the
one is not to lie in any thing, which hee
knoweth: the other, to make a lier manifest
to the face of the world. And euen as
we debarre wise men: so we most of all
disswade youths frō lying; for if they be
suffred & borne withal to coine lies, they
wil at last become altogether past grace,
& by vse wil be inueterated in falshood,
Wherfore they must be quickly restrained,
and seuerely chastised, when they
lie. Hereupon some hold,Cic. li. 3. offic. & Greg. lib. 8. Moral. that * those
youths are as it were naturally euill,
which take a delight in telling of lies. Othersome

say, that Homer. lib. 9. Odyss. 
                     they differ not from
deadly enemies. But howsoeuer, in my
iudgement, they ought to bee speedilie
looked vnto, and then the rather,Plautus in Mercat
                           •
                        r. whē
they begin once to tel lies to their owne
parents, which is a most intolerable fact.
               
               
                  Of Swearing. Chap. 18.
                  VVE must not sweare at all,Maetth. cap. 5. & Extra. de iureiurand. c. 26.
neither by heauen, for it is
the throne of God: nor yet
by the earth, for it is his footstoole:
Neither must wee sweare by our
heades, because wee cannot make one
haire white or blacke. But our communication
must be yea, yea, and nay, nay,
and whatsoeuer is more then these, commeth
of euil. Howbeit notwithstanding,
there be very few here in England, that
are not in a manner fully resolued to regard
swearing as a vertue. Hee is a Gull
or a Puritane, quoth they, that will not
sweare: nay, rather they should say, he is
a member of the diuell that delighteth in
swearing.Augustin. lib. contra. mendac. Hearken what an holy father
sayth: Sweare not at al, lest that by swearing
you come to the facilitie of swearing,
from thence to custome, and from

custome you fall into periurie. Neither
can your feeble excuses suffice, in saying
that you sweare not, by God, by Gods
bloud, by Gods wounds, but rather you
sweare by Gog, by Gogs bud, by Gogs
zwoonce. O foolish hypocrites! doe you
thinke although you delude vs, that you
can dally with him, who noteth & heareth
euerie word which you speake? no,
no: it will not goe for payment at the
fearefull day of iudgement. In swearing
thus, you heape hot coles of fire vpon
your heades, and offend as bad, by attributing
that honor vnto counterfeit creatures,
which is due vnto the creator, who
onely is to bee named, and that after a
good sort, in all your words and deedes.
Take heede least that God execute vpon
you such a fearefull iudgement, as he
of late daies executed on a yong man in
Lincolneshire. This yong man, as is by
master Perkins, master Stubs, & others
credibly reported, was an abominable
swearer, and his vsual othe was, By Gods
bloud. God willing his repentance, corrected
him oftē times with sicknes, that
he might be conuerted. But hee vtterly
reiected all corrections. Then God seeing

that nothing could reclaime him frō
swearing, inflicted on him a most grieuous
disease, of which he languished a
long time. At last his friends perceiuing
him to be neere his death, caused his passing
bell to bee rung. Whereupon this
swearer hearing the bell toll, rose vp in
his bed, saying, Gods bloud, hee shall
not haue me yet. But loe, the iust iudgement
of the Lorde. At those words the
bloud gushed out at euerie ioynt of his
body, & neuer ceased, til al the bloud in
his body was run out, and thus died this
bloudy swearer, whose example, I pray
God, may sink into ye
                      harts of our swaggering
Caualeers, who at ech other word
vse to lash out most detestable othes.
                  Now to cōclude this chapter,August. in tract. de decollat. Iohā. Bap. whosoeuer
prouoketh any mā to sweare a grieuous
oth, and knoweth that he sweareth
falsly, is worse then a murtherer, because
that a murtherer killeth but the body,
wheras he killeth the soule, yea, & which
is more, hee killeth two soules, namely,
his whom he prouoked to sweare, & his
owne soule.
                  
                     Obiection.
                     It is good to haue the name of God in
our mouths, therfore it is lawful to swear.
                  
                  
                     
                     Answere.
                     Swearing
is tvvofold 
                           Godly, when we be called by
the officers of necessitie to depose
the truth in any doubtful
or litigious matter,Epist. ad Hebr. ca. 6. & l. 3. C. de rebus credit. Extra. de probati. c. 2. or else in a
priuate case, betweene partie
and partie, to ende strife and
debate: and this is tolerable,
when all other lawful proofes
are knowne to bee wanting.
                           Vngodly, when we sweare
vpon euerie light occasion,
and in our daily talke, and this
is reproued.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  Of periurie or forswearing. Chap. 19.
                  AN othe hath three associats, to witte,
truth, iudgement, and iustice: wherof
if any be found lacking, it is no longer
to be termed an oth, but rather periury,
which vndoutedly is a most abominable
sinne: for thereby wee haue no respect
either vnto his presence, who is euerie
where, or reuerence vnto his cōmandemēt,
which expresly insinuateth,Exod. 20. & Deut. 5. that * we
take not his name in vain, for he will not
hold him guiltlesse, that taketh his name

in vaine, and so trecherously abuseth his
sacred maiestie.
                  The heathen themselues detested this
vice, and thereuponIn Iliad fera per tot. Homer reprehended
the Troians for their periure.Diodor. sic. lib. 2. The
Egyptians punished periurers by death.
Yea, many holde it for a maxime, that
othes are to bee obserued sacredly towardes
our foes, and that not without
good reason, seeingEx leg. 12. tabu. periurie by the
will of God is destruction, and by mans

soundly confirmed by our ciuill
Lawyers.
                  Sundrie examples I might alleadge to
this purpose, but for breuitie sake I wil at
this time content my selfe with one onely.
In the yeere of our Lord 1576. Anne
Aueries widow, forswearing her selfe for
a little money, that shoulde haue beene
payde for sixe pounde of tow, at a shop
in Woodstreete of London, fell immediatly
downe speechlesse, casting vp at
her mouth the same matter, which by
course of nature shoulde haue beene auoyded
downewards, till she died. Thus
did God reward periurie.
                  In conclusion,Isidor. Hee that forsweareth

himselfe,Isidor. lib. 3. de summo bone. is subiect vnto two persons:
first vnto the Iudge, whom hee deceiueth
by his lying, and then vnto the
innocent party, whom he endangereth
by his periury. Those which would know
more of this vice, I referre to the reading
of my Commentaries,In satyr. 5. Persii. where I haue alreadie
sifted it.
               
               
                  Of Cursers and Blasphemers. Chap. 20.
                  
                     Leuit. 24. WHosoeuer curseth his God, shal
beare the paine of his owne sinne,
and the blasphemer of the Lordes name
shall die the death. The whole congregatiō
of the people shal stone him, whether
he be a citizen or a stranger. This
bitter cōminatiō the Lord raineth down
vpon such as curse and blaspheme. Who
then will presume to contradict and dispute
against it? If a subiect blaspheme or
speake euill of his prince, presently hee is
had by the back, and condemned to die?
What then shall be done with him, that
banneth and teareth in peeces the name
of God, who is the King of Kings? Is hee

not worthy of greater punishmēt, namely,
to suffer both in body and soule? Canō. 10 caus. 24. q. 3. ex Hierō. in Epist. ad Tit. Michael
the Archangell durst not curse the
diuel, albeit he was worthy of al the curses
in the world how therfore is it lawful
for vs to curse? The Turkes at this day
dare not transgresse herein, for feare of
Gods punishmēt. Many of ye papists accoūt
it an intolerable sin to blaspheme.
O what a condemnatiō wil this be vnto
vs? I feare me, that many of them hauing
as it were but a glimpse of the Gospel of
Christ, will goe before vs Protestants into
the euerlasting Paradise. We know in
our consciences, that cursers and blasphemers
are hainous offenders in the
sight of God. Howbe it neuerthelesse,
we liue carelesse and obstinate, as beeing
either dazeled like vnto owles at the
eminent light of the Gospel, or else bewitched
and charmed by the empoysoned
guiles of this world, and the Prince
of this world. Our vsuall speeches in our
anger are these: The Diuell take him,
Vengeance light vpon him, A poxe on
thee, A plague on thee. Al which horrible
curses haue already fallen on some of
our pates, & that within these 7. yeeres.

The plague first ouerspread it selfe
through London the Metropolitane Citie
of this Realme, and from thence it
crept into euerie shire in particular. The
poxe likewise hath not beene absent,
which many parents to their great griefe
can testifie. As for the other two, the diuell
and vengeance, the gallowes being
burthened with traytors, murtherers, and
felons, may giue sufficient euidence against
vs.
                  Now concerning blasphemie, the followers
thereof haue not altogether escaped
scotfree, as appeared by Duke Ioyeus,
who about eyght yeere since, felt the
smart of his impious deserts. This Duke,
one of the cheefest of the leaguers in
France, beeing ouercome by the French
Kings forces that now raigneth, and despairing
of any good successe, vomited
forth these wordes: Farewell my great
Cannons: I renounce God, and wil run
this day a high fortune. With that hee
galloped amaine, and plunged himselfe,
horse and all into the riuer Tar, where
presently hee was swallowed vp. Thus
did God worke the end of this blasphemous
Duke. And I pray God they may

so still bee rewarded that blaspheme
him, which causeth the foundations of
the earth to tremble, in any Realme or
nation in the worlde whatsoeuer. What
shall I write of the Franciscan Friers,
who blasphemously compare their Frier
Frauncis vnto Christ, saying, that Christ
did not any thing, but Frauncis did
the same? yea; Francis did more then
Christ, for his nayles droue away temptations.
O childish comparison! Of this
blasphemous route is Bellarmine, that
Archpapist, as by these his words it appeareth.Bellarm. lib. 2. de Mona. cap. 13. Leuit. 24. & §. vlt. in Nou. 77. Clarus. §. blasphema, lib. 5. Iason. l. 3. §. iurare. num. 11. de iniur. & Zasius Consil. 19 num. 37. lib. 1.
If we, quoth he, cannot by any
meanes keepe the lawe of God, then
God is more vniust, and more cruell
then any tyrant. The punishment of
cursers and blasphemers were diuers.
Sometimes they were punished by
death. Sometimes * their tongues were
cutte or bored through. And at other
times their punishments were arbittarie
according to the number of their offences.
Likewise king Lewes of France hearing
the Lord of lenuile, one of his Barons,
blaspheme God, caused him to be
apprehended, and his lips to be slit with
an hotte iron. For which notable act of

iustice, he afterwards deserued the name
of a Saint.
                  Let vs therefore consider of these both
ordinarie, and extraordinarie punishments,
and employ our whole studies to
admonish those miscreants, who doe nothing
else but ban and blaspheme God,
yea, and otherwhiles their owne selues.
               
               
                  Of Deceit. Chap. 21.
                  SVch is the corrupt nature of this age,
that men conuert that into deceite,
which God gaue them for good reason,
whereby it falleth out, thatTerent. in Andr. 
                     one deceit
bringeth in another, and consequently,
cosenages are heaped vpon cosenages.
Herehence it commeth to passe, that so
many in these dayes are conicatched.
For how can it otherwise bee, as long as
they listen vnto flatterers, & despise wise
men, when they tel them of their follies?
                  Wherefore beware of smoothing dissemblers,
O ye that are gently disposed,
and suffer your selues to bee lift out of
the gulfe of ignorance, and to bee powdred
with truth, which earst like sots yee
haue abandoned.Ari. lib. 4. Metaphysic. 
                     None euer haue

beene deceiued, but in that whereof they
are ignorant, or else in that which is obscure.
And if they bee deceiued,Demost. 1. Olynth 
                     it is prodigious,
if they bee deceiued of good men. Finally,
An. lib 2. Elench sophistic.
                     they that perceiue not deceits, shal oftentimes
be deceiued of themselues.
                  
               
               
                  Whether a man bee bound to performe that,
which he hath sworne to his enemie, either
willingly, or by constraint. Chap. 22.
                  SO excellent a thing is the name of
faith, that the vse therof hath not only
purchased credite among friends, but
also renowne amongst enemies, which
foundation being laide, I constantly auerre,
if a man hath sworne vnto his enemie,
that he is periured, if he performe
not his othe. NowHotomā. lib. illustr. quaestion. cap. 17. 
                     vnder the name of Enemie,
I comprehend sixe sorts of people.
First, there be forraine enemies, such as
the Spaniards bee vnto vs at this instant,
who by an vniuersall consent, doe wage
warre against vs, and these are properly
to bee termed enemies. Secondly,
Rebelles, of which number wee account
the Earle of Tyrone, and the

wild Irish, who haue traitorously reuolted
from her Maiesties iurisdiction,
are to be called enemies. Thirdly, wee
name Pirats, rouers & theeues. Fourthly,
wee name aduersaries, amongst whō
ciuill discords hapneth, enemies. Fiftly,
banished persons, outlawes, and condemned
men, haue the title of enemies.
In which ranke, I place Robin Hood,
little Iohn, and their outlawde traine,
who spoylde the kings subiects. Lastly,
Fugitiues, and runnagate seruants, making
warre with their masters, deserue
the name of enemies. In the beadroll of
these enemies, flatterers, conicatchers,
slanderers, and Promooters, disturbers
of the publike rest may be added.
                  Nowe to the question, whether wee
ought to keepe touch with all these sorts
of enemies? It seemeth vnfaignedly, that
we should, as shall more manifestly appeare
by these reasons.Leuit. 19 First, * othes by
the testimonies of the scriptures,Deut. 5. are to be
obserued.Iosua. 9. Secondly, * euill is not to bee
committed,2. Sā. 21 that goodnes may ensue.
Periurie is euill,Matth. 5. therfore not to be committed,Rom. 3.
that goodnesse may ensue: no,
not although a man should lose his life

for it. Thirdly, of two euils, the least is to
bee chosen: but periurie is a greater euil
then losse of goods and landes, yea, and
which is more, it is greater then losse of
life: therefore it is better to lose life
and liuing, then to burthen our consciences
with the abominable sinne of periurie.Ambros. lib. 1. Offic. c. 29.
Fourthly, there cannot be honestie
nor quietnesse amongst vs, if wee
break our othes. Sixtly, it is no poynt of
liuely magnanimitie to engage our faith,
vnlesse wee were willing to performe it:
forPsal. 15. who shal dwel in Gods tabernacle?
who shall rest vpon his holy hil? euen he
that setteth not by himselfe. It is rather
the propertie of follie, for that a foole wil
sweare any thing for his owne safegard:
whereas a man of discretion will consider
wel, and weigh his speech as it were
by the ounce, before hee pawne it. Seuenthly,
whatsoeuer a man sweareth, and
may performe with the fauor of God, &
without sinne, that same, albeit compelled,
is to bee obserued, for the name of
God is of greater estimation, then al tē
                     porall
commodities: such is the promise
which a man sweareth vnto theeues,
because nowe and then for our amendement

GOD permitteth temptations:
therefore a man hauing sworne vnto
theeues or pirates by compulsion, may
not prophane his othe. Likewise Machiauell
is worthie of many stripes, who
counselled his Prince to put on the
foxes skinne, when his other shiftes
did faile, and to follow that yong mans
example, who said:Hippo
                        
                           •••
                        us apud 
                           •
                        uripidem. 
                     I swore an othe by
tongue, but I beare a mind vnsworne.
                  
                  
                     Obiection.
                     An Obligation whereby a man is
bound, may bee made voyde by the authoritie
of a Magistrate. Also it is a
rule in lawe: A compelled othe is no oth:
therefore a man compelled to sweare,
may choose whether hee will keepe his
othe or no.
                  
                  
                     Answere.
                     There
bee two
sorts of
obligations. 
                           The first, wherby a man is
bounde by writing vnto another
man, and this kinde
of obligation may bee made
frustrate by the Iudges.
                           The second, whereby a mā
                              
is bounde either vnto his
friendes or enemies, and this
onely belongeth to GOD,
who by them is called to record.
Moreouer, although
this obligation by othe may
bee made voyde by the publike
law, yet notwithstanding,
it remaineth stedfast in the
priuate law of a mans conscience.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  Of Heretiques and Schismatiques.
Chap. 23.
                  THey are to be accounted heretiques,
which contumatiously defend erronious
opinions in the church of Christ,
and will not by any exhortations bee
conuerted to the truth. Such were the
Arrians, that helde three degrees in the
Trinitie. Such were the Menandrians,
Manichaeans, Carpocratians, Cerinthians,
Valentinians, Somosatenians,
Nouatians, Ebionites, Noetians, Macedonians,
Douatists, Tertullianists, Pelagians,

Nestorians,Nouell. 109 praefation. §. Haereticos Wesēbec. in C. de Haeretic. & Clarus lib. 5. §. haeres. num. 13 & 14. and others, 
                        •
                      which by
Iustinian the Emperour were afterwards
condemned, their goods confiscated,
and themselues either banished or
put to death.
                  Innumerable examples cōcerning heretiques
are extant: but I will cōtent my
selfe at this time with the rehearsall onely
of two of thē, the memory wherof, is
as yet rife amongst many of vs. In the
yeere of our Lorde 1561. and the third
yeere of the raigne of Queen Elizabeth,
there was in London one William Ieffery,
that impudently affirmed Iohn
Moore a companion of his, to bee Iesus
Christ, and would not reuoke his foolish
beleefe, vntill hee was whipped from
Southwarke to Bedlem, where the saide
Moore meeting with him, was whipped
likewise, vntill they both confessed that
Christ was in heauen, & themselues but
sinfull and wicked heretiques. In like
maner, about ten yeeres ago, I my selfe
being then a scholer at Westminster,
Henry Arthingtō, & Edmond Coppinger,
two gentlemen, bewitched by one
William Hackets dissimulations, concluded
him to bee the Messias, and

thereupon ranne into Cheapside, proclaiming
the said Hacket to bee Christ.
For which hereticall or rather Diuelish
deuice they were apprehended and imprisoned:
& in the end Hacket was hanged
on a gallowes placed vp in Cheapside;
Arthington was kept in prison vpō
hope of repentance; & Coppinger died
for sorrow the next day in Bridewell.
                  Thus we see that truth, although for
a time it be darkened by a cloude, yet at
last it preuailes and gettes the victory: &
the Heretiques themselues are by Gods
speciall iudgements confounded, and
their couragious opinions in a moment
abated. Neither will it be long, ere that
the Romish Bishop, the sonne of Belial
shall seePsal. 2. his power brused with a rod
of iron, and broken in peeces like a potters
vessell: yea, himselfe2. Thes. 2. shall be consumed
with the spirit of Gods mouth,
and be abolished with the brightnes of
his comming.
               
               
                  Of Iesuites. Chap. 24.
                  IGnatius a maimed souldier, not for any
feruency or zeale, that he bare vnto
a new austerity of life, but feeling himselfe

weake any longer to souldierize &
follow the warres, communicated with
diuers persons, and among the rest with
one Pasquier Brouet, a man altogether
vnlettered & ignorāt of Diuinity. These
two together with their enchaunted cō
                     plices,
to apply their title vnto their
zeale, named thēselues deuout persons
of the society of Iesus. And thereupon
presented themselues vnto Pope Paul
the 3. about the yere of our Lord 1540.
This Pope permitted them to be called
Iesuites, but with this coūtermaund, that
they should not surpasse the number of
threescore persons. Thus for a time they
satisfied themselues. But within a while
after, they obtained greater priuiledges
of Pope Paul the fourth: which made
their troublesome order like ill weedes
to multiply a-pace, and attempt many
horrible things: yea, euen most wicked
treason against the liues of high potentates
and Princes, as against our soueraigne
Queene, against the French king,
and diuers others. In Portingal and
India they termed themselues Apostles;
but in the yeere 1562. sundry of them
were drowned by the iust iudgement

of GOD. Who is so simple, but hee
vnderstandeth, that they in naming
themselues Iesuites do goe about to degrade
the auncient Christians, and
blaspheme against GOD? rather they
should call themselues Ignatians, and
not bring in newfound orders. This
the Sorbonistes of Paris knew very wel,
when they doubted not about sixe yeers
agoe to exhibite a bill in the Parliament
against them. What shall I write,
how they giue themselues altogether
to be Machiauellians, and vngodly Politicians,
how they hoord vp wealth,
how they possesse Earledoms and Lordships
in Italy and Spaine? and yet for
all this, they presume to entitle themselues
of the society of Iesus. O wretched
caitifes! O hellish heretiques
                        •
                     
the time will come, when this outragious
profession of yours shall be extinguished
by the Sunne-shine of the
true and Apostolicall doctrine, as the
Sorcerers rod was eaten vp by Aarons
rod in the presence of Pharao.
               
            
            
               
               The fift part.
               
                  Of Magnanimity. Chap. 25.
                  
                     MAgnanimity is a vertue,
                     Arist. lib. 4. Ethic. cap. 3. 
                     that consisteth
in atchieuing of great exploits: and is
touched chiefly vpon eight occasions.
First, a magnanimous man is he, that wil
neuer be induced to enterprise any dishonest
point against any man, no not against
his vtter enemy. Secondly, he will
chuse the meane rather then the extreame.
Thirdly, he will tell his minde
plainly without dissimulation. Fourthly,
he will not respect what the common
people speake of him, nor will hee measure
his actiōs according to their applauses.
Fiftly, a magnanimous man,Osorius li. 3. Christian. nobilit. 
                     though
he should see all the world eagerly bent to
fight, and though hee should see euery thing
round about him set on fire, and almost consumed,
yet he notwithstanding through an
assured confidence will remaine constant.
Sixtly, a magnanimous man will withdraw
his mind from worldly affaires, &
lift it vp to the contemplation of great
matters,Psal. 1. 
                     and in Gods law will he exercise

himselfe day and night. Seuenthly, a magnanimous
man wil scorne vices, and forget
iniuries. Eightly, he will speake nothing
but wise and premeditated words,
according to that old saying: A barking
dog wil neuer proue good biter, and the
deepest riuers runne with least noise.
                  The auncient Christians of the primitiue
Church were right examples of
this vertue Magnanimity, as they, who
had all the properties thereof imprinted
in thē. They, I say, who cheerefully gaue
themselues to be massacred and tormented.
Like vnto these were our late English
martyrs in Queene Maries daies,
who gladly in defence of the true religion
yeelded themselues to fire and fagot.
For the vndoubted beleefe of triumph
in heauen both diminished and
tooke away the corporall griefe, and replenished
the mind with cheerfulnesse
and ioy. They knew mans lyfe to be
but a bubble on the face of the earth.
They considered with themselues our
miserable estate; for assoone as wee are
borne, wee seeme to flourish for a small
moment, but straightway wee die, and
there is litle memorial left behind. They

knew Magnanimity to be the ornament
of all the vertues. Briefly, they perswaded
thēselues to see their sauiour Christ
in heauen, and euermore to dwell with
him. These, these be the duties of magnanimous
men, which whosoeuer do
couet to embrace, shall at last attaine to
euerlasting happines.
                  
                     Obiection.
                     All scornefull men are wicked:Arist. lib. 4. Ethic. ca. 3. 
                        magnanimous
men are scornefull: therfore they
are wicked.
                  
                  
                     Aunswere.
                     There
bee two
sortes of
scornefull
men, 
                           That scorne mens persons,
and they are wicked.
                           That scorne vices, & they
are good: after which maner
magnanimous or greatminded
men do scorne insolent
men & dastardes by reason
of their pride and cowardize.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  Of Ambition. Chap. 26.
                  IN ambition there be fiue mischiefes.
The first is, that causeth a man neither
to abide a superiour nor an equall. The
secōd, an ambitious man by attributing

honour vnto himselfe, goeth about to
defraud God of his due. The 3. plague
in ambition is, that it considereth not
what hath chaunced to such, as exercised
it.Bembus li. 2. Venet. hist. 
                     Lodowicke Sforcia vncle to Iohn Galeaze
Duke of Millan whom he poysoned,
was one of the most ambitious men in the
world; but yet for all his Italian trickes
Gnicciardin. li. 4. Histor.
                     he was at last in the yeere 1510. taken
captiue by the French King, and put in prison,
where he continued till hee died. Cardinall
Wolsey likewise here in England
may serue for a patterne of ambition,
who beyng preferred by King Henry
the eight her maiesties Father, would
notwithstanding haue exalted himselfe
aboue the King, for which his intolerable
ambition his goods were cōfiscated,
and himselfe apprehended. The fourth
mischiefe in ambition is, that hee hunteth
after false and deceitfull glory, and
Persius Satyr. 1.
                     thinkes it a faire thing to be pointed at
with the finger, and to be talked of: This is
he. The fift, an ambitious man waigheth
not his owne frayelty and weaknesse.
               
               
                  
                  Remedies against ambition.
Chap. 27.
                  THe forward horse is not holden back
without foaming and shewing his fury.
The streame that rūneth, is not staied
contrary to the course thereof without
making a noise: & the ambitious man is
not reclaimed frō his aspiring thoughts
without good and wholesome admonitions;
I will neuerthelesse, as well as I
can, endeuour to cure him of his cankered
malady.
                  First, let the ambitious man consider
whereof he is made, namely, of dust &
ashes. Secondly, he must diligently goe
to heare Sermons, and read the holy Bible.
Thirdly, he must thinke vpon the
wauering actions of fortune, how she taketh
frō one that, which she trāsferreth
on another, and how she respecteth not
the equity of causes, nor y• merits of persons,
but maketh her fancy the measure
of her affections. Fourthly, let the ambitious
haue a regard whether hee be
commēded of wise men or of flatt
                        •
                     rers.
Fiftly, let him compare his owne deeds
with those of the holy mēs in times past.

Sixtly, hee must not enquire what the
common people say of him. Seuenthly,
let him take heed by other mens
harmes, and muse vpon the case of those
men, who desiring to eate some fruite,
regarded not the height of the tree,
whereon they grew, but laboured to
climbe vp to the toppe, and so fel downe
headlong by reason of the weakenes of
the boughes.
               
               
                  Of Fortitude. Chap. 28.
                  THe meanes to discerne a valiaunt
man be eight. The first, if he be not
astonied in aduersity, nor proud in prosperity,
but leading both the one & the
other within the square of Mediocrity.
Secondly, he is a valiaunt man, that is
milde and courteous of nature. Thirdly,
ifEurip. in Rhes. 
                     he scornes priuily to ouercome his aduersary.
Fourthly, if hee contemne to
fight in a bad quarrell, forAmbr. li. 1. Offi. 
                     fortitude
without equitie is the fewell of iniquity.
Fiftly, if heeVirg. li. 6. Aeneid. 
                     giue not place to miseries,
but goeth the more couragiously agaynst
them. Sixtly, he is a valiant man, that
sorroweth to die an inglorious death.

Seuenthly, that feareth shame. AsAristot. lib. 3. Ethic. ca. 8 
                     Hector
did, when his friendes counselled him
not to goe out of the city. Eightly, hee is a
valiaunt man, that will fight stoutly in
his Countries defence, and not feare
to die. Such a one was CaptaineHomer. lib. 22. Iliad. Diagio
of Millan,Machiauel. li. 4 Histor. Florent. who in the yeere of our
Lord 1400. beyng enuironed with
fire and enemies, not finding any means
to defend his charge, or escape honestly
with life, threw ouer the wall of the
place, where he was inclosed, and where
no fire as yet burned, certaine clothes
and straw, and vpon the same his two
children, and sayd to his enemies, Take
you here those goods which Fortune
gaue me, but my goods of mind wherein
my glory consisteth neyther will I
giue them, nor can you take them from
mee. The enemies saued the poore
children, and offred him ladders to conueigh
himselfe downe safe. But hee refusing
all succours, chose rather to die
in the fire, then receyue life from the
enemies of his countrey. What shall
I speake of sir Philip Sydney, sir Richard
Greeneuil, and sundry others of
our owne countrymen, who of late

yeeres not vnlike to those of auncient

                  Of Foole-hardinesse.
Chapt. 29.
                  FOole-hardinesse is the excesse of fortitude,
vsed for the most part of Caualeers
and tosse-pots. For seldome is it
seene, that they at any time haue fought
in iust causes, or haue obserued the
circumstances belonging to true Fortitude.
                  Their properties rather are to flaunt
like Peacockes, to play the Braggadochians,
and to trust most impudently in
the hugenesse of their lims, and in their
drunken gates. Such are many of our
yong Gentlemen, who by their wise parents
are sent so timely to learne wise fashiōs
at Lōdon. Such are they, I say, who

cary beehiues and commonwealths in
their pates, who iet now and then in
the streetes with bushes of feathers on
their Cockescombed sconces, and goe
attired in Babilonian rayments. But the
higher they exalt themselues, the greater
will be their fall. In the forefront of
these madde-cappes may the Duke
of Guise appeare, who in the yeere
1588. one day before he was slaine,
as he sate at dinner, found a litle scrowle
of paper vnder his trencher, wherein
was written that hee should looke vnto
himselfe, and that his death was prepared.
But hee in the same paper rashly
with his owne hande wrote these
wordes: They dare not, and so threw
it vnder the table.
                  By whose example let men take
heed how they persist in any thing rashly,
for although the Poetes say, that
Virg. lib. 4. Aenei. & Ouid. lib. 10. Metam.
                     Fortune helpeth an audacious man, yet
notwithstanding that helpe is quickly

then neuer.
                  
                     
                     Obiection.
                     An audacious Braggadochian being
knocked runneth away: therefore there
is no difference betwixt a foolehardy
man and a coward.
                  
                  
                     Aunswere.
                     Two things are
to be respected
in a foolehardy
Braggadochian. 
                           1 Madhardinesse or
rashnes, which leadeth
him into daunger.
                           2 Weaknes of nature
not agreable to
his mind: & this is the
cause, why he trusteth
sometimes vnto his
heeles, rather thē his
hands.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  Of feare and Pusillanimity. Cha. 30.
                  EVen as the foole-hardy Caualeer
trauerseth vp and downe like a Lion:
so a fearefull man is a pusillanimous
meacocke: he feareth his owne shadow
by the way as he trauelleth, and iudgeth
ech bush to be a rouer. When he is among
Gentlemen, he holdeth his head
downe like a dunce, and suddenly sneaketh
away like an vrcheon. He is either

by nature melancholike, or by vse a niggard
or a tenderling, such a one was that
Gentleman of Portingall, who craued of
king Sebastian in the yeere 1572. a protection
against some, who had sworne
his death. The king gaue it him. Shortly
after he came againe vnto the king, and
complained vnto him of the great feare
he was daily in, notwithstāding his protection.
Whereunto the king wisely answeared:
from feare I cānot protect you.
Farre more feareful then this Portingall
was that yong Gentleman of Patauine,
who of late yeeres beyng in prison vpon
some accusation, heard by one of his
friēds, that of certainty he should be executed
the next day following. Which
newes so terrified & chāged him, that in
one only night he became white & grai-headed,
whereas before there was no appearance
thereof. The cause of this so
wonderfull an alteratiō was feare, which
groūded vpon a false opinion of mischief
seazed on his heart, and consumed it
like a pestilent canker according to
that saying:Arist. li. 2. Physic. 
                     A suddaine alteration hath
no great beginning. And again,Vegetius lib. 3. de remilit. 
                     Vsuall
things are seldome feared. For being long

expected, how can they chuse but fall
out lightly? To conclude, it isTerent. in Eunuch. 
                     the first

maner of feare.

                  Of Temperance and Continence.
Chapt. 30.
                  ALl vertues do make a Commonwealth
happy and peaceable: but
temperance alone is the sustayner
of ciuill quietnesse, for it taketh
care that the realme bee not corrupted
with riot and wanton delights,
whereby diuerse states haue beene cast
away. This is that vertue which hindreth
dishonest actions, which restrayneth
pleasures within certaine bounds,
and which maketh men to differ from
bruite beastes. Moreouer, this is that
Homer. lib. 10. Odyss.
                     hearbe, which Mercury gaue to Vlisses, least
he should tast of the enchauntres cup, & so
with his felows be trāsform'd into a hog.

& this is that vertue, which great men
ought specially to embrace, that by their
example the common sort might become
temperate. ForAristot. lib. 1. Ethic. ca. 5. 
                     this is the reason
why so many now-adayes liue riotously like
beastes, namely, because they see noblemen
and magistrates, that gouerne the commonwealth,
to lead their liues wantonly, as Sardanapalus
did. Therefore let noblemen
be temperate, and spend lesse in showes
and apparell, that they may keepe better
hospitality then they doe, and benefit
the poore. Let them, I say, imitate
those famous wights, who voluntarily
resigned vp their large portions in this
world, that they might liue the more
contentedly. A murath the second, Emperour
of the Turkes, after he had gotten
infinite victories, became a Monke

Emperour of Germany gaue vp his Empire
into the hands of the Princes Electours,
and withdrew himselfe in the
yeere 1557. into a monastery. The like
of late did the tyrant his sonne king Philip
of Spaine. What shal I say of Daniel,
and his three companions Ananias,

Azarias, and Misael? did they not choose
to sustaine themselues with pulse, when
as they f might haue had a portion of the
kings meate?Daniel. 1. seeing therefore by these
examples wee perceiue, howe great the
force of Temperance is ouer the greedy
affections of the minde, let vs deuoutly
loue her, and through her loue, obserue
a meane in our pleasures and sorrowes.
               
               
                  Of Intemperance, and Incontinence.
Chap. 31.
                  INtemperaunce is an ouerflowing in
pleasures, desperately constraining all
reason, in such sort, that nothing is able
to stay him from the execution of his
lusts. For that cause there is a difference
betweene it and incontinence, namely,
that an incontinent man knoweth full,
that the sinne which hee commits is sin,
and had intended not to follow it, but
being ouermastered by his Lordly perturbations,
hee yeeldeth in a manner against
his will thereunto: whereas the
intemperate man sinneth of purpose, esteeming
it a goodly thing, and neuer
repents him once of his wickednesse.

Wherehēce I conclude, that an intemperate
man is incurable, and farre worse
then the incontinent: for the incontinent
man being perswaded with wholesome
counselles, will bee sorie for his offence,
and wil striue to ouercome his passions.
But to make both, aswell the intemperate
man, as the incontinent hatefull
vnto vs: Let vs call to minde, howe
they do nothing else, but thinke on their
present prouender and rutting. Also, wee
must consider, how that intemperance is
that goggle-eyed Venus, which hindereth
honest learning, which metamorphozeth
a man into a beast, and
which transformeth simple wretches into
tosse-potted asses: wherefore I wish
all men of what qualitie soeuer they bee,
to take heede of this vice, least they either
be accounted beasts, or aliue bee
reckoned among the number of the
dead.
               
               
                  Of Lecherie. Chap. 33.
                  LEcherie is a short pleasure, bringing
in long paine, that is, it expelleth vertue,

shorteneth life, & maketh the soule
guiltie of abominable sinne. This vice
I feare mee, is too rife here in England,
for howe many Vrsulaes haue wee like
that princely Vrsula, who with eleuen
thousand Virgins more in her companie
being taken by the Painime fleete,
as they were sayling into little Britaine,
for the defence of their chastities, were al
of them most tyrannically martyred? In
steed of Vrsulaes, I doubt, we haue curtezans,
and whorish droyes, who with
their brayed drugs, periwigs, vardingals,
false bodies, trunk sleeues, spanish white,
pomatoes, oyles, powders, and other
glozing fooleries too long to bee recounted,
doe disguise their first naturall
shape, onely sophistically to seeme fayre
vnto the outwarde viewe of tame and
vndiscreete woodcocks. Yet notwithstanding,
lette a man beholde them at
night or in the morning, and hee shall
finde them more vgly and lothsome
then before: and I cannot so well liken
them, as to Millers wiues, because
they looke as though they were beaten
about their faces with a bagge of
meale. But what enfueth after all these

artificiall inuentions? the vengeance of
God.Esay 3.

                  Of Gluttonie and Drunkennesse.
Chap. 34
                  OF Gluttonie there bee foure kindes.
The first hapneth, when a man causeth
his meate to bee made readie before
due and ordinarie time for pleasure, and
not for necessitie. The seconde, when a
man curiously hunteth after diuersities
and daintie meate. The third, when hee
eateth more then sufficeth nature. The
last, when wee eate our meate too greedily
and hungrily, like vnto dogs.
                  Now to come to drunkennesse, I find
that there bee three sorts thereof. The
first, when wee being verie thirstie, not
knowing the force of the drinke, doe vnwittingly
drinke our selues drunke: and
this can be no sinne. The second, when
we vnderstand that the drinke is immoderate,
and for all that, wee respect not
our weake nature, which vnawares becommeth
cup-shot; and this is a kind of
sinne. The third, when we obstinatelie
do perseuere in drinking, and this certainely,
is a grieuous and intolerable
sinne.
               
               
                  
                  The discommodities of
drunkennesse.
Chap. 35.
                  THe discommodities of drunkennesse
are many:Prou. 20. & 23. Ioel. 2. first, (c) it displeaseth God:
secondly, it is vndecent and filthie: for
doth not a drunken mans eies look red,
bloudy,Luke. 16. and staring? doth not his tongue
falter? doth not his breath stinke? is not
his nose fierie and wormeaten? are not his
wits dead, according to that: When the
ale is in, witte is out? doth not his bodie
shiuer?Horatius lib. 1. Epistol. In breefe, What doth not drunkennesse
signifie? it discloseth secrets, it maketh
the vnarmed man to thrust himselfe into the
warres, and causeth the carefull minde
to become quite voyde of care. The
third discommoditie of drunkennesse
is, that it shorteneth life, defaceth
beautie, and corrupteth the whole
worlde. For howe can it otherwise bee,
when GOD blesseth not the meate

and drinke within our bodies? Fourthly,
drunkennesse i
                        •
                      the cause of the losse
of time.Esay. 5. Fiftly, Hell gapeth and openeth
her mouth wide, that the multitude and
wealth of them that delight therein, may goe
downe into it. For proofe whereof, I
will declare one notable example, taken
out of the Anatomie of Abuses.
About twentie yeeres since, there dwelt
eight men, Citizens and Citizens
Sonnes of Swaden a Cittie of Germanie,
who vpon a Sunday morning, agreed
to goe into a Tauerne, and comming
to the house of one Antonie
Hage, an honest man, and zealouslie
giuen, they called for wine. The
good man tolde them that they should
haue none, before Sermon time was
past, and perswaded them to goe heare
the woord preached. But they (saue
one Adam Giebens, who aduised
them to heare the Sermon for feare of
GODS wrath) denyed, saying, that
they loathed that kinde of exercise.
The good Oast neither giuing them
any Wine himselfe, nor permitting any
other, went to the Sermon. Who being
gone, they fel to cursing, & wishing that

he might breake his necke before he returned:
whereupon the diuell appeared
vnto them in the shape of a yong man,
bringing in his hand a flagon of wine, &
drunke vnto them, saying: Good fellowes,
be merrie, for you shall ha
                        •
                     e wine
inough, & I hope you wil pay me well.
Then they inconsiderately aunswered,
that they would paye him, or else they
would gage their neckes, yea, their bodies
and soules, rather thē to faile. Thus
they continued swilling and bibbing so
long, till they could scant see one another.
At the last, the Diuell their tapster
told them, that they must needs pay
their shot: whereat their hearts waxed
cold. But he comforting them, sayd: Be
of good cheere, for now must you drinke
boyling lead, pitch; and brimstone with
me in the pit of hell for euermore. Herevpon
hee made their eyes appeare like
fire, and in breadth as broad as a sawcer:
and ere they could call for grace & mercie,
the diuell preuented them, & brake
their necks asunder. The other Adam
Giebens, who counselled them before
to heare Gods word, hauing some sparks
of faith within him, was preserued from

death, by the great mercie of God.
                  After this sort God punished drunkennesse,
to the terrour of all such as delight
therein. God grant that men hereafter
may beware, howe they play the
drunkards. For doubtlesse, although he
beares with our quaffers heere in England,
yet notwithstanding, hee hath prepared
heauie punishments for them in
the world to come.
               
               
                  Remedies against intemperance, gluttony, and
drunkennesse. Chap. 36.
                  THe first remedie against intemperance,
gluttonie, and drunkennesse, is
the word of God: forMatth. 4 (e)it is written, Man
shal not liue by bread only, but by euerie word
that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
The second, they must consider the fasting
and pouertie of Christ, for when he
said, I thirst, that is, I thirst after mans saluation,Iohā. 19
                     they gaue him Vineger to drinke.
The thirde remedie is, that they waigh
with themselues the euill, which proceedeth
from their vices, and the torments
of the rich glutton in hell. The fourth,
lette them thinke on the eternall pleasures

of the other world, andMatt. 5. 
                     hunger &
thirst after righteousnesse. The fift, lette
them follow Socrates aduice,Plut. de curiosit. et Xenop. lib. 1. de dict. & fact. Socrat. 
                     Who admonished
men to take heede from eating and
drinking those things, which would mooue
them not being hungrie, nor thirstie: and also
from prying into Gentlewomens
beauties, lest, as the Poets faine, Cupid
the blinde God of loue, doe perchance
shoote and hit them. This reasonElian. li. 3. vari. hist. c. 30 
                     Clitomachus
knew very wel, who if he heard but
one talking of loue matters, would immediatly
depart away. Lastly, let them auoyde
idlenesse; forOuid. li. 1. de remed. amo. 
                     Idlenesse being taken away,
the force of lechery decayeth.
                  
               
               
                  Of stupiditie or dulnesse. Chap. 37.
                  STupiditie is a voluntarie and too great
a suppression of lawful pleasures. This
viceArist. li. 3. Ethic. cap. 11. 
                     is seldome founde amongst men:
for where shall we see any so dull, that hath
no taste of pleasures? All other liuing creatures
can iudge and discerne of the meat
which they eate: but dull men haue not
halfe so much iudgement or discretion.
Therefore without doubt, they that haue
lost their feeling, are no more to be called
liuing men, but blocks, or stocks, or

rather bruite beastes depriued of sence.
There bee some men I confesse, verie
bluntish and dull, yet notwithstanding, I
dare not say, that they are in such sort infected
by reason of this vice, the defect
of Temperance; but more likely they are
so, because of their vnwholsome & bad
complections, or else because of some
sicknesse or other. And thus much of the
nature of Stupiditie.
                  
                     Obiection.
                     Stupiditie is a meane to obtaine vertue,
for it is a bridling of lust: therefore it
is no vice.
                  
                  
                     Answere.
                     Stupiditie is a bridling of lust, but confusedly,
without wit or reason.

                     Arist. li. 4. Ethic. cap. 2. 
                     THe like difference as is between God &
man, between a temple & a sepulcher,
such is betwixt magnificēce & liberality: for
Ibid.
                     magnificence is a vertue, that consisteth in
sumptuous & great expences: wheras liberalitie
is cōuersāt in smal things, so y• the

one is peculiar to Noblemen, and the other
to common Gentlemen. But in this
age it is quite abandoned. They were
wont in times past, to patronize and
find poore schollers at the Vniuersitie:
But now, I pray you, who is so noble-minded?
who so vertuous? They were
wont to builde Colledges: but now they
are readie to pull them downe; and
which is more, if any intendes but to
build a free-schoole or an hospital (which
is as seldome seene as a blacke swanne)
wee account him, as they say, one of
God Almighties fooles. The Gentlemen
of the Innes of Court, quoth y• rich chuffes,
weare so much on their backes, as would
serue for the building of free-schooles. Our
sonnes at the Vniuersitie spende yeerely in
batles, decrements, and bookes, as much at
would suffice for the repayring of bridges,
high-waies, and such like. Those preachers
please our mindes best, which preach fayth,
and no good workes. This cheape religion we
like; a strong barne, Neighbour, is worth fifteene
of their freeschooles. But alas, howe
can the poore sheepe doe well, when
their sheepheardes bee cold in charitie?
when these non residents care not how

their flockes thriue? when the Leuits of
Iesus Christ haue alwaies this worldly
theoreme in their mouthes: Hee ought to
bee begd for a foole, that gathereth not for
his wife and children? O politicke worldlings!
O Machiauellians! The Papistes,
that in a manner builde their whole deuotion
vpon good workes, shall rise against
you at the day of Iudgement: yea,

their substance vnto Idols, shall testifie
against you. What sayth your Nazianzene?

ruine.
               
               
                  Of Liberalitie. Chap. 39.
                  LIberalitie is a vertue placed between
prodigalitie and auarice,Arist. li. 4. Ethic. cap. 1. 
                     Conuersant
most commonly in giuing, & sometimes in receiuing;
whereby not onely the participation
of gifts & money are meant, but
also the communication of good counsels
and duties are vnderstood. All they
which exercise this vertue, doe purchase
vnto themselues loue and good will,
which be of great momēt, either to liue
quietly, or to rule without trouble:
Hor. li, 2. Od. 2 & Mart. lib. 8. Epigram.
                     Their fame shall neuer fall from the earth,
and they themselues shall bee highly fauoured
of the highest landlord. ForOui. lib. 5. Fastor. 
                     oftentimes
when God meanes to send his thunderbolts
against the wicked, hee stayeth his
hand by reason of their sacrifices & almes.
                  Now to come to the anatomizing of
liberalitie, I putte downe eight circumstances,
whereby a Gentleman may become
liberal, & so vphold his reputatiō.
The first lawe of liberalitie is, to distribute
vnto them, who are most worthie:
Otherwise, he is like a blinde man, when

he knoweth not to whō he giueth: namely,
he must obserue the order of nature,
in preferring his brethren before his
cosens, & his cosens before strangers, &
Macr lib. 2. saturnal.
                     in rewarding of wise men, before sycophāts
& pickthanks. The second circumstance
is, that a man giue not more, then his abilitie
wil afford, but rather he must cut
out his coate in proportion according to
his cloth: becausePlinius iuni. lib. 7. Epist. 
                     repentance followeth
hastie liberalitie. The third, hee must not
giue to thē, which haue inough alreadie.
The fourth, he must not, after he hath
bestowed his gifts, cast and hitte men in
the teeth with them, or by his prating,
cause the remembraunce of his gifts to
perish. The fift rule of liberalitie, a man
must not hurt one, that he may be liberal
to another, for they that do this, are neither
to bee accounted beneficall nor liberall,
but pernicious. The sixt, he must
giue willingly without requesting, for
nothing is more deere then that, which
is bought by praiers. Hitherto appertayneth
the Apostles saying:2. Cor. 9. 
                     As euerie
man wisheth in his heart, so lette him
giue, not grudgingly, nor of necessitie:
for GOD loueth a cheerefull Giuer.
                     
The seuenth, lette him respect the place,
where hee giueth, that is, whether in
an honest house, or in an infamous. The
last law of liberalitie is, that it be without
shipwracke or losse of the giuers
good name.
                  But why doe I decipher that, which
nowe a dayes men haue vtterly abandoned?
Where in England, nay, where in
the world, can I poynt with my finger, &
say: There is a liberall man? Alas, al men
are become misers, there are none that
are liberall, no, not one. O vngrateful
wretcheslis not God your Landlord, and
doth not hee suffer you to enioye his
lands without in comes or fines? Onely
this is his conditiō, that ye vse the poore
well, and cherish the needie: why then
are yee couetous, why doe yee not performe
his condition, and bee liberall? It
behooues you rather to lay vp riches in
heauen, and not to beleeue, that this fickle
and doating worlde, is a perpetuall
paradise, & that the drossie excrements
therof, are hallowed. Communicat therfore
your goods one vnto another, for
treasure remaineth prepared for the
godly in heauē. Let not the hellish vsurer

haue dominion ouer you: he is Plutus
(as the Poets faigne) the God of your
riches. Beware of his fawnings, take
heede of his motiues and illusions; hee
commeth disguised in the forme of an
Angell of light, perswading you by sophistrie,
that liberalitie is a vice, that
golden duckets are demie Gods. But
what followeth after all these fallacies?
death, and the vengeance of the highest.
To be short, as many as are well disposed
to be liberall, let them giue in their liues
time, whilst they haue space to giue. It is
foolishnesse for any man to defer his liberalitie
till after his death: for executors
will part stakes; and besides, almes
at that time, will do the giuers no good.
               
               
                  Of Prodigalitie. Chap. 40.
                  
                     Arist. lib. 4. Ethic. 
                     PRodigalitie is a foolish and vndiscreete
wasting and lauishing of goods: for the
which pouertie and late repentance doe
ensue. The rare follower of this vice careth
not for circumstances, but spendeth
his money vpon such things, wherof
hee leaueth little remembrance or
none at all behind him: he neuer thinks

on the variable blasts of fortune: but ignominiously
cōsumeth his patrimony in
a baudy or infamous house, and if there
were giuen him as much moneyBoetius lib. 2. de Consolat. Philosop. metr. 2. 
                     as the
sea turneth vp sand, when it is tossed with the
raging winds: yet for all that a prodigall
mā will deuour al, & at last will be forced
to pill & poll his poore tenāts, supplying
his wāts ambitiously by vnlawful means.
                  Into the listes of this vice many of our
English Caualeers & souldiers do enter,
who bestow al that they haue on gorgeous
raiments & in visiting of queanes:
Wheras rather they should cōsider with
thēselues,Pers. satyr. 3. 
                     what they are, how they meane to
liue hereafter, of what vocation they are, &
what profit they may reape by sauing their
money. It becommeth them not to follow
crowes abroad through thicke & thinne:
but to respect, whither they go. It becō
                     meth
thē, I say, not to imitate Bedlems,
who iourney still that way, where the
staffe falleth. God hath appointed euery
man to be of some calling or other. To
cōclude, they deceiue thēselues in thinking,
that prodigality doth ingraffe in thē
a kind of liberality: forTacitus lib. 1. Histor. 
                     many know how
to spend, but not, how to giue.
                  
               
               
                  
                  The properties of a couetous man.
Chapt. 40.
                  THe properties of a couetous mā are
infinit, but principally these: First a
couetous man is an Infidel, for he loueth
not his brethren, and1. Ioh. 4. 
                     he that loueth not,
knoweth not God, for God is loue. Secondly,
he is a theefe, for the goods that hee
possesseth, are none of his owne, but
Gods. Man is only constituted as a steward,
and must one day to his perpetuall
destruction, yeeld an account thereof.
Further, it is knowen, thatArist. li. 1. Politi. 
                     theft, and sundry
other vices spring chiefly from couetousnesse.
Thirdly, a couetous man is a slaue,
for he attendeth & wayteth on his money.
Fourthly, he is in continuall feare
and suspition, least theeues robbe him
of his treasure, least his ewes haue no
good yeaning, least the flouds cary away
his milles, and least there happen a
wette yeere.
                  Fiftly,Iuuenal. Satyr. 14 
                     a couetous man is alway vexed
and agrieued in minde, for if his wife asketh
for two shillinges to buy silke,
sixe pence for spice or salte; then hee

frets and fumes, yelles and bannes, swearing
that she seekes his vtter vndooing.
Sixtly, hee hath most commonly three
keyes or more to his chest, and which is
worse, threescore in his heart to keepe
them from spending. Lastly, a couetous
man offendeth against the second commandement,
for hee worships Idols, in
reposing so much confidence in his
money.

                  ALbeit thatSeneca in Hercu. O
                           •
                        te, 
                     nature is little inough to satisfie
a niggards mind, because hee is
insatiable: yet notwithstanding, I will
endeuor to bring him into the right way:
first, let him thinke vpon theAmo. 6. fearefull
alarums,Esay 5. which God by his Prophets
sounded against all couetous men.Luk. 6. Secondly,
let him consider the pouertie of
Christ.Iud. 2. Thirdly, let him weigh with himselfe,
how nature is content with a little,
as for example,1. Reg. 19. 
                     Elias was glad to eate
bread and water:
                     Dan. 1. 
                     Daniel satisfied himselfe
with pulse:
                     Luke. 3. 
                     Saint Iohn Baptist liued on locusts
and wilde honey. Fourthly, let the couetous

man keepe good companie, and
follow them that are vertuously disposed.
Fiftly, let him thinke on the euerlasting
riches of the other world. Sixtly,
lette him consider of his ende and death.
Lastly, let the couetous man examine
himselfe, and muse vpon the vnhappie
liues and punishments, of such as haue
beene couetous.
                  Calipha the Soldan of Egypt, hauing
filled a Tower with golde and pretious
stones, and being in war with Allan the
king of Tartarie, was at last taken captiue
by him, & famished in that tower,
wherein his treasure lay. More strange is
that, which is reported of an Archbishop
of Mogunce, who in the yeere of
our Lorde 1518. foreseeing that corne
would the next yeere be sold at an extreame
rate, gathered together great
store, and whorded the same vp in certaine
garners, which he had built for the
same purpose; not with a godly intent to
bring downe the price, but rather to enhaunce
it for his own priuate commoditie.
But behold the iudgements of God;
his seruants the next yeere ouerturning
this whorded corne, founde cleane contrarie

to their expectations snakes, adders,
and vermine so thicke crept in, that
it was impossible to saue ought thereof.
The like, as I heard, hapned about a dozen
yeeres agoe vnto a wicked niggard
here in England. Also, to mine owne remembrance,
there was one in the yeere
1589. that sent foure bushels of wheat
(euery one consisting of two bushels &
a halfe of Winchester measure) into the
market, and was offred 22. shillings for
euery bushell, which he refused, hoping
to get 2. shillings more on the next market
day. But see the reward of couetousnes:
wheat was thē sold for 16. shillings,
& within 2. markets after for a noble, in
somuch that that man, which refused to
take 22. shillings for euery bushell, was
now glad to haue a noble for the same.
Likewise a certain knight of Oxfordshire
punished very iustly (but ouerseuerely)
the couetousnes of a priest, that denied
the seruice of his office in the burying of
a dead body, because his widow had not
wherwith to pay him ye costs of the funeral.
For the Knight himselfe going to the
buriall, caused the minister to be bound
to ye corps, & so to be cast both into one
graue. Which done, he rode straightway

to the Court, & with some intercession
begd his pardō of Q. Mary. The like fact
I heard was put in practize by Iohn Maria
Duke of Millan aboue an 100. yeers
since. What shall I speake of the couetousnes
of one Peter Vnticaro a Spaniard?
who with certaine other Christians,
to the nūber of 263. hauing bene a long
time withholden captiues in Alexandria
by the great Turke, at lēgth in the yeere
of our Lord 1577. conspired together
for their deliuery, & by good lucke killed
the Gailer, and then entring into his
chāber, foūd a chest, wherin were great
store of double duckets, which this Peter
Vnticaro, & two more opening, stuffed
thēselues so ful as they could therewith,
between their shirts & their skin▪ which
th'other Christiās wold not once touch,
but said, that it was their liberty, which
they sought for, to the honour of God, &
not to make a mart of the infidels wicked
treasure. Yet did these words sinke nothing
into their stomacks. But within a
while after, in a skirmish with the warder
of ye prison, P. Vnticaro & th'other 2. that
were armed with ye duckets, were slain,
as not able to weild thēselues, being so

pestered with the weight and vneasie
carriage of the duckets.
                  Now to end these remedies and fearfull
punishments executed on couetous
persons, I hold, that1. Tim. 6. 
                     couetousnesse is the
roote of all euill, & the cheefest cause why
God is offended with vs: to which also
by his Prophet he pronounceth wo, saying,Esay. 5.
                     Woe bee vnto them that ioyne house to
house, and lay field to field.

Chap. 43.
                  HAuing heard so many remedies and
fearefull examples, awake yee couetous
men, and seeke to bee rich in God,
and not in the fraile riches of this world,
which consume away like rust, before
you haue any fruition of them. Distribute
your goods vnto the needie, and
purchase no more then serues your necessitie:
yee knowe not whether your
lands and goods shall be taken from you
by the Turkes, Spaniardes, suretiships,
fire, subsidies in the time of war, or any
other discōmodities. In the yeere 1588.
diuers rich Farmers and niggardes hearing

that the Spanish nauie was cōming
to inuade this realme, and fearing therby
the losse of all their graine and money
which they had by the sea side, trāsported
as much as they might into safer
places: euen so, ye that bee rich, being
aduertised of the wauering case of this
world, see ye transport so much of your
wealth, as possibly you may, into the
house and purses of the poore: commit, I
say, the custodie of your substaunce to
Christ himself, who in the day of Iudgement
will redeliuer the same vnto you
with a glorious interest, & with a crown
of gladnesse. Remember the wordes of
Christ: 
                        •
                      
                     O fooles, this night shall your soules
be taken from you,
                     Luk. 12. 
                     then whose shall those
things bee, which ye haue prepared? Euen
theirs, who will make hauocke of them,
and neuer thanke you once. Forget
not what hee commaundeth you in
another place.Matth. 10. 
                     Possesse not gold nor siluer,
for
                     Mar. 10 
                     it is hard for them that haue riches, to enter
into the kingdome of God: andIbid. 
                     It is easier
for a Cammell to goe through the eye of a
needle, then for a rich man to enter into heauen.
Wherefore, O ye rich, be not like
to a dogge lying in the hay, which when

he cannot eate himselfe, he will not with
his barking, suffer the poore horses to
eate thereof. Oh resemble not cammels,
who though they goe loaden with treasure,
yet they eate nothing but hay. In
fine, repent and turne to God, for hee is
mercifull, and woulde not your destruction:
 Giue almes,
                     Luc. 12. 
                     and make you bagges
which waxe not olde, and a treasure which
can neuer faile in heauen, where no theefe
commeth, neither moth corrupteth.
                  
               
               
                  Whether the couetous man be worse then the
prodigall. Chap. 44.
                  
                     COuetousnes is one of the desires beside
nature,
                     Arist. lib. 1. Physic. and therefore more detestable
thā prodigality, which for the most
part, issueth from a generous spirit, and
hath some tokens of grace and repentance:
whereas contrariwise, couetousnes
springeth in such, as are of base & dunghilled
thoughts, which hardly may bee
lift vp from the earth, and is so bred and
inueterated in the bone, that it will neuer
be rooted out. In a worde, the prodigall
man doth good vnto many, by his
lauish gifts, & by wise counsels may be

brought to the square of liberalitie; but
the couetous man benefiteth none; and
(as I sayd before) is incurable, and as it
were sicke of a dropsie, by reason of a
dayly habite, which he hath taken in coueting.
                  
                     Obiection.
                     He that hurteth himself, is worse then
he that hurteth another; but such is the
prodigall man: therefore hee is worse
then the couetous man.
                  
                  
                     Answere.
                     The couetous man hurteth himselfe,
and others worse, by keeping that in his
chest, which might credite himselfe, and
releeue the needie: whereas on the contrarie,
the prodigall man purchaseth
friendes and good will by his spending,
and otherwhiles helpeth others in their
distresses.

                  NOt onely reason consenteth, but also
experiēce confirmeth, that of whō
clemencie is abandoned, in him al other
vertues are abolished: for what maketh a

man seeme a God? doth not clemencie?
surely, there is nothing that draweth
neerer vnto Diuinitie then it. The consideration
wherof, procured by the contemplation
of the notable frame of man;
prouoketh vs to bee zealous, and earnest
to do our neighbour good, as not ignorant,
howe that the pure grace and mercie
of God, doe shine in euerie iust and
honest man. Wherefore, let Princes,
Noblemen, and Gentlemen, who know
what vertue is, consider in howe vast a
sea of inconueniences they wade connually
for all their superficiall ports. Let
them, I say, waigh with themselues, that
they bee but men; and if for a momentarie
while they frowne, and scorne to
looke on their inferiours: what, will
not the mightie Iehouah, who noteth all
mens hearts and gestures, contemne thē
likewise: yea, yea, he wil also strike them
with most horrible dartes of vengeance:
therefore, for feare of the same, let men
behaue themselues curteously, and imitate
those famous wights, who by their
curtesies haue merited perpetual honor.

                     stable
to chastise the rebellion of Burdeaux,
afterward gaue out a generall absolution,
and forgaue euerie man. The
like courtesie did the Duke of Guise, albeit
he was a most bloudy tyrant, shewe
vnto the Prince of Condie his prisoner,
in that he spake reuerently vnto him, vsed
him kindly, and permitted him to lie
with him in one bed, which most men
did not suppose that hee would haue
done: for it is manifest, howe hatefull in
ciuill broyles, the head of either faction
is, so as if the one happen into the others
hand, his vsage most commonly is vngentle,
and his life in ieopardie.
                  Now by these and such like examples,
let vs, who are reformed Christians, follow
the traces of Gentlemen, & not like
vnto heathenish Canniballes, or Irish
karnes, persecute one another with capitall
enmitie. Finally, let vs againe, and againe
ponder the wordes of our Sauiour

                  Of Modestie and Bashfulnes. Chap. 46.
                  HE that is impudent and neuer blusheth,
is accounted lost, and ought to
be banished from all vertuous company:
But on a sodaine,Terent. in Adel.  
                     I saw him blush, therefore
all is well. O noble modestie! O honourable
affection of the mind! which
deseruest to haue Temples & altars dedicated
vnto thee, as to a diuine Goddesse:
for what beautifieth the vertues?
Modestie: what bridleth and tameth the
furious passions of the mind? Modestie.
In yong men shee is the badge of innocency,
and greatly to bee commended:
butAri. lib. 4. Ethic. cap. vlt. & Plautus in Amphyt. 
                     in old men she is vtterly dispraised; the
reason is, because shame fastnesse being
once departed from a man, is irreuocable,
and knoweth not howe to returne.
But nowe alasse, in this old and spotted
age of the world, youths, by reason of
their parents fond indulgence, haue exceeded
the limits of modestie, and are
become so brazen-faced, that they will
not sticke to outface & denie that which
is most euident: they are I say, become
so impudent and base minded, that they

wil neither acknowledge any reuerēce
to their elders, nor suffer thēselues to be
aduised by their equalles, nor as yet look
mildly on their inferiors. Neuerthelesse,
shamefastenesse in despight of al her aduersaries,
shal be acceptable among wise
men, and guide their hearts, as she did in
times past. In the meane time, lette men
thinke well of her, and note, whether she
graceth yong men; and then according
to the effect, let them choose, whether
they receiue her or no,

Chap. 47.
                  AFfabilitie is either a wittie vse of
speech; or a delightfull recreation of
the mind; or an amiable shew of countenāce.
It is a wittie vse of speech, whē a
man moueth mirth, either by the quicke
chaunging of some sentence, or else by a
counterfeit, extrauagant, and doubtful
speech, as for example, a Gentlemā on a
time said vnto a Gentlewoman, How now
Gentlewoman, what, al alone? she eftsoone
wittily answered: Not alone, sir, but accō

him Piper: whereunto the partie excepting,
said, Sir, you mistake, my name
is Pepper, not Piper: the Recorder answered:
what differēce is there between
piper in Latin, and pepper in English?
There is, replied the other, as much difference
betweene them, as is betweene
a pipe and a Recorder.
                  Affabilitie is a delightfull recreation
of the mind, when we laugh moderately
at those things, which wisely and chiefely
touch some fonde behauiour of some
one body, or when wee tickle some vice
or other: as if a man should talk of a priuie
theefe in this wise; I haue one at home
among all others, to whome there is no doore
shut in all my house, nor chest lockt: Meaning,
that hee is a picklocke and a priuie
theefe. Howbeit, he might haue spoken
these words of an honest seruant.
                  Affability is an amiable shew of coūtenance,
as whē some great personage resaluteth
the people cheerfully, & succoureth
euerie one according to his power.
Whereby, as another2. Sā. 15 
                     Absalon, hee

stealeth the hearts of the people. Then they
speake all, as it were in a diapazon: who
can chuse but with all his heart loue this noble
minded Gentlemā, in whom all the sparks
of aswell royall, as reall vertues do appeare?
But on the cōtrary, if a Noble man, that
is proud and haughty of countenance,
should passe by them without any semblaunce
of gentlenesse, they will thus
descant of him: This man by his stately
stalking, and portly gate ouer looketh Powles
steeple: he is as proude as Lucifer, his pride
will one day haue a fall. Thus they read of
him, be he neuer so high of degree: they
care not who heares thē: their tounges
are their owne.
                  In respect whereof, I wish all Gentlemen
to behaue themselues affably, and
courteously towards their inferiors. For
whereby els is a Gentleman discerned,
saue by his gentle conditions? let them
therfore looke better & prie into themselues,
& earnestly charge some of their
most faithfull followers, to admonish
them of their ouersights at conuenient
seasons.
               
               
                  
                  Of Indulgence. Chap. 48.
                  INdulgence is a fond, vaine, & foolish
loue, vsed most commonly of parents
towards their children. There is no vice
so abhorred of wise men as this; For
they find by experience, that mo youths
haue bene cast away through their parēts
indulgence, then either through violent
or naturall death. Yea, I haue heard
sundry Gentlemen, when they came to
yeeres of discretion, grieuously exclaime,
and bitterly complaine of their
parents fondnesse, saying: Wee would to
God that our parents had heretofore kept
vs in awe and seuerity; for now lacking that
instruction, which we ought to haue, wee feele
the smart thereof. Vndoubtedly God wil
one day demaund an account of them,
and examine them, wherefore they respected
not better their owne bowels.
Shall he blesse them with children, and
they through blind indulgence neglect
their education? Truly, it is a miserable
case. In times past parents were wont to
place their sonnes with wise gouernors,
requesting them not in any case to let
them haue their owne willes. But now

adaies it falles out cleane contrary. For
parents in these times when they hire a
scholemaster, will first hearken after his
gentle vsage, and then they will question
with him touching the small salary,
which they must pay him for his industry,
so that forsooth now and then to be
mindfull of this vice Indulgence, they
accept of a sow-gelder, or some pety
Grammatist, that will not sticke in a
foole-hardy moode to breake Priscians
pate. With such a one they couenaunt,
namely, that hee must spare the rodde,
or els their children will be spild. Within
a while after assoone as their indulgent
Master hath taught them to decline
Stultus, Stulta, Stultum, as an adiectiue
of three terminations, they bring
them out of hand into the Vniuersity,
and there diligently do enquire after a
milde Tutour, with whome their tender
sonnes might familiarly and fellowlike
cōuerse. And what then? Mary, before
a tweluemoneths end, they send for
them home againe in all post haste to
visit their mammes, who thought each
day of their sonnes absence to bee a
whole moneth. There they bee made

sucklings during the next twelue moneth.
Well, now it is high time to suffer
their ready dādlings to see new-fangled
fashions at the Innes of Court.
Where being arriued, they suite themselues
vnto all sorts of company, but for
the most part vnto shriuers, Caualeers,
and mad-cappes, insomuch at the last, it
will be their friends hard happe, to heare
that their sweet sonnes are eyther pend
vp in New-gate for their good deeds, or
haue crackt a rope at Tiburn. This is the
effect of Indulgence. This is their false
conclusion, proceeding of their false premisses.
Now you must vnderstand, that
if the parents had not thus cockered &

                        〈◊〉
                      their sonnes in their childhood,

                        〈◊〉
                      caused them to be seuerely looked
vnto, they would not in the floure of
their age haue come to such a miserable
end.
                  In the Chronicle of the Switzers, mē
                     tion
is made of a certaine offendour,
whom vpon his arraignement his owne
father was compelled to execute, that so
by the indulgent author of his life hee
might come to his death. Hither likewise
may I referre that common story of

a certaine woman in Flaunders, who liuing
about threescore yeeres agoe, did
so much pamper two of her sonnes, that
shee would neuer suffer them to lacke
money; yea, shee would priuily defraud
her husband to minister vnto them. But
at last she was iustly punished in them
both, for they fell from dicing and rioting
to stealing, and for the same one of
them was executed by the halter, & the
other by the sword, she her selfe being
present at their wofull ends, whereof her
conscience shewed her, that her Indulgence
was the onely cause.
                  This ought to be a liuely glasse to all
parents to prouide for their childrens
bringing vp, and to purge them betimes
of their wild and wicked humours, least
afterwards they proue incurable, and of
litle sprigs they become hard withered
braunches. In briefe, O parents, correct
your childrē, while they be young; pluck
vp their weedes, while they beginne, lest
growing among the good seed they hinder
their growth; and permit them not
so rathe, of prentises to become enfranchised
freemen. In so doing, you may be
assured, that they will easily be brought

to study the knowledge of heauenly wisedome,
and to embrace ciuility, the onely
butte and marke, wherat the godly &
vertuous do leuell, especially for Gods
glory, for their owne commodity, and
for the goodnesse that thereby ensueth
vnto the commonwealth in generall.
               
               
                  Of Pride. Chap. 49.
                  PRide is a bubbling or puffing of the
minde, deriued from the opinion of
some notable thing in vs, more thē is in
others. ButEccl. 10. 
                     why is earth & ashes proud!
seeing that when a man dieth, hee is the heire
of serpents, beasts, & wormes? Who knoweth
not, that GOD closely pursueth
proud men? who doubteth, thatLuke 1. 
                     he thū
                        dreth,
and scattereth them in the imaginations
of their hearts, that he putteth downe
the mighty from their seates, and exalteth
the humble and meeke? In somuch that
Eccl. 10
                     he which is to day a king, to morow is dead,
Wherefore, O wight, whosoeuer thou
art that readest this booke, lay aside thy
Peacocks plumes, and looke once vpon
thy feet, vpon the earth, I mean, wherehence
thou camest.Eze. 28 
                     though thou thinkest

in thine heart, that thou art equall with
GOD, yet thou art but a man, and that
a sinfull man. In summe, wish not lordly
authority vnto thy selfe, for hee that
seeketh authority, must forethinke
how hee commeth by it, and comming
well by it, how hee ought to liue in
it, and liuing well in it, hee must forecast
how to rule it, and ruling discreetly,
hee must oftentimes remember his
owne frailty.
               
               
                  Of Scurrility of Scoffing.
Chapt. 50.
                  EVen as I greatly commend affability
and pleasant iestes: so I vtterly mislike
and condemne knauery in iesting.
For toungs were not giuen vnto men to
scoffe and taunt, but rather to serue
God, and to instruct one another. And
as a litle fire may cōsume whole villages:
so in like manner the toung, which is a
kind of fire, yea, a world of calamity, polluteth
the whole body, if it bee not refrained.
For which cause, though there
be some merry and conceited wit in a
iest: yet we must beware, that we rashly

bestow it not on them, whom we afterwards
would not for any thing offend.
Therefore the respect of time, & consideration
of the person is necessary in
lesting. For we must not giue dry floutes
at meales, least we be accounted Aleknights:
wee must not taunt cholericke
men, least they take it in ill part: we
must not deride simple felowes, because
they are rather to be pitied: nor
yet wicked persons, for it behoueth to
haue them rather punished, then laught
to scorne.
               
               
                  Whether Stageplayes ought to be suffred
in a Commonwealth?
Chapt. 51.
                  STageplaies fraught altogether with
scurrilities and knauish pastimes, are
intolerable in a wel gouerned common-wealth.
And chiefly for six reasons. First,
Tertull. lib. de speculo.
                     all Stageplayes were dedicated vnto Bacchus
the drunken God of the Heathen,
and therefore damnable. Secondly,Concil. 30. Carthag & Synod. Laodic. cap. 54. 
                     they
were forbidden by Christian parliaments.
Thirdly, men spend their flourishing
time ingloriously and without credit, in
cōtemplating of plaies. All other things

being spent may be recouered againe,
but time is like vnto the latter wheele
of a coach, that followeth after the former,
and yet can neuer attayne equally
vnto it. Fourthly,Ephes. 5. 
                     no foolish and idle talking,
nor iesting should be once named amongst
vs. Fiftly, stageplaies are nothing
els, but pompes and showes, in which
there is a declining frō our beleefe. For
what is the promise of Christians at their
Baptisme? namely, to renounce the Diuell
and all his workes, pompes, and vanities.
Sixtly,Saluian. lib. 6. de Gubern. Dei. 
                     Stageplayes are the very
mockery of the word of God, and the toyes
of our life. For while we be at the stage,
wee are rauished with the loue thereof,
according to the wise mans wordes: It
is a pastime for a foole to do wickedly;
                     Prou. 10. 23. and
so in laughing at filthy things, we sinne.
               
               
                  Of Cruelty. Chap. 52.
                  THere bee two sortes of cruelty:
whereof the one is nothing els, then
Sen. lib. 2, de Clementia cap. 4.
                     a fiercenesse of the minde in inflicting of punishmēts.
The other is a certain madnes,
together with a delight in cruelty, of
which brood I accoūt thē to be, who are

cruell without cause. The causes, that
procure cruelty, be three. The first is
couetousnesse, for (as the auncient Latin
Oratour recordeth)Rutilius Lupus li. 2. de figur. sent. 
                     madnesse is the
father of cruelty, and couetousnesse is
the mother thereof. The second is violence
naturally ingraffed. The third
cause of crueltie is ambition, which soweth
in it a hope and desire of clyming
higher.
                  Now to beautifie our subiect with examples,
I bring forth first of all Galeace
Sfortia Duke of Millan, who being wō
                     derful
wroth with a poore man, that by
chaunce had taken a hare, which he in
hunting before had lost, compelled
him to eat the same raw, skinne, and all:
Further, the Spaniards of all nations vnder
the cope of heauen be most cruell, as
appeared by their monstrous and horrible
cruelties exercised vpon the miserable
Indians, whom they, in stead of alluring
by faire means to the knowledge
of the Gospell, made some to be deuoured
of dogs, and others to be cast downe
headlong from steepe hilles. Moreouer,
many of our own coūtrymen haue bene
eye-witnesse of their barbarous tyrannies.

In the yeere of our Lord 1588.
they brought with them hitherward
gagges and such like torments to inflict
vpon vs, if by Gods mercifull prouidence
they had not beene speedily preuented
and miraculously confounded;
and I pray God all they may be so serued,
that intend cruelly to vsurpe and
incroche vpon other mens rights. Neither
with silence can I ouerskip the cruelties
of Cardinall Albert, Archduke
of Austria, and deputy of the lowe
countries on the King of Spaines behalfe.
This Cardinal, about foure yeeres
since, hauing taken Caleis in Fraunce,
spared not man, woman, nor child: But
Tigerlike caused them all to be butchered.
Likewise about a yeere and a halfe
a-goe, the said Cardinall departing from
the low coūtries, with intēt to be maried
vnto the king of Spaines sister, that now
is, left Frauncis Mendoza, Admirall of
Aragon, his substitute to wage war in the
low countries. But what cruelties this
Mendoza together with his ragged

                        •
                     out hath committed within this twelue-moneth,
the whole world reporteth; and
especially they of Cleue land, his owne

confederats to their vtter vndoing, can
beare witnesse of the Spanish cruelty.
                  God of his goodnesse preserue our
realme of England from their rauening
clawes, & abate their pride which already
beginnes to rise, and to assaile the reformed
Church of Christ.
               
            
            
               The ninth part.
               
                  Of Patience. Chap. 53.
                  PAtience is a vertue, that is exercised in
tolerating mildly of iniurious words,
of losse of goods, or of blowes. But alasse
wee shall now-adaies sooner find them,
that wil do away themselues, rather then
they will beare any thing patiently; the
reason of this their impatiēce is, because
they know not the effects of patience,
which are these following, namely, first,
to hope well, and then if any thing happen
besides their expectations, to beare
the same patiētly. Secōdly,Aristot. lib. 1. de anim. 
                     not to be moued
without a cause. Thirdly, not to giue
place to any trouble. Fourthly, not to
enuy them, which manage, although
simply, matters of estate. Fiftly, a patient

man must spare him, that hath offended
him being his weaker, and must
spare himselfe, if his stronger hath iniuried
him. For what skilleth it, whether
fortune alway displeaseth thee? canst not
thou cōtemne her frownes, & accōpany
God the authour of all things without
murmuring? Consider with thy self, how
God tempteth some good men with aduersity,
lest that long prosperity should
puffe vp their minds with pride, & how
he suffereth others to be molested with
pensiuenesse and damages, that thereby
they might confirme the vertues of their
mindes. Perhaps thou complainest of
sickenesse, or of sturdy seruaunts. Admit
thou art so vexed, yet notwithstanding
remember, thatEurip. in Orest. 
                     there is no passion
so great, no calamity so grieuous, whose
waight mans nature fayleth to sustaine.
Follow the example of Casimire Duke
of Polonia, who playing at dice with
a certaine Nobleman of his realme,
chaunced to winne a great summe of
money, and thereupon would needes
giue ouer. But the Nobleman, whose
money hee chiefly wonne, was there at
so fiercely moued, that hee stroke his

Duke, and by the benefit of the night
escaped away scotfree. Neuerthelesse,
the next day following hee was apprehended
and brought before the Duke,
euery man beleeuing, that he should
lose his head. Yea, many of the
Barons perswaded the Duke to put him
to death. Whereunto his grace aunswered
in this wise: Truely, I know no
cause, why I should punish him, seeing
that, whatsoeuer hee did, was done in
rage: my selfe rather am woorthy of
blame, for that I vsed such vnseemely
gaming; wee must giue losers leaue to
chafe.
                  But to returne to my matter, percase
thou art poore: suppose thou be; canst
thou not by study ouerwhelme this
griefe? nature is with a little satisfied. I
am banished, thou sayest, and by enuious
flatterers brought into disdaine among
my chiefest friends. What? wilt
thou therefore torment thy body and
mind, and deface the workemanship of
God? no▪ For these misfortunes are not
peculiar to thee alone, but common eyther
early or late vnto all mortall creatures.
Let the freedome of thy banishment

comfort thee, as that, which is farre
to be preferred before domesticall seruitude.
In fine, forget not to thinke vpon
those famous wights, who chaunced
to be buried in a forraine soile.
               
               
                  Of Anger. Chap. 54.
                  ALthough I haue written of this furious
viceIn Cō
                        ment. in Sat. 5. Persi. 
                     els where: yet notwithstanding,
I will aduenture once againe
to expresse the same in a more familiar
tongue; & to make it appeare the more
easie, I hold anger to be daungerous for
nine reasons. First, it is contrary to Gods
spirit, for where by it wee are borne anew
& of wild wolues made tame sheep:
so contrariwise Anger corrupteth vs, &
of sheep reduceth vs to be wolues. Secondly,
Anger permitteth not a man to
follow good & wholesome counsels, nor
to consider of that, which he hath to do.
Thirdly, Anger is accōpanied with ambition,
& causeth a man to slay himselfe,
as for exāple,Sophoc. in Aiac
                           •
                        , & Ouid. lib. 13. Metam. 
                     Aiax seing that the Grecians
had preferred Vlisses before him, and had
bestowed vpon him the armour of Achilles
as a recompence of his wisedome, fell mad,
and in his madnesse killed himselfe.
                     
Fourthly, Anger maketh a man to reueale
secrets like to a drunkard. Fiftly,
Anger diffigureth a man, for it causeth
him to stammer and hack in his speech,
to waxe red, to looke pale; yea, it causeth
his bloud to boyle, as if there were a
torche put vnder: his eies sparkle, he biteth
his lips, he beateth the boord with
his fist, he stampeth against the ground,
and flingeth, and ouerturneth all things,
that are next about him. Sixtly, Anger
thirsteth greatly after reuenge. Seuenthly,
Homer. lib. 7. Iliad.
                     Anger disturbeth all things, and is the
cause of all euill. Eightly, Anger destroieth
all the vertues. Lastly,Ennius apud Cicer
                           •
                        nē li. 4. Tusculan. 
                     Anger is the
beginning of madnesse.
                  
               
               
                  Remedies against Anger.
Chap. 55.
                  EVen as they that feare to be besieged,
do beforehand prepare victuals
to auoid famine, and also bulwarks, and
warlike engines to repell the enemy,
and defend themselues: so in like maner
they, that see themselues naturally
disposed to anger, ought to premeditate,
and find out beforehand certaine
medicines for the same; with which

being made mild, they may resist anger,
or at least so temper themselues, that
they may not be afflicted. In consideration
whereof, I will sette downe tenne
kindes of salues. The first is, that the angrie
manEphes. 4. 
                     let not the sunne go downe vpon
his wrath: nor delay it, for feare lest delayed
anger breede hatred. The second
remedie, the angrie man must haue a
lowly and humble spirit, andSenec. in Thebaid. 
                     addict his
mind to pietie, and to the reading of the
scriptures. The third, he must not be too
credulous, curious, nor superfluous in any
thing. The fourth, he must perswade
himselfe, how that euerie man is by nature,
dull, weake, and fraile, and therefore
hard for his seruants to please him.
The fift salue against anger is, that the
angrie mā reade the treatises of Philosophers
concerning patience, and gather
some flowers thereof into a breuiarie.
The sixt, he must whē some haue offended
him, repeate ouer some tract or other,
before hee bee throughly angrie.
The seuenth, let the angrie man bethink
with himselfe, touching the ilfauoured
countenance of such, whom hee saw angrie;
and when he himselfe is angrie, hee

must take a looking-glasse in his hand,
and therein beholde the fashion of his
face, and whether it bee altered or no.
The eight, the angrie patient must eschew
such meates as ingender choller,
and eate the contrarie: and, if yet he amende
not, hee must repaire to the
Phisicion, and either purge that cholericke
humour, or else vse Phlebotomie.
The ninth, lette him muse vpon the passion
of our Sauiour Christ. The tenth
and last salue is, that hee waigh with
himselfe the vncertaintie of this life, and
consider of the ioyes of heauen, and of
the torments of hell.
               
               
                  Remedies against aduersitie, and losse of
worldly goods. Chap. 56.
                  WHen I consider with my selfe the
instabilitie of this fickle worlde,
and beholde the aduersitie, which sundrie
honest men sustaine, I am prickt
in conscience, and enforced to impart
those fewe medicines which I knowe,
vnto the view of the worlde.Act. 3. 
                     Gold and

siluer haue I none, yet such as I haue, that
giue I vnto you. My first remedie is, that
the afflicted person haue recourse to
God, & heartily beseech his Maiestie to
forgiue him all his sinnes. The second,
the distressed patient must beleeue,
that all aduersities whatsoeuer, tend
to some scope or other, namely, for our
misdemeanours towardes GOD, or
for our triall: and for this cause it is expedient,
that hee reioyce and bee glad,
that God hath such a respect vnto him,
in chastizing him in this worlde. The
third remedie is, that hee perswade himselfe
to bee free, and his owne man:
whereas others liue in subiection to
their diuelish pelfe, and are toyled with
legions of troubles.Boetius lib. 1. de Consolatione philosophiae. metr. 4. This the patient
Philosopher confirmeth: Whosoeuer
(quoth hee) careth and feareth the losse
of worldly things, or wisheth for temporall
goods, is not his owne man, nor at libertie.
The fourth salue for aduersitie is, that
the patient man read ouer the scripture
diligently, and there beholde, as in a
cleere glasse, the aduersitie and pouertie
of Christ & his disciples. The fift remedie
in such a case is, toCominaus li. 5 cap. 5. 
                     Confer with some

familiar friend: for that easeth the minde,
and by talking thus in counsell with a faithfull
friend, the spirits recouer their former
vertue and strength. The sixt, that he either
reade himselfe, or heare some other
reading the Treatises of morall Philosophie,
namely, Seneca the Philosopher,
Plutarch, Boetius, and Petrarch. The
seuenth, that hePlautus in Asin. 
                     resolue himselfe to be cō
                        stant,
stout, and patiēt, for it is a fond thing
to seeke the auoyding of that, which cannot
by any meanes bee auoyded. The
eight medicine is, that hee premeditate
with himself, after what maner he might
beare his aduersitie, that is, whether it
be better to dwell in his owne country,
or in a forraigne land: and whether hee
should applie himselfe to this or that occupation:
The ninth reason is to remē
                     ber,
thatLucretius li. 3. de rerum natura. 
                     mans minde is more vehemently
stirred vp to religion in aduersitie, rather thē
in prosperitie. The tenth and last is, to busie
himselfe with labours, & to exercise
his body dayly, that thereby he may the
sooner forget his woonted griefs. There
be some, that giue three naturall purgations
or remedies for sorrow, to witte,
weeping, sighing, fasting. But these in

my iudgement are very hurtful, for they
impaire the force of the body, & deface
the handie-worke of God.
               
            
            
               The tenth part.
               
                  Of friendship.
Chap. 57.
                  FRiendship ought to be had in regard
among mortall men, chiefely for seuen
reasons: First, becauseEurip. in Helen. 
                     there is a
certain desire of friends, to know the miseries
of their friends. Secondly, friendshippe
ought to be respected for the friendly similitude,
which is between God & good
men. Thirdly, becauseCic. in Laelio, & Manilius. lib. 2. Astron. 
                     there is nothing
more agreeable to nature, and more conuenient,
as well to prosperitie, as to aduersitie,
then it. Fourthly, for that one friend will
helpe another in doubtfull matters.
Fiftly,Horatius lib. 1. satyr. 4. 
                     A friend will defend a friend
in his absence. Sixtly, friendshippe is
prayse-worthie among men, because it
is regarded among birdes, and also, among
things which are without life: as
for example, there is friendshippe betweene

the Peacocke and the Doue:
betweene the Chough and the Heron:
Vines loue the Elme tree: the mirtle
likewise is a friende to the Oliue: and
if the Almond growe alone, it prooueth
altogither vnfruitfull. Lette vs prie
into mineralles, and we shall see friendshippe
betwixt the loadstone and the iron,
and betweene the Emerald and
golde: If wee consider of heauenly bodies,
wee shall finde, that Mercurie, Luna,
Sol, and Iupiter, are friendes to Saturne,
and that Mars and Venus are his
enemies. All the Planets sauing Mars
and Saturne, are friendes to Iupiter. Finally,
among friendes al things are common,
forArist. lib. 4. Ethic. 
                     A friend is a second selfe.
                  
               
               
                  Howe a man should know his
friend. Chap. 58.
                  MAny there bee, that meeting by
chance either in trauelling, or at ordinaries,
do beleeue, that frō that instāt
a sure league of friendshippe is established
betweene them, which in good

truth can neuer bee so, by reason that
in the time of triall there is no more effect
of such friends, then betweene the
Crowe and the Kite, of whom (as the
Fable goeth) when it happened to the
one to bee bare of plumes, and would
needes borrow some, the other answered,
that hee had no more then was sufficient
for him.
                  Of this ranke was King Richard
the second of this Realme, who in the
yeere of our Lorde 1398. created
Henrie Bolling brooke Earle of Darby,
Duke of Hereford, and foure other
Earles, at that time made hee
Dukes, and parted landes among
them, thereby thinking to haue gotten
firme friendes. But boughtfriendes are
seldome sure, as being like vnto Arabian

                        •
                     auens, who so long as they are full, doe
make a pleasant noyse, but being emptie,
they yeelde a fearefull crie. So in like
maner it chanced to this King Richard,
as being shortly after deposed by the
Duke of Hereford (afterwarde King
Henrie the fourth) whom, as I say de before,
he had friendly aduaunced to that
honour.
                  
                     
Wherefore a man that would bee
circumspect, and know his friend, must
principally knowe these positions.
First, lette him consider, whether his
friend bee ambitious: because that
Cicero in oratio. pro Milon.
                     Ambition is fearefull, and for the least
crosse of fortune, wil forsake true friendship.
Secondly, whether his friend bee
couetous, for thatSalust. in coniurat. Catil. 
                     Couetousnesse selleth
friendshippe, faith, and honestie. Thirdly,
let him prooue his friend aforehand in
matters of importance, for if he then go
forwarde with a readie affection, hee
may bee assured of him against the next
time: but if hee once stagger, or seeme
colde that way, hee knoweth what
he hath to doe.
               
               
                  Of Flatterie.
Chap. 59.
                  FLatterie is hardly discerned from
friendshippe, by reason that in euery
motion of the minde, it is glozingly
intermingled with it, but in their
deedes they are meere aduersaries, for
flatterie dissenteth from it in al vertuous

actions. This a wife man will soone
espie, and that especially by these tokens.
First, a flatterer is accustomed
to prayse a man before his face, and
yeeldeth his consent with him in all
matters, as well bad as good. Secondly,
aIuuen. Satyr. 3. 
                     flatterer is wont to commend the
deformitie of his friend, when hee is present,
and to admire his stammering voyce.
Thirdly, A Flatterer, when a man hath
neede of him, turneth his backe.
Fourthly, a flatterer will take vpon him
at first to contradict a man, & by little &
little hee will yeeld as vanquished, and
will shake handes with him: these bee
the properties of a Flatterer, of whome
let euerie honest man beware; for (as
the Poet sayth)Oui. lib. 2. Eleg. 
                     Wicked poyson lurketh
vnder the sweetest honey. And it is better
to fall among a companie of crowes,
then to come among Flatterers, because
they will not pecke a man till hee bee
dead, whereas Flatterers will not spare
to deuoure a man being aliue.
                  
                     Obiection.
                     A flatterer will smoothe and consent

with you in all things, therefore hee is
not vitious.
                  
                  
                     Answere.
                     A flatterer
is either 
                           An Ape by imitation, for
hee will soothe a man so long
till hee hath gotten somewhat
by him.
                           A shadow by deceite, for
he quickly passeth.
                           A Basiliske by stinging,
for with his very sight hee
woundeth a man.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  Of Ingratitude, with a remedie
against it.
Chap. 60.
                  BEcause ingratitude is the greatest
token of all vices, and because the
earth bringeth foorth nothing worse
then an ingratefull man: I will anatomize
both the vice, and the louer
thereof: First, in respect of our vnthankfulnesse
towardes GOD, and next,

in consideration of so many ingratefull
wretches, that liue in these accursed
dayes.
                  Our first Parents hauing receiued
vnspeakeable benefites at the handes of
GOD, as beeing created by him after
his owne likenesse, and then constituted
as Monarchs ouer all other liuing
creatures, shewed themselues ingratefull
for the same, by eating of the
forbidden Apple. Whose examples
wee imitating, doe persist, or rather
surpasse them in ingratitude, as, in forgetting
GODS exceeding loue, when
he spared not his onely begotten sonne,
but gaue him euen to shamefull death
for our saluation.
                  Moreouer, wee are vnthankfull
vnto him for his singular care and fauour,
which hee exhibited in opening
our stone-blinde eyes, and in lifting
vs out of the darke pitte of errours,
wherein our forefathers by the illusions
of the fiende, and of his member
the Pope, were enthralled, and in a maner
sunke.
                  Wee are vnthankfull towardes men,
when wee deface with forgetfulnesse

the good turnes which wee haue receiued
of our friendes. This abominable
kinde of vsage is at this instant too
much practised by our owne countrymen
and Neighbours: for it so comes
to passe, that the greater the benefites
are, the greater most oftentimes is
the ingratitude: and I knowe not who
among the rest bee more vnthankfull,
then children towardes their Parents,
and Schollers towardes their teachers,
who in steede of thankes, doe recompence
them with disobedience, lyes,
curses, slaunders, and what not? O detestable
sinne! not the fowles of the
ayre, who altogether are ignorant of
reason, haue euer exercised the same.
Wee reade, thatAelianus lib. 13. variar. histor. 
                     A yong man falling by
chaunce among theeues, and crying out,
was saued by a Dragon, who by him being
nourished, straightway knewe his voyce,
and came to helpe him. It is sayde of the
Storke, that so often as shee hath yong
ones, shee casteth one out of her nest
into the chimney, for a guerdon and
rewarde vnto him, that suffered her to
lodge there. Oh, I would, that all they
which delight in the contrarie, had

beene subiect to the Persian King,
for doubtlesse then they would repent
them of their ingratitude, when they
should see their neckes in the halter.
The Persians knewe, thatXenoph li. 1. paed. Cyr. 
                     the man,
which of benefits receiued proued vnthankfull,
was not worthie to liue.
                  
                  Lette men therefore beware, whom
they accept into their fauour and houses,
for it may be, their ghestes will
become as gratefull vnto them, as the
Adder, whome the husband man, finding
almost dead in the snowe, brought
home and cherished.Aesop. in Fabu. 
                     Which Adder being
thus entertained, within a while after
in lieu of his fostering, infected all the whole
house with his poyson.
                  
                  
                     Now touching a preseruatiue against
this vice of ingratitude, mine opinion is,
that men haue a good respect howe
they bestow their benefites,
                     Cōminae. li. 2. ca. 3 Seeing it is
impossible for a wise man to bee vnmindfull
of a good turne: and if they conferre
their giftes vpon fooles, they are worse then
mad, because they shall perceiue in the end,
that a fooles acquaintance will stand them
in no steade.
               
               
                  
                  Of hatred, and the punishment
thereof. Chap. 61
                  IT is strange nowe-a-dayes to see, how
one man is a woolfe to another, and
how their whole imaginations are set
on nought else, saue on destruction and
bloud. Although they speake gently,
and vtter the wordes of the holy Prophets,
yetPersius Satyr. 5. 
                     in their mustie mindes they
repose the Foxes subtilties, and hating
their brethren, are1. Cor. 13. 
                     as sounding brasse
and tinkling Cimballes. For which cause,
lette not beastes excell vs, who are wont
to conuerse with all other of the same
kinde, and doe right kindly loue together.
                  Lette vs not, I say, bee at variance amongst
our selues, and suffer the Diuell
to haue his tryumphant will, by
prouoking vs to further mischiefe, and
like promooters, to lay trappes for our
enemies. To fall out for euerie strawe,
and to reuenge euerie iniurie, is as if
one member of the body should rebell
against another: and to say the truth, doe

we not dayly see, howe these kindes of
contentious men are ouermet withall,
and ouerthrowne in their owne inuentions?
Albeit they flourish for a while,
yet notwithstanding, at last they haue
their deserts: for GOD, when hee
strikes, strikes home, and to the quicke.
For manifestation wherof, I will propose
certaine late examples, and which haue
chanced within this last age.
                  In the yeere of our Lord 1503. Ceasar
Borgias determining to poyson a
Cardinall, and others, inuited them to
supper, and for that purpose, sent before
a flaggon of wine that was infected with
poyson, by a seruant, that knew nothing
of the matter, commanding that no man
should touch them: but such is the iudgement
of God, who in the execution of
iustice, raiseth one tyrant to kil another,
and breaketh the brands of fire vpon
the head of him that first kindled it:
Pope Alexander the sixt, Cesar Borgias
his father, comming by aduenture
in somewhat before Supper, and ouercome
with the exceeding drought of the
weather, called for drinke: and because
his own prouision was not as thē brought

from the palace, he that had the infected
wine in charge, thinking it to bee
recommended to his keeping for
wine most excellent, gaue the Pope to
drinke of the same wine, which Cesar
Borgias his bastard sonne had sent: who
likewise arriuing, while his father was
drinking, drunke also of the same wine;
being but iust, that they both should tast
of the same cup, which they had prepared
for others.
                  In the yeere of our Lord 1563. the
Duke of Guise purposing to sacke the
Citie of Orleans, wrote vnto the Queen
Mother, that within foure and twentie
howres after he would send her word of
the taking of Orleans, wherein hee
would not spare any man, woman or
childe whatsoeuer: and that after hee
had kept his Shrouetide therein, hee
would in such sort spoile and destroy the
towne, that the memorie thereof should
be extinct for euer. But man purposeth,
and God disposeth: for the same day, as
the Duke about euening returned from
the camp to the Castle, where he lodged,
minding to execute that, which he had
written vnto the Queene, a yong man

named Iohn Poltrot, hauing long time
before intended to giue the stroke, stayed
for him in the way, as hee returned to
his lodging, and discharged his pistoll
laden with three bullets at him, whereof
the Duke presently after died.
                  In like maner the Duke his sonne, hauing
occasioned that bloudy massacre at
Paris in the yeere 1572. and purposing
in the yeere 1588. vtterly to roote the
Protestants out of the realme, was himselfe
slaine through the commaundement
of the French king his soueraigne,
whom he a litle before most traiterously
had iniuried.
                  By these and such like examples, let
vs take heed, how wee entrap one another;
yea, let vs beware, how we curse &
lay in waite for our chiefest enemies.
Vengeance is Gods, and he will reward.
Briefly, let vs embrace loue, and friendly
agree together in Christ Iesu. For1. Cor. 13. 
                     loue
deferreth wrath: it is bountifull: loue enuieth
not: loue doth not boast it selfe: it is not
puffed vp: it reioyceth not in iniquity, but in
the truth: it suffereth all things: it beleeueth
all things: it hopeth all things: it endureth al
things.
                  
               
               
                  
                  Of Enuy. Chap. 62.
                  NOt without reason are vices named
brutish, for they be all borrowed
from brute beasts. Niggardize we haue
from the hedgehog: pride from the
lion: anger from the wolfe: gluttony frō
the beare: sluggishnesse frō the asse: &
enuy from the dog. All which saue enuy
may sophistically be iustified: as for example,
niggardize is shadowed vnder
the number and care of wife and children,
and otherwhiles vnder the vaile of
pouerty. Pride pleadeth, that familiarity
breeds contempt, and that she must
obey the importunity of the times.
Anger alleadgeth the ingratitude of
men, the indignity of iniuries, the disparagement
and shame, that may follow
by too much patience. Gluttony
sheweth, that hee hath a strong constitution
of body, a good stomack to his
meat, and therefore hang sorrow and
kill care. Sluggishnesse declareth, that
labour and study consume the vitall spirites,
that he, which sleepes well, thinkes
no harme, and he that thinks no harme,

pleaseth God. Thus euery vice for the
most part can shrowd it selfe vnder some
cloake or other. But, Enuy, where is
thy excuse? Truly, thou hast nothing
to say for thy selfe. Onely thou meanest
to escape away scotfree, because
thou art concealed in mans heart, as being
like vnto a tree, which in outward
appearaunce seemeth to be most beautifull,
and is full of faire blossomes, but inwardly
is rotten, worme-eaten, and withered.
Now a-daies thy subiects beare
all the sway, they put men by the eares,
they are the Petifoggers, they the politicians,
and who but they? Alasse,
Plaut. in Bacchid.
                     there is no man, that enuieth not another
mans prosperity. What then shall we further
expect? nothing, but the comming
of the great Iudge. Wee see all things
fulfilled; wee see the father enuious against
the sonne, the sonne against the
father; to bee short, wee see one brother
enuious against another. Now is
that golden prophesie of the Greeke
Oratour come to passe: to wit,Demost. Oration. 1. contra Aristo. 
                     When
equity and the common good are ouerturned
by enuy, then must wee thinke that all
things are turned topsy turuy.
                  
                  
                     
Examples aswell domesticall as forraine
be infinite concerning enuy: howbeit
at this time I will rehearse but one,
and that a forraine one. In the yeere of
our Lord 1596. the Duke of Medina,
seing that our English fleet had burnt
the Spanish nauy, & had takē the towne
of Cales, and doubting that the other
nauy, which he had at S. Lucas would either
be compelled to yeeld, or pay ransome,
was so enuious of our happy successe,
that he caused it immediatly to be
set on fire, so that to spare a reasonable
redemption, he rashly lost twelue millions
of gold, which (as it is credibly reported)
the nauy valued.
                  Amongst other sins, which the Turks
account deadly, this of Enuy is not held
to be the least. For (say they) no man
whatsoeuer shall euer come to the ioyes
of Paradise, although in all other things
he be neuer so dutifull to please God,
except he be first throughly cleansed frō
this sinne of Enuy. Repent therfore, thou
sensuall and enuious man, and aske God
forgiuenes from the very bottome of thy
heart. Repent, I say, and God will heale

                  Of Calumniation and slaunder.
Chapt. 63.
                  EVen as they, which lay siedge vnto
cities, do not inuade their enemies;
where they see the walles strong and
massy, but where they perceyue there is
small resistance, and where they see the
place easie to be scaled: so they, that pretend
to backbite & slaunder others, do
note what is most pliable and weake in
the hearers mind, that thereto they may
conueigh their artillery, and bring in
their weapons, which are falshood, craft,
and periury. This done, they tickle the
hearers eares, and rubbe them as it were
with a pen: so that most cōmōly the accusers
are beleeued, & they, that are accused,
are not called to giue answere.
But in my iudgement they, that lend
their eares to these curre-dogs barking,
are no lesse to be reproued, then the barkers
themselues, because they winke at
such imperfections, & will not exchange

stripe for stripe, I meane, because they
will not punish and correct such slaunderers.
Of this brood I reckon many
of our raskall trencherknights, who
not onely wind themselues in by subtill
deuices, but also set their tongues to
sale for a morsell fo pasty-crust, and
take a delight to sow dissention betwixt
man and wife, and betwixt brother and
brother.
                  Examples I need not produce, for
our pillories beare euident witnesse of
their slaunderous dealings. Leaue therfore
to accuse your brethren, to snap
honest men by the shinnes, and to raile
and scoffe at them, that will not in any
case intermeddle with you. Be like vnto
newe borne babes, and couet the
milke of loue, that so you may not bee
guilty of that sentence, which the holy
Ghost pronounced, namely, that

               The eleuenth part. Of the
Intellectuall vertues.
               
                  Of Art; and whether Art be better
then Nature? Chap. 64.
                  THis name of Art hath foure significations.
First, it is taken for the vniuersall
perfection of Art, which
wee comprehend in GOD.
So we say, thatPlato lib. 10. de Legib. 
                     the world, and all that
therein is, were made by Gods art. Secondly,
the name of Art is put for the similitude
and shadow of that, which shineth
in beasts, birds, flies, & such like. In this
sence it is said, that the spider shewed vnto
vs the art of spinning. The Bee taught
vs to conforme things in order. The fish
learned vs the Art of swimming. Thirdly,
the name of Art is extended to the
general habit of the mind, as farre forth
as we do any thing by it, that is seperated
from nature. So Grammar, Rhetorick,
Musick, Arithmetick, Logick, Geometry,
and Astronomy are called
Artes. Likewise in this sence Prudence
is named the art of composing mans
actions: Science the Art of discerning

the truth. Fourthly, the name of Art is
taken for that true forme of Art, which
is distinguished from the other habites
of the mind, as farre forth as it is defined
an habit of the mind ioyned with true reason,
apt to effect. In this signification I
terme it here an intellectuall vertue.
Herehence ariseth that doubtfull question,
to wit, whether Art be better then
nature? To this I aunswere negatiuely,
perswaded specially by these three reasons.
The first,Arist. li. 7. Metaphysic. text. 4. 
                     the essence of a thing is
better then the accident of a thing: Nature
is an essence, & Art an accident, therefore
nature is better then Art. The second,
nature worketh inwardly, and altereth
the inward habit of the mind, but
Art only effecteth outwardly, & chaungeth
the outward forme: therefore Art
is not better then nature. Finally, nature
is ioyned with God, according to that
common sentence, God & nature do make
nothing in vaine: but Art is ioined with
man, and by reason of mans weakenesse
is subiect to innumerable errours: therefore
nature is farre better then Art.
                  
                     Obiection.
                     
                        That which is later in birth, is first in excellency

and perfection: Art is in birth later
then nature: therefore it is more excellent
in perfection.
                  
                  
                     Aunswere.
                     Your rule onely holdeth in corruptible
things, namely, while that which is
first stayeth for the next which followeth.
But when the essence is compared
with the accident (as now it is) the essence
is farre more excellent, and by a
consequence nature is better then Art,
and your sentence false.
                  
               
               
                  Of Science or knowledge. Chap. 65.
                  THe name of Science is taken foure
maner of waies. The first, it is vsed
for euery certaine knowledge of a thing.
So wee say that the snow is white, the
crow black, the fire hot. The second, the
name of Science is taken for euery true
habite of the mind separated from the
knowledge of the sences; in which signification
Hippocrates proued Phisick to
be a science. The third, it is vsed more
properly for euery habit gotten by demonstration,
separated from the habit of
actiō: in this sence supernatural philosophy
is named the chiefest science. The

fourth, the name of science is takē more
strictly for a habit gotten by demonstration
separated from wisedome; in which
last signification Naturall philosophy, &
the Mathematickes are called Sciences,
and supernaturall Philosophy is termed
humane Diuinity.
                  The benefits, that come by this intellectuall
vertue, are three. First, it aswageth
mans mind beyng rude and barbarous,
and maketh it capable of true
reason. Secondly, science setleth a mans
mind in constancy and discretion, that
he may spend his life to the welfare and
good estate of his countrey. Thirdly,
it causeth a man to end his dayes honourably,
with an vndoubted beliefe of
euerlasting life.
               
               
                  Of Vnderstanding. Chap. 66.
                  VNderstāding is an habit of the mind,
whereby as with an eye wee behold
the principles aswell of practise as of
contēplation. I say with an eye, because
that the same, which the sight is in the
body, vnderstanding is within the soule.
This vertue is the reward of faith,Manil.

                  Of Prudence. Chap. 67.
                  ALl the authority and maiestie of a
Prince cōsisteth in the opiniō of prudence;
for euen as the sicke man obeyeth
the wise Physician, and the passenger
hearkeneth vnto the skilfull pilot:
so in like maner subiectes are obedient

vnto their prudent Prince, & will
gladly follow whatsoeuer he prescribeth
vnto them. O peerelesse paragon! O noble
Prudence! thouEccle. 1. 
                     rairest downe knowledge
and vnderstanding, and bringest to honor,
thē, that possesse thee. Thou defendest
our commonwealth from the Spanish
yoke.Sophocl. in Antigon. 
                     Thou holdest the supremacie in felicity,
and sauest vs from aduersity. Take
away this Iewell, & our liues will be filled
with folly, wickednesse, and barbarisme.
This politiciās do very wel know;
for how is it possible, that a commonwealth
should be well ruled, vnlesse the
gouernours thereof do perfectly & prudently
vnderstand the nūber of souldiers,
the loue of the leaguers, the scituation
of the countrey, & the nature of the
inhabitaunts? King Henry the seuenth
therefore her Maiesties Graundfather
deserueth great commendations, in that
hee kept a priuate booke for that purpose,
& therein registred the force of his
realme, & the treasure, which yeerely
his officers receiued into the Excheker.
As concerning the nature of people, I
find that windy places do make men sauage,
and inconstant, and that in calme

countreys they become ciuill & courteous.
Also, we see, that they, which dwell
neere the sea, and farre from London,
are for the most part more fierce and
hardy, then those, which liue in the midst
of England. Moreouer, it behoueth a
prudent man to consider, that some
kind of people be angry by nature, some
be impudent, some fearefull, and othersome
be giuen to newfangled fashions,
to drunkenesse, and lechery. In like
maner,Smith. li. 2. Reipub. Anglican. cap. 26. 
                     the nature of Englishmen is to be
couragious, to neglect death, to abide no torment,
and therforeIbid. 
                     in no place shall you see
malefactours go more constantly, more assuredly,
and with lesse lamentation to their
death, then in England. The nature of
Welshmen is kind, haughty, and prodigall
of life and bloud. The Irish are
accounted rude and couragious: which
doubtlesse proceeds of their countries
cold climate: for, as the Philosopher
saith,Arist. in Probl. 
                     they that liue in the North, and in a
cold countrey are commonly called treacherous.
To end this chapter of prudence, I
thinke it expedient, that a prudent man
yeeld vnto the necessity of the time, and
take heed, that anciēt lawes & customes

be not altered, becauseBodin. lib. 2. de Repub. cap. 3. 
                     they are the foū
                        dations

changed, the whole building must consequently
fall to wrack and destruction.
                  
               
               
                  Of Sapience or Wisedome.
Chap. 68.
                  WIsedome among the auncient heathen
was no other thing, but a certaine
kind of prudence to manage and
handle great causes & matters of policy,
Plutarc. in Them. vita.
                     which profession beginning in Solon, did cō
                        tinue,
and was taken vp from man to man
as a sect of Philosophy. But wisedome among
Christians hath obtained a higher
title, to wit, a knowledge to expound
the word of GOD concerning our saluation
redeemed through his Sonne Iesus
Christ. This is that Diuine vertue,
which was ordayned from euerlasting,
before any thing was made:Prou. 3. 
                     before the
earth, the seas, the hilles, and the riuers
were, she was conceyued and brought forth.
When GOD prepared the heauens, shee
was present: when hee enuironed the sea
with her bankes, and layd the foundations
of the earth, shee was with him, making
all things: and shee delights to be with

the children of men. The Chymistes write,
that one dragme of their power of proiection
will turne a thousand dragmes
of any mettall into gold. What then
shall the least grayne of the celestiall
powder of wisedome be able to effect?
Verily, it will lift whole milliōs of soules
out o
                        •
                      Sathans net, and will transport
them vp into the highest spheare: where
for euer residen
                        •
                     , they shall enioy vnspeakeable
pleasures. For this cause the
Emperour Charles the fourth went on
a time to a colledge in Prage, to heare
Diuinity disputations there, and remained
standing aboue foure howres. And
when his Courtiers, to whome that kind
of exercise seemed irksome, told him,
that his supper was ready, hee aunswered,
that the hearing of those disputations
was more pleasant vnto him, then
all the suppers in the world. What greater
testimonies of fauour towards wisedome
can we wish, thē those of the Princes
of England, who frankly and freely
granted such large charters & priuileges
vnto the 2. Vniuersities of this Realme?
Surely I should be too ingrateful, if I do
not remēber in this place Elizabeth our

gracious Soueraigne, who so spareth
neither care nor means to preferre scholers,
that shee meriteth the name of
the Nurse of Wisdome. Next, the Lord
Archbishop of Canterbury, that now
is, deserueth to be had in remembrāce,
in that hee daily purgeth the Church of
spots and Schismes, and aduaunceth all
students, euery man according to his desertes.
Likewise, Sir Thomas Egerton
Lord Keeper so tendereth & fostereth
the professours of true wisedome, that
he is worthily named the Reuiuer and
restorer of wisedome: yea, I haue heard
it sundry times blazed, that Englād neuer
had the like zealous patron of scholers.
There be also other furtherers of
wisedome, whome I leaue to name, by
reason that our bookes, which continually
are published, do royalize and eternize
their heroical names. God continue
them in their noble minds.
                  To finish this discourse, I aduise al mē
both high and low, which haue an entraunce
in them towards God, to coūtenaunce
the followers of wisedome, and
to strike an euerlasting league of amity
with them. As for worldly wisedome,

I wish them not so pretiously to esteeme
it, as they doe: for what else are the wise
men of this world, saue gay politicians,
Machiauellians, and niggards, falsely vnder
the colour of wisemen, purloyning
the poore, and preparing their owne
selues to be▪ scourged of the Diuell, and
to bee scorched in the fierie flames of
hell?

                     ALas, what ignorance leadeth wretches
astray, and bringeth them into a
wrong way cleane contrarie from happinesse
and knowledge? The Egyptians
accounted it a most grieuous calamitie,
to endure theExo. 10 
                     Darknesse which
God sent them by Moyses but three dayes.
Howe much more ought wee to bee afraide,
when wee remaine all our liues
time in the night of Ignorance? Manie
there bee, that wish our Colledges to be
vtterly suppressed, and our schooles of
learning to bee made barnes or wooll-houses,
which were euen to wish vs peasaunts
and witals like themselues. But
God forbid, that any such ignorant wishes

should be fulfilled. SoonerOuid. li. 1. Trist. Eleg. 7. 
                     shall
the earth bring foorth starres, and the heauens
be eared with plowes: then that barbarisme
and ignorance should in such
sort ouerflow vs. Take the Sunne out of
the firmament, and the light from the
skie: what else would the world seeme,
saue a massie Chaos, or a rude and confused
lumpe? In like maner, if learning
bee extinguished, would not wee
become dizarts or cuckoes? Nay, to seeke
the decay and abolishing of learning, is
to prepare a way for Atheisme, & consequently,
to put a mart or market for
the diuell. O foolish Libertines, and besotted
with too much pleasure! You
know, how to prize a fat bullocke, howe
to buy this tenement or that tenement
of landes, and hauing bought it, you
know how to marle it, trim it, and stocke
it; you knowe right well howe to defray
your money, to defraud your brethren
of that, which God hath allotted vnto
them. To bee short, you know howe to
winke at iniustice, to receiue bribes, to
fawne, and otherwhiles to pawne your
credite for your priuate commodities:
yea, & which is worse, you know holes,

crochets, and quiddities, whereby you
may (as you thinke) redeeme, or indeed
infringe your pawned credite. And yet
notwithstanding for all this, you make
your selues so blinde, that you list not
to know, where perfect goodnesse lyeth
hidden.
                  
                     Wherefore in fine repent, (a)
                     Prou. 2. Cause
your eares to hearken vnto wisedome, and
encline your hearts to vnderstanding: for if
you call after knowledge, and crie for vnderstanding,
if you seeke her as siluer, and
search for her as treasures, then shall
you vnderstand the feare of the
Lord, and finde the knowledge
of God.

                  Of a family, and the diuision
thereof. Chap. 1.
                  
                     
                        BEcause euery Commonwealth
is composed of families,
                     Arist. lib. 1. Polit. 
                     & the
parts of a Familie bee those,
whereof it is immediatly compacted:
I will first declare,
what a Familie is, and then lay down the
diuision therof. A Familie is a cōmunion
and fellowship of life betweene the husband
& the wife, the parents & childrē,
and betweene the master and the seruant.
Now touching the diuision of a family,
I finde, that it is diuided into foure
parts, whereof the first is matrimoniall,
that is, of man and wife, the second is fatherly,

to wit, of parents and children:
the third part is masterly: namely, of masters
& seruants: the fourth is, the acquisitiue,
or getting facultie. All which parts
of a family, I mean, God willing, to decipher.
               
               
                  There be foure kinds of matrimonie.
Chap. 2.
                  VEry children knowe, that there bee
foure kinds of Matrimonie: namely,
that of honour, of loue, of toyle, and of
griefe. The matrimonie of honor is said
to be tripartite. The first is metaphysical,
and supernatural, wherby God and
mans nature do mystically meete together.
The effect whereof, was in the incarnation
of our Sauior Christ. The second
degree of the matrimonie of honour
is, when God & the soule are combined,
euen by grace and glorie. The
third is, when God & his Church meete
together, and are vnited in one mystical
body.
                  The matrimonie of loue is, when an
honest man and an honest woman are
linked together by God, for the propagation
of mankind.
                  The matrimony of toyle, & that which

is most cōmon in this last rotten world,
is, when men choose wiues not by the
eares, that is, for their good report; but
by the fingers, to witte, for their large
dowries; not in hope of issue, but in regard
of their outward beautie, which fadeth
away like the lillies of the fielde.
                  The matrimonie of griefe is nothing
else, but the coniunction of the wicked
and the reprobate: this kinde of matrimonie
was of late veeres put in vre and
vse, by the sect of the Family of loue.
               
               
                  The causes why Matrimonie was instituted.
Chap. 3.
                  GOd hauing finished the workmāship
of the world, created of euery sexe
two, male & female, & last of al he made
man after his own image, giuing him for
a copartner, a womā formed of the mans
own rib, whō coupling together in matrimonie,
he blessed, saying: Increase,
multiplie, and replenish the earth.
                  The causes why he instituted matrimonie,
bee fiue; the first, for the lawfull
generation of children in his feare,
euen in the time of innocencie, before
man had sinned. The second, for the auoiding
of vnclean fornicatiō. The third

cause, for the mutuall & reciprocall consolation
and succour, which the one
might minister vnto the other in distresses.
The fourth, to be a token or type of
the Ecclesiasticall marriage betweene
Christ & vs. The fift cause of the institution
of Matrimonie is, that aduersaries
might be reconciled by meanes of it, and
made perpetuall friendes.
               
               
                  How excellent a thing Matrimonie
is. Chap. 4.
                  AMong all the societies of this life,
there is none so naturall, as that betweene
man and wife. For (as wee see)
all other societies are accused of free
will and election: but matrimonie proceedeth
not onely of election and free
will: but also of necessitie. The excellencie
of it appeareth by foure reasons.
First, matrimonie is auncient, as is manifest
by the time and place, where it
was instituted, andArist. li
                           •
                         3. Topic. cap. 1. 
                     Euerie good is so
much the more excellent, by howe much the
more auncient it is. Secondly, matrimony
was sanctified by GOD, and graced
by his sonne our redeemer Iesus Christ

his presence,Iohn 2. 
                     at Cana a Citie in Galilee,
where he wrought his first miracle in his humanitie
by turning water into wine. Thirdly,Heb. 13.
                     marriage, as Saint Paul writeth, is honourable
among all: and euerie honourable
thing is more eligible then that,
which is not honourable. Fourthly, matrimonie
is excellent, because two are
better then one. Fiftly, matrimonie is
notable, because it carrieth with it a shew
of grauitie, and hath greater priuiledges:
as in Florence at this day, he that
is father of fiue children, straightway vpon
the birth of the fift, is exempted
from all impostes, subsidies, and lones.
Also, heere in England, a married man is
not so soone prest into the warres as singlemen
or batchelers. In a worde, nothing
within the rounde circle of this
world is comparable to matrimonie.
What a wonderfull marriage is between
the Sunne and the earth? the Sunne is
the male, and with his vegetatiue heat,
quickneth and nourisheth all earthly
things: the earth is the female, and
conceiueth trees and Plants.
                  If we behold metals, we shall finde
that gold and siluer are married (I meane

not in a niggards chest) for if a leafe of
gold be put to a leafe of siluer, they will
be so vnited, that they can neuer bee
seuered. What more shall I adde to
this induction?Arist. li. 1. Politicor. 
                     He that shunneth marriage, and auoydeth societie, is to bee esteemed
a wicked wretch (as the Pope is) or more
then a man, as hee whom Homer reprehendeth,
saying: that hee was tribelesse, lawlesse,
and houselesse.
                  
               
               
                  After what maner the auncients solemnized
Matrimonie.
Chap. 5.
                  THe rites of matrimonie were diuers▪
according to the diuersities of Nations.
The Grecians accustomed to burne
before the doore of the newe married
the axletree of that coach, wherein she
was brought to her husbands house, letting
her to vnderstand, that she was euer
after to dwell there.
                  Among the RomanesL. si a sponsa. C. de d
                           •
                        nat. ante nuptias. 
                     The future
couple sent certaine pledges one to another,
which most commonly they themselues afterwardes
being present, would confirme
with a religious kisse. And when the mariage
day was come, the bride was boūd

to haue a chaplet of flowers or hearbes
vpon her head, and to weare a girdle of
sheeps wooll about her middle, fastned
with a true-loues knot, the which her
husband and must loose. Herehence rose the
Prouerbe: Hee hath vndone her virgins
girdle: that is, of a maide he hath made
her a woman. It is reported of some, that
the wife, as soone as shee was come to
her husbands house, presented to her
husband fire in one hand, and water in
the other: which gaue to vnderstande,
that as these two elements were most
necessarie of al others for conseruation
of mans life: so there could no societie be
neerer linked together, then that of the
husband and wife.
                  The auncient Frenchmē had a ceremonie,
that, whē they would marrie, the
bridegroome should pare his nailes, and
send thē vnto his new wife: which done,
they liued together afterwards as man
and wife.
                  In Scotlād the custome was, that the
lord of the soile should lie with the bride
before her husband. But because this
order was not decēt nor tolerable amōg
Christians, King Malcolme, the third

of that name in the yeere of our Lorde
1095. abolished that wicked custome,
and enacted, that euerie bride thencefoorth,
should pay to the Lord for ransome
of her maiden-head, fiue shillings.
                  Marriages among the Gentlemen of
Venice, were for the most part concluded
vpon by a third person, the bride
being neuer permitted so much as to see
her new husband, nor hee her, till their
nuptial dowrie was fully treated of & agreed;
which being finished, they were
married with great pompe & solemnitie.
                  Concerning the ancient order of mariages
in Turkie, they held it an vndecent
thing, for the bride to bee brought
home to her future husband with musicall
instruments, but they thought it
meete, that the married couple should
present themselues before God, with all
humilitie and reuerence: and after that
these ceremonies were ended, they were
led to their bed-chamber, which was prouided
for them in a very secret and
darke place: the next morning at the
dawning of the day, the husband (by
Mahomets law) is boūd to aske his wife,

whether she can read or no. If she cānot,
then must he learne her to reade. In like
sort, if she can reade, and her husband
not, then must shee teach and instruct
him. This was the old maner of marriages
among the Turks. Howbeit, at this
day, they are growne to such excesse of
voluptuousnesse, that they rather resemble
beasts then men.
               
               
                  Of Matrimonie in England, at this day
solemnized. Chap. 6.
                  MAtrimonie in England is accounted
finished, after that it is solemnized
in presence of the minister, and two
lawfull witnesses. Superstitious ceremonies
there are none. Onely the Priest is
bound openly in the Church to aske the
banes: to wit, whether any man can alleadge
a reason, wherfore they that are
about to bee married, may not lawfully
come together. Which being done, and
no exceptiō made, they then are ioyned
in the holy linkes of matrimonie. Also,
in some shieres, when the marriage day
approcheth, the parents of the betrothed
couple, doe certaine dayes before the
wedding, write letters, to inuite all their

friends to the marriage, whom they desire
to haue present. Afterwards, the mariage
day being come, ye inuited ghests
do assemble together, and at the very
instant of the marriage, doe cast their
presents, (which they bestow vpon the
new maried folkes) into a bason, dish,
or cup, which standeth vpon the Table
in the Church, readie prepared for that
purpose. But this custome is onely put
in vse amongst them, which stande in
neede.
                  Moreouer, it is to bee noted, that if
the wife bee an Inheritrix and landed,
she is to let her husband enioy it during
his life and hers: the which afterward
descendeth to her eldest sonne, or in defect
of sonnes, it is equally parted betweene
her daughters. Howbeit, neuerthelesse,
if she die barren without children,
the husband loseth all: because
landes euer (by the common law of England)
follow the succession. But if shee
once had a child by him, which was
heard to crie, the courtesie of our countrie
is such, that y• husband possesseth the
said lands during his life. If the wife haue
only moueables, as money, plate, cattell,

and such like, all belong to her husband.
                  
                     To knit vp this discourse,
                     Smith. lib. 3. de Republic. Anglic. cap. 8. If the husband
haue any landes, either by inheritance
descended, or purchased and bought, and
chance to die before his wife, shee shall haue
the vsufruit of one third part of his landes
during her life, as her dowrie, whether hee
hath child by her or no.
               
               
                  The duties of the husband toward his
wife. Chap. 7.
                  THe duties of a husband toward his
wife are 7. The first, that he1. Pet. 3 
                     giue honour
to his wife, as the weaker vessell, for
she is partaker of the grace of life. The second,
hee must patiently brooke the hastinesse
of his wife, for there is nothing
in the world more spitefull then a woman,
if shee be hardly dealt withall, or
egged to indignation. Hence is the prouerbe:
Anger thy dogge, and hee will bite
thee. The third dutie,Casus lib. 1. Thesaur. Oecono. cap. 4. 
                     The husband in
any case must not haue carnall copulation
with any other but his owne wife, for that is
verie vniust, by reason it dissolueth the girdle
of faith and chastitie, & is the next way to
cause her to hate him: a woman is iealous,

and naturally suspitious, and sith her
husband breaketh with her, she will not
sticke to breake with him, and priuilie
borrow a nights lodging with her neighbour.
The fourth dutie, the husband
must not iniurie his wife by word or
deede, for a woman is a feeble creature,
and not endued with such a noble courage
as the man; shee is sooner prickt to
the heart, or mooued to passions, then
man: and againe, he, that iniurieth his
wife, doth as if hee should spit into the
aire, and the same spittle returne backe
vpon his owne selfe. The fift, the husband
in disputations with his wife, must
sometimes confesse himselfe vanquished
by her. The sixt, the husband must
prouide for his wife, and for her housekeeping,
according to his abilitie. The
seuenth, the husband must suffer his
wife to be merrily disposed before him,
otherwise (a womans nature is such) shee
will by stealth find out some secret place
or other to tattle in, and to disport her
self. The eight and cheefest dutie is, that
the husband haue a special regard not to
make two beddes, for so hee may take away
all causes of displeasure: also, if

eyther of them chaunce to iarre, by this
meanes they may be soone pacified.
               
               
                  The duties of the wife towards her
husband. Chap. 8.
                  BVt what shall the woman do? shall
shee do what seemeth good in her
owne eyes? no: for S. Peter speaketh vnto
wiues in this wise:1. Pet. 3 
                     Let wiues be subiect
to their husbands: which is as much
to say, as they must not contradict them
in any point, but rather endeuour to
please them by all meanes. The second
duty, the wife must not forsake her husband
in aduersity, or deride him, as Iobs
wife did, when shee bad himIob 2. 
                     curse God
and die, but shee ought to comfort and
cherish him, as a part of her owne body.
The third, she must esteeme the maners
of her husband to be the legall rules of
her life. The fourth, she must not be too
sumptuous & superfluous in her attire,
as, decked with frizled haire, embrodery,
pretious stones, gaudy raiments, and
gold put about, for they are the forerunners
of adultery:1. Pet. 3 
                     But let her haue the inward
man in her heart, which consisteth in

the incorruption of a mecke and quiet spirit,
that is before God a thing much set by. For
euen after this maner in time past did the
holy women, which trusted in God, attire
themselues, and were subiect to their husbands.
The fift, shee must not bee iealous,
or mistrust her husbands absence.
The sixt duty of a wife is carefully to ouersee
her household, and to bring vp
her children and seruaunts in the feare
of God. The seuenth, she must not discouer
her husbands imperfections and
faultes to any, for by disclosing them,
eyther she makes her self a iesting stock,
or els she ministreth occasion for knaues
to tempt her to villany. The eight duty
of a wife is, that she gibe not, nor flout
her husband, but beare with him as long
as she may.
               
               
                  Of Diuorcement. Whether the innocent
party, after a diuorcement made,
can marie againe during the
other parties life.
Chap. 9.
                  MAny mē now a-daies forgetting the
plighted troth of man and wife are
so deuoid of iudgement and vnderstandding,

that they make no conscience to
proue them separated,Matth. 19. 
                     whome God hath
ioyned together. Yea, some proceed further,
saying, that a man hauing taken his
wife in adultery, may not onely put her
away, but also marrie another, notwithstanding
the first being aliue. Which
last opinion of theirs, because it seemes
somewhat probable, I will, as well as I cā,
discusse. S. Paul saith, that the Lord
commaundeth the wife1. Cor. 7 
                     not to depart
from her husband: but and if shee do, then
be willeth her to remaine vnmarried, or bee
reconciled vnto her husband. In which
words might be made a doubt, whether
the Apostle meant the guiltlesse or guilty
party. Howbeit, I find a defensiue
aunswere, namely, that hee meant the
guiltlesse wife, for this commaundement
(let not the wife depart from her husband)
implieth not this sence, to wit, let not the
wife be constrained as guilty to depart from
her husband, but rather, let not the wife
beyng guiltlesse be authour of diuorcement,
and so by order of law depart from her guilty
husband.
                  
                  Further, if it were lawful for the guiltles
to marie againe during the other parties

life, there would be made a way for infinite
diuorcements; yea, and the commonwealth
would be endaungered by
reason of often dissentions, cauillations,
and innouations: whereas otherwise, mē
knowing, that either they must liue singly,
or be reconciled, seldome or neuer
should we see diuorcements.
                  To knit vp this doubtfull and litigious
question, I resolue on this, namely,
that we being Christiās should consider
that the spirituall marriage, which is betwixt
Christ and his Church, is now and
then polluted by vs with spirituall fornication,
and that notwithstanding all
this, it pleaseth his Diuine maiestie to be
at a new atonement with vs, & to comfort
vs after this maner:Ierem. 3 
                     Returne, O yee
disobedient children, and I will heale your
rebellions. For euenIere. 20. 
                     as a woman hath rebelled
against her husband: so haue yee rebelled
against me. In like sort it behoueth
vs to forgiue one another, and to imitate
our sauiour Christ, who mercifully pardoned
the woman, whom the Scribes &
Pharisees tooke in adultery, saying vnto
her:Ioh. 8. 
                     Goe, and finne no more. To be short,
wee ought to thinke how troublesome

second marriages are like to be, both for
the childrens sake, and also for the guilty
party, who being out of all hope of reconciliation,
will fall to despaire, and to
greater vices, and perhaps neuer afterwards
will become reformed.
               
               
                  Of Iealousie. Chap. 10.
                  IEalousie is a malady of the mind, ingendred
of loue, which will not admit
a corriuall or copartner in the thing
beloued. To this passion the wild asse is
most subiect: for in a whole herd of females
there is but one male, and he is so
iealous, that he will not permit any other
to come amongst them: and when the
female hapneth to haue a male colt, the
sire with his teeth wil bite off his stones,
as fearing he would couer his damme.
Among men, the Italians bee most iealous,
for they, if their wiues do but once
commune, albeit openly with men, do
presently suspect them of adultery. The
Germanes of all nations are lesse iealous,
although their womē be very faire.
Pope Pius the second, otherwise called
Aeneas Siluius in the yeere of our Lord

1461. being at the bathes in Germany,
wondred much at the boldnesse of
the Dutchwomen, who would euē with
men step naked into the bathes; whereupon
he was wont to say, that the Germanes
were farre wiser then the Italians.
Our women here in England,Smith. lib. 3. de Republ. Anglic. cap. 8. 
                     although
they be in the power of their husbands, yet
they bee not so straightly kept as in mew,
& with a gard, as they be in Italy & Spaine,
but haue almost as much liberty as in Frāce,
or in Germany, and they haue for the most
part all the charge of the house and household,
which is the naturall occupation and
part of a wife. In summe, there is no nation
vnder the cope of heauen lesse iealous
then ours, who tender their wiues
so kindly and charitably, thatSmith. lib. 3. de Republ. Anglic. cap. 8.

of the children and their portions.

                  The duty of Parents towards their
children. Chap. 11.
                  PArents must haue a carefull eye to
their childrē, because thereupon principally

dependeth the glory of their
house. And that their duties towardes
them may the more manifestly appeare,
I will set downe what they ought to do.
First of all, Parents must teach their children
to pray vnto God, to rehearse the
Creed, and the ten Commaūdements,
and to catechize them in the chiefest
points of faith. Secondly, they must beware,
that they come not among such
felowes as sweare, curse, and such like,
and to that end they must place discreet
tutours ouer them. Thirdly, parēts must
breake them from their willes, & correct
them sharply, when they offend (yet not
in their anger) forProuer. 23. 
                     in smitting with the
rod, they shall deliuer their soules from hell.
Fourthly, parentes must not permit
their children to weare gorgeous attires
or newfangled dresses, but rather
declare vnto them the vanity thereof.
Fiftly, parentes must procure them wise
and learned teachers, when they are
fit to go to schole. Sixtly, parentes must
not marre their children by marying
them, during their minorities, neither
cause them against their willes to bee
assured. Seuenthly, parentes must see,

that their children liue in vnitie, peace,
and concord; for if debate and discord
be pernicious among al men, how much
rather betweene brethren? Lastly, parents
must ordinarily vse equality amōg
their children so neere as they may, and
not shew more affection to one then to
another, least thereby they prouoke thē
to anger and desperation.

                  THe first duty of children towards
their parents is, theyColoss. c. 3. & l. 1. ff. de obsequi. parent. & patron. praestād. 
                     obey them in
all things, for that is well pleasing vnto the
Lord. Also, they must remember, that the
earthly father is the true representer of
God the vniuersall father, and therefore

                     next after God to be had in reuerence. The
second duty of children towardes their
parentes is, that they endeuour by all
means possible to asswage their parents
anger. Thirdly,l. ff. de agnoscēd. & alend. liber. §. 1. & 2. & l. 1. C. de alend. liber. 
                     children must helpe their

wantes with all necessary complements.
                  
               
               
                  
                  Of Brotherly loue. Whether a man should
preferre his friend before his
brother? Chap. 13.
                  NOthing is more acceptable vnto the
Lord, thē that brethren should loue
one another. The which vndoubtedly by
his soueraigne maiesty is ingrauen at
our birth, for we see the first occasion of
this amity to be bred euen from our natiuity.
Therefore it is the duty of a brother
not to bee angry or discouer the
faults of his brother. Further, it is the
part of a brother to loue his brother aboue
all other, for he may daily get many
of this friendly mould, and more, if
these faile: but it is no more likely to get
a new brother, then to get an eye, which
is drawn out, or an hand, which is chopt
off. Hence springeth that question,
whether a mā should preferre his friend
before his brother? To this I aunswere
negatiuely, that he should not; and especially
for these two reasons. First, we are
bound to follow nature, if she leades vs
not astray, (for who so euer followeth
nature, followeth God, by whome she is

directed) therefore we are bound to loue
our brethren aboue our friends, seeing
that by nature wee are chained with our
brethren, and whatsoeuer we bestow on
them, we bestow on our selues. Whereunto
soundeth that saying of the Poet:
Hesiod. apud Plutarch. de fratern. amore.
                     Take heed, that thou make not thy friend equall
with thy brother. Secondly, the loue
of brethren is better then the loue of
friends, for it includeth in it more then
the other; as for example, when friends
be at variaunce, we see nothing left betwixt
them; but if brethren chaunce to
disagree, the knot notwithstanding of
brotherhood in despight of them remaines
stedfast: moreouer, a man being
forsaken of all his parasitical friends,
is neuerthelesse of his brother, as it were
by a natural instinct receiued and comforted.
                  To bee briefe, I exhort all brethren
to assist one another with mutuall loue,
& not to beleeue any whispering makebates,
whose onely drift is to shift for
themselues, and to oppose not onely
friend against friend, but also for their
owne priuate good to put brother against
brother. This exhortatiō of mine

if brethren will embrace, let them assure
themselues, that they shall enioy the felicity
of the celestiall Paradise, which is
already prepared for them.
               
               
                  Of disobedient Sonnes. Chap. 14.
                  THe very Turkes thēselues according
to the second commaūdement contained
in their Alcoran, do require such
dutifull obedience of children towards
their parents, that they expresly forbid
any, vpon pain of death, to gainsay them
either in word or deed. Besides, it is an
article of their beliefe, that God will neuer
forgiue them, who are accursed of
their parents. Yea, they assure thēselues,
that no sorrow, nor penitent contrition
of mind is euer able to wash or do away
the foule burthen of the parents curse.
Likewise, theCaus. 6. q. 1. Can. 17. 
                     Popish Canonists do condemne
thē as infamous, which rebell against
their parents. What then shal we do, that
are reformed Christians? shall we suffer
the sonne to abuse the father, to commence
suit against him, & approbriously
to endamage him? no. God forbid. We
wil ratherL. si filius tuus. C. de patri. potest. 
                     lead him to the magistrate, who
shall impose on him, what punishment soeuer

the father demaundeth. Wee willDeuter. 21. 
                     stone
him to death for his vnnaturall disobedience.
But suppose hee were left vnpunished,
would he not (thinke you) be cut off as
an vnprofitable member by the iust
iudgement of God? would not his daies
be shortned? Yea, yea; he shall not only
die in this world, but also his body in
the world to come shall alway be tormēted
in hot scalding lead, and his soule
for euer shall endure the horrible paines
of hell.
                  We read in our English Chronicles,
that the sonne of Henry the secōd, king
of this land, by the instigation of the
French King tooke armes against his
owne naturall father, betwixt whom diuers
mighty battels being fought, the
victory alwaies inclined to the father, so
that the disobedient & rebellious sonne
was enforced to desire peace, which the
father mercifully graunted, and forgaue
him his offence. Howbeit notwithstanding,
God the auēger of such abominable
factes punished him for his disobedience,
by causing him to die 6. yeeres before
his father. A meet punishment (no
doubt) for him, seeing that he could not

tarie till after his fathers death. Further,
we heare, that there was of late daies a
certain man, that dwelt in a village neere
to Cambray, who in a great fury threw
his owne mother out of his house three
times in one day, and the third time told
her in anger, that he had rather see his
house on fire, then that she should abide
there one day longer. But mark the end;
It fortuned that on the very same day
according to his speech, his house was
strangely fired, & quite consumed to ashes.
An euident signe assuredly of Gods
displeasure. The exāples wherof I would
to God might serue for a warning to all
children, if not to mollify, yet at least to

seruaunts. Chap. 15.
                  THe duty of Masters toward their
seruaunts I comprise in sixe points.

First, I counsell masters not to keepe any
seruaunts in their houses, that are giuen
to swearing, gaming, whoring, drinking,
or to any such notorious crimes. Secondly,
I exhort masters to haue a speciall
care, that their seruaunts be catechized
and taught in the word of GOD.
Thirdly, they must not make them labour
on the Sabaoth day. Fourthly,
they must see that their seruaunts lie not
abroad in the nights. Fiftly, masters must
grauely correct their seruants according
to the quality of their faults, least being
let alone, they waxe bold, and so fall into
worse courses. Lastly, masters must
looke, that their seruaunts receyue their
wages or hires at due times.
               
               
                  Of the Sabaoth day. Whether a master
ought to set his seruaunts at worke

Lord made heauen and earth, and all, that
therein is, and rested the seuenth day. Secondly,
that they might assemble together,
& gratefully thanke his diuine maiesty
for his daily blessing powred down
vpon them. Thirdly, that they might recreat,
refresh, and repose themselues, to
th'end they might labour the next week
more aptly. Fourthly, the Sabaoth is to
be obserued, by reason it is the seuenth
day; which number containeth great
and hidden mysteries. The skie is gouerned
by seuen Planets. The reuolutiō

                  It was ordained by a good and godly
act made in ye parliament of Scotlād in
the yeere of our Lord 1512. being the
one and twentieth yeere of the raigne of
Iames the fourth, that no markets, nor

fayres should be holden on the Sabaoth
day. Which act King Iames the sixt,
that nowe is, by the consent of his three
estates, ratified and approoued in the
Parliament holden in the yeere 1579.
cōdemning the breakers of the Sabaoth
to forfeit all their moueables to the vse
of the poore within that parish, where
they dwelt. It was likewise there enacted,
that no handy-work should be vsed
on yt Sabaoth, nor any gaming, playing,
passing to Tauernes, nor wilfull remaining
from prayer and Sermons, should
bee in any case exercised vnder the penalties
following: to wit, of euerie man
for his labouring, as often as he was taken
in the fact, ten shillings: and of euerie
person for gaming, playing, passing
to Tauernes, and wilfull remaining
from praier and Sermons on the sunday,
twentie shillings to bee presently payed,
and imployed to the releefe of the poore
in their parish. I could wish, that some
speedy good order were taken here in
Englād, for the breakers of the Sabaoth.
For many now a-dayes, hauing beene idle
all the weeke before, doe of set contumacie
labour that day in despight of

the Lord & his Sabaoth. Some frō morning
to euening do nothing els but play
at dice or tables, swearing & staring at the
least crosse of fortune. Others againe be
delighted with reading of pāphlets, louebooks,
ballads, & such like, neuer once so
deuout as to name God, vnlesse shamefully
abusing him. Oh how oftē do they
vse on that day vnseemly speeches? the
very Turks, I feare me, go beyond them
in deuotion. For they duly on their festiual
daies resort to their Churches, neuer
once gazing or looking aside as long as
seruice lasteth. The seruice being ended,
they go home each mā to his house, inuiting,
& humbly beseeching the priests to
beare them cōpany: with whō they questiō
touching diuine matters, not by carping,
nicking, & nipping, but with pure
simplicity & feruent care; wheras many
of vs Christians contrariwise, do openly
prophane not only holidaies, but also the
Lords day, & yet they terme themselues
Christians. Christiās, O coūterfeit Christiās,
& worse thē Painims. Me thinks,
if nothing else could moue you, yet the
daily myraculous punishments inflicted
on such prophane persons as you bee,

should bee a terrible warning for you.
                  At Kinstat a towne in France, dwelled
a certain couetous woman, about fortie
yeres ago, who was so eager in gathering
together worldly pelfe, that shee would
neither frequent the church to heare the
word of God on sunday her selfe, nor yet
permit any of her familie to do it, but alway
toyled about pilling and drying of
flaxe, neither would shee bee disswaded
by her neighbours frō such an vnseasonable
work. One sunday as she was thus
busied, fire seemed to fall downe among
the flaxe without doing any hurt. The
next sunday it tooke fire indeed, but was
soone quenched. For all this, shee continued
forwarde in her worke euen the
third Sunday, when the flaxe againe taking
fire, could not be extinguished, till
it had burnt her, & two of her childrē to
death; for though they were recouered
out of the fire aliue, yet ye next day they
all 3. died, & that which was most to be
wondred at, a yong infant in the Cradle,
was taken out of the midst of the flame,
without any hurt. Thus God punisheth
the breakers of ye sabaoth. Famous is that
example, which chanced neere London

in the yeere of our Lord 1583. on the
thirteenth day of Ianuarie, being Sunday,
at Paris garden, where there met
together (as they were wont) an infinite
number of people, to see the bearebaiting,
without any regard of that high
day. But in the middest of their sports,
all the scaffolds and galleries sodainely
fell downe, in such wise, that two hundred
persons were crushed well nigh to
death, besides eight that were killed
forthwith.
                  In the yeere of our Lord 1589. I being
as then but a boy, do remember, that
an Alewife making no exception of
dayes, would needes brue vpon Saint
Markes day: but loe, the maruailous
worke of God, whiles she was thus laboring,
the top of the chimney tooke fire,
and before it could bee quenched, her
house was quite burnt. Surely, a gentle
warning to them that violate and prophane
forbidden dayes.
                  Notwithstanding, I am not so straight
laced, that I would not haue any labour
done on Sundayes and holy dayes. For I

                     In Sat. 5 I will therefore
proceed to the next.
               
               
                  Of the duties of seruants towards their Masters.
Chap. 17.
                  THe first dutie of seruants towardes
their masters is, that they be subiect
vnto them (e) and please them in all things,
                     Titus 2.
                     not answering againe, nor replying, although
otherwhiles they know better

what is to be done, then their masters.
The second is, that they be honest and
faithfull vnto their masters, and not (as
many now a-dayes do) flatter & cologue
with them, therby thinking to get some
bootie. The third duty of seruants is, that
they seeke their masters profit more thē
their owne. The fourth, that they reueale
not to others their masters secret
affayres. The fift, that they defend their
masters, euen to the hazarding and losing
of their liues. The famous effect
whereof, appeared in that couragious
seruant of Maurice, Duke of Saxonie;
who of late yeeres, seeing his master sodainely
assaulted by certaine Turks that
lay in ambush, and cast from his horse,
couered him with his owne body, & valiantly
repelled the enemie, vntill certaine
horsemen came and saued the
Prince, but died himselfe a little while
after, being hurt and wounded in euerie
place of his body. Finally, to fill vp this
discourse, seruants must diligently and
honestly guard their masters, and their
masters goods: forPro. 27. 
                     They that keepe the
figge tree, shall enioy the fruite thereof:
and they that waite vpon their Masters,

shall come to honour.
                  
               
            
            
               The fourth Plant.
               
                  Of the Acquisitiue facultie.
Chap. 18.
                  NOw hauing sufficiently disputed of
the chiefest parts of a familie, I come
to the last part, that is, to the acquisitiue
or possessorie facultie, wherof I find two
kindes; the one naturall, the other artificiall.
The naturall consisteth in breeding
of cattell, in manuring of the
groūd, in hauking, hunting, fishing, & in
spoyles and pillages both by sea & land.
The artificiall way of getting, lyeth in
exchanging, either ware for ware, as, of
cloth for silkes, of wool for graine: or els
of wares for money. And againe, those
acquisitiue Arts bee disallowed, which
are loathed of men, as the trade of Brokers,
huxters, toll-gatherers, bauds, vsurers,
and ingraters. Of which three last,
after my next discourie of money, I wil,
God willing, entreat.
               
               
                  
                  Of money, the chiefest part of the Acquisitiue
facultie. Chap. 19.
                  
                     MOney (as Plinie writeth) was coyned
by King Seruius of Rome,
                     Plin. lib. 33. c. 3. 
                     with the Image
of a sheep and an oxe. Others say, that
it was first inuēted at the siege of Troy.
But I find that money was many yeeres
currant before the warres of Troy.Gen. 23. 
                     Abraham
bought a field of Ephron the Hethite
for foure hundred siluer sicles of money
currant amōg Marchāts; Which is of our
money, three and thirtie pound, six shillings
and eight pence. Howbeit, there is
no vse of coyned money in sundry coū
                     tries
at this instāt. In ye coūtry of
                        Belul the Aethiopian word, in English is Pretious, and not Presbiter or Prester, as heretofore it hath been mistaken in print. Pretious
Iohn, salt goeth for money. The
Indians of Peru neuer made any account
of money, before the Spaniards
robbed them of their gold. Besides,
within these two hundred yeeres, mony
was verie scant heere in England: for
King Edward the fourth, in the ciuill
warres betwixt him and Henrie the
sixt, beeing on a time pursued by the
Earle of Warwicke, who then was turned
to the contrarie side, bought a ship

in the yeere of our Lord 1461. for eight
score nobles, to saile into Ireland: which
price in those times was esteemed wonderfull
deare. Also, in the yeere 1514.
money coyned of leather was rise in this
Realme. Of which kinde of money my
selfe haue seene of late, aboue tenne bushels
in an olde castle in Wales, stamped,
as farre as I remember, with the
Duke of Lancasters Image. For in those
dayes, certaine Dukes were licensed to
coyne money. So likewise wee reade,
that countie Palatines, as Chester, Durham,
and Ely, could then giue pardons
concerning the pleas of the crowne, and
send writs in their owne names. In the
Kingdome of Cathay, money is yet neither
of gold nor siluer, nor of any other
metall, but onely of the barke of mulberie
trees, which is cut as well into sundrie
small, as great round peeces, whereon
they engraue the names of their
countrie, rating them, as wee do ours, according
to their greatnesse & smalnesse.
It is petie treason among them to employ
any other money.
                  Sir Thomas Moore reporteth, that
his faigned Vtopians did make chamber-pots,

and other vesselles, that serue
for most vile vses, of gold and siluer.
Moreouer, he saith, that they made great
chaines, fetters, and giues, wherein they
tyed their bondmen, of the very same
metals: and whosoeuer among them for
any offence was infamous, by his eares
hung rings of gold, about his necke was
a chaine of gold. Thus by all meanes
possible, they procured to haue gold
and siluer among them in reproach and
infamie. And if wee Christians examine
our selues somewhat more neere, wee
shall finde, that money is one of the
chiefest causes why so many felonies,
murthers & treasons be committed, and
why the crie of the poore is so often
come before the Lorde. For this cause
Plato the Diuine Philosopher saith, that
Plato li. 5. in leg.
                     In a common-wealth well gouerned, there
should not any money bee vsed, because it
marreth good maners, and maketh the mind
of a man couetous and in satiable.

Chap. 20.
                  ALthough I haue touched this infamous
question in another Booke of
mine,
                     In commentar. in Sat. 5. Pers. yet notwithstanding I iudge it not
amisse, if I repaint the same with more
breuitie, in a more familiar tongue. The
first that instituted the filthie order of
stewes, was Venus, who because shee alone
would not seeme to bee a whore,
(as hauing lyen with Mars, Vulcā, Mercurie,
Anchises, and sundrie others) appoynted
in Cypres, that women should
prostitute themselues for money to all
commers. Which custome was renewed
by the Popes, who built most statelie
houses for whores, and ordained, that
they for the same should pay yeerely
great summes of money. There bee
some men liuing, that know how Pope
Paul the third had aboue fortie thousand
courtizans, that paied him an infinite
tribute. The report goeth, that Pope
Clement the 8. that nowe is, receiueth
of euery baudy house in Rome yeerely, a

Iull, that is, twentie thousand duckets.
                  These Panders are to whorehunters,
as brokers to theeues. They entice yong
lasses with gaudy garments, & deceitfull
promises, to serue euery mans turne for
gaine: which done, they teach these virgins
their schoole-lessons, namely, to
bring in swaggrers to outsweare a mā of
his money, to faine thēselues with child,
made of a cushion (for cōcealme
                        •
                     t wherof,
the bawds must be wel bribed,) to caper
in mens armes til they haue guld thē
of their purses, to counterfeit teares with
an oniō, yea, & to vse fine glozing speeches:
as, Sir, you mistake your marke, I am
none of your wanton Gilles, you abuse my
credit, my mistris cals me. And immediatly
after, perceiuing the lusty wooer to haue
mony in his purse, she begins by degrees
to listen, saying: Many men will promise
much, but performe little, they beare vs in
hād, vntil they haue got their pleasures of vs,
and then away they go, but you lo
                           •
                        ke like an
honest man. After this, the bawdes seeing
their wenches deformed, they giue thē
drugges to raise their colours, and to
seeme fairer. This is the bawdes acquisitiue
facultie, whereby they liue. Some

bawds haue a dozen damsels, some lesse,
yet of euerie man they take largely, as
20. shillings a weeke, or tenne pound a
month. It is said, that lōg Meg of Westminster
kept alwaies 20. Courtizans in
her house, whō by their pictures she sold
to all commers. But I returne to the extirpation
thereof.
                  We reade, thatSocrat. li. 5. hist. Ecclesia. cap. 8. 
                     Theodosius the great, in
the yeere of our Lord 392. vtterly chased al
stewes out of his Empire. For which notable
act, his name euē at this day is greatly
honoured. No lesse praise deserueth
Henry the eight of famous memory, for
abolishing & putting down of the stewes
in London, which then were innumerable.
Therin he imitated the good K. Iosias,2. Reg. 23.
who brake down the houses of the Sodomites,
that were in the house of the Lord.
Finally, no man is ignorant, that the pestilent
disease of the French pockes was
sent as a punishment to stewes.

                     HE that receiueth any thing ouer and aboue
the capitall summe that was lent,
is an vsurer. For which respect I compare
him to an aspet for euen as he that is stūg
with an Aspe, falleth asleepe, as it were

with delight, but dieth ere he awakes: so
an vsurer taketh great pleasure in his
interest at the first, but at length he is so
ouercloyed with money, that he can neuer
enioy any rest: the cause is his conscience,
which like a multitude of furies
vexeth his heart, and fortelles him of his
euerlasting damnation. Hence it is, that
the Romanes inflicted as great punishment
on an vsurer, as on a theefe: and
not without cause, for hee that killeth a
man, riddeth him out of his torments at
once, whereas an vsurer is long in punishing
and vndoing his creditour, causing
him by little and little to pine away. Also,
an vsurer by vndoing of one, vndoeth
many, namely, the wife and whole houshold.
                  Moe Gentlemen heere in England
haue Vsurers, Banquers, and Marchants
driuen to despaire, then either
warres or sicknesse. For when a yong
Punie commeth vnto them, desiring to
be credited for money or apparrell, then
one of them counterfeiting themselues
forsooth to be coy like women, wil burst
foorth into these termes: The world is
hard, and wee are all mortall, wee may not

venture our goods, God knowes howe wee
earne our liuing: wherefore make vs assurance,
and you shall haue tenne poundes
(worth in silkes and veluets.) Well,
this passeth on currant, assurance is giuen
with a witnesse. A little after, if
the Gentleman hath not wherewithal
to pay as wel the interest, as the principall
agreed vpon, whensoeuer this
reprobate cut-throate demaundeth it,
then presently as round as a ball, hee
commenceth his statute-marchant against
him, and for tenne poundes
profite, which was scarce woorth fiue
pound in money, hee recouereth by relapse
ten pound a yeere.
                  O intolerable wickednesse! O diuelish
haberdashers! and worse then those
vngodly tenants, who seeing their Landlords
heyre comming, sayde one to another:

                     This is the heire, come, let vs kill

Darest thou, O wretched cormorant,
hope to bee saued, and expect to bee
partaker of the heauenly blessings?
Art thou a Christian, and wilt suffer thy
brother in Christ thus to miscarie

No, no: thou art a member of Sathan,
thou art in the gall of bitternes,

                     The lawes of England do permit vsurie,
to wit, two shillings in the pound,
therefore an vsurer is not wicked.
                  
                  
                     Answere.
                     It is one thing to permit vsurie, and
another to allow thereof. By our positiue
lawes is meant, that those men, who cared
not, howe much they extorted out of
poore mens handes for the loane of their
money, should bee empaled and limited
within certaine meeres and bounds,
lest they ouerflowed reason So that the
lawes do but mitigate the penalties, and
if it were possible, they would restraine
men from it.

As for example, if he lend to a man

that he giue him sixe bushels at
Bartholmewtide. Secondly, hee that
forestalleth and intercepteth corne in

committeth vsury, that for the loane of his

the money being not repayed him

vsurer, that lendeth his money vpon cō
                     dition,
that the other buy his necessaries
at his shop, or grind at his mill. Fiftly, he
is an vsurer, that keepeth false ballances,
and that selleth bad & musty things
for good and new. Finally, hee that incloseth
commons, & turneth tillage into
pastures, is an vsurer.

ingrate and ingrosse corne in the market,
to the intent he may sell
the same another time at
a dearer price?

corne in the market, and trāsporteth

doubt committeth vsury. For euery mā

                  Of Hospitality. Chap. 24.
                  HOspitality is the chiefest point of
humanity, which an housholder
cā shew, not only vnto his friēds,
but also vnto straungers & wayfaring
men. For which causeChryso. Hom. 44 sup. Gen. 
                     he that keepeth
a good house, and entertaineth straungers,
is said to receiue Christ himself. Which
likewise another holy father confirmeth,
saying:August. lib. cōtra haeres. 
                     We must tēder hospitality without
discretion, lest that the person, whom we exclude
and shut out of doores, be God himselfe.
This Abraham knew very well,
when hee accustomed to sit in his tent
doore of purpose to call in trauellers, and
to relieue them. Among whomGen. 18 
                     he entertayned
on a time three Angels. This
also was not vnknowen to Lot, when
as he vsed to harbour ghestes, andGen. 19 
                     compell
Angels beyng vnder the shape of pilgrimes
to come into his house. Wee read,
that the harlot Rahab, for her hospitality
Iosu. 6.
                     was saued with all her household
from death at the winning of Iericho.
                     
Wherefore, O yee that be rich, see that▪
yee keepe good hospitalitie, and relieue
the impotent and distressed. To conclude,
if we consider more narrowly and
pierce more deepely with a sharpe eye
into the benefits of hospitality, though
no other cause could perswade vs, yet
Luc. 14 Rom. 12 1. Tim 3 Tit. 1. Heb. 13. 2. Pet. 4
                     the monumēts of the new testament might
exhort vs thereunto.
               
               
                  Wherein good hospitality consisteth.
Chap. 25.
                  THey are greatly deceyued, who
thinke, that hospitality doth consist
in slibber-sauces, in spiced meates, or in
diuersities. For these are nought els, saue
fooleries, and fond wasting of goods,
whereby the flesh is prouoked to lechery,
& becommeth altogether inflamed,
massy, and diseased. Further, experience
teacheth, that none are more subiect
to sicknesses, then they, that gurmaundize
and feed on sundry kindes of
dishes. The reason is, because that those
diuersities, which they eat, be repugnant
and contrary the one to the other,
and breed putrifaction and corrupt humours
within their bodies. Whereas

contrariwise they, that liue on one sort of
meat and hardly, do looke faire, lusty, &
well complexioned, and most commonly
attaine vnto very old age. Good hospitality
therefore cons
                        •
                     steth not in gluttonous
diuersities, but rather in one kind
of meat, in clothing the naked, and in giuing
almes vnto the poore.
               
               
                  Why houskeeping now-adaies is
decayed. Chap. 26.
                  THe causes, why hospitality is nowadaies
brought to so low a saile, are
fiue. The first is ambition, which moueth
Gentlemen, that are of large reuenewes,
to weare gorgeous attires, to
traile a costly port after them, to caualiere
it abroad, and giuing vp house-keping
at home, to take a chamber in London,
where they consume their time in
viewing of stage playes, in carousing of
healths, & (perhaps) in visiting of courtizans.
The second is hatred, which
pricketh Gentlemē to fall out with their
neighbors, and to enrich the lawiers by
commencing of suites and cōtrouersies.
The third is couetousnesse, which perswadeth

landlords to hoord vp substāce
for the Diuell, to enhaunce incomes, to
rayse rents (for feare least yeomen keep
better hospitality then themselues,) and
to conuert tillage into pastures. In consideration
of which abominable abuse,
it was most prudently enacted in the
last Parliament, that all landes, which
were conuerted into sheepe pastures, or
to the fatting or grazing of cattell, (the
same hauing beene tillage lands) should
be before the first of May in the yeere
of our Lord 1599. last past, restored
to tillage by the possessours thereof,
and so should continue for euer. It was
further enacted in the said Parliament,
that euery person offending against the
premisses aforesaid, should forfeit for
euery acre not restored the summe of
twenty shillings yeerely, as long as the
offence continued. The fourth reason,
why hospitality is caried to so lowe an
ebbe proceedeth of building; for sooner
shall wee see a Gentleman build a
stately house, then giue almes, and cherish
the needy. The fift and last cause
of the decay of hospitality is gluttony,
which enduceth men to prepare artificiall

cookeries & diuers sorts of meate:
wheras one large and wholesome messe
of meat could peraduenture counteruaile,
yea, and go beyond all their iunkets,
and dainty delicacies.
               
               
                  Of Almes, and the forgetfulnesse therof
in these dayes. Chap. 27.
                  THe poore, being an inferiour family
in Gods church, are recommended
by him to our charge, namely, that wee
should relieue them in their distresse, &
consider, that whatsoeuer wee do vnto
them, we do vnto Christ himselfe, who
for our sakes left a glorious habitation,
and became poore. Besides, we must remēber
to giue almes vnto the poore in
respect of that holy mans saying:Psal. 34 
                     The
poore crieth, and the Lord heareth him, yea,
and deliuereth him out of all his troubles,
Alasse, let vs ponder with our selues,
wherefore did the Lord giue vnto many
of vs such great aboundaunce of wealth
in this life aboue our brethren, if it
were not to vse them well, and to furnish
the needy. The simplest idiot of vs al
doth very wel know, that wealth was not

giuen vs to hoord vp, no nor to consume
the same in superfluous vanities. Why
then do we keep our clothes in our presses,
our money in our coffers? Why do
wee misspend our goods in gaudy rayments,
in caualiering shewes, in feeding
of houndes, in banqueting, in reuelling,
and in a thousand trumperies besides? oh
why do we not waigh in our minds, that
whatsoeuer wee spend more then wee
need, is none of ours, but the poores; &
to detaine from them, is to pill and poll,
yea, and perforce to spoyle them. What
shall we say, when God will demaund an
account of our stewardships? Doubtles,
except wee do out of hand repent, and
giue almes, wee shall bee cast as a pray
vnto the Deuill, and with him bee tormented
in hell for euermore. O fearfull
doome! The misbeleeuing Turkes are
woont secretly to send their seruaunts
abroad, & purposely to hearkē amongst
their neighbours, which of them hath
most need of victuals, money, and apparell.
Yea, & more then that, in their Musaph
or Alcoran they haue these words:
If men knew, how heauenly a thing it were to
distribute almes, they would not spare their

owne flesh, but would euen teare the same,
and slice it into carbonadoes, to giue it vnto
the poore. The Papists, that are ouerwhelmed
in superstition and idolatry, do
hope (although sacrilegiously) to be saued
by their almes-giuing. Oh what a
shamefull thing will this be against vs at
the dreadfull day of iudgement? Verily,
I feare me, it will be easier for them, then
for vs, to enter into the kingdome of
heauen, if speedily we amend not, & be
boūtiful vnto the poore, ForProu. 21 
                     whosoeuer
stoppeth his eares at the crie of the poore,
                     Mat. 18. 
                     shal
also cry himselfe, and not be heard. Where
now-adayes shall we find the woman of
Sarepta to entertaine Elias? where are
Abraham and Lot, to feast the holy Angels?
If Eliza were now liuing, surely he
should want his hostesse the Sunamite.
Nay, which is more, if Christ himselfe
were here, he should neither find Martha
to welcome him, no nor Mary to
powre any sweet oyntments vpon his
head. The members of ChristProu. 18 
                     make supplication,
and pray meekely: but the rich giueth
a rough aunswere. Lazarus beggeth
still without doores, & yet for all his begging
cannot come by the crumbes of the

rich mans table.
                  Wherefore extend your bounty vnto
the poore, O yee that be rich, according
to the proportion of your wealth, and as
your good conscience shall lead you, so
giue. Remēber that your daies be short
vpon earth, and that you haue but a smal
time to liue. Distrust not Gods promise,
who said, thatLuk. 21 whatsoeuer is giuen
to the poore, is lent to himself, and looke,
what you lay out, shall be payd you againe.
                  
                     Obiection.
                     A mā, that hath a great charge of children,
cannot well giue almes vnto the
poore: therefore he may be excused.
                  
                  
                     Aunswere.
                     Marke what Christ saith:Mat. 20 
                        He that loueth
his father and mother aboue me, is not worthy
of me.
                        1. Ioh. 3 
                        The loue of God is not with them,
who will not benefit the poore. The widow
of Sarepta preferred not her sonne
before Elias in the time of famine; neither
was that lost, which shee bestowed
on Elias. In a word, no man must despayre
of Gods reward.Ps. 36. 
                        I have beene
yoūg, (quoth the Prophet Dauid) and
now am old; and yet saw I neuer the

righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging their
bread publickly with vtter shame and
discredit.
                  
               
               
                  Circumstaunces to be obserued
in giuing of almes.
Chap. 28.
                  HOwbeit for all this, I am not so indulgent
and fond, that I would haue
men to distribute almes without exception,
and without due regard of circumstaunces.
For herein fiue things are to
bee respected: whereof the first is, that
they giue their almes for the Lords
sake, and that voluntarily, of their owne
proper motion. The second, that they
argue with them touching their religiō,
before they giue them any thing, to the
end, they may vnderstand, whether they
be true Protestants, or froward Papists,
or Atheists. The third, that they dispute
with thē concerning their conuersation.
The 4. that they giue their almes vnto
religious men, and to them that be old,
blind, lame, or crazed and sicke of body.
The fift & circumstāce to be noted,
and followed in distributing of almes, is,
that men giue them not for a brauery,

and vainglory, to be praysed and extolled
of the world, but rather of pure zeale
& deuotion, not expecting any recompence
againe.
               
               
                  Of Fasting. That an housholder should
obserue fasting dayes.

                     Cas. in Append. thesaur. Oecon. 
                     EVen as learned and wise Physicians, in
euery fluxe of the belly occasioned of surfet
and repletion, do for the most part prescribe
an exquisite diet, and also a purgation,
to wit, of Rheubarb or such like, to
the end that not onely the superfluous substaunce
of the belly may be drawne out, but
also that nature may be strengthened by the
secret property and vertue of the Medicine:
so expert and wise householders
ought in time of famine specially to
haue regard, that they lay downe a limited
order of fasting vnto their families,
whereby they may not onely purge
the rebellious humours of the flesh, but
likewise in after-clappes sustaine themselues
the better from pouerty and
dearth. Oh, what is it for a man to spare
two meales in a weeke, and bestow the

estimate vpon the poore? Alasse, it is
not much out of their way.
                  
                     Wee read that the Iewes, so oft as
they would pacifie or aske any benefit
of GOD, vsed most commonly to
fast. By fasting
                     Exo. 24 Moses saw God.3. Reg. 19. & Tertulli. de ieiun. aduersus Psychi. & Cypr. de ieiunio & tē

God.Ionas 3. The Niniuites fasted with repentance,
and were pardoned. By fasting
                     Dan. 3. Daniel
reuealed Nabuchodonozors dreame.
                  But if these examples can worke no
charity in the adamant and steely hearts
of our English Rookes: yet ciuill policy,
me thinkes, and her Maiesties commaundement
might preuayle so much
with them, that they obserue Frydaies,
Saturdayes, Lent, and Ember dayes (so
neere as they may) as fasting dayes, both
for the preseruation of meates ordained
for their owne sustenaunce, and for
the safegard of their consciences, and
for the supplying of their neyghbours
wants.
                  
                     Obiection.
                     Good meates do nourish bloud, and
do reuiue aswell the vitall as the animall
spirites. As for fish, figges, and
such like, they bee slimy, windy, and

make a man to bee ill complexioned.
And againe fasting is more daungerous,
for it weakneth and enfeebleth the
whole body: therefore a man ought not
to obserue fasts.
                  
                  
                     Answere.
                     Al the commodities, which you bring
on the behalfe of meats are nothing in
comparison of the good, that spring of
fasting, for by it men become capable of
visions, and of the word of God; by it
many sicknesses are alayed. Wheras on
the contrary, by flesh the body is enflamed,
and tormented with hot burning
agues, & with innumerable maladies besides.
So that the commodities of fasting
do farre exceed & downewaigh the discōmodities
thereof. Yet notwithstāding,
I verily beleeue, that old persons, and
cholerick folkes may be licensed to eat
flesh. In like maner women with child,
scholers, and they, that by study and
care haue annoyed their spirits, might
be authorized from fasting. In briefe,
I am perswaded, thatHieron. ad Laet. 
                        fasting is hurtfull
for them, which haue not attained to their
perfect growth and strength.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  Of the true fast. Chap. 30.
                  NEuerthelesse, I am of this mind, that
those men obserue not the true fast,
which hypocritically forgo a meale or
two, of purpose, colourably to hunt for
worldly prayse, and to be accounted religious
in the sight of man: but they rather
are the true and allowed fasters,
that strongly leane to the euerliuing
God, that shunne as the horrour of hell
al earthly vanities, and that mortifie the
filthy appetites of the flesh. Albeit the
other (I confesse) is a coadiutour to
that thing, and auayleth much for that
purpose.
                  Whosoeuer therefore is willing to
fast vprightly, and according to the ordinaunce
of GOD, must fast with all
the members of his body. First, hee
must fast with his eyes, and not pry too
much into the pompeous shewes, & dazeling
beauty of this world, lest at the
sight thereof, as of a Cockatrice, he be
wounded to death both of body and
soule. Next, he must fast with his eares,
that is, hee must not consent to the alluring
speeches of Seminarie Priests,

heretikes, flatterers, slaūderers, and such
like, lest Sirenlike they entice him into
their snares. Thirdly, he must fast with
his toung, and beware of blasphemies,
lies, and vngodly communications.
                  Fourthly, he must fast with his mouth,
that is, he must take heed that he eat and
drinke no more, then sufficeth nature,
and that he abstaine from meats at conuenient
seasons, whereby as with a wing
he may fly into heauen. Fiftly, he must
fast with his heart, and refraine from sinfull
and idle thoughts. Sixtly, hee must
fast with his feet, and bridle them
from being too swift to shead
bloud, or from trudging
to London for proces
against his
brethren.

                  Of a Common-wealth. Chap. 1.
                  
                     A Common-wealth is a societie
of free mē, vnited together
by a generall consent,
to the end to liue well and
orderly, not onely in regard
of iustice, but also of commoditie,
and for the preseruation of themselues,
as well in peace, as in warre. The which
is a thing naturall, both in respect of
parts, to wit, a shire, a parish, and a family,
whereof a Commonwealth is the accomplishment:
and of men naturally disposed
to liue in societie.
                  
                     
Neuerthelesse, there haue beene many
societies, which were not Common-wealths,
but certaine base habitations in
villages, where the weaker yeelded seruice
to the stronger. Also, the Arabians
at this day, wander vp and down, ignorant
of liuing, and do carrie about with
them their woodden habitations, which
they draw vpon charrets, seeking for
prayes and spoyles frō the riuer Euphrates,
along vnto the sea Atlantique. But
to these and such like, well may I apply
that saying of the Philosopher, namely,

men in perfection.

be destroyed, both we and

our families must likewise come to vtter
destruction. Let this serue for a watchword
to our English Fugitiues, who vnnaturally

where the gouernement of the
whole Common-wealth, is in one

mans hand. This kind regarding the
weale publike, more then the weale priuate,
is named the soueraigne authoritie,
as in England, France, Spaine, Denmarke,
Polonia, and Swethland. The
second, an Aristocracie, where the smaller
number, and those of the best sort do
beare rule; as the Senate of Rome in
times past, and the Gentlemen of Venice
at this present day. The third kinde
of a Common-wealth is called a Democracie,
where the regiment of a Commonwealth
consisteth in the power of al,
or else, of the greater part of the people:
as in ancient times at Athens, and nowe
at this present, the Cantons of Switzerland.

                     This inferiour world obeyeth the superiour,

of the world) which issueth down
frō the celestiall essence, & spreadeth it

selfe through the lumpe of this huge
body, to nourish all things vnder the
Moone. In like maner, we see the sunne
the principall minister of this celestiall
vertue, as a monarch among the Planets,
illuminating al the world with his
glistering beams. We see the Moone as
an Empresse, predominant ouer al moist
things. We see the fire bearing the soueraigntie
ouer the other elements. In musicall
concents consisting of soundes, we
see the treble as it were commāding the

                     all superiour and inferiour things are
much better ordered by the arbitrement of
one, then by the aduice of many?
                  
                  Moreouer, there bee foure forcible
reasons, which prooue that a Monarchy
ought to be preferred before all other
sorts of gouernments. First,Iustin. ex lib. 1. Trog. Pompe. 
                     from the beginning
of countryes and nations, the gouernement
was in the hands of Kings, who
were not extolled to that high degree of maiestie
by Ambition, but for their modestie,
which was knowne to all men. Likewise,
 that which is auncient and first▪
                     
                     Ari. li. 3 Topicor. cap. 1. 
                     is more
noble then that which is newfangled and later.
Secondly, the image of a monarchie
is found in priuate families. For the authority
of a father ouer his children, may
bee resembled to a royall gouernment,
because the Children are the fathers
charge: hee alone must prouide for
them, and their offences are by him
chastised. With which concurreth that
common speech: Euery man is a King in
his owne house. Thirdly, a Monarchie
hath continued aboue a thousand
yeeres; whereas the longest Aristocracie
and Democracie, haue not lasted
aboue sixe hundred yeeres.
                  
                     
Our Kingdome of Brittaine retained
a Monarchie, from the time that
Brutus first inhabited it, vntill Cadwalader,
who was the last king of the
British bloud; which was aboue foureteene
hundred yeeres. Then in the
yeere of our Lorde 574. the Kingdome
was diuided among seuen of the
Nobles, who still continued ciuill
warre one vpon the other, vntill Ecbert
in the yeere 800. reduced the
seuen prouinces into one whole Kingdome.
Since which time there ruled
Princes as Monarches, vntill now this
yeere of our Lord, one thousand six hū
                     dred.
Whereby wee finde, that our
Monarchie hath alreadie lasted full
eight hundred yeeres. Scotland likewise
hath endured in a Monarchie,
from the yeere of our Lord eight hundred
and twentie, Dungall then raigning,
vntill this present yeere. Fourthly,
a Monarch carrieth a greater maiestie,
whereby hee seemes gratious and
amiable in the sight of his subiects,
and dreadfull to his enemies. To
conclude, lette vs consent, thatPlato. lib. 1. de. leg. 
                     a
Monarchie is the most excellent regiment

of all others, as that which draweth neerest
to Gods will, who is the Monarch of all
Monarches, King of Kings, and Lord of
Lordes.
                  
                     Obiection.
                     It is better to be subiect vnto God alone,
then vnto man: for he foreseeth al
things to come,Math. 10. and without his prouidence
one sparrow shall not fall on the
ground. And seeing that hee is so carefull
for these small things, will not he, thinke
you, care forIbidem. 
                        man, that is of more value
then many sparrowes? Furthermore, wee
are Christians,1. Pet. 2. 
                        chosen of God, and pretious
as liuely stones, and also made a spirituall
house, an holy priesthood, to offer vp
spirituall sacrifices to God by Iesus Christ,
                        Math. cap. vlt.
                        with whom the presence of his spirit will alwayes bee, vntill the end of the world.
Therefore iniurie is done vnto him,
if wee allow of any other Monarch, but
onely him.
                  
                  
                     Answere.
                     EVen as it hath pleased God of his diuine
prouidence to ordain the sunne,
Moone, and elements, as Emperours ouer

this inferiour world: so in like maner,
hee working by such meanes and
instruments,Exo. 3. Deut. 31. 
                        constituted Moses, Iosuah,
and others, iudges ouer his people, by
whome as his instruments, hee brought
to passe his sacred will, and deliuered
the Israelites from Egypt, where they
were enthralled. And although hee
defendes vs with an outstretched arme,
and hath illuminated vs with the light
of his Gospel, yet notwithstanding,
hee hath appointed Princes, as his vicegerents
and instruments heere on earth,
to see his word plan
                           •
                        ed, heresies rooted
out, and offenders by political lawes
executed.
                     Monarches therefore must bee obeyed,
r as the ministers of God, to take
vengeance on the wicked.Rom. 13. Ibid. There is no
power but of God, and the powers that
bee, are ordained of God. Wherefore,
Exod. 23. Let no man speake euill of the ruler of
the Common-wealth.
                  
               
               
                  
                  That hereditarie succession is better
then Election.
Chap. 4.
                  
                     Lipsius lib. 2. Politicor. cap. 4. MAny affect the place of a monarch,
not to any good end (they
being not good themselues) whome
neuerthelesse the custome or lawe of
Nations hath restrained by a double
bridle of election and succession. The
latter is that, when maiestie commeth
of descent, and one Prince is borne
of another. The other, when as birthright
being set aside, they are chosen by
consent of voyces.
                  Succession without doubt is the better,
as by reasons shall appeare. First, it
is meete that the sonne possesse the
Kingdome for the Fathers sake. Secondly,
the sonne is brought vp to follow
his fathers steps, especially in defending
of religion. Thirdly,Tacitus lib. 2. Histor. 
                     the alteration
of matters giues opportunitie to strange
and great attempts. Fourthly, the sonne
by nature from his father obtaineth a

smacke of policie, and beeing alwayes
present with him, knoweth the state
of the Kingdome better then any other.
Fiftly, the successour is woont to administer
iustice more constantly and sincerely.
Whereas the elect Prince must
in a maner fawne on his electours and
newe subiects. Finally,Curtius lib. 4. histor. 
                     No authoritie
can prosper or endure, which is purchased
by canuasing and flatteries, & there is lesse
danger in the acceptation of a Prince,
then in the election.
               
               
                  The dutie of a Prince.
Chap. 5.
                  THere are foure cheefe qualities necessarie
for a Prince to maintaine his
reputation. The first is clemencie, to
forgiue trespasses. For as the Sunne,
when it is highest in the Zodiake, moueth
slowest: so the higher a Prince
is soared to greatnesse, the more gratious
and meeke hee ought to bee towardes
his humble subiects. The second,
to imprint the lawes and ordinances
of God in his minde, and to leuell
all his actions to the glorie of the

king of kings: as well for the health of
his owne soule, which hee ought to hold
dearer then his whole kingdome, yea,
then all the world: as for good ensample
and imitation vnto his subiects. The
third is liberalitie, to succour poore scholers
and souldiours; for as there is nothing
more common then the sunne,
that communicateth his light to all the
celestiall bodies, and chiefely to the
Moone, so a prince ought to impart part
of his reuenewes to the distressed, and
especially aboue the rest, to students &
Souldiours. The fourth, to haue courage
and vertue to tolerate abuses. For
Boetius lib. 3. de consolation. philosoph. metr. 5.
                     Although his power and authoritie extend
so farre, that the countrie of India quaketh
at his commandement: & although the farthest
Island in the sea doth serue and obey
him: yet if hee cannot bridle his owne affections,
his power is not worthie to be esteemed.
                  
               
               
                  Of the name of Emperour.
Chap. 6.
                  THis name Emperour the Romanes
first inuented, not for their Kings,

but for their warlike Generalles. Serranus,
Camillus, Fabius Maximus, and
Scipio the Affrican, as long as they gouerned
the Romane hosts, were entituled
Emperours. But when they finished
their warres, they were called by
their owne proper names. Afterward,
when Antonie was discomfi
                        •
                     ed by Augustus
Caesar, it chanced that the common-wealth
came altogether into his
hands. Whereupon the Romanes desired
that hee would not assume vnto
himselfe the name of King, because it
was odious vnto thē, but that he would
vse another title, vnder which they
would bee his loyall and obedient subiects.
Then Augustus being at that time
Generall, and therefore named Emperour,
chose this title, to doe the Romanes
pleasure. So that Augustus Caesar
was the first, that called himselfe by
the name of Emperour. The cause why
they hated the name of King, was by
reason that their forefathers in auncient
times, hauing deposed their King
Tarquin for his tyrannies and rapes, had
forbidden by an edict and solemne
othe, the name of King euer after to be

vsed among them. Augustus beeing
dead, Tiberius succeeded him in the
Empire of Rome; then Caligula, Claudius,
Nero, and foure and thirtie more,
before the Empire was by Constantine
the great, in the yeere of our Lord
310. transferred to Constantinople,
where it continued vnited vntill the
yeere of our Lord seuen hundred ninetie
and foure. At which time the Empire
was parted into the East and West,
which lasted in that sort, vntill the yeere
of our Lord a thousand, foure hundred,
fiftie and three, Constantinople to the
great disparagement of all Christian
Princes, was taken by the great Turke,
called Mahomet the second. Neuerthelesse,
the Empire of the West, or
rather of Germanie, since that time
hath as yet remained with the house of
Austria, Rodolph the second now raigning.
               
               
                  
                  Of the name of King.
Chap. 7.
                  TOuching the title of King, it is to be
noted, that according to the diuersitie
of Nations, so did they diuersly nominate
their Princes: to wit, among the
Egyptians they named them Pharaoes:
among the Persians, Arsacides: among
the Bythinians, Ptolomeyes: among
the Latines, Siluii: among the Sicilians,
Tyraunts: among the Argiues,
Kings: among the Sara
                        •
                     ens, Amiraes:
and nowe of late among the Persians,
Soldanes. In the beginning of the world
all Princes were termed Tyrants: but
when people beganne to perceiue, how
great difference was betwixt the one
and the other,Plutar. lib. de Repub. 
                     they agreed among themselues,
to call the good Princes Kings, and
the wicked Tyrants. Whereby wee see,
that this title of King is authorized only
vnto iust Princes, and that doe well deserue
to be so named.
                  
                     In this Realme of England, there
hath not at any time beene vsed any
other generall authoritie, but onely
the most royall and kingly maiestie.
                     
                     Smith. lib. 1. de Repub. Anglicā. cap. 9.Neither hath any King of this Realme,
taken any inuestiture at the handes of the
Emperour of Rome, or of any other forraine
prince, but helde his kingdome of God to
himselfe, and by his sword, his people and
crowne, acknowledging no Prince in earth
his superiour, and so it is kept and holden at
this day.

Chap. 8.
                  WOmen by gouerning haue got no
lesse renowne then men, as is euedent
by learned Histories. For which
causePlato li. 34. de legumlat. 
                     The Diuine Philosopher found
great fault with his countrymē the Graecians,
because their Noblewomen were
not instructed in matters of state & policie.
Likewise Iustinian the Emperour
was highly displeased with the Armenians,
Nouell 21. de Armen.
                     For that most barbarously they
prohibited women from enioying heritages,
and bearing rule, as though (quoth
hee,) women were base and dishonoured,
and not created of God.
                     Iustiniā. in Nouel. 18. cap. 4. § neque illo de c
                           •
                        ter. 
                     In the right

of succession the sisters sonne is equall to the
brothers sonne. Whereby is vnderstood,
that women are licensed to gouerne, aswell
as men.
                  Moreouer, there be two forcible reasons,
that conclude women to be most
apt for Seignories. First,Galat. 3. 
                     there is neither
Iew, nor Graecian: there is neither bond
nor free: there is neither male, nor female,
for they are all one in Christ Iesus. The
minds, and actions of men and women
do depēd of the soule, in the which there
is no distinction of sexe, whereby the
soule of a man should bee called male,
and the soule of a woman female. The
sexe rather is the instrument or meanes
of generation; and the soule ingendreth
not a soule, but is alway permanent and
the very same. Seeing therefore that a
womans soule is perfect, why should she
be debarred by any statute or salique
law from raigning?Aristot. li. 1. Polit. ca. 3. 
                     The body is but lumpish,
and a vassall to the soule, and for that
respect not to be respected. Secondly,Senec. in Epistol. 
                     vertue
excludeth none, but receyueth all, regarding
neither substaunce nor sexe. What
should I rippe vp the examples of sundry
nations,Lipsius li. 1. Polit. cap. 3. 
                     which preferred women before

themselues. And for that causeTacitus li. de morib. Germanor. 
                     they
did neyther reiect their counsels, nor set
light by their answeres. Semiramis after
the death of her husband Ninus, fearing
lest the late conquered Aethiopians
would reuolt and rebell from her
Sonne yet young of yeeres and ignorant
of rule; tooke vpon her the principality,
and for the time of his nonage,
ordered the kingdome so princely, that
shee passed in feates of armes, in triumphs,
conquests, and wealth, all her
predecessours. Nicocris defended her
Empire against the Medes, (who then
sought the Monarchy of the world) and
wrought such a miracle in the great riuer
of Euphrates, as all men were astonished
at it; for shee made it contrary
to mens expectation to leaue the ancient
course, & so to follow her deuice to
and fro, to serue the citie most commodiously:
insomuch that she did not onely
surpasse all men in wit, but ouercame
the elements with power. Isis after the
decease of her husband Osyris raigned
ouer Egypt, and tooke care for so much
prouision for the common wealth, that
shee was after her death worshipped as

a Goddesse. Debora iudged Israel: Iudith
the Bethulians: Lauinia after the
death of Eneas gouerned Italy: Dido
Carthage: Olympias Pirrhus his daughter
ruled ouer Epire: Aranea was queen
of Scythia: Cleopatra of Egypt. Helena
after the death of Leo the Emperour
raigned in Constantinople ouer all Asia
as Empresse. Ioanna was queene of Nauarre,
& marying with Philip Pulcher
the French king, made him king of Nauarre
in the yeere of our Lord 1243.
Margaret ruled ouer Flaunders in the
yeere of our Lord 1247. And another
Princesse of that name ye only daughter
of Valdemare the 3. king of Dēmark &
Norway gouerned those kingdoms after
her fathers death; & in the yeere of our
Lord 1389. she tooke Albert the king of
Swethland captiue, & kept him in prison
7. yeeres. Ioanna was queene of Naples
in the yeer 1415. Leonora Dutchesse of
Aquitaine was maried to Henry Duke
of Gaunt, and in despight of the French
K. brought him Aquitaine & Poiteaux
in the yeere 1552. Queene Mary raigned
here in Englād in the yeere 1553.
What should I write of Elizabeth our

gratious Queene, that now is? which by
her Diuine wisedome brought three admirable
things to passe. First, her Maiesty
reformed religion, that by the Romish
Antichrist was in her sisters time
bespotted. Secondly, she maintayned
her countrey in peace, whē all her neighbour
Princes were in an vprore. Thirdly,
she triumphed ouer all her foes, both
domesticall and hostile, traiterous and
outlandish. If a man respect her learning,
it is miraculous, for shee can discourse
of matters of state with the best
Philosopher; she vnderstandeth sundry
kinds of languages, and aunswereth forreine
Ambassadours in their forreine
tongues. If a man talke of the administration
of iustice, all the nations vnder
the heauens cannot shew her peere. In
summe, her Princely breast is the receiuer,
or rather the storehouse of all the
vertues, aswell morall as intellectuall.
For which causes England hath iust occasion
to reioyce, and to vaunt of such
a gratious mother. To whome the Monarch
of Monarches long continue her
highnesse, and strengthen her (as he hath
done hitherto) to his perpetuall glory,

confusion of all her enemies, and to our
euerlasting comfort.
               
               
                  Of Tyraunts. Chap. 9.
                  SIr Thomas Smith termeth himLib. 1. de Repu. Anglic. cap. 7. 
                     a Tyraunt,
that by force commeth to the Monarchy
against the will of the people, breaketh
lawes already made at his pleasure, and
maketh other without the aduise and consent
of the people, and regardeth not the
wealth of his commons, but the aduauncemēt
of himself, his faction, & kindred. Also,
there be two sorts of Tyrants.Bartol. in tract. de tyrān. 
                     The one
in title, the other in exercise. He is in title
Tyrant, that without any lawfull title vsurpeth
the gouernment. In exercise, he that
hath good title to the principality, and commeth
in with the good will of the people, but
doth not rule wel and orderly, as he should.
And so not onely they, which behaue
themselues wickedly towards their subiects,
are called Tyraunts, as Edward the
second of this realme in the yeere of our
Lord 1319. and Alphonsus of Naples,
that lawfully came to the crowne in the
yeere 1489. but also they are named
tyrants, which albeit they behaue themselues

well, yet they are to be called tyraunts,
in that they had no title to the
principality; as S
                        •
                     eno the King of Denmark,
that vsurped this realme of England
in the yeere 1017. and Pope Clement
the eight, that now is, who about
two yeeres ago seysed on the Dukedome
of Ferraria onely by pretence of a
gift, which Constantine time out of
mind bequeathed to the papacy. Furthermore,
there be sixe tokens to know
a tyrant. The first, if hee sends abroad
pickthanks, talebearers, and espies to
hearken what men speake of him, as Tiberius
the Emperour was woont to do.
The second, if he abolisheth the study
of learning, andTacit. in vita Agricolae. 
                     burneth the monuments
of most worthy wittes in the market place,
and in the assembly of the people, least his
subiects should attaine to the knowlege
of wisedome. As Alaricus king of the
Gothes did in Italy, in the yeere 313.
and the great Turke in his Empire.
The third, if hee maintaine schismes,
diuisions, and factions in his kingdome,
for feare that men should prie into his
doings. As the Popes haue done alway
from time to time: and of late daies the

Queene mother in Fraunce. The fourth,
if hee trust straungers more then his
owne naturall subiects; and continually
goeth garded with a strong company:
As Vortiger sometime king of this
Realme did, when he brought in Hengist
and the Saxons, and gaue them the
countreys of Kent and Essex to inhabit.
The fift, if he without cause cōmand his
chiefest nobles to be cashiered & branded
with ignominy, or to be imprisoned
and put to death, for feare lest they
should waxe too popular and ouermighty.
Such a one was Frauncis Sfortia
Duke of Millain, that caused Alphonsus
king of Naples villanously at a banquet
to murther Earle Iames sonne to Nicholas
Picinio (whome he had sent Ambassadour
to the sayd Alphonsus) for no other
cause, then for that hee feared his
might, & because the Braciques in Italy,
& some of his subiects highly esteemed
him. The sixt token to know a tyrant, is,
if he do away learned and wise men for
no other intent, then that fearing they
should reproue him, & write against his
depraued & vngodly life. As Domitius
Nero, that commaunded Seneca the

Philosopher, and the Poet Lucan to be
slaine; and Domitian, that banished the
Poet luuenal for the same cause. But of
this matter I haue spokenIn Comment in Satyr. 3. Pers. in another
booke.
               
               
                  Whether it be lawfull for subiects to rise
against their Prince being a tyraunt
or an heretique?
Chap. 10.
                  EVen as the Prince ought to remoue
the causes of mislike, which his subiects
haue conceiued against him, and to
extinguish the flame, that being nourished
in one seuerall house would breake
into the next, and at last into the whole
towne: so in like maner subiects ought
to please their soueraigne, and to tolerat
all rigour, yea, and to lay downe their
neckes vpon the block, rather then to
cōspire against his power, which he hath
from God. It may be, that he is raised as
another Nabuchodonozor of the Lord
for a scourge to punish the transgressiōs
and enormities of the inhabitants.Plautus 
                     The
dishonourable things, which a Prince doth,
ought to be accounted honourable. Men
must patiētly (for they can do no otherwise)

beare with an vnreasonable deàre
yeere, with vnseasonable stormes, and
with many blemishes and imperfections
of nature. Therefore they ought to endure
with as constant courages the heresies
and tyrannies of their soueraigne.
But, thou wilt say, subiectes must obey
only iust and vpright Princes. To which
I answere, thatEphes. 6. & Coloss. 3. 
                     parents are bound to their
children with reciprocall and mutuall duties.
Yet, if parents depart from their
duty, and prouoke their children to desperation:
Ibidem.
                     it becommeth not children to
be lesse obedient to their parents.
                     Calu. li. 4. Instit. cap. 20. 
                     But they
are subiect both to euill parēts, and to such,
as do not their duty. Further, if seruants
must be obedient to their masters, aswel
curteuos as curst, much more ought
subiects to obey not onely their gentle,
but also their cruell Princes.
                  This Didacus Couarruuias an excellent
Lawier confirmeth, saying:2. part. Decret. cap. 3. §. 4. 
                     If a
Prince, (whether by succession or election
he was made, it skilleth not) doth exceed
the limits of law and reason, he cannot bee
deposed, nor put to death by any subiect;
Yea,Soto li. 5. de iustitia &

                        re. q. 1. artic. 3. 
                     it is hereticall to hold that paradoxe.
ForDan. 2. & 4. 
                     God is he, which chaungeth the times

and seasons: he taketh away kings, and setteth
vp Kings: to the intent, that liuing men
might know, that the most high hath power
ouer the kingdome of men, and giueth it to
whomesoeuer hee will, and appointeth ouer
it the most abiect among men. Hence is
it, that we seldome heare of rebels, that
euer prospered, but in the end they were
bewrayed and brought to confusion. In
the time of Henry the fourth there rebelled
at one time against him the Duke
of Exceter, with the Dukes of Gloucester,
Surrey, Aumarle, & Salisburie: and
at another time the Earle of Worcester,
the Archbishop of Yorke, & Hēry Hotspurre
sonne to the Earle of Northūberland;
all which were either slaine or beheaded.
To come neerer the state of this
question, we find, that Leonagildus an
auncient king of the Gothes in Spaine,
both a tyrant and an Arrian in the yeere
of our Lord 568. pursued the true Christians,
and exiled his own sonne, because
he was of the true religion. Whereupon
this young Prince being moued
at the persecution of the Christians in
his countrey, did twise raise armes against
his Lord and Father. At the first

he was taken captiue and banished; at
the second he was put to death on Easter
day. By which example wee may note
the effects of Gods iudgements, and rebuke
the rashnesse of this Prince, that
rebelled against his soueraigne.
                  Wherefore, O yee that be subiect to
cruell Princes, refraine your fury, learne
to obey, & beware lest the same chance
vnto you, which is faigned to haue chanced
vnto the frogs, who being importunat
on Iupiter to haue a king, a beame
was giuen them: the fi

                     t fall whereof did
somwhat affright them, but when they
saw it stil lie in the streame, they insulted
theron with great disdain, & praied for a
king of a quicker spirit: thē was sent vnto
them a stork, which tyrānized & daily
deuoured them. In a word, rebels in taking
care to auoid one calamity, do entā
                     gle
themselues in a whole peck of troubles,
as by this fable of ye frogs is euident.
And oftentimes it hapneth that the remedy
is more dangerous then the malady
it selfe; for of one tyraunt they make
three Hydraes, or els in seeking to shun
tyranny, they reduce their gouernment
to a troublesome Democracy.
               
               
                  
                  Of an Aristocracy. Chap. 11.
                  THe rule of a certain and prescribed
number of noblemen & Gentlemē
respecting the benefite of the common
wealth, is termed an Aristocracy: & if any
ambitiously preferre their priuat cō
                     modity
before the publick good, and by
cōspiracies dispose of all matters appertaining
to the cōmonwealth, as it please
thē, it is named an Oligarchy. For as irō
is consumed in time by rust, although it
auoideth al incōueniēces; so some peculiar
dammage or other sticketh to euery
commonwealth according to the nature
therof; as for exāple, thisAristot. lib. 4. Politicor. 
                     Oligarchy endamageth
an Aristocracy; Tyrāny is opposite
to a Monarchy, & sedition to a Democracy.
That Aristocracy is best allowed, where
the gouernment is allotted to a few noble
& vertuous men, which bestow most
in common seruices, and make lawes for
the rest, directing their cogitations to no
other scope, then the publick good of
their countrey. The citizens of Venice
do deliuer the discussing of their matters,
aswell ordinary, as of importance,
to the Senate, which are very fewe in

number, as not ignorant, how, few being
made priuy of their matters, they should
bee the more priuily managed. Neuerthelesse
this kind of commonwealth being
compared with a monarchy, will be
found imperfect & farre inferiour. True
it is, that siluer and tinne are good, but
yet imperfect metals in comparison of
gold, wherein the souerainety and perfection
of all metals consist. In like maner
an Aristocracy well tempered may
be good, but seldome it so falleth out.
This Realme of England, when it was
diuided into prouinces, as Mercia, Northūberlād,
& others, & ruled by the nobles,
was soone surprized by the Danes:
whereas if it had continued counted,
they durst neuer aduenture to set foot in
any one place of this realme. Briefly, an
Aristocracy disagreeth with the law of
natiōs, which all men held in great estimation,
forL. ex hoc genere ff. de iustitia, & iure. 
                     all nations had kingdomes distinct,
and Kings appointed for them. The
Israelites required a king of the Prophet
Samuel: for, said they,I. Sam. 8. 
                     Wee will be
like all other nations, and our King shal iudge
vs, and go out before vs, and fight our battels.
                  
                  
                     
                     Obiection.
                     Mediocrity in al things is praise-worthy,
& extreames dispraised: an Aristocracy
is the mediocrity between a Monarchy
& a Democracy: therefore it is
best.
                  
                  
                     Answere.
                     The mediocrity betweene a Monarchy
& a Democracy is perfect & praise-worthy,
if it could be equally diuided,
& thereby the vertue drawne out; which
is in a maner impossible.
                  
               
               
                  Of a Democracy, Chap. 12.
                  A Democracy of all regiments is the
very worst, as being a market where
all things are sold, & fashioned by owles,
whose sight the night lighteneth, & the
day makes dim. What is more preposterous,
then to see the multitude (a mōster
of many heads) void of discretion, deliberating
and determining on wise mens
deeds, yea, & now & then on their liues?
are not they still shuffling the cardes and
desirous of new cōmotions? are not they
wauering & corrupt? wretched, I say, &
miserable is that commonwealth, which
wāts a head, & where the people raigne.
Persius Satyr. 5.
                     Sooner will a foole be brought to play vpō a

that hauing need of physicians wise
& experienced, he will put his body into

Which caused Anacharsis the Philosopher,
when hee saw the Areopagites
propoūding causes, & the people resoluing

the Athenians moued matters, & fooles

the Florētines sustain by this sort of gouernment,
vntil of late it was reduced by
the Mediceis into a monarchy? In fine, ye
multitude cōpoūded of many & diuers
spirits, of maners, & customes, can neuer
distinguish between good & bad co sel,

they hold to be curiosity. But whatsoeuer
is rash & hasty, that is thought by them
to be couragiously deliberated.

                     Of the continuance of the Switzers
popular gouernment, I find two causes.
The first, they haue slaine all their noblemen,
and they mistrust not one another.
The second, the most factious and
seditious of them are commonly abroad
as mercenary souldiers vnder the Frēch
king and other potentates, and the rest
at home more tractable regard not how
the world goeth.

Chapt. 13.
                  ALl the people, which be in euery
royall commonwealth, are generally
either Gentlemen or of the
commonaltie. Of Gentlemen
there be three degrees. Vnder the first
and chiefest is the Prince comprehended.
Vnder the second, Dukes, Marquesses,

Earles, Vicounts, Barons, and
Knights of honour. Vnder the third and
last are contained Knights, Graduates
of law, Esquires, Masters of Arts, Captaines,
and they that beare the countenance
and port of Gentlemen. Whereunto
also might bee added a fourth degree
of Gentlemen, whome wee name
Gentlemen of the first head: I meane
them,Smith. li. 1. de Repub. Anglic. cap. 20. 
                     to whome Heraldes for money doe
giue armes, newly made and inuented, the
title whereof shall pretend to haue beene
found by the sayde Heralds, in perusing
and viewing of olde Registers, where his ancestors
in times past had beene recorded to
beare the same. The Commonaltie likewise
is diuided into Citizens, Artificers,
Marchants, and Yeomen.
               
               
                  Of Noblemen.
Chap. 14.
                  IF wee call to remembrance all things
that wee haue seene, wee shal finde euery
one thing in particular to excel the
rest of the same kind, in some perfection
or other. Let vs looke vp into the Zodiake,
and there wee shall see the sunne

Diamond, the Smaragde, and Saphire.
Among trees, the Pine, the Iuniper, the
apple-tree. And so among liuing things,
some exceede others. What maruaile
therefore is it, if among men, the verie
same order bee obserued? In the buying
or selling of a horse, wee glorie & boast
of his sire: and shall wee not respect, of
what stocke and parentage a man is descended?
Boetius lib. 3. de Consolation. Philosoph. metr. 6.
                     Eueryman, I confesse, commeth
of Noble seede, that is to say, from
God; but afterwards he becommeth degenerate
and ignoble, by forsaking God
his beginning, and by leaning vnto wicked
vices. For which cause there was a
law in Rome termed Prosapia, that is, the
law of discēt, by the which it was ordained,
that whē cōtention did arise in the
senate house, for the Cōsulship, that they
which descēded from the Torquatians,
Decians, and Fabricians, should obtaine
the place before others.
                  Concerning Noblemens priuiledges,
they be many, wherof we wil at this present

recite onely 5. First, a Nobleman
cānot be chalēged to the combat or lists,
by any inferior man. Secondly, a Noblemā
is sooner preferred to beare office in
the Cōmon-wealth, to sit in commissiō,
& to be an arbitrator betwixt partie and
partie. Thirdly, by the ciuill law, the testimonies
of Noblemen are sooner approoued.
And whereas inferior gentlemē
must personally appeare in criminall
causes, it is lawfull for Noblemen to bee
absent, so that they substitute an atturney
or proctor for them. Fourthly, a Nobleman
hauing cōmitted an hainous offence,
as murther or treasō, is iudged by
his peeres & equals:Smith. li. 2. de Republic. Anglic. cap. 27. that is, The yeomā
                        rie
doth not go vpō him, but an enquest of the
L. of the Parliamēt, & they giue their voices,
not one for al, but each seuerally, as they doe
in parliamēt, beginning at the yongest L. and
for iudge, one L. sitteth, who is high steward of
England for that day. And this punishmēt
is beheading: but if an inferior Gent. offend
in this sort, then at the next sessions
he hath twelue Godfathers on his life,
and is condemned to bee hanged.
Fiftly, Noblemen and their wiues are
licensed to weare clothes of gold, but

Knights & Esquires are forbiddē them.
                  To hasten to an end, this honour
of auncestrie as it doth adorne Noblemen,
so doth it greatly disgrace them
if they liue not vertuously. For thereby
they eclipse their genealogie, and become
themselues vtterly vnknowne. In
consideration of which abuse, a notable
law was enacted among the Rhodians,
to wit, That those sonnes, which followed
not their fathers vertues, but liued wickedly,
should be disinherited, & their reuenewes
giuen to the most vertuous of that race, not
admitting any vitious heyre whatsoeuer.
               
               
                  The properties of a Gentleman.
Chap. 15.
                  THe meanes to discerne a Gentleman
bee these. First, hee must bee
affable and courteous in speech and behauiour.
Secondly, hee must haue an
aduenturous heart to fight, and that but
for verie iust quarrels. Thirdly, hee must
bee endued with mercie to forgiue the
trespasses of his friendes and seruants.
Fourthly, hee must stretch his purse to
giue liberally vnto souldiours, and vnto

them that haue neede: for a niggard is
not worthie to bee called a Gentleman.
These bee the properties of a Gentleman,
which whosoeuer lacketh, deserueth
but the title of a clowne, or of a
countrie boore. In breefe, it fareth with
Gentlemen, as it doth with wine: which
ought to haue foure good qualities,
namely, it must not taste of the Caske:
next, it must sauour of a good soyle.
Thirdly, it must haue a good colour.
Last of all, it must sauour of the goodnes
of the grape, and not bee sophistically
mingled with water and such like.
               
               
                  That Gentlemen must not greatly respect
what the common people speake of
them. Chap. 16.
                  THe common people groūd their actions
vpō fallible expectations: they
are stout when perils bee farre off, and
very irresolute when they approach.
Who therefore is so brainesicke, as to
beleeue their assertions? What else is
glorie, then a windie gale, neuer comming

from the heart, but onely from the
lungs?Boetius li. 3. de Cō
                        sol. Philo. pros. 6. 
                     They that be praysed vnworthily,
ought to bee ashamed of their praise. Admit
they bee iustly praised, what thing
more hath it augmented to the conscience
of a wise man, that measureth not
his good, by the rumour of the common
people, but by the trueth of the conscience?
For which cause the Romanes
built two temples ioyning together; the
one being dedicated to vertue, & the other
to honour: but yet in such sort, that
no man could enter into that of honour,
except first hee passed through the temple
of vertue.Ari. li. 4. Ethicor. 
                     Honor (as the Philosopher
sayth) is a reuerence giuen to another, for a
testimonie of his vertue. Insomuch as honor
is not attributed to vertue by dignitie,
but rather it is attributed to dignity,
by vertue of them that vse the dignitie.
                  Howbeit notwithstanding,Persius satyr. 1. 
                     I haue not
such horny heart-strings, that I would not at
al haue mē to be praysed; but my meaning is,
that Gentlemen should obserue a meane and
a limitation in their common applauses, and
fine soothings. ForCicero. li. 1. Offici. 
                     to bee altogether carelesse
(as Stoykes & Cynicks would haue
euerie one to be) what men think of thē, is

not onely a marke of arrogancy, but also a token
of a loose life. Wherefore gentlemen
must endeuour by al meanes, & without
vain-glory, to keep a good name, especially
among their neighbors, & to beare
themselues such men indeede, as they
would haue al men account thē. Wherto
accordeth that saying of the Poet:
Thou shalt liue well,
                     Horat. li. 1. Episto. 17. 
                     if thou takest care to
be such a one, as thou hearest how the people
testifie of thee abroad.
                  
               
               
                  Of Knights of honour. Chap. 17.
                  THose I call knights of honour, who,
here in England, are named Knights
of the Garter, and in France, Knights of
the order of saint Michael. The original
of the honorable order of the Garter,
was first inuented after this maner. Whē
K. Edward the third had, by the means
of Edward the blacke Prince his sonne,
taken captiues King Iohn of France, and
King Dauid of Scotland, and had put
them both in ward at London, and also
had expelled King Henrie the bastard
of Spaine, restoring the Kingdome
to Peter the lawfull King, then

he, to honor and grace his victories, deuised
an honourable fellowship, and
made choyse of the most famous persons
for vertue, and honoured them with this
order, giuing thē a garter adorned with
gold and pretious stones, together with
a buckle of gold, to weare onely on the
left legge.Smith. li. 1. de Republic. 
                     Of which order hee and his
successors, Kings and Queenes of England
should be soueraigne, and the rest, by certaine
lawes among themselues,
                     Anglic. cap. 18. 
                     should
bee taken as brethren and fellowes in
that order, to the number of sixe and twentie.
And this breefely touching the
inuention and authour of the honourable
order of Knights here in England.
Now I will addresse my pen to write of
the honourable order in France.
                  King Lewes the eleuenth of France,
after he had made peace with his peeres,
whom in the beginning of his raigne, he
had excluded from his presence, inuented
at Amboise, in the yeere of our Lord
1469. a societie of honour, consisting of
sixe and thirtie Noblemen, and named
Saint Michael Patron of them (euen as
the English knights had deuoted themselues
to the tuition of Saint George)

giuing ot each of them a golden chaine,
of the value of two hundred pound,
which they were bound to weare daily,
& not to bestow, sell, or gage the same as
long as they liued; & if any one of them
chanced to die, forthwith there was an
election to dubbe another in his roome,
not by voyces, but by litle scrowles turned
together in the forme of balles, the
which they did cast into a bason, and the
Lord Chauncelour was to reckon them.
Then he, that had most balles on his side
was admitted to the societie, the King
speaking these words: The honourable societie
do accept of thee as their brother, and
in regard of their good wil to thee-wards, do
bestow this golden chaine on thee: God grāt
thou maist long weare it. When the King
had spoken these words, hee gaue him a
kisse on the right cheek. This is the custome
of dubbing kinghts of the order
of Saint Michael.
                  Also, there be other orders of knights
in Christendome, as, the kinghts of the
golden Fleece, knights, of the Bathe,
knights of the patent deuised by ye
                      Pope,
and knights of the Rhodes. But because
the rehearfall of them are not much appertaining

to our purpose, I cease to
treate further of them.

                     HE that first inuented a citie, was the
cause of much good. The which praise
some attribute vnto eloquent men.
Some to Saturne. And others to Orpheus
and Amphion. For in the beginning
of the world, people liued barbarously
like vnto bruit beasts: and the nature of
man was such, that they not hauing eyther
the law naturall or ciuill prescribed,
rogued vp and downe dispersed in the
world, & possessed nothing, except that,
which by force they tooke away from others,Cicero in Oratio. pro Sesti. & Plato li. 6. de legib.
                     til there arose some notable men both
in wisedome and valour, who knowing, howe
it was to instruct man, assembled all of them
into one place, ordamed a Citie, and enuironed
them round about with walles.
                  
                  Further, Citizens in generall are they
that liue vnder the same lawes and soueraigne
magistrates. But Citizens particularly
are they, that are free-men, & do
dwel in Cities and boroughs, or corporated
townes, Generally, in the shire

they be of no account, saue onely in the
Parliament to make lawes.Smith. de Repub Anglic. The auncient
Cities appoynted foure, and each
borough two, (whome we call Burgesses
of the Parliament) to haue voyces in it,
and to giue their consent and dissent in
the name of the Citie or borough, for
which they be appoynted.

seldome it is seene, that the homeborne
Citizens, and the outlandish doe agree
together. In the yere of our Lord 1382.

excluded from bearing offices in the
Common-wealthL. in Ecclesiis. 11 de Epis. & clericis C. statuerunt. 
                     Arcadius and Honorus
Empercurs of Rome decreed, that no man
out of the parish, where a benefice fel voyde,
should be admitted minister. Likewise,
Cap. bonae. 4. §. intelleximus, de postulation. praelat.
                     Pope Innocent the third was woont to say,
that hee could not with a safe conscience
preferre any strangers to bee officers in the
kingdome of Hungarie. King Charles the
seuenth of France in the yeere of our
Lord 1431. proclaimed, that no alien or
stranger should be presented to any ecclesiasticall
liuing liuing in his realme.
                  
                     
For which respects, Princes must haue
great regard touching the admission of
strangers, and especially to their number.
For if they exceede the natiue inhabitanes
in number and strength, then
through confidence in their own might,
they will presently inuade and ouerthrow
their too too kind fosterers.
               
               
                  Of Marchants.
Chap. 20.
                  FOrasmuch as there bee three sorts of
Citizens: the first of Gentlemen,
who are wont now and then for pleasure
to dwell in Cities: the second, of
Marchants: and the third of manuaries
and Artificers: it is expedient, that I
hauing alreadie declared the properties
of Gentlemen, should now conse quently
discourse some what of Marchants: and
then of Artificers. By Marchants necessaries
are transported frō strange countries,
and from hence other superfluous
things are conueyed to other places,
where they traffick so commodiously,
that the whole Commonwealth is bettered
by them. Euerie countrie hath a seuerall

grace naturally giuen vnto it, as,
Moscouie is plentifull of hony, waxe,
Martin-skinnes, and good hides. The
country of Molucca yeeldes cloues, sinnamon,
and pepper. In the East Indiaes
grow the best oliues. Damascus aboundeth
with prunes, reysins, pomegranates,
and quinces. From Fraunce we
fetch our wines. From Francoford wee
haue bookes brought vnto vs. So that
whosoeuer considereth the generall cō
                     mon-wealth
of all the world, hee shall
perceiue, that it cannot continue long in
perfection, without traffique and diuersities.

there is most vse of bodily strength: and
those most vile, wherein vertue is least
required. And again, the gaines of tolegatherers
and vsurers are odious: and so
are the trades of Butchers, Cooks, Fishmongers,
and Huxters. Pedlers likewise
& Chaundlers are accounted base,

for that they buy of Marchants, to the
end, they may presently vtter the same
away. In vttering of which, they cog and
cousen the simple buyers: thē which nothing
is more impious or more hurtful to
the conscience. These kind of menSmith. 1. de Republic. Anglic.

no voyee in the common-wealth, and no account
is made of them, but onely to be ruled,

Chap. 22.
                  A Yeoman is hee that tilleth the
ground, getteth his liuing by selling
of corne in markets, and can dispend
yeerely fortie shillings sterling. There is
no life more pleasant then a yeomans
life: for where shall a man haue better
prouision to keep his winter with fire enough,
then in the country? and where
is there a more delightful dwelling,
                     Xenoph. in oeconomic. 
                     for goodly
waters, gentle windes and shadowes, then
in the coūtry? This life was so highly regarded
in ancient time, that euen Emperors
and generals of war, haue not bin ashamed
to exercise it.Persius satyr. 1. 
                     Herehence descended

Remus, and Q. Cincinnatus, who, as he was
earing his foure acres of land, was by a purseuant
called to the City of Rome, & created
Dictator. Dioclesiā left his Empire at Salona,
and became a yeoman. Let a man
repaire at any time to a yeomans house,
andHoratius Epod. 2. & Cicer. desenect. 
                     there he shal find all manner of victuals,
                     meath, and all of his owne, without buying
or laying money out of his purse.
                  
                  But now a dayes yeomanrie is decayed,
hospitalitie gone to wracke, and husbandrie
almost quite fallen. The reason
is, because Landlords, not contented
with such reuenewes, as their predecessours
receiued, nor yet satisfied, that
they liue like swinish Epicures, quietly
at their ease, doing no good to the Commonwealth,Morus lib. 1. Vtopi.
 doe leaue no ground for
tillage, but doe enclose for pasture many
thousand acres of ground within one
hedge, the husbandmē are thrust out of
their own, or else by deceit, constrained
to sell all that they haue. And so either
by hook or by crook, they must needes
depart away poore seely soules, men,
women, & children. And not this extremity
onely do our wicked Ahabs shew,
but also with the losse of Naboths life

do they glut their ouergreedy minds.
This is the cause, why corne in England
is become dearer, then it was woont to
bee; and yet notwithstanding all this,
sheep & wool are nothing better cheap,
but rather their price are much enhaunsed.
Thus do our remorcelesse Puttocks
lie lurking for the poore commons, to
spoile them of their tenemēts,Iob 20. 
                     but they
shall not long enioy them. And why? because
they are oppressours of the poore, and not
helpers, their bellies are neuer filled, therefore
shall they soone perish in their couetousnesse.

                  Of Counsell. Chap. 23.
                  COunsell is a sentence, which particularly
is giuen by euery man for
that purpose assembled. There be
fiue rules to be noted in counsell.
The first, to counsell wel, wherein is implied,
that whatsoeuer is proposed,
should be honest, lawful, and profitable.
The second, counsell must not be rash
and headlong, but mature, deliberated,

and ripe, like vnto the barke of an old
tree. Thirdly, to proceed according to
examples touching things past, as, what
shal chaūce to the Israelites, because they
haue worshipped the goldē calf. Fourthly,
to giue counsel cōcerning the present
time, & of those things, which are cōprehended
in the sences. So Christ said vnto
the disciples of Iohn:Mat. 11 
                     Go, and shew Iohn
what things yee heare & see. The blind receiue
their sight, & the halt do walke: the lepers
are clensed, & the deafe heare: the dead
are raised vp, & the poore receyue the Gospel.
Fiftly, to foresee things to come, & to
forewarne men of them; as,Mat. 22 
                     he, that shall
offend, shall be bound hand and foote, and
cast into vtter darkenesse, where shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.
                  
               
               
                  Of Counsellours. Chap. 24.
                  SEuen things are required in a counsellour;
First, the feare of God, for he is
the only authour of al good counsels. Secondly,
experience in matters of policy.
Thirdly, learning & knowledge in the
lawves. ForCassiod. lib. 8 Epistol. 18 
                     hardly will they bee infected
with 
                           •••

                           •
                        es, whome learning hath
purged. Fourthly, mildnesse. Fiftly, a coū
                     sellour

must be naturally borne within
that state, where he gouerneth. Sixtly, he
must be secrete, lest he worke to himselfe
the occasion of his owne death; as the bishop
of Setto did: who because he reuealed
to the French king, that Cesar Borgias
his master brought with him a Bull
authentike & ratified from the Pope his
father, for a diuorcement to the French
king, which hee dissembled, was by the
said Duke eftsoone poisoned. Seuenthly,
a counsellour (if it be possible) ought
to be of noble parētage, forAristot. li. 3. Polit. ca. 8. 
                     they which
haue more nobility, haue more right in a cō
                        mōwealth,
then the ignoble. And euery one
esteemeth nobility in his countrey, as a
thing very honourable, seeing it is likely,
that the best parents should beget the
best children: and nobility is the vertue
of the stock and race.
               
               
                  Of Parliaments. Chap. 25.
                  PArliaments are right necessary in a
commonwealth, & without them the
whole estate is mortified and sencelesse.
For euen as a man cannot liue without a
soule: so a commonwealth cannot liue

without Parliaments. By experience it
is found out, that they haue saued commonwealths
frō ruine & decay. Greece
had neuer so long flourished, if the great
counsell of the Amphictions, first instituted
by Amphiction the sonne of Deucalion,
had not beene holden twise a
yeere, in spring time and in Autumne
at Delphos in the temple of Apollo,
which was seated in the heart of all
Greece. The counsel of Nicene hindred
the proceedings of the Arrians, and caused
the true religion to be planted. The
Parliamēts of Germany, where the Emperour
and the seuen Electours meete,
haue preserued the state thereof from
the intrusions of the Turkes. So likewise
the Aggregation of the Genowayes,
the Iourney or Diet of the Switzers, the
great councell of the Vene
                        •
                     ian Gentlemen,
the Diuan of the Turks, the assembly
of the states of Polonia, the 7. councels
of Spaine, to wit, the councell of
Spaine, of the low Countries, of the Inquisition,
of the Indians, of Italy, of the
order of saint Iohn, & of warre: the meeting
of the states of Fraunce, and the parliament
of England consisting of the

Prince, Baronrie, and commonalty haue
maintained their commonwealths more
securely aswell from hostile as from domesticall
enemies.
                  To hold a Parliament, is, when the
Prince communicateth his affaires of
importance with his subiects, demaundeth
subsidies of them, taketh their aduice,
heareth their molestations, & prouideth
for them reasonably.Smith. lib. 2. de Republ. Anglic. cap. 2. 
                     The Iudges
in our Parliament of Englād are the Prince,
the Lords spirituall and temporall, and the
commons represented by the Knights and
Burgesses of euery shire and Borough towne.
The officers are the speakers, the clarks,
and the committies. The authour of this
Parliament was king Henry the third,
induced thereunto (as I suppose) by his
Barons, who rebelling against him,
made England tributary to Pādolph the
legat in the Popes name. And doubtlesse
the calling and holding of it is the
chiefest meanes of all our welfares. For
in times past it appeased ciuill warres, it
deliuered the whole realme from the incursions
of forraine enemies, and maintained
continuall warres abroad with the
Scots and Frenchmen. In a word, this

holding of parliament is the anchor of
our whole comonwealth, wherby it is set
sure and stayed, as a ship in the water.
               
               
                  Of Iudgements. Chap. 26.
                  IVdgemēt is that, which is decreed by
the Iudge, not altogether dissenting
frō the tenor of the law. Of iudgements
some be called ciuill, some criminall: but
because our Ciuilians haue largely treated
of them, I will proceed to another
diuision, which makes most for our politique
instruction. Iudgements againe
are either priuat or publique: Ordinary
or extraordinary: Priuat iudgemēts cō
                     cerne
testaments, successions, mariages,
contracts, wardships, gardianships, bondages,
& prescriptions. Publique iudgements
are of grieuous offences against
God and man: as, high treason, petie
treason, murthers, rapes, felonies, riot,
bribes, forgeries, and insurrections. Ordinary
iudgements are those, which are
executed by the Iudge, according to the
prescription of the law.Cuiacius in Paratit. ff. de extraord. criminib. 
                     Extraordinary
are called when the Iudge departing somewhat
frō the rigour of the law, iudgeth more
mercifully according to his owne conscience.
                  
                  
                     
The cōmon & vsuall forme of iudgement,
that is exercised here in England
is by the great assise, or by a quest of 12.
men necessarily of that shire, where the
defendāt dwelleth. These mē the sherife
warneth to appeare vpō pain of amercements.
And appearing (vnlesse exceptions
be made against thē) they besworne
to tell the truth of that issue or criminall
cause, according to their conscience and
euidence or writings authēticall laid before
them. Then these 12. men are shut
vp in some roome hard by, and kept by a
bailiffe without any kind of sustenance,
fire, or candle, vntil al of them agree vpō
one verdict about the said issue or criminall
cause. This is our common order
of iudgement. There are likewise other
formes, whereby iudgement is giuen, as
by the parliament, by combat, and such
like, which are absolute, and without appeale;
howbeit they be seldome vsed.

condemne any man vpon suspition: for
better it is to suffer the guilty to escape
vnpunished, then to condemne an innocent.
They must neither be too seuere,
nor too remisse, but they must determine
circumspectly, as the matter, and necessities
require. Howbeit, in light matters
let them be somewhat addicted to lenity,
and in waighty affaires to seuerity being

And if they would needes remit penalties,

                  Iudges may erre sixe maner of waies.
First, when they be partial towards their
friends and kinsmen. Secondly,Sotus li. 3. de iustitia & iure. 
                     when
they haue no power ouer them, whome they

iudge. Thirdly, when for hatred they
prosecute any man. Fourthly, when they
repriue men for feare to displease some
great personage. Fiftly, when being
greased in the fist with the oyle of gold,
they winke at enormities, and corruption.
Sixtly, when being vnlearned they
iudge rashly & without premeditation.

replications, that his suites shall hang
seuen yeeres; yea, and perhaps a dozen
yeeres, according to the number of those
superfluous sheetes, before they bee
brought to any perfection, & vntill the
poore client become farre behind hand.
Nowadaies the common fee of an atturney
is no lesse thē a brace of angels, notwithstanding
hee speake but once, and
that (the Lord knows) very coldly to the
right sence of the suit. And if a poore
man should proffer him lesse, he wil aunswere
him in this maner: Sir, behold my
face and complexion, and you shall find, that
it is all of gold, and not of siluer. Innumerable
are the quirkes, quiddities, and
starting holes of our English petifoggers:
for sometimes when a definitiue
sentence is pronounced, they forsooth
will inuent some apish tricke, eyther to
suspend it from execution vpon some
smal cauillation or obiection, or els they
call it into a new controuersie by a writ
of errour or by a ciuill petition; or, to cō
                     clude,
they find out some shift or drift
to reuerse and reuoke the sentence.
Thus do they play the sophisters with
their seely cliēts, or rather conies, whom

they haue catched and intrapped in their
nettes. But these disorders would bee
quickly reformed, if men will follow my
counsell, which is, To forbeare awhile
from going to law. Honest and well disposed
men might content themselues at
home, and not gadde euery foote to the
court of Common pleas, to the Chauncery,
to the Starchamber. Neighbours,
Isay, and kinsfolkes ought to regard
one another, and to end all doubts and
quarrels among themselues: I do not
meane by brutish combats and affraies,
but by mediations, atonements, and
intercessions. Man is by nature humane,
that is, gentle and curteous: and
good vsage will in time cause him to relent
from his former stubbernesse. Many
countries haue their Courts, Leetes,
or Lawdaies, where men generally do
meet together: there, me thinkes, light
controuersies and iarres might assoone
be taken vp and decided, aswell as in
farre places. If this aduice of mine were
obserued, we should haue fewer lawyers
and lesse controuersies.
               
               
                  
                  Of Magistrates. Chap. 29.
                  EVen as in the body of a liuing creature
the organe of seeing is ascribed
only to the eies, & al the other off
                        •
                     ces do
obey them as their guides: so in like maner
all offices in the commonwealth are
cōmitted vnto wise magistrates, as to the
eies of the realme, & the other members
must be directed by thē. For which consideration
I require in a magistrate learning
and vertue, without which he is not
worthy to be termed the eye of a commōwealth,
but rather a blind bayard, as
wanting both the eies of the body & the
eies of the mind. Whē as we chuse a rapier,
we chuse it not, because the hilt is
double-guilt, & the scabberd of veluet
and beset with pearles: but because the
point of it is sharp to enter well, and the
blade strong & stiffe. So hapneth it in the
electiō of magistrates, namely, that they
be learned & vertuous, rather then hādsomely
and beautifully proportioned in
body. Strength of body is required in a
laborer; but policy in a magistrate. This
is profitable to a twofold scope, that the
wise & feeble may commaund, and the

strong obey. Next, magistrates must cō
                     sider,
why the sword of iustice both by
the law of God and man is put into their
hands; that is to say, they are the ministers
of God and the executioners of the
law, to take vengeance on the wicked, &
not to let offenders in any case wilfully
to perseuer in their errours. In the beginning,
euery malady is easy to be cured:
but if it be let alone for a while, it
groweth past remedy. Magistrates therfore
must in time prouide salues to redresse
abuses: otherwise they incurre the
anger of God. They must haue lions
harts, that they shrink not in iust causes.
They must bee constant, lest by their
friends intercessions they waxe partiall.
Lastly, they must be both graue & ciuill:
graue in commaunding, & ciuill in conuersation.
               
               
                  Of the great cares and troubles of
Magistrates. Chap. 30.
                  O How greatly are mē deceyued, that
perswade thēselues, that magistrates
do lead the ioyfullest liues. Litle know
they, how vnquiet bee their thoughts.
They thinke not of their lōg watchings,

and that their nature is weakened, and
through such distemperatures their bodies
languish. No man liueth exempt
from some sorrow or other. Although
ignorant men and fresh-water souldiers,
to whome warre is pleasant, account it
felicity to commaund: yet if they compare
in an euen balance the waight of
such troubles, as daily happē in their magistracies,
vnto the weakenesse of pleasure
which proceedeth by cōmaunding,
they shal perceiue, that far greater is the
toyle of the one, then the toy of the other.
How often are they cumbred with
cōplaints? How long in perusing of informations?
So that in fine their offices
will not permit them any contentation.

their Prince, should liue in too great discomfort
and despayre, if great men and magistrates
had nothing in this world but pleasure,
and they on the contrary side but toyles
and calamities. But God hath otherwise
disposed of the case. For they languish
in mind: whereas poore men do but
weary their bodies, which easily might

be recouered againe. The consuming of
the vitall spirites is in a maner irrecuperable;
insomuch as the cares of the
one exceed farre the labour of the other.
               
               
                  Whether magistrates may receyue
presents sent vnto them?

gaine of oppression, and shaking
their hands from taking of giftes, shall
dwell on high, their defence shall be the
munitions of rockes, and they shall see
GOD in his glory. ForExo. 23 Deut. 16 & Eccl. 20. giftes do
blind the eies, and peruert the words of
the righteous. No magistrates therfore
must presume to take gifts,Lib. 6. Decretal. tit. 3. ca. 11. 
                     vnlesse they
be to be eaten or drunke vp within three

may corrupt their authority, and so
speed of their owne pleas and pursuites.
Let them rather imitate Cicero,Cic. lib. 5. ad Atticum, Epist. 10. & 16. 
                     who
as long as he was Pretour of Cilicia, would
neyther himselfe receyue, nor permit any
of his company to take presentes, no, not
that beneuolence, which by the law Iulia

was due vnto him.

                  Of the Education of Gentlemen.
Chap. 32.
                  
                     Plato li. 6. de legib. 
                     MAn is by nature a gentle creature:
who with his happy nature getting
good education, becommeth diuinely disposed:
but if hee lacke this education, he waxeth
the most wicked of all creatures, that
are borne vpon the earth. Many drops of
water (as wee see) falling vpon the
hard marble stone do pierce and make it
hollow. And the ground being well tilled
and manured beareth goodly corne.
So in like maner a man well brought vp
acknowledgeth his duty towards his
Maker, & knoweth how to conquer his

owne affections. Whereas contrariwise
Gentlemen being euill nurtured, cā neuer
vnderstand how farre the power and
abilitie extendeth, that God hath giuen
them. For they neuer read it themselues,
neither are they taught by them that
know it; Cōminae. lib. 5. 
                     Nay, few that vnderstand it, are
admitted to their presence: and if one bee,
yet dare he not instruct them in it, for feare
of displeasure; or if happily at any time hee
put them in minde thereof, no man will abide
him, or at least he shall be accounted but
a foole; peraduenture also it may be taken
in il part, and so turne to his harme.
Howbeit, the vertuous must not abstain
from their godly admonitions, seeing
that Cicero li. 3. de Diuinati. 
                     they cannot benefite the commonwealth
more, then when they teach and instruct
young mē, especially in those times,
wherein they are so corrupted, that
they must needes by all well disposed
persons, bee refrained and restrained of
libertie. One saith, I am an heire, borne
to a thousand pound land. Another
sayth;Persius satyr. 3. 
                     I haue a fat farme, and a house well
furnished. What cause haue I to feare? Let
the world chance as it will. Another againe
craketh and breaketh his lungs

wel-nigh with windie bragges, because
he is a Knights eldest sonne,Persius ibid. 
                     fetching his
pedegree by a thousand lines and branches,
from some worthie Lord, and because some
neere kinsman of his is made Censour, Maior,
Iustice of peace, or Lieutenant of the
Shire,Persius ibid. 
                     to whom he may say, Good morrow,
Cousin.
                  
                  Infinite are the fooleries of youth,
which by due correction, and diligent
exhortation must bee rooted out. I will
therefore comprehend their education
vnder foure lessons.
                  The first is instruction, vnder which
are cōtained foure rules. The 1. wherof
is, to teach children the feare and loue
of GOD, and to shew them, that they
must not glorie too much in worldly
goods. Secondly, to teach them, how
to bridle their tongues, to bee modest,
and to embrace vertue: for education
properly, is nothing else but a bringing
vp of youth in vertue. Thirdly, to
shew them the facultie of exercise,
which serueth to the maintenance of health
and strength,
                     Arist. lib. 8. Politicor. cap. 3 & 4. 
                     by ordering the body with
light and gentle exercises. Fourthly, familiarly
to declare vnto them examples,

as well of good men, as of wicked
men, that thereby they may learne how
the good are rewarded, and the wicked
punished.
                  The second lesson appertaining
to the instruction of youth, is prayse,
that is, to commende them, when
they doe well, that thereby they may
bee incouraged the better to goe forwardes.
For youth is like vnto moyst
and soft clay, and for that respect,
is to bee egged on to glorie in well doing.
                  The third is counsell, which must
bee giuen by their sage Vncles, or
auncient men, concerning their dutie
towards their parents, elders, and teachers.
                  The fourth poynt of instruction is
threatning and correction, which is
to bee vsed, when they offend and
neglect to follow the aduice of their
teachers, and when they beginne to
bee headie, stubborne, and selfe-willed.
This the diuine Philosopher verie
well noted, saying: thatPlato Dialog. 7 de legib. 
                     a boy,
                     not as yet hauing fully and absolutely giuen
himselfe to vertue, is a deceitfull,

cruell and a most proud beast. Wherefore
he must be bound with a schoolemaster
as it were with a strong bridle.
               
               
                  The causes why so fewe Gentlemen no we
adaies be vertuously disposed.
Chap. 33.
                  I Find that there bee foure causes, why
so few Gentlemen in this age, attaine
to the knowledge of vertue. The first is,
the corruption of the whole world: for
now areDan. 9. 
                     the abominations of desolation.
                     These be dayes of vengeance to fulfil althings
that are written.
                     Mat. 24 The minds of men are so
peruerse and barren,Luk. 21. that they will not
receiue the seed of true wisedome.Mar. 13 Their
cogitations are too much bent to the
pompes and follies of this transitorie
world. The second cause proceedeth of
counterfeit and vnsufficient teachers,
whose onely occupation is couertly to
woo yong scholers, that come guidelesse
and headlesse into the Vniuersitie: and

                        〈◊〉
                      gotten them into their nets, they
afterward let them runne at randon. But

                      iudgement, such youths as suffer

                        〈◊〉
                      to be snatched vp for haukes

meate in this or the like maner, do therin
imitate sicke folkes, who refusing the
good Phisician, by some braine-sicke
mans counsell, doe commit themselues
to the tuition of such a one, as by ignorance
killeth them. The third cause is
the niggardize of parents, who continually
labour to gather the drossie and vnconstant
pelfe of this world, and in the
meane time make no reckoning of their
children, but permitte them to grow old
in follie, which destroyeth them both bodie
and soule. The fourth and last cause,
is the indulgence and fond loue of the
parents, who take their sonnes from the
Vniuersitie, as fruite from a tree, before
it is ripe, or rather as pullets without feathers,
to place them at the Innes of
Court, where, as I haue written in my
Commentarie vpon Persius,In sin. satyr. 1. 
                     they gad
to Stage-playes, & are seduced by flattering
coni-catchers.
                  
               
               
                  
                  Whether youths ought to be
corrected?
Chap. 34.
                  A Good huswife knoweth how hard a
thing it is, to keepe flesh sweete and
sauorie, vnlesse it bee first poudred and
put in brine. So likewise, it is impossible
for parents to reape any ioye of their
sonnes, except they bee first corrected.
Roses must needes wither, when they be
ouergrowne with briers and thornes:
and children that are assailed and ouertaken
by whole legions of affections,
must at last fall, if they be not accordingly
succoured.Prou. 13. * Hee that spareth the rod,
spilleth the child. And euen as Phisicions

of the soule. Whereunto agreeth the
prouerbe: Many times the rodde is better
for children then bread. This Xenophon
considered, when hee brought in his
youthXenoph.

                      Our Ciuilias also thought it expedient,Lib. 9. & 19. ff. tit. 2.
that boyes should bee punished. And
doe we not our selues see by daily experience,
that those parents, who dandle
and cocker vp their sonnes, and winke
at their follies, bee most commonly agrieued
and brought to heauinesse?Eccle. 30 
                     An
vntamed horse will be stubburne, and a
wanton child will be wilfull. In like sort,
suffer thy son to haue his will for a time,
and he will become (do what thou canst)
rude, inflexible, and wantonly disposed
to all maner of vices. Waxe, as long as
it is soft and clammie, receiueth any impression
or seale, but being hardened, it
receiueth none. So likewise, chastise thy
child, and imprint discipline in his heart,
while hee is young and towardly, and
thou shalt bow him to what instruction
thou wilt, but let him haue his
owne scope, andSeneca in Thyest. 
                     hee will rather breake
then bow.
                  
                  
                     Obiection.
                     Diuers youthes will performe more
at a becke, then they would otherwise

at a blow. Also, it is slauish, as said Socrates,
to be beaten: therfore youths ought
not to bee corrected.
                  
                  
                     Answere.
                     My meaning is not, that all youths
should be corrected; for many there be,
that naturally are inclined to liue vertuously,
and such I would haue rather
incouraged by praises, then discouraged
by threatnings. My question onely includeth
sturdie and stubborne youthes,
who being let alone, will become worse.
And wheras you say with Socrates, that
it is slauish to be beaten: I answere with
the same Socrates, that it is slauish to deserue
beating. If Socrates his free nature
be not found, surely Socrates his slauish
nature must be beaten, and that euen by
Socrates his owne confession.
                  
               
               
                  Of Schoolemasters and their
duties. Chap. 35.
                  PRinces that in the frontiers of their
enemies, keepe fortes and garrisons,
doe choose wise and expert Captaines
to ouersee them; otherwise it were better

to batter downe the Forts, and to remoue
the garrisons, then it should come
into the hands of the enemies. So in like
maner parents, which tender the training
vp of their childrē, ought to choose
out a good schoole-master, that will not
onely instruct them in learning, but also
informe them in the precepts of good
maners. Else, they imitate horsecoursers,
whose onely delight is, to pamper and
fatne their horses, and not to manage
them as they should: so that when such
Iades come to trauell, they praunse gallantly
at the first, but in the midst of
their trauelling, their grease melting away,
they founder and fall downe in the
mire. Euen so young men hauing gotten
but a taste of learning, become so headie
with a fond fantasie of that little which
they haue, that they tire and lie downe
in the midst of their bookish pride.
The consideration whereof, hath prouoked
mee principally to require in a
schoole-master, morall and politique
Philosophie, thereby to instruct his
schollers in awe, obedience, and loue.
For would it not grieue the Prince to
see his subiects rebellious? the Father to

finde his sonnes disobedient to his will▪
Withall, a schoolemaster must be endued
with these nine qualities. First, hee
must be well skilled in Grammar, Rhetoricke,
and Poetrie. Secondly, hee
ought to haue discretion to iudge of his
scholers nature and disposition. Thirdly,
courage to heartne and egge forward
a toward youth. Fourthly, perseuerance
not to giue ouer his schoole vpon
enuie or grudge of some particular
person. Fiftly, hee must haue affabilitie
and courtesie, least his schollers as apes
taking example by his froward lookes,
become rough and disobedient. Sixtly,
hee must vse mediocritie in correcting,
that is, hee must correct them according
to the qualitie of their faults, and while
hee is so occupied, hee must not reuile
or nickname them. Seuenthly, hee
must bee endued with some maiestie of
countenance, and strength of bodie, otherwise
hee will bee contemned, and
made a iesting-stocke. Eightly, with continence,
to abstaine from lecherie and
excesse in drinking, apparrell, and such
like. Ninthly, a schoole-master must not
impose more labours on his scholers,

then they can well sustaine, least thereby
hee cloying them with too much at
once, doe make them dull, and so daunt
them from their bookes. For it is loue
that maketh vs to take delight, and to
profite in our studies. And this is the
cause, why plants moderately watered
doe grow, but being too much moystened,
they are choaked and drowned.
               
               
                  That schoole-masters should haue
large stipendes.
Chap. 36.
                  IN vaine doe I treate of necessarie
schoole-masters, vnlesse parents bee
gratefull vnto them:Cassiod. lib. 9. Epist. 21. 
                     Stipends doe nourish
Arts. Wherefore teachers are to bee
stirred vp to benefite the Common-wealth,
through the augmēting of their
allowances.L. medicos. §. C. de profeso soribus & medicis. 
                     Constantine the Emperour
enacted, that schoole-masters should haue
large salaries payed them: whereby hee
got him an immortall name. It was also

decreed by the councell of Laterane,
thatIn cap. de magi. li. 5. tit. 5 
                     prebends should be giuen to schoole-masters.
                     Concil. Trident. sessio. 5. dereform. c. 1 & sessio. 23. de reforma. c. 18.
                     The like was done by the councell
of Trident. It is great pitie that euery seuerall
parish in this realme of England,
hath not a good schoole-master constituted
in it, for the training vp of
youth, and an indifferent liuing out of
the same parish, for his trauell. For lacke
whereof, some carefull parents now-a-dayes,
are constrained to send their children
a hundred miles off, either to Eaten
colledge, Westminster, Winchester,
or other like places, where they pay
much for their diet and tuition, and peraduenture
so much, as being spared,
might encourage them to kee
                        ••
                      them
the longer at the Vniuersitie. But perhaps
you will aske mee, at what time I
would haue schoolemasters receiue their
exhibition? To which I answere: either
the one halfe aforehand, and the other
halfe at the halfe yeeres end, or else
quarterly, or ratherBaldus ad leg. 1. de suffrag. 
                     The one halfe at the
halfe yeeres end, and the remnant at the
tweluemonths end. This is my foundation,
which being wel laid, I doubt not but to
see youths more ciuill, & better lettered.
               
               
                  
                  Whether it bee better for parents to keepe
their sonnes at home with a priuate
schoole-master, or to send them
abroad to the publike
schoole.
Chap. 37.
                  IN my iudgement this question is
worth the deciding, to wit, whether
Gentlemen should maintaine their children
at the free-schoole, or rather at
their houses, where they themselues
may ouersee their towardnesse? They
that approoue this priuate teaching, alleadge
three speciall reasons. First, children
are by nature weake, and quickly
surprized with infectious diseases,
therefore they had rather haue them in
sight, where they may be tendred and
regarded; which is likewise confirmed
by that common saying: namely, The
masters eie fatneth his horse. Secondly, they
will learne modestie and ciuilitie at
home, whereas if they were abroad, they
would become rude, impudent, aud vicious.
Thirdly, they being in number

few, will be more diligently taught and
informed; which in a maner is impossible
in a common schoole, by reason of
the confusion of so many scholers.
Howbeit notwithstanding these reasons,
publike teaching seemeth to bee
of most force, and that for foure causes.
First, becauseAri. li. 8 Politic. cap. 1. Xenoph. li. 1. Paed. & Quintiliā. li. 
                     the wisest sort of men
haue preferred the publike instruction before
the priuate. Secondly, a childe will
get wit and experience by conuersing
with many. Thirdly, when hee misseth
in his lesson, hee may in the common
schoole speedily recouer that which is
lost,2. cap. 1. by conferring with his mates.
Fourthly, if hee bee by nature melancholike,
crabbed, or wicked, hee will
in a free-schoole bee reformed, partly
for shame to bee beaten in the
sight of many, and partly for feare,
in seeing offenders punished. These
bee all the reasons which I can coniecture
on the behalfe of the publike scholemaster.
                  To knit vp this question of priuate
and publike teaching, this is my resolution,
that children from the first time
they bee put to schoole, vntill they bee

at least thirteene yeres of age, should be
cloystered at home with a priuate teacher,
and then placed in the common
schoole for two or three yeeres space,
till they bee readie and fit for the Vniuersitie.
               
               
                  Of Tutours in the Vniuersitie. How
to discerne a good Tutour.
Chap. 38.
                  PArents in any case must not send
their sonnes to the Vniuersitie, before
they bee at least foureteene yeeres
of age: whither being once come, they
must curiouslie hearken (but not of
vnlearned persons and boyes, for they
measure mens sufficiencie by their
owne fancie) after a good Tutour,
that will not onelie furnish them
with necessaries, but also reade himselfe
vnto them: otherwise, the parents
may one day repent them 
                        •
                     f
their sonnes education. For many
Tutours now-a-dayes will not sticke to
receiue a marke or twentie shillings a
quarter, for each of their scholers tuition,

and yet not vouchsafe once to reade
themselues vnto them, but to substitute
young Bachelers of Art, who, albeit
some of them can reade tolerably, yet
notwithstanding they cannot correct
and prouoke the sluggish, as wanting
both discretion to iudge, & seueritie to
compell. It is therefore very prudently
decreed, although not alwaies executed,
by the Vniuersitie, that none should be
a Tutour, vnder a Master of Arts, & yet
not euery Master, but such a one, that for
his integritie of life, and sufficiencie of
learning, is admitted by the Vicechancelour,
the Head of the house, whereof
the Tutour & the scholers are, & by the
consent of two Doctours, or two Bachelers
of diuinitie, to be a Tutour.
                  The qualities of a good Tutour bee
tenne: the first is, that hee bee godly
and vertuously giuen. The second,
that he be well seene in Humanitie and
Philosophie. The third, it is requisite
that he be no lesse then seuen & twentie
yeeres of age, and no more then fortie,
because the one lacks audacitie and
grauitie to commaund, and the other
most commōly is negligent. The fourth,

a Tutour must be sober aswell in words
as in deeds. The fift, he must not (as many
nowadaies do) suffer his pupilles to
be idle, and to haue their owne willes.
The sixt, he must chastise them seuerely,
if they play at dice, sweare, fight, or
such like. The seuenth, he must (if hee
may possibly) haue them in his sight and
chamber. The eight thing required in a
Tutour is, that he be famous in the Vniuersity
for his learning, and also well
friended, that thereby he may both supply
his scholers wantes, and looke that
they be not iniuried. The ninth duty of
a Tutour is, that hee haue an especiall
care and respect to his scholers battles,
lest that by permitting them to spend
what they please, he incurre the displeasure
of the parents, and so hazard his credit.
The tenth and last duty of a Tutour
is, that he keepe his scholers in awe and
obedience; and not too familiarly insinuate
himselfe vnto them, seing that according
to the old adage, too much familiarity
breeds contempt. And (in conclusion)
whosoeuer giueth his scholers but
an inch, may be assured, that they will
(do what he can) take a whole ell.

their speech, in processe of time inuēted
this Art. Although before Adams fall
from Paradise, learning was natural, yet
neuerthelesse no man can now of himselfe
come to the knowledge of it, without
practize, exercise, and other mens
inuention. Charondas the lawgiuer extolled
Grammar aboue all other Artes:
and that iustly, forDiodor. Sicul. lib. 12. ca. 4 
                     by meanes of it the
chiefest things in the world are written; as
lawes, constitutions, willes, and testaments,
and such like, as concerne mans life.
Whereby we see thatArist. lib. 8. Polit. ca. 3. 
                     Grammar is many
wayes profitable to mans life.
                  
                  But alas, the vse thereof is in these
dayes not perfectly knowen. Albeit we
haue many that profes it, yet for al that,

few there be that vnderstand it aright.
The reason is, because nowadayes they
thinke, that whosoeuer can prattle in
Latine, make verses, or patch a declamation,
is a substanciall Grammarian
(or, as they terme him, an Humanitian)
which, God wot, they know not what it
meanes. For aQuintil. lib. 1. Institut. Oratori. 
                     Grāmarian is he, that can
speake the vsuall tongues elegantly, and expoūd
the mysteries of Poets with their tropes
and figures, and that hath some smack in
Philosophy, because sundry places in
Poets are quoted out of the quintessēce
of the Mathematikes.

                  LIke as they, that digge for metals,
do strictly and diligently search the
veines of the earth, and by earnest noting
the nature thereof, attaine at last
to the perfect knowledge of the mine:
so they, that will enioy learning, aswell
for the common good, as for their owne
profit, must narrowly study this Art of
Logike,Iohan. Grāmatic. lib. 1. Prior. Analyt. 
                     which is conuersant with vs in our
daily conferences. And no doubt but

hauing studied it well, they shall find it
expedient three maner of wayes.Arist. li. 1. Topic. cap. 2.

                     whē
thou shalt enter farther into it, an insatiable
desire of learning it, foorthwith will cause
thee to embrace it. For without doubtIamblichus Epistol. ad Dexippum. 
                     God
himselfe reuealed the knowledge of Logike
vnto vs. And if we neglect this worthy
and magnificent gift of his, he will also
for our ingratitude withdraw not onely
this Art, but all other Artes whatsoeuer
from vs: though wee haue both wit and
learning together, yet shall they litle auayle
without Logicke. What maketh
youths to speake so boldly & roundly?
Logike. What maketh atturneyes to go
so fast away with their words and pursuites?
Logick. In al Artes therefore Logick
is praise worthy. Logick is defined
to be an Art, that knitteth well together
all discourses formed by speeches, and
all positions in them, according as they

depend one vpon another, & are grounded
vpon good reason. And euē as gold
by seuen fires is tried and purified: so in
like manerL. fin. §. mixta muner. ff. de muneribus & honorib. 
                     the truth in despight of errours
is by logicall disputations found out, and restored
to her former liberty. ForZabarella li. 1. de natura logic. cap. 13. 
                     the end
of Logick is to discerne in philosophy the
truth from the false; as if a man should say,
knowledge is the end of it. The duties of
it are foure; namely, to define, to deuide,
to compose true arguments, and to dissolue
them that be false. The partes of
Logick are two, to wit,De quibus Aristo. in praedicamēt. 
                     The first intentions,
and

                  RHetorick is an Art, that teacheth a
man to speake finely, smoothly, and

eloquently. And whereas Logick formeth
speech as it were a bare picture,
& hauing nothing but simple draughts,
which serue to furnish it in respect of
ech part and lineament thereof:Arist. lib. 7. Rhetoric. cap. 1. & 2.

beyng the offspring of Logick shapeth
it not onely as a picture well varnished,
but also enriched and polished with glorious
fields and medowes, and such like
glozing shewes, that it may become faire
to the eye, & pleasant to the eare. Being

                     there is nothing so sacred to
perswade as it. But nowadaies it is not
much profitable, especially to preachers.
For although Rhetorical speeches do delight
their auditory; yet notwithstāding,
they make not much for y• soules health.
Aeschylus in Prometh.
                     Simple & material speeches are best among
friēds. Preachers therfore must labour to
speak & vtter that, which the hearers vnderstand,
& not go about the bush with
their filing phrases.1. Cor. 2 
                     They must not (I say)
come with excellency of wordes to shew the
testimony of God vnto the people.

                     Neyther
must their preaching consist in the enticing
speech of mans wisedome, but in the
plaine euidence of the spirit and of power.
Moses, when God commaunded him to

go downe to the Israelites, would haue
excused himselfe, saying,Exod. 4 
                     O my Lord, I
am not eloquent, neyther at any time haue
beene: but I am slow of speech and slow of
tongue. Then the Lord said vnto him, Who
hath giuen the mouth to man? or who hath
made the dumme, or the deafe, or him that
seeth, or the blind? haue not I the Lord?
Therefore go now, and I will bee with thy
mouth, and will teach thee, what thou shalt
say. Caluine that zealous Preacher had,
as many men know, an impediment in
his speach, and in his sermons neuer vsed
any painted or rhetoricall termes.
                  What shall I write of our common

andMartia. lib. 1. Epigram. 
                     with their hired tongues think it
not vnhonest to defend the guilty, and to patronize
vnlawfull pleas? Why will not
they imitate Anacharsis the Philosopher,
who when the scholers of Athens
laughed him to scorne, by reason hee
could not pronounce Greeke distinctly,
and eloquently, answered them, that
a speach was not to bee termed bad,
as long as it contayned good counsels,
and as long as honest deeds did follow

after his words? Constantine the Emperour

                  Of Poetry, and of the excellency
thereof. Chap. 42.
                  WhenExod. 1 
                     the children of Israel were enthralled
in the land of bondage: then
GOD, who is alway the helper of the
friendlesse, raised vp Moses his seruaunt,
made him ruler of his distressed people,
and deliuered them with a strong & outstretched
arme frō their miserable captiuity.
WhereuponExo. 15 
                     Moses framed a song
of thankesgiuing vnto the Lord in verse,
which I take to be the most auncient of
all. So that it is certaine, and (as they say)
able to be felt with hands, that Poetry
came first by inspiration from GOD.

LikewiseIudic. cap. 5. 
                     Deborasung a Psalme of victory
in meetre. Dauid also & the Prophets
were Poets.
                  If wee prie into the liues of the heathen,
we shall find that Poetrie was the
chiefest cause of their ciuility. Whē

                     before
they remained scattered lawlesse, and

                     exhorted them to listen their eare vnto
their wholesome counsels, and to lead their
liues well and orderly. And as these two
Poets, and Linus before them reclaimed
the wildest sort of men: so by all likelihood
mo Poets did the same in other
places.
                  Further, Poets were the first, that
obserued the secrete operations of nature,
and especially the celestial courses,
by reason of the perpetuall motion of
the heauens, searching after the first
mouer, and from thence proceeding by
degrees to consider of the substaunces
separate and abstract. They were the
first, that offred oblations, sacrifices, and
praiers. They liued chast, and by their
exceeding continence came to receyue

visions and prophesies. So likewise1. Sam. 9. 
                     Samuel
& the Prophets were named Seers.
                  
                  Now sithence Poetry is so sanctified, it
will not bee amisse, if I anatomize her
parts, and compare her with other faculties:
which done, I doubt not but she
wil deserue a more fauourable censure euen
of the Momistes themselues. The
Prince of Philosophers writeth, that
Aristot. li. 3. Rhetoric.
                     Rhetorick had her first beginning from
Poetry. The chiefe of the late Philosophers
doubted not to proue, thatZabar. lib. 2. de natur. logic. 
                     Poetry was part of Logick, because it is wholy occupied
in deliuering the vse of examples, I do
not meane that kind of example, which is vsed
in common conferences; but I meane the
maners, affections, and actions of men,
which are brought as examples eyther to be
imitated or shunned of the spectatours, or
readers. In like maner, Poetry is more
philosophicall and serious then history,
because Poetry medleth with the generall
consideration of all things: wheras
history treateth onely of the particular.
And not onely history, but also
Philosophy, Law, and Phisicke are
subiect to Poetry, for whatsoeuer nature
or policy, case or medicine they rehearse,

that may ye Poet, if he please, with
his forme or imitation make his owne.
                  But, mee thinks, I see a rout of criticall
Pharisees comming towards mee,
and discharging whole volees of cannon
shot against my breast, and exclayming
without reason, that I falsely erre,
for prouing Poetry to bee deriued from
Moses. The Gentiles (say they) were the
first founders of Poetry, and therefore it
ought to be reiected. Well do I deny
this argument, demaunding of thē, whether
philosophy be bad, because the Painims
brought the knowlege thereof to
light? whether Greeke letters be euill,
because Cadmus inuented thē? whether
the bookes of Resolution bee blameworthy,
for that R. P. a fugitiue papist
wrote thē? O mōstrous absurdity! What?
wil they with the foolish Donatists vtterly
refuse the Sacraments, because the
priests are vicious, that administer them?
Or wil they with the Anabaptists forbid
alsuites & going to law, because the lawyers,
that cōmence thē, are corrupt? Thē
farewell quietnesse, farewel money, yea,
farewell religion, & all: for each of them
was, is, & will be abused for euermore.
                  
                     
Othersome there be, that iudge poetry
vnlawfull, for that they themselues
are not capable thereof. And againe
there be some, that meane to kil the lion
with a straw, and condemne Poetry for
the fables that are contained therein.
But if I should dash these enuious Sycophāts
with a blurre of inke for euery offence,
which they commit against the
truth, they would, I feare me, become
blacker then Aethiopian Negroes.
                  As for Poetical Fabies and Parables
what els should I retort, but that, which
one of the ancient Fathers hath written
on their behalfe? to wit,Lactantius. 
                     Poets do speake
that which is most true, and by their mysticall
fables do decipher profound matters. After
which maner Dauid in his Psalmes saith,
Psa. 80
                     Thou hast brought forth a vine out of Egypt:
thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
What is vnderstood by this vine, & the
plāting thereof, but the childrē of Israel,
whom God by his Diuine prouidence
brought out of Egypt, & gaue thē inheritance
in the land of Chanaan? likewise
we read of the steward, of the prodigall
child, & such like in the new Testament.
Whē Perseus, Dedalus, & Bellerophon

are faigned to fly: what els is meant by
their flying, but their speedy iourneying?
what doth the trāsformatiō of Halcione
into a bird signifie? namely, that
shee, after the death of her husband
Ceix, mourned & sorowed like vnto that
same bird. When Lycaon is reported to
be metamorphozed into a woolfe: what
other sence is vnderstood by the wolfe,
then that this king was a tyrant & a rauenous
theefe? By the painful trauell of Vlisses
is portrayed the liuely picture of
mans miseries. Icarus had winges, and
therewith mounted vp into the aire: but
so soone as the sunne had melted his
waxen wings, he fell downe into a riuer,
and was drowned. Whereby is included
that no man must rashly reach aboue his
pitch. If men would speake & inueigh against
niggards, what better instance cā
they make, then in Danae, Tantalus,
and Midas? To blaze prodigality, and
such as were giuē to pleasures, the Poets
painted Acteon turned into a Hart, who
was so much delighted in hunting, that
in the end he was eaten vp of his dogs;
that is, he spent all his goods in feeding
of hounds. For an exāple of whoredome

they inferre Circe, who was so beautifull,
that she rauished and enchaunted all
such as beheld her. And so wee must
iudge of the rest. Iupiter betokeneth
the highest God: Phoebus the Sunne:
Mars warre: Themis law: Minerua learning:
Venus loue: Vulcan fire: Ceres
corne: Bacchus wine: Neptune the sea:
The Nymphes signifie riuers: and by
destiny is declared the ineuitable will
of God. There is no faculty of any account,
but hath hard & obscure significations;
as for example, naturall philosophy
comprehendeth the first matter and
the first mouer. Alchymy cōtaineth dark
words: as, Saturne signifieth lead: Mercury
quicksiluer: Sol gold: Luna siluer:
Venus copper: Iupiter tinne: Mars iron;
with diuers words of Art a hūdred times
more mysticall then these. I wil passe ouer
the elixers, fixations, and such like
names of the Chymists. Thus (gentle
Reader) mayst thou see, that euery Science
hath other significations, then the
plaine names do declare. Why then
wil Dunces vpbraid Poets with their intricated
Fables, which none but Oedipus
can interpret? Only sonnes of Art,

to whome God hath imparted his blessing,
must attaine to the right knowlege
of the Muses. Hearken what another
saith,Zabar. lib. 2. de natur. Logic. cap. 19. 
                     The faigned examples of the Poets
are fit and conuenient for the amendement
of maners. To bee short, I am verily
of this opinion, thatOsor. li. 1. Ciuilis nobilitat. 
                     all Poets are sworne
enemies to lies, and do vtterly detest falsehood:
and among the rest Homer was the
searcher and louer of truth and verity.
Sundry times haue I beene conuersant
with such, as blasphemed Poetry, by
calling it mincing and lying Poetry.
But it is no maruel, that they thus deride
Poetry, sith they sticke not in this outworne
age to abuse the ministers of
GOD, by terming them bookish fellowes
and Puritanes, they themselues
not knowing what they meane.
                  What more shall I write? Poets at all
times haue beene preferred before all
Artists, & highly esteemed of all Princes.
Euripides was entertained of Amintas
king of Macedon. Sophocles together
with Pericles was cōstituted gouernour
of Athens. Antimenides the
Poet was Generall of an army. Likewise
Tyrtaeus the Poet being lame on one

legge, was by the oracle of Apollo chosen
chieftaine of the Lacedemonians, &
got the victory ouer his enemies. Lysander
king of Lacedemon, in reward of a
few verses, gaue vnto the Poet Antiochus
his hat full of siluer. The Sicilians
hauing ouercome the Athenians,
spared many of them for Euripides his
sake. And if they heard any verses like
vnto his, they would haue thē by heart,
and one would present them to another
with great ioy.Sydn

was thus honoured, but also for his
sake all other meane Poets, insomuch
as Cherilus a simple Poet had for euery
good verse, which he composed, a Philip
noble of gold, amounting to the value
of an Angel English. Theocritus the

was the onely meanes to reuiue the

with silence, the fauor of the French
Queene Anne, wife to Lewis the twelfe
of France, extended to Poets. This
Queen passing on a time from her lodging
towards the Kings side, saw in a gallerie
Allen Chartier a learned Poet,
leaning on a tables end fast asleepe,
which this Princesse espying, shee stouped
downe to kisse him, vttering these
words in all their hearings: Wee may
not of Princely courtesie passe by, and
not honour with our kisse the mouth,

from whence so many golden poems
haue issued. Frauncis the first, French
King in the yeere of our Lord 1532.
made those famous Poets, Dampetrus
and Macrinus, of his priuie Counsell.
King Henrie the eight, her maiesties
Father, for a few Psalmes of Dauid turned
into English meeter by Sternhold,
made him Groome of his priuie chamber,
and rewarded him with many great
gifts besides. Moreouer, hee made Sir
Thomas Moore Lord Chauncelour of
this Realme, whose Poeticall works are
as yet in great regard. Queene Marie
for an Epithalamy composed by Verzoza
a Spanish Poet, at her marriage
with King Philip in Winchester, gaue
him during his life two hundred crowns
pension. Her Maiestie that now is, made
Doctour Haddon being a Poet, master
of the Requests. In former times, Princes
themselues were not ashamed to studie
Poetrie. As for example, Iulius Cesar
was a very good Poet. Augustus
likewise was a Poet, as by his edict touching
Virgils bookes appeareth. Euax
King of Arbia wrote a booke of pretious
stones in verse. Cornelius Gallus

treasurer of Egypt, was a singular good
Poet. Neither is our owne age altogether
to bee disprayed. For the old
Earle of Surrey composed bookes in
verse. Sir Philip Sydney excelled all
our English Poets, in rarenesse of stile
and matter. King Iames the sixt of
Scotland, that now raigneth, is a notable
Poet, and daily setteth out most
learned Poems, to the admiration of all
his subiects.
                  Gladly I could goe forward in this
subiect, which in my stripling yeeres
pleased mee beyond all others, were it
not I delight to bee briefe: and that Sir
Philip Sydney hath so sufficiētly defended
it in his Apologie of Poetrie; that if
I should proceede further in the commendation
thereof, whatsoeuer I write
would bee eclipsed with the glorie of
his golden eloquence. Wherefore I
stay my selfe in this place, earnestly
beseeching all Gentlemen, of what qualitie
soeuer they bee, to aduaunce Poetrie,
or at least to admire it, and not
to bee so hastie shamefully to abuse that,
which they may honestly and lawfully
obtaine.
                  
                     
                     Obiection.
                     The reading of Catullus, Propertius,
Ouids loues, and the lasciuious rimes of
our English Poets, doe discredite the
Common-wealth, and are the chiefe occasions
of corruptions, & the spurres of
lecherie: therefore Poetrie is blameworthie.
                  
                  
                     Answere.

                        but the abuse
of him that vseth them, must bee blamed.
The fault is not in the Art of Poetrie,
but rather in the men that abuse it.
Poets themselues may bee traitours and
felons, and yet Poetrie honest and vnattainted.
Take away the abuse, which is
meerely accidental, and let the substance
of Poetrie stand still. Euerie thing that
bringeth pleasure, may bring displeasure.

                        Phisicke is most commodious

this solution, I conclude, that many of
our English rimers and ballet-makers

deserue for their baudy sonnets, and amorous
allurements, to bee banished, or
seuerely punished: and that Poetrie it

                     PHilosophie is the knowledge of all good
things, both diuine and humane.

God: and morall Philosophie, of vertue

the execution and practise of
precepts. Thirdly, the promotion of a
good man;Clemens Alexandrinus. li. 2. stromat. * Which three concurring together
in one man, do make him a wise Philosopher.
The Iewes diuided Philosophie
into foure parts: namely, into Historical,
Ciuill, Naturall of the contemplation of
sacrifices, and into Diuine of the speculation
of Gods word. Of which I will at
this time content my selfe with the natural,

and the ciuillAri. in initio lib. 1. de coelo. 
                     Naturall Philosophie
is a science that is seene in bodyes, magnitudes,
and in their beginnings or ground
workes, affections, and motions. Or, as
others say,Zabarel. lib. de Constitutione naturalis scientiae. cap. 6. 
                     Naturall Philosophie is a
contemplatiue science, which declareth
the perfect knowledge of naturall bodyes,
as farre foorth as they haue the beginning
of motion within them.
                     Pererius lib. 2. Physic. cap. 7. 
                     There bee seuen
parts of it. The first is of the first causes
of nature, and of naturall bodyes. The
second of the world. The third, of
the mutuall transmutation of the elements,
and in generall, of generation
and corruption. The fourth is, of the
meteours. The fift, of the soule, and
of liuing creatures. The sixt, of plants,
The seuenth, of things perfectly mixed,
and of things without life, as, of Minerals
and such like.
                  
                     Piccolominaeus in introduct. ad 10. gradus Ciuilis Philosophiae. cap. 7. Ciuill Philosophie is a science compounding
mans actions out of the inward motion
of Nature, and sprung vp from the fulnesse
of a wise minde: insomuch that wee
may in all degrees of life attaine to that
which is honest.
                  This ciuill Philosophie is diuided into
foure parts: Ethicke, Politicke, Oeconomicke,

and Monastick. Ethick is the
discipline of good maners. Of Oeconomick
and Politick, I haue discoursed
before. Monastick is the institution of
a priuate and a solitarie life. But of the
worthinesse of this ciuill Philosophie,
and by how much it goeth before the
naturall, I haue expressed inIn Commentar. in satyr. 5. Persi. another
booke.
               
               
                  Of the Art Magick.
Chap. 44.
                  THe auncient Magicians prophesied
either by the starres, and then their
Art was termed Astrologie: or by the
flying and entrailes of birdes, and this
they called Augurie: by the fire, and
that they named Pyromancie: or by the
lines and wrinckles of the hand, which
was termed Chiromancie or Palmistrie:
by the earth, called Geomancie: by
the water, and that they termed Hydromancie:
or by the diuell, and this we call
coniuring or bewitching. All which
superstitious kindes of illusions (I feare
mee) haue beene too often vsed heere

in England; witnesse of late yeeres the
witches of Warboise: witnesse figurecasters,
& calculatours of natiuities: witnesse
also many of our counterfeit Bedlems,
who take vpon thē to tell fortunes
and such like. Now-a-dayes among the
common people, he is not adiudged any
scholer at all, vnlesse hee can tell mens
Horoscopes, cast out diuels, or hath some
skill in southsaying. Little do they know
thatPlinius in initi. li. 30. 
                     this Art, (if it b
                        •
                     e lawfull to call it
an Art) is the most deceitfull of all Arts,
as hauing neither sure foundations to
rest vpon, nor doing the students thereof
any good: but rather alluring them
to throw themselues away vnto the diuel
both body & soule. Wo be vnto thē that
delight therein, for it were better for
them that they had neuer beene borne.
A man hauing in his furie killed one,
may by the grace of God repent, and
bee sorie for his offence; but for the coniurer
or magician, it is almost impossible
that hee should be conuerted, by reason
that the Diuell is alwaies conuersant
with him, and is present euen at his very
elbow, and will not once permit him
to aske forgiuenesse. Experience whereof

Doctour Faustus felt, who was at
last torne in peeces by the diuell. Cornelius
Agrippa likewise, a man famous
for his great skill in Magicke, and as
yet fresh in some old mens memorie,
went continually accompanied with
a Diuell in the shape of a blacke dōgge
                        •
                     
and when at his death hee was vrged to
repent and crie GOD mercie, hee
pulled off the coller which was about the
dogges necke, and sent him away with
these words, Packe hence, thou cursed
curre, which hast quite vndone mee.
With that the dogge went away, and
drowned himselfe in the riuer Arar▪
Within a little after Agrippa deceased,
whose iudgement I leaue vnto the
Lord.
                  As touching the deedes of coniurers,
I confesse, they bee wonderfull;
forExod. 7. 
                     the charmers of Egypt turned roddes
into serpents in the sight of Pharao. And
there is nothing which good men doe,
but Sorcerers like Apes will assay to do
the like. Many of them (among whome
I meane Pope Siluester the second,
Pope Benedict the ninth, and Pope
Alexander the sixt) were cunning in

the scriptures, professed holynesse of
life, and gaue pardons and indulgences
(as the Pope doth now) vnto them
that would buy them. But in the end
they were pitifully and openly tormented
and deuoured by the Diuell
their schoole-master. My selfe haue
seene about eleuen yeeres agoe, a counterfeit
dumbe fellow, that could by
signes and tokens foretell diuers, things
to come. Hee could signifie what misfortunes
a man hath suffered, what
yeeres hee was off, what wife hee had
maried, how many children he had; and
which is most strange of all, hee would
finde out any thing which was hidden
of purpose. At last it was this yong Magicians
happe to arriue at a zealous
Gentlemans house, who hauing before
heard of his miraculous deedes, eftsoone
suspected him and made no more
adoe, but by violence and threatning
enforced him to speake, and to declare
his dissimulation procured, as hee himselfe
confessed, by the Diuell, with
whome hee had couenated to become
dumbe, on condition that he might
performe such miracles.
                  
                     
haue heard and read of many Coniurers,
that wrought wonders, and
things almost incredible: yet neuer
haue I either heard or read of any
that prospered, but at the last, they
eyther came to the gallous or fagot, or
else they were preuented, and miserably
taken by the Diuell. Which
is the cause, that wise men haue vtterly
detested this blacke Arte, as being
admonished by other mens harmes,
to beware of it. So that none but malicious,
simple, and grosse-headed persons,
who eyther for reuenge, or for
couetousnesse are so seduced, doe enter
into league and confederacie with
the Diuell.
                  To knit vp this discourse, I aduise
all persons, and especially olde
women, to take heede of illusions and
charmes▪ seeing principally,Exo. 22 Leuit. 19 Deut. 18

& abominable by the laws of man both
ciuill and canon. Finally, men must abstain
from sorceries, coniurations, witchcrafts,
and such kind of wickednesse, for
feare of punishment, because,Leuit. 20. 
                     if any
                     
sayth the Lord, turne after such as worke
with spirits, and after southsayers, to goe
(spiritually) a whoring after them, then
will I set my face against that person, and
will cut him off from among his people. And
in another place:Exo. 22. 
                     Thou must not suffer a
witch to liue. Looke therefore vnto
your selues, and bee prepared, O simple
wretches, lest otherwise the siend finding
you vnreadie, will quickly surprize
you, and so inueigle your weake and
shallow mindes.

goodnesse thereof. There is no facultie,

Potentates haue not disdained to exercise

it. Gentius the King of Illyria, found
out the vertuous qualities of the herbe

and Lybia, found the herbe called
Euphorbium. Sabor King of the Medes,
Sabrel King of the Arabians, Mithridates

                     and of that which
is iust and vniust. Of Ciuilians it is declared
tripartite: as it comprehendeth
the law of nature, the law of nations,
and the ciuill law. The law of nature is
a feeling which euerie one hath in his

conscience, whereby hee discerneth
betweene good and euill, as much as is
sufficient to deliuer him from the cloudie
cloake of ignorance, in that hee is reprehended
by himselfe.L. Iustitu. tit. de iure. Natu. Gent. & Ciuil. §. ius natur. 
                     Hence commeth
the coniunction of male and female: the Procreation
of children, and education. The
law of Nations is a prescription, that all
maner of people can claime: as, to resist
violence was lawfull: to defraud the wilie
and subtill was no fraude: to hurt a
Herauld was not tolerable: to pay euery
man his owne was right: and in a maner
all contracts were brought in by
this law: as buying, selling, hiring,
gaging, and infinite others. The Ciuill
law is that, which is squared according
to honestie, and is termed euery
priuate law, enacted by one peculiar
people.
                  There is also a Diuine law, which is
three-fold: to witte, the morall law,
the ceremoniall law, and the Iudiciall
law. The morall law is that, which is
constituted for all Nations, if they will
obserue the commandements of GOD,
The Ceremoniall law was an instruction
of infancie giuen to the Iewes, to bee

exercised vnder the obedience of God,
vntill Christs comming. The Iudiciall
law is that, which was giuen them for
politicke gouernement, teaching them
certaine Maximes of iustice, whereby
they might liue quietly, without molesting
one another.

Chap. 47.
                  AS soone as Brutus came into this
Realme, hee constituted the Troians
lawes throughout all his dominions.
But when diuisions and ciuill broyles
hapned a little after his decease, those
lawes decayed for a long time, vntill
Malmutius reuiued them, enlarging
them with many profitable more, and
were named Malmutius lawes: vnto
which Martia a Queene of this land, added
the decrees of her time, and were
called Martiaes lawes. Besides these,
King Lud is reported to amend them.
Then in the succession of time, raigned
Saint Edward, a right vertuous

Prince, who selected and enacted excellent
good lawes: but within a while
after, the Normans conquered this land,
and altered the estate thereof, appoynting
new lawes in their owne language,
as a people naturally inclined to sophisticall
and doubtful sence, whereby they
wrested the lawes to all constructions.
Yet notwithstanding, King Edward the
third was enduced to abrogate many of
the Norman lawes, and in their stead to
inuest new and wholesome lawes. The
method of which, is at this day put in
practise among our Sergeants and vtter-Sarristers.
                  
                     Obiection.
                     That law which is of no antiquitie,
neither grounded vpon any good foundations,
nor vsed in any countrey but
one, cannot bee good: such is the common
law of England: therefore it is of
no effect.
                  
                  
                     Answere.
                     Our Common law of England (I confesse)
is of no great antiquitie: yet
grounded vpon the law of Nature, and
approoued by the vniuersall consent
of the Prince, Nobles, & Commons, in a

generall Parliament. In briefe, necessity
hath no reason.
                  
               
               
                  Whether alteration of lawes be good in
a commonwealth. Chap. 48.
                  THere was a law amōg the Locrensians,
that whosoeuer did intrude
himself to make a new law, should come
with a halter about his necke: insomuch
that if his lawes were approued, he went
away safe as he came: if reproued, hee
was presently hanged. So in like maner,
when we alter our vsuall diet, wee feele
great innouations in our bodies, and do
perhaps fall into some sicknesse or other:
but when we be accustomed once vnto
it, then we recouer, & waxe more lusty
then before we were. Custome (as they
say) is another nature. But yet this custome
may bee reduced into a better.
The alteration of lawes (I confesse) at
the first seemeth rough and raw vnto
our fraile and queizy natures. But within
a while they be better liked of. Which
moued the Diuine Philosopher to say:
thatPlato li. 7. de 
                           ••
                        
                        gibus, 
                     chaunge of lawes, excepting those
that be bad, is perilous at all times. This

caused the Kentishmen to rise against
king William the Conquerour of this
land, and priuily to enclose him round
about in the woods, that thereby hee
might the sooner be compelled to cōdiscend
to their petition, which was, that
they might be suffered to enioy their ancient
customes and liberties.
                  As for the deciding of this question,
I thinke, that some lawes may bee altered
and reduced into better. Howbeit
law-makers must aduise themselues wel
in that behalfe, & take great heed therein
for where there ariseth small good
by innouations of lawes, it is an euill
thing. Surely,Arist. lib. 2. Politic. ca. 6 
                     It is better to beare with
the imperfections of lawes: because the alteration
of them will not do so much benefit,
as harme, by vsing men to disobey.
                  
                  And againe, who is so dull-spirited,
which will not graunt, that defects
of lawes ought now and then to
be winked at and dissembled? Vpon
which occasionPlato li. 1. de Legibus. 
                     all persons vnder the age
of forty were heretofore forbidden to enquire
whether lawes were well or ill made.
Ripenesse of yeares is a great meane to
conserue people in their obedience.

And for that causeArist. lib. 1. Ethic. ca. 3

                  THe auncient Philosophers accounted
three kinds of speculatiue or
contemplatiue Sciences: to wit,Aristot, lib. 11. Metaph. cap. 1. 
                     naturall philosophy: the Mathematickes: and
Diuinity, which is the first and chiefest
beginning of all things, which is the
cement that soddereth the peeces of the
building of our estate, and the planke,
wherewith our ship is fortified. Take
away this beginning, and the world will
seeme a confused Chaos. Take away this
cement, and our building is ruinous. In a
word, vncaske the plāks of a ship, & it wil
leake & sinke into the sea. Plant ye therfore
religion in your kingdomes, and let
not the heathen rise vp against you at
the day of iudgement. The Romanes,
we read, through the bare instinct of nature,
did so reuerētly thinke of Diuinity,
that they sent their childrē into Hetruria
to learne it there. And yet many of vs
Christiās presume to iniure the ministers

God, albeit we know, thatSen. in Epist. 84 
                     nothing is
hidde from him, and that he is present, and
still accompanieth vs in the midst of our secrete
cogitations. God make cleane our
hearts within vs, and cause vs to regard
his ministers and word better then wee
do. Otherwise, let vs expect for nothing,
but fearfull alarums, warres, heresies,
pestilence, and famine continually without
ceasing to annoy and destroy both
vs and our countrey.
               
               
                  Whether two religions may be tolerated
in one kingdome?
Chap. 50.
                  TWo religions cannot be suffered in
one kingdome: for diuersities cause
factions, garboiles, and ciuill warres,
which neuer end but with the subuersiō
of the commonwealth. The tranquillity
of all estates consisteth in the vnion and
consent of the inhabitants. Take away
this vnion, and it is but a denne for rouers
and theeues. The first foundations
of kingdomes were built vpon the rock
of one religion; and the heathen themselues
had neuer established their lawes,

if they had harboured pluralities of religions.
He that displaceth this stone, shaketh
all the building.Matt. 
                     No man can serue
two masters, for eyther he must despise the
one, or loue the other. Neither must Princes
halt betweene two opinions.3. Reg. 18. 
                     If the
Lord be God, follow him, but if Baal be hee,
then go after him. In religion there is no
mediocrity, for a man must either be a
Christian, or els, he must be an enemy of
Christ, that is, an Antichristian, according
to our Sauiour Christes words:Luc. 11 
                     He
that is not with mee, is against me: and he
that gathereth not with me, scattereth.

                     I
am the Lord, saith God, this is my name,
and my glory wil I not giue away to another:
neyther my prayse to grauen images. Also,
it is written,Matt. 4. 
                     Thou shalt worship the Lord
thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue. But
how is it possible to obserue this commaundement,

buying and selling, or els of posting
ouer and exchaunging some spirituall
thing, or some thing annexed to the spirituality,
as aduowsons, presentations,
and such like. This vice is called after
the name of Simon Magus, by reason
that heAct. 8. 
                     offred the Apostles money, that they
might giue him the power, that, on whomsoeuer
he layd his hands, he should receyue the
holy Ghost. For which his execrable
proffer, hee had this answere of Peter:

Headship, or for a fellowes or
Scholers roome, is guilty of Simony.

Simony.
                  
                  Now hauing declared how many
waies Simony is committed, I wil shew,
that it is the vtter ruine of the Cleargie,
and consequently of the whole commonwealth.
First,Sotus li. 9. q. 8. art. 1. & Nauarr. in manu

                     Simony is condemned
with excommunication, the seuerest censure
of the Church: and therfore odious.
Secondly, Simony hindreth house-keeping,
so that ministers cannot distribute
almes. Thirdly, it breedeth the
desolation and destruction of the state.
For commonlyTacitus lib. 13. Annal. 
                     there ensueth a dissolution
of the commonwealth, when the fruits

                           •
                        es therof are decreased. Fourthly,
Simony discourageth parents to send
their sonnes to the Vniuersity: for what
parents bee so foolish, as to bestow in
maintenaunce of their sonnes at least

three hundred pound before they attayne
to perfection, and then to pay againe
two hundred poūd for a benefice,
or foure hundred pound for a Chauncelorship?
surely it is a lamentable case.
I had rather, saith one, that my sonne be a
colier then a scholer. For what shall I put my
sonne to schoole, when he shall pay so much
for a liuing? Better it is for me to leaue my
sonne an ingram foole, then to buy him a liuing
through vnlawfull meanes. Besides,
who is so bluntish, that knoweth not
the great & infinite labours of Scholers?
that seeth not their eyes weakned, their
bodies empaired, & which is worse, their
spirites decaied? O stony hearts! O wicked
Simonists! Doubtlesse this abomination
portends some great calamity to
follow. Lastly,l. q. 1. ca. Quisquis. 
                     Simony is an heresie, and
for that respect it ought to be reiected
from all true Christians.
                  To wind this vp in a word, I wish all
Pastours and patrons of benefices and
Chancelourships to looke more narrowly
vnto themselues, and to stand in feare
of God, who vndoubtedly is offended
with their Simony, and will one dayValer. Maxim, lib. 1. 
                     requite
the slacknes of their punishments with

the weight thereof, & wil cast them downe
headlong into the bottomlesse and tormenting
pit of hell, where euery sence
of their bodies shall abide his peculiar
punishment. Their eyes shall haue no
other obiects then Diuels and Snakes:
their eares shall bee afflicted with clamours
and howlings: their noses with
brimstone and filthy smels: their tast
with poison and gall: and their feeling
shal be vexed continually with boyling
lead and firy flames.

Chap. 52.
                  COmmonwealths, euen as mortall
men, haue their infācy, childhood,
stripling age, youth, virility, middle
age, and old age: that is, they
haue their beginning, vegetation, flourishing,
alteration, and ends. And like as
diuers innouations, & maladies do happen
to mē, according to the cōstitutiō of
their bodies, or according to their diet
and education: so in like maner it falleth

out with commonwealths, as being altered
eyther by domesticall & ciuill wars,
or els by forreyne, or perhaps by both
together, or by the death of the noblest
inhabitaunts, or to bee briefe, by vices,
which are suffred to creepe in. It is necessary
that all things, which are in this
world should waxe old, andOuid. li. 10. Metamorph. 
                     hasten to the
same end, some sooner, others later, according
to the will of God their Creatour,
and by his permission through the influence
of the heauenly bodies from
which this mutuall succession of life and
death issueth. Howbeit notwithstāding,
I confesse that prodigious signes are not
the causes of euents, but rather foretokens
of them. Like as an Iuy bush put
forth at a vintrie, is not the cause of the
wine, but a signe that wine is to be sold
there: so likewise if wee see smoke appearing
in a chimney, wee know that
fire is there, albeit the smoke is not the
cause of the fire.Dan. 2.

deepe and secret things, and the light is with

                  FOrasmuch as the alterations of commōwealths
are for the most part foreshewed
vnto vs by heauenly signes: I
iudge it more meet for mee to declare
those, which chaunced within this last
age, rather then in any other, especially
for that they are neerer to our fathers
memories, and also more familiar
vnto vs.
                  In the yeere of our Lord 1500. there
appeared a Comet in the North,Anno 1500. after
the which followed many and straunge
effects. For the Frenchmen assaulted the
kingdome of Naples: & the Tartarians
the kingdome of Polonia. Then was a
great famine in Swethland, and a cruell
plague throughout al Germany; besides
ciuill warres amongst themselues, in taking
part with the Bauarians against the
Bohemians. Thē died Pope Pius the 3.
together with the Archbishop of Tre
                     
                        •
                     ires,
and diuers other famous wights.
                  In the yeere 1506.Anno 1506. appeared another

Comet. Whereupon died Prince Philip
the father of Charles the fift and Ferdinand
afterward Emperours. Maximilian
the Emperour made warre with the
Frenchmen and Venetians.
                  In the yeere 1514.Anno 1514. was an Eclipse of
the sunne. About which time George
Duke of Saxony inuaded and spoyled
Frizelād. King Lewis the 12. of Fraūce,
and Vladislaus king of Hungary & Bohemia
departed out of this world.
                  In the yeere 1518.Anno 1518. was seene another
Eclipse of the sunne. Immediatly after
the which died the Emperour Maximilian
the first. Christierne the 2. king of
Denmarke fought a most bloudy battell
with the Swethens: & within a while after
he was deposed of his kingdome.
                  In the yeere 1527.Anno 1527. appeared a great
Comet: the operation wherof the poor
                        •
                     
Hungarians felt, as being barbarously▪
to the shame of all Christians, martyred
& destroyed by the Turkes. The prodigious
disease of sweating was rife here in
England. The riuer Tiber ouerflowed
the citie of Rome. The sea also consumed
away a great part of the low countries.Anno 1533.
                  
                  In the yeere of our Lord 1533. wa
                        •
                     
                     
seene another blazing starre: whereupō
a litle while after, king H. y• 8. was diuorced
frō his brothers wife. The sect of the
Anabaptists begā to rise. Pope Clement
the 7. departed out of this life: and Pope
Paul the 3. was inuested in his roome.
                  In the yeere 1539.Anno 1539. chaunced an Eclipse
of the sunne: & presently after appeared
a Comet: the effects wherof were
many. For there was a great cōmotiō in
Gaūt, which the Emperour not without
much damage at lēgth appeased, & took
away their priuileges frō them. Iohn the
K. of Hungary ended his life. And so did
Henry Duke of Saxony. The Duke of
Brunswisk was by the young Duke of
Saxony and by the Landgraue of Hassia
driuen out of his countrey. The English
ouercame the Scots.
                  In the yeere 1544.Anno 1544. chaūced foure Eclipses,
one of the sunne, and three of the
Moone. Wherupō the L. high Admiral
of England arriued with a fleet of two
hūdred saile in Scotland, where he spoiled
Lieth, and burned Edinburgh. King
Henry the eight went himselfe in person
to Fraunce wiith a great army, & cōquered
Boloigne. The Marques of Brandeburge

died in his banishmēt. And before
three yeeres after the fight of the said
Eclipses were fully expired, king Henry
the eight deceased. Likewise, the French
kings sonne, the Duke of Bauarie, the
Queene of Polonia, the Queene of
Spaine, the Archbishop of Mogunce, &
Martine Luther ended their liues.
                  In the yeere 1557.Anno 1557. a blazing starre
was seene at al times of the night, to wit,
the sixt, the seuenth, eight, ninth, and
tenth of March: when presently after,
open war was proclaimed between England
and Fraunce; and a great army was
sent by Q. Mary ouer to S. Quintaines.
The Protestants were persecuted and
cruelly dealt withall in this Realme. And
Queene Mary, before a tweluemoneth
came about, departed out of this life.
                  In the yeere 1572.Anno 1572. was seene towards
the North a straunge starre, in bignesse
surpassing Iupiter, and seated aboue the
moone. At which time succeeded the
bloudy massacre and persecution of the
Protestants in Fraunce. Many great personages
ended their liues; as, King
Charles the ninth of Fraunce, Mathew
Parker Archbishop of Canterbury, and

sundry other. Pirats robbed and spoyled
many of our marchants on the West
seas. The sect of the family of loue begā
to be discouered at London. Sebastian
the king of Portingal, and Mule the king
of Moroco were both slaine within lesse
then sixe yeeres after.
                  In the yeere 1581.Anno 1581. appeared a Comet
bearding Eastward. Whereupon a little
while after, certaine cōpanies of Italians
& Spaniards sent by the Pope to strengthen
the Earle of Desmond in his rebelliō,
landed on the west coast of Ireland,
and there erected their Antichrists banner
against her Maiesty. Campian and
other Seminary priests returned to this
Realme, and were attached.
                  In the yeere 1583.Anno 1583. appeared another
Comet, the bush wherof streamed southeast.
But the effects thereof followed in
the death of Edmund Grindal Archbishop
of Canterbury, & Thomas Earle of
Sussex: and in the apprehending of Arden,
Someruile, and other traitours in
Warwickshire. Also within a while ensued
a great dearth here in England.
                  In the yere 1596.Anno 1596. appeared a Comet
northward. At which time Hēry Carew

L. Hunsdon, & L. Chamberlaine of her
Maiesties houshold, and Sir Frauncis
Knowles ended their liues. Robert Earle
of Essex, and Charles L. high Admiral of
England Generalles of the English fleet
burned the Spanish nauy, & sacked the
towne of Cales. Moreouer, there continued
here in England a great dearth of
corne, with straunge inundations of waters,
Graue Maurice got a famous victory
ouer the Spaniards in the low countreyes.
Alphonsus Duke of Ferraria departed
out of this life. The Pope and the
Bastard of Ferraia had diuers bickerings
about the Dukedome. Finally, before
the yeere went about, died Gunilla
the Queene mother of Swethland, and
Gustaue Duke of Saxony her Nephew.
Likewise Iohn Marquesse of Brādeburge
one of the Electours, & Anne Queene
of Polonia, daughter to Charles Archduke
of Austria, being great with child,
ended their liues.
                  In the beginning of the yeere 1598.
was seene a most fearfull Eclipse of the
sunne,Anno 1598. in the seuenteenth degree of Piscis,
neere to the Dragons head: the like
whereof was seldome heard off at any

time before: for the sunne was darkened
full eleuen poynts, which very neere is
the whole compasse of his body. The effects
of it are these following.
                  Sigismund Prince of Transyluania,
not finding his power sufficient to encounter
the Turks, voluntarily resigned
his dominion to the Emperour Rodolph
the second. The King of Swethland returning
into his Realme from Polonia,
had diuers conflicts and skirmishes with
his subiects. William Lord high Treasurer
of England deceased. And so did
king Philip the second of Spaine, albeit
after a more strange maner. For it is credibly
enformed, that this tyrant was eaten
vp of lice and vermine. A punishmēt
no doubt befitting his vsurping life.
Rome was againe ouerflowne by the riuer
Tiber, whereby fifteene hundred
houses perished, and in a maner all
the Popes treasure was lost. Cardinall
Albert sent Mendoza Admirall
of Aragon, with his rascalitie, into the
Low Countries, where, vpon his owne
confederates of Cleueland, he hath exercised
many bloudy tragedies. Theodore
Duke of Muscouie ended his life.

There was a great deluge of waters in
Hungarie. The Turks had wonderfull
bad lucke vpon the seas. The vnited
States of the low Countries sent a huge
fleete into Spaine, where they had verie
good successe, to the vtter vndoing of
many a Spaniard. What shall I write of
the terrible rumours of warres, which
were noysed throughout all England
this last summer? Assuredly these enents
were foreshewed vnto vs by the horrible
Eclipse, which appeared now aboue two
two yeeres agoe. Since which time I
waited continually for some notable effect
or other: neither could my mind otherwise
presage, but that such things
would come to passe, which now (GOD
be thanked) are ouerpast. This after a
sort, I communicated at that time to master
Ia. Pr. an auncient wise gentleman,
and a deare kinsman of mine, at whose
house, I as then being lately come into
my countrey, after my fathers decease,
soiourned. God grant vs better and happier
successe in this new yeere.
               
               
                  
                  Of the causes of sedition and ciuill
broyles. Chap. 54.
                  THere be sixe causes of sedition. The
first and chiefest is the contempt of
religion. For if men loued God, which
they cannot doe, except they loue their
neighbour, doubtlesse no such effects
would follow from their actions.Esay. 2. The
loue of religion breaketh swords into
mattocks, and speares into sithes, and causeth
thatMicha. 4. 
                     nation shall not lift vp sword against
nation, neither learne to fight any
more. The second cause of sedition is the
factions of the subiects, which euer haue
beene, and euer will bee the subuersion
of estates. The third cause is riotous prosperitie:
for ouer-great aboundance of wealth, is the prouocation of mischiefes,
                     Ouid. lib. 1. Metamorph. and
maketh men to become diuels. The
fourth is, when the Prince ouerchargeth
his subiects with tributes, and when
hee substituteth niggardly and deceitfull
Treasurers and Lieutenants to receiue
the leuied money, that will not

sticke to detaine a part thereof for their
owne priuate gaine. The first cause of
Sedition is iniquitie:Arist. li. 5. Politic. cap. 1. 
                     as, when that which
is due by proportion, is not giuen to them
that bee equall; and when the Prince bestoweth
honour, which is the hire and
guerdon of vertue, vpon raw and meane
men. This was one of the originall causes
of the late troubles in France, when
the Queene mother, for the establishment
of her regencie, dubbed simple
Gentlemen knights of the honourable
order of Saint Michael, first instituted
by King Lewis the eleuenth, and til that
time held in great estimation. The sixt
cause of sedition is, when the Prince
winketh at the cosonages of magistrates
and Lawyers, and permitteth some of
the richer sort to enclose commons, and
to rake their inferiors out of measure.
               
               
                  Of Treason. Chap. 55.
                  
                     TReason bringeth no lesse danger and hurt
to men,
                     Valerius Maxim. lib. 9. ca. 6. 
                     then Loyaltie doth profit and felicitie:
for it is farre easier to vanquish a
knowne foe, then to subdue a traitour
and a priuie conspiratour. This wicked

monster in time of warre, worketh more
scath and damage, then all artilleries.
Howbeit, hee neuer enioyeth his promised
hire, but is at last cruelly punished.
As for example, the great Turke in the
yeere of our Lord 1400. hauing taken
Constantinople through the treason of
Iohn Iustinian a Genoway, whō after
he had made King according to his promise,
caused his head to bee chopt off
within three dayes.
                  To approch neerer our owne time,
let vs bethinke with our selues the mercifull
prouidence of God, in discouering
the hainous treasons pretended against
our dread soueraigne Queen Elizabeth.
Of late yeeres, namely, in the yeere
1588. what befell to Tilney, Sauage,
Babington, and the rest of their cursed
complices? were they not all executed,
& brought to confusion? Likewise Doctour
Lopouze, the Queenes Phisicion,
who had poysoned sundry Noblemen of
this Realme, and by the Spanish Kings
procurement, went about to poyson the
Queene her selfe, had he not in the yere
1594. his deserued punishment? Euen
so the last yeere one Squire, by the instigation

of a Spanish Frier, going about
to do away her Maiestie, was surprized in
his treason, and executed to the terrour
of all such diuelish traitours.
                  Be therefore better admonished, yee
wauering men, let the example of such as
were executed, terrifie your minds from
rebellious attempts, and suffer not wilfully
the diuell to tempt and leade you
into temptation.
               
               
                  Of Idlenesse. Chap. 56.
                  O You slouthfull men, why doe you
miche, range, & turne your backs to
vertuous labours, seeing that they, who
ouercame the delites of this world, haue
deserued heauen for their rewards? why
doe you straggle & rogue from house to
house? Beleeue me, there is no occupation
in the world, that bringeth with it
lesse profit then yours.Prou. 6. 
                     Goe to the emmet,
yee slouthfull sluggards: consider her wayes,
and learne to bee wise. She hath no guide, no
teacher, no leader, yet in the summer shee
prouideth her meate, and gathereth together
her foode in the haruest. Oh why haue you
forgotten the words of the Lord, namely,Gen. 3
                     In the sweate of thy face shalt thou eate

thy bread? Remember what penalties
are imposed on runnagates and loytering
droanes. In the primitiue Church it
was decreed, that all men should liue of
their owne labour, and not vnprofitably
waste the fruits of the earth. Likewise
the (faigned) Syphograuntes or officers
of the Vtopians,Moru
                           •
                         li. 2. Vtop. 
                     tooke heede, that no
man sate idle, but that each one should diligently
apply his owne craft and occupation.
What shall I say of our owne constitutions
here in England? In the yeere of our
Lord 1572. it was enacted in the parliament,
that all persons aboue the age
of foureteene yeeres, which were taken
begging and roging abroade, should be
apprehended, whipped, and burnt
through the eare with a hot iron, for the
first time so found; and the second time
to be hanged. For which consideration,
looke vnto your selues yee carelesse
caitifes, gette you masters, that
may instruct you in some occupation or
other; which done, labour continually: &
that not onely for your selues, but for
the reliefe also of such as are not able
to helpe themselues. In so doing, Sathan
the enemie of grace, who hitherto

like a wily foxe hath awaited for you,
shall goe away in despaire, and (as they
say) with a flea in his eare.
               
               
                  Of Dice-play. Chap. 57.
                  CHristians ought vtterly to forbeare
Dice-play: first, becauseCypriā. lib. de Alea. 
                     The diuell
inuented it. Secondly, because it is flat against
the commandement of GOD,
namely,Exo. 20 
                     Thou shalt not couet any other
mans goods. Thirdly, Dice-play is for the
most part accompanied with swearing
and blaspheming Gods holy name.
Fourthly,August. in Epist. 64. ad Maced. the holy fathers of the church
haue most vehemently written against
it.Ambros. lib. 1. Offici. cap. 23. Fiftly, all sports and recreations must
haue respect to some profite, either of
body or of mind,Chrysost. homil. 6. in Matth. P. Marty. Commēt. in Iudic. cap. 14. & Danaeus lib. de Alea. (otherwise it is but lost,
for which wee must one day yeelde an
account to God) but Dice-play, as wee
know, is no exercise for the body; neither
is it any pleasure for the minde: for
the euent of the hazard or maine, driueth
the players minde to a furious hope,
and sometimes into a fearefull quandarie:
to wit, when hee doubteth the recouerie
of his lost money. Sixtly, we

are charged,Coloss. 4. 
                     Not to consume our time in
wicked and vnlawfull exercises. Seuenthly,
men must abstaine from Dice-play,
that they might shew good example to
their inferiours.Iuuenal. satyr. 14. For * if graue parents delight
in wicked Dice-play, their sonnes will
likewise be enduced thereunto. Eightly,C. lib. 3. tit. 43. L. Alear. vsus. &c. ff. 11. tit. 5.
Dice-play is condemned by the lawes
and decrees of Princes. By the law Roscia,
all such as played at dice were banished
from their countrey. It was also enacted
in Rome, thatPaedian. in. lib. 2. Diuinat. Ciceron. 
                     Dice-players should
bee amerced in foure times so much as they
played for. King Edward the fourth of
this Realme decreed, that euerie Dice-player
should be imprisoned two yeres,
and forfeit tenne pound. King Henrie
the seuenth enacted, that Dice-players
should bee imprisoned one day, and
that the keeper of the gaming house
should bee bound to his good be hauiour,
and be fined a Noble. King Henrie
the eight ordained, that euerie one
which kept a dicing house, should pay
fortie shillings, and the players themselues
a Noble, for euerie time so occupied.
Ninthly, this kind of play is odious
and reproachfull, as appeared in

Antonie, to whome Cicero obiected,
that heeCicero Philip. 2. Sueton. cap. 71. 
                     not onely himselfe was a dicer but
also hee fostered such men as were dicers,
                     i 
                     Augustus the Emperour was noted, and
ill thought of for his dicing. Lastly, the despaire
and aduersitie which Dice-players
fall into, and their extraordinarie punishments
be sufficient meanes, to reclaime
and terrifie men from it.
                  In the yeere of our Lord 1550. one
Steckman of Holsatia hauing lost much
money at dice, fell into despaire, and
therewithall killed three of his children,
and would haue hanged himselfe, if his
wife had not preuented him. Likewise in
the yere 1553. one Schetrerus playing
at dice in an ale-house neere to Belisan,
a towne in Heluetia, blasphemed God.
Wherupon the diuell came in place, and
carried him away. Also, my selfe haue
knowne a wealthie yeoman, that was as
great a dicer, as any other in that shire
where he dwelt, and (I thinke) had gotten
wel-nigh a thousand pound by that
his occupation: but what became of him
and his wealth? marrie, he bathing himselfe
in a riuer, was sodainely drowned:
and his sonne, to whom his goods after

his death did rightly appertaine, before
3. yeeres were expired, spent al at dice,
and at this day is glad to stand at mens
deuotion. In summe, do wee not commōly
see, that dice-players neuer thriue?
and if perhaps one amongst a thousand
chance to winne, notwithstanding at last
he loseth all, & so may put his winnings
in his ere, yea, and which is worse, hee
hazardeth his soule, which hee ought to
hold more deare then all the world. But
because I haue largely confuted this
vice inIn Commētar. in satyr. 3. & 5. other places, I will proceed to
the other cause of the alteration of commonwealths.
               
               
                  Of superfluitie of apparell, another cause Persi.
of the alteration of Kingdomes.
Chap. 58.
                  IN the beginning of the world, men
were clothed with pelts and skins of
beasts: wherby is to be noted, that they
were become as beasts, by transgressing
the cōmandement of God, touching the
fruit in Paradise. Apparell was not
giuen to delight mens wanton eies, but
to preserue their bodies from the cold,

and to couer their shame. They had no
Beuer hats sharpe on the top, like vnto
the spire of a steeple, nor flatte crownde
hats, resembling rose-cakes. They wore
no embrodered shirtes, nor garments
of cloth of gold. They knew not what
meant our Italianated, Frenchified, nor
Duch and Babilonian breeches. They
bought no silken stockins, nor gaudie
pantoffles. Their women could not tel
how to frizle and lay out their haire
on borders. They daubed not their faces
with deceitfull drugs, wherewith, hiding
the handi-work of God, they might
seeme to haue more beautie, then hee
hath vouchsafed to giue them. They imitated
not Hermaphrodites, in wearing
of mens doublets. They wore no chaines
of gold, nor ouches, iewels, bracelets,
nor such like. They went not clothed in
veluet gownes, nor in chamlet peticotes.
They smelt not vnto pomanders,
Ciuet, Muske, and such like trumperies.
And yet for all that, they farre surpassed
vs in humanitie, in kindnesse, in loue,
and in vertue. Their onely cogitations
were bent to decke the inward mind, &
not the outward body, which is nothing

els, sauing a liuing sepulcher. They knew
that if the mind were humble and lowly,
the raiment for the body must bee euen
so. Euerie seede bringeth forth herbes
according to his kind: as time seed bringeth
foorth time, and tare seede tare.
Such as the heart is, such is the body; if
the heart bee proude, the fruit thereof
will be ill weedes, and proud attires. But
why is the earth & ashes proud? to what
end will our fine apparell serue, when
death knocketh at out doores, and like a
theefe in the night surprizeth vs vnawares?
Our yong gallants, when they
hire a chamber in London, looking daily
to bee sent for home by their parents,
will neuer trouble themselues with any
charges or garnishing it, as otherwise
they would doe, if they were assured
longer to continue in it. And what, I
pray you, is the body, but a chamber lent
to the soule, wherehence it expecteth
continually to bee sent for by God our
heauenly father, and (as Saint Paul speaketh)
to bee loosed, and to be with Christ?
For what cause doe wee take such care
to apparell the body, seeing within a
while after it must putrifie, and returne

to the dust of the earth, from whence it
came? what reason haue wee to neglect
the soule, which neuer dieth? why do we
not follow King Henrie the sixt of this
Realme, who when the Earle of Warwicke
asked him wherefore hee went so
meanely apparelled, answered, It behooueth
a Prince to excel his subiects in vertue,
and not in vesture? Let vs call to remembrance
the wife of Philo, the Iewish
Philosopher, who wisely answered one
of her gossips, that demaunded of her,
why she went not (as other matrons) attired
in pretious garmēts: Because (quoth
shee) I thinke the vertues of my learned husband
sufficient ornaments for me. Whereto
consenteth that of the Comick:Plautus in Mostellar. z In
vaine doth a woman goe well attired, if shee
be not also well manered. But what neede
I spend time in producing of examples,
when our Sauiour Christ scorned not to
weare a coate without a seame? Which
kinde of apparell if a man now-a-dayes
vsed heere in England, presently,Persius in fin. satyr. 5. 
                     one
of our fine Caualeers would laugh at him,
and prize both him and his apparell, scant
worth a hundred farthings. Oh, what a
shame is it, that euerie seruing-man in

England, nay, euerie common Iacke,
should flaunt in silkes and veluets, and
surpasse Gentlemen of worship! I haue
knowne diuers, who would bestow all
the money they had in the world, on
sumptuous garments; and when I asked
them howe they would liue heereafter,
they would answere: A good marriage
will one day make amends for all; thereby
implying, that they hoped to inueigle
and deceiue some widow or other.
Which pretence of theirs being frustrate,
they will bee driuen to commit
burglaries and murthers. In respect of
which inconueniences, I exhort euerie
man to liue according to his vocation,
and to obserue her Maiesties decrees
and proclamations, whereby Caualeering
groomes, and dunghilled knaues,
are straightly prohibited to weare the
same sutes and apparell as Gentlemen
                  
                     Obiection.
                     God hath created al things which are
in this world for mans vse: therefore any
man may weare cloth of gold, siluer, or
such like.
                  
                  
                     
                     Answere.
                     True it is, that God made all things in
this world to be vsed of mā; but herein I
must distinguish men: some men be noble,
some ignoble. There is no reason,
why cloth of gold, permitted onely to
Noblemen, should be equally permitted
to earth-creeping groomes. And again,
God hath appoynted men not sole cō
                        manders,
but bailies of his goods & creatures,
with condition, that they giue an
account of the vtmost farthing of the
same. And in this regard Noblemē may
gorgeously attire themselues, so long as
they clothe the needie and distressed
members of Christ. But if Noblemen on
the contrary, clothe themselues sumptuously,
without reseruing meanes to furnish
the poore members of Christ, then
will the Lord at the great day of iudgement,
pronounce this fearefull doome against
them,Mat. 25. 
                        Depart frō me, ye cursed, into
eternal fire: for I was naked, & ye clothed
me not. To knit vp this briefely, I say,
that God created al things for his owne
glorie, and to take occasion to extoll
him, but not for our pride, to abuse them.

                  Of the conseruation of a commonwealth.
Chap. 59.
                  THere be many means to preserue
a commonwealth; but aboue the
rest these ten are of most efficacy.
The first, and chiefest is to liue
vprightly in the feare of God. The second,
to make no delay in executing of
attainted and condemned persons. The
third, to suffer euery man to enioy his
owne, and not lauishly to spend & rake
the priuat inhabitants goods. The 4. to
haue a great regard of mischiefs & euils
at the first budding, how small soeuer it
be, forAristot. li. 5. Polit. cap. 8 
                     the corruptiō, that creepeth in by little
& little, is no more perceyued, then small
expenses be, the often disbursing wherof vndoeth
the substance of a house. And as great
rayne & horrible stormes proceed from
vapours and exhalations, that are not
seene: so alteration & changes breed in
a commonwealth of light and trifling
things, which no man would iudge to
haue such an issue. The fift means is, that

Magistrates behaue themselues mildly
and modestly towards their inferiours.
The sixt, that Princes bee not partiall
in their subiects factions. The seuenth,
the Prince & his Coūcell must not giue
care to euery tale and crafty deuice:
for it may be, that the enemy hath his
intelligence in the realme. The eight, to
cast out Heretickes and Schismatickes
frō amōg the people. The ninth, to muster
& traine the people once a moneth
in martiall affaires. The tenth is, to discard
stageplayes, vsury, extorsiō, bribes,
and such like abominable vices.
               
               
                  Of Taxes and Subsidies.
Chap. 60.
                  
                     Tacitus lib. 4. Histor. 
                     THe peace and tranquillity of a commonwealth
can neuer be had without
souldiours, nor souldiours without maintenance
& pay, not pay cā be purchased without
taxes and subsidies, which are the lawfull
reuenewes of the Prince to maintaine
his Realme. But, thou wilt say,
taxes and subsidies bee for the common
good of the Realme, & not for the Princes
maintenaunce. To which I answere,
thatCaluin. lib. 4. Instit. c. 20 
                     the Prince may likewise vse taxes

and subsidies to his priuat royalty, which
is after a maner conioyned with the honour
of the Princely state, that hee beareth.
How is it possible for a Prince to beare
a stately port, vnlesse hee hath sufficient
reuenewes? Let therefore all true hearted
subiectesMat. 22 
                     giue vnto Cesar that
which is Cesars:
                     Rom. 31 
                     tribute to whome tribute
belongeth: and custome to whome custome.
Without this ground we had long since
been a pray vnto our enemies. The Scots
would haue swalowed vs vp. The Spaniards
also would haue triūphed & cruelly
massacred vs, as they did the poore
Indians. None but wizards and niggards
will seeke to be exempted from contributions,
& shake off the necessary yoke
of obedience. Experience layeth downe
before our eyes the successe of them,
that grudge and rebelled against their
Prince for taxing. The beginnings
haue beene vngodly, and the ends miserable.
                  In the yeere of our Lord 1381. the
cōmons of Kent & Essex, to the number
of threescore thousand, rebelled against
king Richard the second beyng their
Soueraigne: but they were discomfited,

and the most part of them sharply punished.
Likewise in the yeere 1484. a
great commotion was moued by the
commons of the North, by reason of a
taxe, which was imposed vpon them of
the tēth peny of all their lands & goods.
But their rash attempt was speedily broken,
and their ringleaders hanged at
Yorke.
                  By this wee see the miserable issue of
all such rash reuoltings, and therewithall
consider, how detestable they are in the
sight of God, Let therfore al subiects patiently
endure whatsoeuer subsidy is leuied,
and night & day beseech the Lord
to graunt thē peace, whereby their taxes
will become shortned.
               
               
                  Remedies against sedition and priuy
conspiracies. Chap. 61.
                  THe plaisters, that are to bee applied
vnto sedition, be diuers, according to
the causes therof. Yet notwithstāding, I
will epitomize and draw some of them
into a breuiary. First, the Prince must
betimes forethinke to alay the seditions,
which beginne to kindle. For euery mischiefe

at first is soone cured, but being
let alone, and taking farther roote, it gathereth
more strength. Secondly, the
Prince must by espials know, who
slaūder or speake euil of him. Howbeit,
respect must be had, lest the innocent be
iniuried. Thirdly, the Prince must proclaime
rewards to the reuealers of conspiracies.
Fourthly, the Prince must aforehand
remoue munitions and artilleries
out of the way, & put them in safe
custody. In so doing he shall find the seditious
the more tractable. Fiftly, the
Prince must seuerely punish the authors
of sedition,Cic. ad Brutū. 
                     lest they, that come after, go about
to imitate such wickednesse. Sixtly, the
seditious must be sundred by some policy
or other. Seuenthly, the seditious must
be allured with ambiguous & doubtfull
promises. Eightly, the Prince must diligently
looke, that his loyall subiects cō
                     municat
not with the seditious, forComi
                           •
                         naeus li. 1 cap. 9. 
                     such
communing together at such times, and in
such sort, is very daungerous, especially for
the party, that is like to take the foile. Ninthly,Lipsius li. 6. Polit. cap. vle.
the Prince must * send men of honour
and dignity vnto the rebels vnder pretence
of reward, to the intent, that their Captaines,

who desire innouations, may be
withdrawen from them.
               
               
                  Of the felicity of a commonwealth.
Chap. 62.
                  THe felicity of a commonwealth is,
when by some Diuine prouidēce frō
aboue, there meeteth in one person the
right maiesty of a Prince, and the mind
of a wise Philosopher. For then needeth
no cōpulsion, no rigour, no extremity
to bridle the subiects, what is more
delightfull, then to see the true image
of vertue in their visible Prince? then
to heare the wise lessons and golden
speeches issuing out of such a mouth?
Happy, I say, is the Realme, where the
Prince imitateth the order of an expert
Phisicion, who whē the remedies, which
he prepareth to cure the weakenesse of
the inferiour members, encrease griefe
in the head, he throweth away all infirmities
most light, and with the fauour of
time, hee proceedeth carefully to the
cure of that, which necessarily importeth
the health of the patient or commō
                     wealth.

                  Of warres. Chap. 63.
                  BEcause * a Prince ought to be prouided
against all chaūces as well of warre
as of peace:
                     Iustinian. in Prolegomen. Institut. it will not bee amisse,
if I write somewhat of warrelike
affaires. The original whereof in my
opinion proceeded fromGen. 10 
                     Nemrod the
iolly hunter before the Lord. The Graecians
inuented first of all the vse of armour.
And the Almaines deuised in the
yeere of our Lord 1381. gunnes being
the most terrible engines of al others.
                  Now touching the causes and effects
of warre, doubtlesse, God seing that no
benefits could fructifie, nor threatnings
disswade vs from our disobedience, sendeth
warre, as his fearefull instrument
to rouse vs frō sluggishnes, & to plague
vs for our manifold iniquities: according
to that dreadfull alarum, which
long since hee sounded against vs.Leuitic. 26. 
                     If,
quoth he, you wil walke in my ordinances,
I will send peace in the land: but if you will
not obey me, but despise my cōmandements,

I will send a sword vpō you, that shall auenge
the quarrell of my couenant, and you shall be
deliuered into the hands of the enemy. This
the Spaniards of the Island saint Maries
knew & felt this last Summer, being the
yeere of our Lord 1599. insomuch as
when two English ships, and one ship of
Amsterdame had taken the said Island,
and the Generall had demaunded the
Spanish Gouernour, wherefore hee
yeelded so soone? Hee answered, that
the sinnes of the inhabitants were great,
and therefore it was bootlesse for them
to resist.
                  As for the discommodities of warre,
they be infinit: it treadeth vnder foot the
lawes of God and man: it maketh the
Church to be derided, and placeth tyrants
in the throne of Iustice. In conclusion,
warre enduceth many malecontēts
to follow the importunity of the time,
and breedeth pestilence and dearth: for
victuals spent, dearth must needs ensue.
Whereupon sundry infectious diseases
spring.
               
               
                  
                  Whether it be lawfull for Christians
to make warre? Chap. 64.
                  ALthough the Marcionists haue heretofore
doubted, whether Christians
might make warre? yet notwithstanding,
I wil by forcible reasons maintaine
the contrary. First, it is written, that the
Israelites should warre against their enemies,
andDeu. 20 
                     not faint, nor feare, nor be amazed,
nor a-dread of them. Secondly, lawfull
warres are named2. Paral. 20. 
                     the battels of the
Lord. Thirdly,Exo. 15 
                     the Lord himselfe is a mā
of warre. Fourthly, Saint Iohn Baptist
confirmeth the lawfulnesse of warre in
these wordes, which he spoke vnto the
souldiers:Luc. 3. 
                     Do no violēce to any man, neyther
accuse any falsly, and be content with
your wages. Fiftly, Cornelius a Captaine
was so fauoured of God, thatAct. 10 
                     he receyued
the holy Ghost. Sixthly,Rom. 13 
                     the Magistrate
carieth not the sword in vaine. Seuenthly,
it is lawfull for any man to defend
himselfe. ForCic. pro Milon. 
                     reason teacheth, that
it is lawfull to repell force offred to our liues
and to our persons, with force. To conclude,
it is lawfull for one people to assault

another, so that it it bee either to
get their owne againe, or els to punish
reuolters. Howbeit neuerthelesse, I
counsell warre to be practized as a last
and desperat medicine, which without
very vrgent occasion ought neuer to be
applied.
               
               
                  What warres be most lawfull.
Chap. 65.
                  
                     Liuius lib. 9. THose warres be most iust, whereto we
are constrained; and with good cōsciēce
may we take armes, when there is no safet
                        ••
                     
for vs, but in armes. To this an anciet Bishop
subscribeth, saying,
                     Ambr. li. 3. Offic. That fortitude,
which defendeth a mans countrey from
forrayne enemies, or sustaineth the desolat
and oppressed, is perfect iustice. Moreouer,
                     Caluin. lib. 4. Institut, ca. 20.the holy Ghost by many testimonies
of Scripture declareth such warres to bee
lawfull.
                  The iniury, which is done to Ambassadours,
ministreth lawfull cause for
Princes to take armes in hand. Therefore
K. Dauid made war with the Ammonits,
for that they villanously misused
the messengers,2. Sam. 10. 
                     which he sent to comfort
the yoūg king of Ammō for his fathers death.
                     
Most iust likewise was that warre, which
king Richard the first of this Realme
made with the Infidels for the recouery
of the holy land. And surely it is a meritorious
and religious deed, that Christian
Princes should vnite their forces
together, and proclaime warres against
the Trukes, who to their great shame
haue now welnigh conquered all Hungary,
& are at the very gates of Germany,
and consequently or all Christendome:
this peril how long soeuer it is de

                     ferred,
doubtles is like to happen. Suppose
our Christian Princes could do no
other good, but keepe back the Turkes
forces from further inuasions, would not
this be a meanes to restore and reuiue
the dismembred estate of Christēdome?
Yea certainely. To that end I constantly
auerre, that it is lawfull to warre: prouided
still, that the determination be not
to put to death any, that will be brought
to the true knowledge of the Gospell.
For it is not with swords, but with words,
not with constraint, but with cōference,
that misbeleeuers are become conuerted.
               
               
                  
                  That before we begin warres, preparation
is to be made of sufficient
necessaries thereto belonging.

kinds of calamities.
                  Hauing forethought of prouision, it is

also necessary, that men should bee mustered
and chosen out. ForXenoph. li. 1. Paedt. Cyr. 
                     if there be a
mighty hoste of men in the field, what towne
or countrey is not willing to welcome them?
In like maner the Captaine generall
must forecast, whether horsemen would
serue his turne better then footemen?
                  
                     This question being well discussed,
the Generall must take aduice with his
chiefe and wisest Lieftenaunts concerning
the successe of the warres. For
                     Luc. 14what King going to make warre with another
King, sitteth not downe first, and taketh
counsell, whether he be able with ten thousand
to meete him, that cōmeth against him
with twenty thousand? or els, while hee is
yet a-great way off, he sendeth an ambassage,
and desireth peace?
               
               
                  The dueties of a Generall.
Chap. 67.
                  IN a Generall seuen things are required.
First, that he be religious and deuout:
for thē if he with Iosuah say,Iosu. 10 
                     Sunne,
stay thou in Gibeon: and thou Moone, in
the valley of Aialon: the Sunne wil abide,
and the Moone will stand still, vntill he

be auenged vpon his enemies. Secondly,
a Generall must be a man of authority,
by reason thatCic. pro lege Manili. 
                     nothing is more auailable
in the ordering of battels, then authority.
Thirdly, he ought to be temperate:
for how can he gouerne others, that cannot
rule his owne affections? Fourthly,
he must be well experienced, that he
may see how the enemy lieth, what
way is best, eyther to prouoke the enemy,
or to defend himselfe. Fiftly, a Generall
must be witty and well spoken,
because souldiers minds will be sooner
inflamed to fight by sweet exhortations,
then by all the trumpets in the world.
Sixtly, he must be couragious and valiant,
that he maySilius Italicus lib. 1. 
                     giue the first onset, when
any bickering is at hand, and shew the way
to others. Lastly, a Generall ought to be
very well seene in Philosophy, & specially
in Geometry, otherwise he will neuer
be able either to incampe himselfe,
to find out the enemy, or to cōceiue the
scituation of places: as for example, how
the champion fields are couched together,
how the valleys hang, how broad
the marishes be, & how the mountaines
are lift vp.
               
               
                  
                  Of the choyse of Souldiers. Chap. 68.
                  THere be six notes to discerne a good
souldiour. The first is, that he be an
honest mā. The second, that he be strōg
and valiant. The third, that he be constant
& patient. The fourth, that (if it be
possible) he be a Gentle-man borne: the
reason is, because most commonly he is
more easily trained for the warres, and
will scorne to yeeld himselfe vanquished
to the enemy. The fift marke of a souldier
is, that he be nimble, actiue, and not
of a fat or grosse body, lest like a carters
iade he founder and fal downe. The sixt,
a souldier ought to be chosen from seuē
                     teene
yeeres old to sixe and forty. But
in my opinion elderly souldiers are more
apt & fit to go to the warres, then young
men, by reason that they are lesse mutinous,
and better able to endure.
               
               
                  Whether the straunger or the homeborne
subiect ought to be preferred?
Chap. 69.
                  IF we cōsider the cause, frō whēce proceeded
the late destructiō of Italy, we

shall find, that the calling in of the Switzers
and Frenchmen to aide it, turned
to the desolation of it. Lodowick Sfortia
Duke of Millaine sent for the Switzers
to succour him against the Frenchmen.
But how sped he? Mary, hee was
by his owne mercenaries deliuered prisoner
ouer to Lewis the twelfe, French
king. yea, we read, that the greatest misery,
which euer hapned to the Brittish
nation diuided, was, when Vortiger
mistrusting the peeres of his Realme,
called in the Saxons to helpe him, who
at last cōpelled him to deliuer the chiefest
part of his kingdome vnto them. So
that at length they droue away at the naturall
inhabitants of the countrey. For
which cause the natiue subiect is to be
esteemed, who stādeth not so much vpō
his valour & pay, as vpon his loyalty &
reputation. Besides, no man is so barbarous
& sauage, as to take part with strā
                     gers
against his owne countreymen.
               
               
                  How the enemy is to be vanquished.
Chap. 70.
                  WE must obserue twelue rules, before
we discomfit our enemies. Wherof

the first is, that wee aske forgiuenes of
God for our misdeedes, and feruently
beseech him to goe before our armie.
The second is, that the Captaine Generall
forbid all blasphemies, swearing, dicing,
rioting, and such like impious doings.
The third, that none but wise men
beare office in the campe. The fourth
way to ouercome the enemie, is to bee
well prouided of necessaries. The fift,
Captaines must not enuie one another.
The sixt, niggardly and corrupt officers
must bee seuerely punished. The seuenth,
our warriours must make no long
delay in the enemies country: especially
if the climat therof be contagious and
noysome. The eight meanes to obtaine
the victorie ouer our foes is, not to permit
any to straggle abroad and rob, lest
meeting with ambushes, they bee vnawares
surprized. The ninth, Marchants,
on paine of death, must not transport any
newes, prouision, or commodities into
the enemies coast. The tenth, valiant
men must bee nobly recompenced for
their aduenturous acts. The eleuenth
rule, to haue a fresh supply alwaies at a
becke; and for that purpose, some of the

best experienced Captaines must be left
behind, to conduct the rawest sort, and
to traine them vp in martiall discipline.
The twelfe and last obseruation is, that
all transgressors be rigorously chastised,
to the terrour and ensample of others.
               
               
                  The Conclusion, of peace.
Chap. 71.
                  LEst for treating of Martiall affaires,
I bee either termed a fauourer of
contention, or else a simple dizart, as
hauingCicero. lib. 2. de Orator. 
                     neuer as yet seene the enemie in
the face, no not so much as their tents:
heere voluntarily I resigne my crest, I
lay downe mine ensigne. In regard
whereof, I demaund an oliue branch,
the onely true and vndoubted token
of peace. The reason that thus mooueth
mee, is our owne safetie: for if wee
should doe nothing but fight and enter
into skirmishes, in the end,Seneca in Hercule fureate. 
                     our fieldes
would remaine without village, and the ashes
of our burat houses as a graue would couer

our dead corps. Who knoweth not, that
peace is the end of warre? peace therefore
must bee established betimes.Aeliā. li. de natur. animal. cap. 3. 
                     All
things are sodered together through vnitie,
but disseuered through discord. The
Realme of France is a liuely spectacle
hereof, which being of late yeeres hackt
by the leaguers, as it were into mammocks,
became wel-nigh a pray vnto
the Spanish king. But now being vnited
againe, shee recouereth her former
strength.
                  Wherefore, O Souldiour, lay downe
thy Musket and Armour, and say not
with the Poet:Homer. lib. 3. Ili
                           •
                        d. 
                     I haue as yet long speares,
round shieldes, head-peeces, and glistering
cuiraces. Oh, seeke not to defile thy
handes in thy brothers bloud. Forgiue
thine enemie, euen as GOD forgiueth
thee. Hearken (I pray thee)
what the Apostle sayth,Rom. 12. 
                     If it bee possible,
as much as in you is, haue peace with all
men. And againe,Colos. 3. 
                     Let the peace of GOD
rule in your hearts, to the which ye are called
all in one body.
                  
                  Finally, to end this discourse, and
therewithall my booke, I conuert my
speech vnto thee, O Lord of Hostes,

humbly from the bottome of my heart
desiring thee to saue vs from the furie of
our enemies, and to sende vs peace in
Christ Iesus, to whom with thee and the
holy ghost, for this which I haue written,
and for all other benefites receiued,
I yeelde all praise, honour,
and glorie.
Amen.
                  If I haue done wel, & as the matter
required,2. Macc. 15. it is the thing that I
would: if I haue spoken slenderly
and barely, it is that I could.

            Thomas Iames Master of Arts, and Fellow of
New Colledge in Oxford, to Master Vaughan
the Author of the Golden-groue moralized.
            WHilst brothers liue, as brothers they must loue,
            As thē one wōb, so they one mind must beare.
            This Vaughan shewes in this his Goldē-groue,
            In this his learned worke without compare.
            Two Brothers like two feete so well they goe,
            Or like two mariners together row.
            The soyle which hath these louing brothers bred,
            Was euer held a soyle of great account,
            Here Brute of yore his golden time had led,
            Whose bruit and fame vnto the skies did mount:
            Whose noble seede amongst his issue sowne,
            Hath made the Britaines through ye world wel
            Known for great soldiers, & resolued mē (known
            Known for their loue to learning and the Arts;
            As these two brothers on the worldes Scene,
            Approu'd of late by their true acted parts:
            
               
The other by his pen deseru'd the same.
            His pen was siluer, but his head of gold,
            That could so much in so few lines containe;
            That in three bookes could all things so vnfold:
            (If all bee three, as learned writers sayne)
            Of metals, gold the purest is esteemd;
            Of our late writers, thou as best art deemd.
            The Muses hire is not well ratified:
            (Such is their fare in these accursed daies)
            But of thy Brother be thou gratified,
            Heele pay thee loue, as thou dost pay him praise.
            For both your meeds let goldē groues abide,
            And after death you golden wreathes betide.
