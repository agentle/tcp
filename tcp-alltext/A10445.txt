            TO THE READER.
            
               THE more worthie of loue and
honor, that the
nature of Truth
is, the more shamefull
without
doubt, and hatefull it must be, to doe
any violence vnto it. For, where more
occasions are offered, to staie men from
their euill purposes, there to passe the
bondes of rightuousnes, it proueth a
greater impudencie. As for example,
in young ladies, whom cōplexion hath
made bewtifull, and lacke of brothers
onlye heires, and good education worthie
of all praises, and pure loue of holines
hath perswaded to contynue virgins,
if any act dishonorable, or vile rape
be committed, what straunger is so
vnkind and far of from the countrie
or sight of that person and vertue,
which but hearing only of her iniurie,
doth not rise in his hart, againste the

worker of it. But, what virgin euer
was there, so faire, so princelie, so noble,
so chast, and so without all spott,
as Truth? And what greater vilanie
can be practised, then by dissimbling,
lying, slaundering, & blind reasoning,
to go about to defloure such a vertue?
Surelie, yf those eyes and iudgementes,
by which spirituall bewties are considered,
were as generallie and cōmonlie
in mens heades, as the bodilie eyes are,
which iudge of colours, it would offend
the gentell bloude and hart, a thowsand
tymes more, to see the truth abused,
then to behold a Lucretia (yf you
will) of their familie violentlie to be
taken of some villane, and constrayned
to serue hym at his pleasure. But, so
greate and greauouse is the plage,
which thorough Adam his disobedience
falleth vpon euery soule, our education
allso and conuersation is so carnall
& corruptible, by reason of grosse

and sensible thinges, with the which we
are so well acquaynted, that a blowe
geauen vnto some worshipfull frinde
of ours, or a fowle worde and opprobrious
spoken to the face of our naturall
Prince, doth more frett the hart
with compassion or indignation, then
when we heare it readen neuer so plainelie
and treatablie, that: Pilate then
toke Iesus and whipped him.
               10. 19. 
               And
the souldiars, platting a crowne of
thornes, dyd put it on vpon his
head, and set a purple robe abowt
hym. And thei came to hym, and
saied: Haile, o kyng of the Iewes,
and thei boxed and buffe
                     •
                  ed him.
After which sort, yf but a cusson of anye
Christian Prince in the world▪
should be ordered of his tenantes and
seruantes at this present, what exclamations
would we make, and what
detestations would we cōceiue against
them? There is not vndoubtedlie, ther

is not, that zeale for the truth it self,
which is vttered in defence of playne
vanitie: and God most allmightie and
glorious, is not so attentiuelie considered,
as a man, or a mase, or a badge
onlie vpon the sleeue, which are nothing
in comparison. For defence yet
of which thinges so small, how greate
angers and stomakes are taken, and
how much is he cōtemned in the world,
which dissembleth an iniurie in such
matters? And in deede, allthough the
thinges them selues are but simple, yet
the truthe is in them allso, moderatelie
to be folowed, and in right iudgement
it were not to be suffered, that either
officers, either orders, should be freelie
disgraced: how much more iustlie then
are the sacramētes & the auncient maners
of the Catholike faith, to be considered
of all sober heades, and maintayned
in all humilitie, and if truth in
wordlie and common matters be embraced

of euery honest man, whi is the
euerlasting veritie, and cause of owr
sowle, which should be chiefest, either
not sought for, when it is easelie to be
fownd, either els not cared for, when
it is euidentlie perceaued. Hath he
(trow you) a good iudgement or a noble
hart, which either affecteth ignorance,
and wil not turne ouer the leffe,
least he should haue a conscience of
the truthe once knowen, either being
conuinced by euident reason, that his
forfathers beleiued well and trulie,
doth thinke that diuines onlie haue to
thinke of such matters, and foloweth
outwardlie the fond and newfound
brothers? Or thei, which reade the bokes
of both sides, and either through
lightnes and vanitie doe beare awaye
no more then the phrase and maner of
writing of the authors, either for malice
and enemitie, consider onlie how to
find faultes with the writer, doe thei

shew therein, anye point of great witt
and grauitie? And so, whiles some
thinke, and those I feare no young babes
or beggars, I hold with Christ
whom all confesse, and further if
I should consider the question, I
might be made, to my cost, a papist:
and others saie priuilie, in deed
the old religion is best, when all is
done, but we must beare a litle
with the world: further when on other
sort reporteth, it is smoothelie
done, or he paieth his aduersarie
home, or he runneth lyke oile, or
he byteth lyke vineger: and finallie
whiles others saie, directing their eye
not to the matter, but against the author,
that, herein he declareth litle
good nurture in not belording some
person, or he misseth in congruitie
of speach, or he telleth old
dreames and stories, or he iesteth
and dalieth all togeather: the conclusion

is, that verie few do honor the
truth, or seeke ernestlie for it. For,
thei which refuse to be acquainted
with it, or dissimble the knowledge
thereof, doe without all doubt geaue
occasion to disgracing of it. Like as in
court, to make as though you knew
not some notable and worthie Lord,
it is halfe a dishonor vnto hym. And
others, which busie themselues about
wordes and titles, and passe ouer, with
out consideration, the sense of thinges
and the matter, are lyke them which
loke a man in the face, whiles he telleth
them a sadd tale for their profite,
& thinke all that while vpon nothing
els in a maner, but what tailer it shold
be, which made his cote and apparell.
I appeale therefore vnto euerie conscience,
and my selfe I prouoke to the
vttering, and the, (Reader) to the
considering of the truthe.
            It is not inough to reade, but thow

must allso consider, and it litle profiteth
to consider, except it be a truthe
worth the marking. Of the .ij. women,
which striued before Salomō, one told
a long tale, of her dwelling in one house
togeather with her felowe, of her
owne and her felowes childebearing,
of her quicke child taken in the night
season from her side, and the placing
of her companions dead boye in her
bosome, with other such circumstancies
more, to moue perchaunse some affections.
When she had ended: It ys
not so (quod the other woman vnto
her) as thou saiest,
               3. Reg. 3. 
               but thy soune
ys deade, and myne lyueth. But on
the other side, Thou lyest, saieth she,
for my soune ys a lyue, and thyne
ys deade. And thus thei striued before
te kinge. Now, what sentence the
wise Prince gaue, it is commonlye
knowen, as how he called for a sword,
and commaunding the quick child to

be diuided in .ij. partes, sought to find
out thereby, in which of the .ij. women
the naturall compassion ouer her child
would sonest appeare. Which straitwayes
vttering it self brimly, in one of
them, as he wittilie had cōceiued, vnto
her he apointed the quicke child, and
sensiblie dissolued a secrete question.
Of which example, this I thinke, may
be well gathered, that in all controuersies
we goe strayt to the quicke of
the question, and rest not vpon the
by matters. For, in disputing of the
Sacrament of the aultar, and the necessitie
whether some allwaies should
communicate, thou lyest saieth one,
thou blasphemiest saieth the other,
this is an itching folie saieth one, this
is sluttisshe eloquence saith the other,
you playe apishe partes saieth one, you
be like S. George an horsebacke saieth
the other, and this is no litle sport vnto
manie to see, how contrarie sides can

cutt one the other. But this vndoubtedlye
is nothing to the question, how
euen one is with the other. For cōcerning
such odd wordes, as I can not tell
hou thei come in, and serue to the expressing
of affections, so let hym take
heede which vseth them, that thei cō
               sent
and agree with the matter, and
let other be warned, which are the
readers or hearers, not to gape after
such glauncies, which happ now and
then in sadd writing, but to marke
aduisedlye what truth is in question,
and neither by acclamation to the
wordlie proceedinges, neither indignation
against the old faith and Catholike,
to shrinke in anye part from
it. Wich is (me thinketh) to call for
a Salomons sword, and not to sitt still
in iudgement with harkening after
such by phrases, as are not of the substance
of the question. The sharpnes
of which sword will shew, who is the

false harlot, and who is loth to be inwardlie
examined, caring not what
absurditie he permitteth, so that he
be not openlie confounded, and the nature
(as I may saye) of the question
be not espyied. And this, I speake, not
onlye for the indifferent reader his sake,
whom I wisshe to consider the
truth ernestly, but for our ease allso in
this fight with the Protestantes, that
we might come to some peace and conclusion.
For, to the bokes of Catholikes,
which of late haue ben printed,
some of the answers, and the most cō
               mon
are these: It is an vnlerned boke,
it doth not obserue the stiles &
titles which it should doe, it nameth
hym but Master, whom it
should call my Lord, it alleageth
such authorities as we neuer saw,
it reciteth visions which are not
in scripture, it hath false Latin in
it, it is full of skoffes and tauntes.
               
As who should thinke, the argument
were dissolued, if the maker of it were
reproued, for lisping in his vtterance,
or making a wrie mouth vpon his aduersarie.
For, if these were heighnous
faultes, and might in deede be so proued
against the Catholikes, or if there
were not a perfect hatred, which the
holye Prophete boldlye confesseth,Psal. 138 in
louing the persons of his enemies, with
detesting to the vttermost, and defying
all their iniquities, yet a wise preacher,
would not speake at all of them,
or lightlie passe away from such matters,
and go exactlie to the point of the
question, and proue that it toucheth
not the state of his religion.
            Yet I graunt, if a religion were approued
by long vse of all Christendome,
it were inough to tell the people,
that the contrarie is not to be credited:
and thei without more wordes ought
to be perswaded, as bound to folow an

vniuersall authoritie of Catholike priestes
and Bishopes. But when new opinions
are brought furth in to open pulpites,
and thei cōmended by no formar
authoritie, allso when straunge Ghospells
are confirmed by no miracles, but
onlye by naked affirmations, and priuate
interpretatiōs, that this is true,
and this we vnderstād it, or els by no
likelie and probable reasons, by which
the vnderstanding might be sumwhat
directed, it is no honest and indifferent
dealing, that when such their wordes
and argumēts are disproued, it should
be inough for them to answer againe,
you lie, or you iest, or you fauor
not the pure and sincere Ghospell.
I gather by the handeling of other Catholikes,
what I haue to prouide for,
about my owne doings.
            A preacher at paules crosse, (in an
euill houre) prouoked all the Catholikes
in the world, vpon manifold articles,

against him (for part of his lying)
a short confutation was straitwaies
put in writing. which for the shortnes
of it, being easelie copied out, and for
the truth and soundnes of it, liked verie
well of the Catholikes, through
much goeing abrode in to manie places,
and free communicating of it vnto
diuers persons, it cummeth at length
vnto a protestāts handes, which before
that, was desirous of it. Which, (to
the cōmendacion of his zeale vndoubtedlie,
although not of his science) made
with speede an answer vnto it, and
intitled it, An answer in defence of
the truth. &c. Wherin you may note,
how much in a short time the world is
chaunged. For, at that season, simple
and familiar letters of Catholikes, not
framed to such purposes, were out of
hand answered, and put in print. Treatisies
also, which went abrode without
name from frind to frind, were sought

and inquired for curiouslie, and set
furth in print to be considered. Yet
now, when thei are prouoked againe
and againe, to make good the crakes
sett on their Ghospell, thei worke (I
feare) by deceipts and subtelties, and
haue either no answer at all to make,
or that which thei haue made is not
lyked of their fauorers, or els thei will
make so manie wordes and so greate
a worke, that lyke craftie wormes
thei maye couer themselues vnder leaues,
and still mainteine a russhing,
with creeping yet awaye from the taking,
or els thei are not so hott in sprite,
as thei were wont to be. But concerning
that called Defence of the
truth, being sent vnto me by a great
fauorer of the proceedinges, and sent
of verye good will and frindshipp,
that I should be reformed (after his
desire) by it, by considering how the

Papi
                  ••
               es are allwayes repelled, I taried
not long, but made a reply againste
it, the veritie of our cause was so
euident, and the false demeanure of
the aduersarie, that I might well defend
the Catholike, and turne the glorie
of crakers in to confusion. What
I dyd, that it might come in to the
handes of our aduersaries, and find
emong them a direct answer vnto it,
or els a quiet geauing ouer of their
further striuing against the truthe,
allthough it be harmelesse, yet being
needelesse, I will not declare it. Yet,
this I am bold to saye, that thei might
(if thei would) haue done by this boke,
as thei dyd by the Apologie (as
thei termed it) of priuate masse, and
haue set it furth in print with their
answer vnto it, for the glorie of their
religion, and much liberalitie towardes
poore Catholikes, whose writinges

without the author his labors and
charges, full diligentlie thei haue
printed. Which, whether it were
worth the answer, or no, therein let
anye reasonable men be iudges, and let
the truthe be considered, I praie the
(Reader) most hartelye, without respect
of anye my manner of writing.
Not because I am not willing to answer,
to euerye point that thei maye
haue against me, but that the truthe
should be seen the better, when extraordinarie
inuectiues are not intended.
For, (as I haue saied,) I feare,
by the examples of other, lest this will
be their chiefest answer: It is not
worth the answering, it is full of
toyes and fancies. It forgetteth
good nurture in writing. &c. As
who should thinke, that thei (like
gentle doues) had no manner of gall

in their writinges, or as though that
a wiseman might not dissimble an iniurie,
and answer to the matter directlye.
But, be it so, you be patient, quiet,
fairespoken, innocent, harmelesse, you
thinke euill of no man, you praie for
the Pope and the Cardinals, you reuerence
the name of religious folkes, you
know not how to nickname the Papistes,
no bitternes, no skoffing, no vncurteousnes,
is in your preachinges and
writinges espied, and the contrarie vices
are in Catholikes. Forgeaue vs
then, I praie you, these our singular
faultes, considering yourselues, that
you allso maye be tempted. And if a
sharpe word or sentence, allthough it
be medicinable, must not be spoken vnto
you, take awaye all such wordes in
this boke, as may troble your patience,
and let the truthe by itselfe be considered,

and briefelye answer iust obiections.

            Therefor let the truthe be considered,
and the substance of the matter
regarded, that, when preachers and
prelates find fault with our maner of
wrytinge, as though all the boke were
then answered, if they say toyes and
nothing els to be in it, thou (indifferent
Reader) be not so quieted, but
either iudge thou by our doings,3. Reg. 3. whether
we be like Luther and skoffers,
or whether the cause it selfe be not separated,
from the manner and fasshion
of handeling it. For which purpose,
I haue gathered this table, of such
thinges as mislike vs in the maker of
the defence, by which, one maye see

what religion thei be of, and how shamefullie
they abuse their whole countrie.
The end is this, let no honest
man be ashamed of the truthe, let no
protestant belie the truthe, if we defend
a euill cause, there are wittes to
discusse it, and prouing our matters
so euidentlie, why is no more regard
made of them? Yf our Lorde be the
God, folow hym, if Baal be he, folow
hym. Yf we slaunder or misreport our
aduersaries, let the places be noted,
and we shall satisfie them. Yf they haue
not done so with vs, the places are
quoted, we loke for their aunswer.
            That they maye be short and compendious,
I require them to speake to
the questions, and that they maye not
wander in confusion of talke, I haue
brought our obiections in to order.
            They can doe to their countrie at home,
and vs here abrode, no greater

pleasure, (except they would out
of hand returne vnto the Catholike
church) then speedilye and honestlye
to cleere themselues of such matters as
are laied against them, that we maye
haue a further occasion to shew the
weakenes of this new religion, & that
others, which through harkenyng to
the world, and their owne priuate lustes
or opinions, haue neglected the authoritie
of all Christendome commended
to them by longe contynuance,
may with reason beleue rather the Catholikes,
whose wordes shall be found
more truer, & more certaine to build,
or els beware vpon (as thei haue to
mistrust their deuotions) lest in deede
thei be of no religion. For which kynd
of men, if it were not, lesse preuailyng
against the truthe and lesse alteration
would be permitted, but seeing man is
free and master of his owne actions,

thei can be no more then warned, that
thei seeke after truth, and folowe it.
God be mercifull vnto vs, and if he
hath saied it by some of his Prophetes,
vpon vs, that for our synnes sake,
and dishonoring of his exceding greate
name, we shall be caried awaye prisoners
in to Babilon, yet,4. R

Bonus sermo Domini, quem locutus

            A REPLIE AGAINSTE
THE FALSENAMED DEfence
of the truthe.
            
               CAP. I.
               
                  WHETHER M. Iuell, or the
author of the Apologie of
pryuate Masse, haue for
their partes done all thinges
so perfectly, that they
may or shold be defended of those, which
are of the same opinion and faith with
them: in the one syde it may be a questiō,
and on the other, I know it is none at all.
For, as concernyng the folowers of new
religiōs, which beleiue that the true light
ys reueled in these last dayes, they haue to
stryue and labor for them, whom they take
for their Apostells: but the Catholike,
whose faith ys not to finding owt in the
end of the world, he hath not to hang vpon
any one mans authoritie, except he
be such as ys commended by the whole
worlds testimonie. Yet, forasmuch as the
answerer to the Apologie of priuate masse,
beginneth first with the author of that
verie Apologie, I will not by my silence,
be thowght to confesse hym vtterly giltie,

and yet I will not make for him suche
hard shift, and stoute defence, as thowgh
any part of owr cause were lost, if he be
not thoroughly cleared. Therefor to begyn
with yow, which would seeme to defend
the truth, what fault doe yow fynd
with the author of the Apologie of priuate
Masse? Fyrst of all yow reproue him
sharplye, that he bringeth hys owne sense
vnto M. Iuels wordes, and after, so reason
against it, as though it were his meaning.
But, how proue yow this vpō hym? Mary,
the Bishope of Salisburie (say yow)▪
                  He neuer said simplie,Defence. that he should make
no rekonyng of his doctrine, because he was
Bishope.
               
               Trulie neither the Apologie doth simplie
so report of hym.Replie. But his wordes
rather be these: I maruell not a litle, why
yow, being reputed a man of such lerning,
wtterlie refuse to proue the doctrine you teache:
alleaging verie slender causes of your
refusall, &c. Meanyng hys vocation to
so high a Rome, and the place where he
tawght, and the honorable estate of the
audience, and the doctrine authorised by

the realme. Now it is .ij. thinges, to saye,
I refuse to do this, and, I should not do
this. Or els▪ I refuse to do this, and I alleage
my vocatiō for one cause, and, I shold
not do this, because I am a Bishope. For
in refusing and alleaging cause of it, there
ys greater occasion geauen of further
consideration: but in sayng, I should not
do this, because I am a Bishope, there ys
small grace shewed because of so hastie
conclusion. This second kynd of phrase,
ys for them which stand gloriouslie vpon
their honor and estimation, but the first
agreeth euen with such, as are readie to
fullfill their vocation. The one sentence
doth challenge a thing of dutie, the other
emploieth within it a reason and cō
                  ueniencie.
And to be short, the one may
be spoken, mildlye, discreetly, and charitablie,
but the other is vttered (I thinke)
stoutlie, vnwyselie, and presumptuouslie.
Wherefor, Sir, you make the matter worse
by your telling, then it was in the author
his writyng: and yow find fault
with others for misreporting and miscō
                  struing,
prouiding not in the meane while

for your selfe, to vse and shew true dealing.
The Catholike doth not take M.
Iuell to be so folishe, as to thinke that because
he is a Bishope, he should make no
rekonyng of his doctrine: but he marueleth
rather (his lerning cōsidered) that
he would alleage such causes as he dyd,
for the refusall of prouing his doctrine.
And so he may yet still maruell at it.
               But (say you) my Lord Bishope dyd not
saye,Defence. he should not proue his doctrine, but
that he might not well do it without further
licence.
               Wherein truly you do take very much
from a Bishope his libertie,Reply. if he can not
safely cōferr with such as D. Cole is, withowt
obteinyng of licence. And you will
troble allso the coūsell of the realme with
more matters then needfull, if they shall
make so litle of their Bishopes, that they
are not to be trusted, with vsing of their
office, except they first aske leaue and licence.
Yf the Catholikes, which are in
prison, were such greuouse offendars against
the state, that it might be suspected
they would practise all treason, then in

deed, for suertie that none of their religion
might come vnto them, it were not
done vnwyselie to make the restraint generall:
and then might a new Bisshope
doubt perchaunse to conferr with them,
without further licence. But where as all
the fault, which is laied to their charge,
hath no other name but papistrie, and old
religion, M. Iuels doubt was more then
needfull, to refuse the prouyng of his doctrine
without further licence. But it ys
well that you will declare vnto vs, the
rightfullnes of his refusall, and make his
part more probable. Wherein your reasonyng
is this:
VVere it good reason (think you) that a
magistrate at the demaund of euerie subiect,Defence.
should bring reason to proue any law,
publisshed by the prince, to be good? &c.
               
               Neither euery demaund,Reply. neither euery
subiect is to be answered, and God forbed,
that either cardmaker, or tapster, or
fyddler, or peddler, should be permitted
emōg their pottes and packes, to sitt iudges
vpō great Doctours, or reuerend Canons
of generall Councells. Yea trulie, if

either gentlemā or marchant, would captiouslie
and proudlie appose the priest
or curate of his parishe, it were not to be
suffered. But is D. Cole euery man? and
the good and lerned Catholikes, which
continue in indurance, are they no more
to be regarded, then the common sort of
Englishe men? or on the other syde, are
they to be abhorred, as a singular sort of
wicked men? To submitt the iudgement
of the Prince and realme, to the myslykyng
of one wayward subiect, I graunt
with yow, it would be great impeachmēt
to the Princes authoritie▪ neuerthelesse
to defend the iudgemēt, which hath passed
by consent of any Prince, or realme,
it cōmendeth their estimation and dignitie.
But, concernyng waywardnes, hath
D. Cole shewed hym selfe to be such a
one, in his request and letter to M. Iuel?
In deed you speake brodely of hym, and
say that he required a proufe of M. Iuels
doctrine, vnder pretence of lernyng, but
in deed quarelling. But a
                     •
                  ee herein yowr
honest and true charitie. M. D. Cole in
hys first letter to the Bishope, promiseth

by the faith he beareth to God, that he
will yeld so farr as M. Iuel shall geaue him
cause. And he againe in the second letter▪
to M. Iuell, in most hartie and humble
wyse, desyreth hym to geaue eare vnto
his sute, and he speaketh so loulie and
baselie, that it may be wel marueiled, why
such a Catholike would submitt hym selfe
vnto a protestant. Yet this notwithstanding,
you, which see further in other
mens hartes, then you can gather by any
outward signe, dare to speake it, and that
in print, that for all M. D. Coles pretence,
yet in deede, he went about quarelling.
And you speake not onlie for your
selfe, but you would haue other beleeue,
that M. Iuell allso was of the same opinion,The M. of the defence slaūdereth D. Cole, and Master Iuel, bothe.
as though he had therefore made
strange, without further licence, to shew
furth the proufes for his doctrine, because
he had to do with a wayward and quarelling
subiect. Whereof you do fouly
and vnworthely cause hym to be suspected▪
as it doth clearly appeare by his answer
to M. D. Coles first letter. In which
after he had declared the doubt of hys

mynd whether without further licēce, he
might safely geaue a rekonyng of his doctrine,
                     M. Iuell in the answer vnto D. Coles first letter.
                  Not withstanding (sayeth he) for as
much as I am persuaded that you charitablie
desyre to be resolued, I can allso charitablie be
contented &c. to conferr with you herein.
Wherefor truly, Syr, (what so euer you
be) you be much to blame to report in
such sort of D. Cole, as neither by hym
is to be gathered, by the faith he oweth
vnto God, neither to M. Iuell ys persuaded,
as plainely appeareth by his letters.
Yf therefor D. Cole was not in such sense
taken by M. Iuell, as you suppose hym
to haue ben receiued, it is euident that as
you vnderstode not the meanyng of the
author of the Apologie, so lykewyse, you
haue mistaken the mynd and saying of
your Lord of Salisburie. Which maketh
me iustly to doubt, whether you vnderstand
your selfe in such matters, as you
haue enterprysed. As, in an other reason
which you bring for M. Iuell, it may be
partly proued, vntill I procede further.
Your reason is this,
In that he is orderlie called,Defence. to the state of
a Bishope, he is in possession of the truth.

And therefor it were not reason, he shold

                        •
                     e requested first to shew his euidence.
               
               What meane you then,Reply. I pray you, by
possession of the truth? Is the truth so
ioyned vnto the Bishopericke of Sarum,
that he which is sett in possession of the
landes, ys straitwaies placed in the possession
of the truth? And because it is not
so: how ys M. Iuell at this daye more properly
in the possession of the truth, then
he was seuen yeres past, when he was out
of all possession of land? And if seuen yeres
past, he might haue ben required, and
nothing haue doubted, to shew his euidence,
vnto a Catholike Bishope: wh
                     •
                   ys
it against reason that at this daye (for all
his temporall honor) he should do the lyke?
For allthough palace, parkes, reuenues,
seruantes, horses, and such lyke, do make
hym in the sight of the world more
worthyer, yet all the ryches and glorie of
the world, should not make hym, by one
iote, the truer. If the wyll or counsell of
mightie Princes of the world, or yf the
consent of the commons of any realme,
were able to sett the studentes of diuinitie

in the possession of the truth: then,
not only such Princes or such commons
might be called Lordes of the truth, but
allso the truth, which is one in it selfe,
should be oftentymes changed, euen as
their myndes shoulde be altered whiche
are letters and setters of it. But the wysedome
of God hath apoynted a better order.
And he hath geauen vnto his only-begoten
and singularly welbeloued soun
Ihesus Christ, the nations of the world,
as his iust inheretance, which yet is so
geauen of the father, that the soun by his
pretiouse death hath truly & deerly purchased
it. To take therefor the possession
of the world, which he might of right
challenge for his obedience vnto death,
he sent furth his officers and Apostells,
and by his diuine power,How the possessiō of the truthe was geauē, and who be the holders of it at this daye. and shewing of
miracles, he placed those so few and so
simple persons, in the possession of hys
landes, and by sending vnto them all the
giftes and graces of the holyghost, he set
them perfectly in the possession of hys
truth,Io. 16. as it ys writen, when the holygost
cummeth, he shall teach you all truth. Now,

that the possessiō of this truth might not
be lost for euer after, and that, allthough
the Apostells and Disciples should within
few yeares, depart from this world, yet
that such should neuer be to seekyng, as
might hold the possession of truth once
taken, therefor God (which was able to
performe it▪) dyd apoynt in hys church,
some Apostles;
                  Eph. 4. 
                  some Prophetes, some Euangelistes,
other some Pastors and teachers,
vntill all we shall come and meete togeather
in vnitie of faith, and knowledge of the soun
of God. Such therefor as succeed the Apostells
in their faith and places, and such
as haue cōtinued in the possession of the
truth euer sence Christ hytherto, such also
as keepe the Catholike tradition and
priesthode in the most partes of Christendome,
are to be regarded and estemed
as the right heires of the Apostles
and Christ. But if in some corner of Christendome,
the old and auncient Bisshopes
be dryuen out of their places, and if
a new religion be planted .xvC. yeres after
Christ, allthough it should continue
without interruption in that one particular

place vnto the worlds end, yet could
it be neuer rightly saied, to haue the possession
of truth by order. No verely, it
hath not so much as the possession of place
orderly, and much lesse the possession
of the truth. For, I pray yow, what māner
of faith was he of, whom M. Iuell succedeth
in the palace of Sarum? Or what
order can yow number vp, sence England
was Christened, of Bisshopes and Priestes
inspired with the lyke confession of faith,
as now is, for the tyme, vsed? Well Syr
yet agayne, if the order which any one
Realme taketh, be able to settle men in
the possession of truth, and if for the tyme
of that order standyng, no Bishope is
to be required to shew his euidence: how
chaunseth it, that in the disputatiō which
was prepared at Westminster, the catholike
Bishopes, which then were in possessiō,
were not yet permitted to enjoy their
pruilege? Or whi did your Bishopes now,
which then were out of office, refuse to
shew their euidences as thei were required?
As the church of Christ had hundred
of yeares togeather vsed, so dyd the

Bisshopes and clergie of England obserue
and keepe in their seruice and order of
church, what tyme you began to ryse and
reason against them. And whereas it was
sufficient cause inowgh for them to beleiue
and mainteine as thei dyd, because
thei had so receiued of their predecessors
and fathers, whose wysedomes thei had
not to suspect, yet you were not content
with the licence graūted vnto you, of disputyng
with them, but you would allso
apoint vnto them, what order thei should
take in the matter. And for all their possession,
yet you would dryue them to
shew their euidencies. What if thei had
lost their writinges? or could not fynd
them presently? or wold not shew them
to such as you were: ys their silence, or
refusall in that behalfe, to be accompted
for a losse of their cause? But (thankes
be to your Bishoperickes) when you be
now well placed,The heretikes chā
                     ge their argumentes, togeather with the changes of tyme. you are content that
the plaintyfe shoulde first and formost
shew his euidence. And now it ys against
reason, that the possessor should take the
person of a plaintyfe, which, before this

tyme, would not be graūted, whiles your
selfes were out of all possession. But how
say yow, if the Catholikes doe continually
yet keepe their possession? for the
Bishopes of Fraunce, Spaigne, Germanie,
and Italy, are not yet dryuen out of
their chaires and places of the Apostells.
And as long as they keepe their romes,
you can not enter in to the churche, as
it were a house forsaken and destitute.
how then? will you dryue them out by
force, vi & armis? In deede it ys one of
the cheifest wayes, by which the new
ghospel hath proceded, which if you can
not, as yet, folow thoroughly, you must
then, either lett them alone (which you
do not as appeareth by your sermons &
writinges) or els bring furth your euidē
                  ces
against them which be in possession.
But no reason shall preuaile except it
make for you, and therefor you passe not
vpon the possession, which the Catholikes
hold and keepe in the world, but
you wyll dryue them to the prouyng of
such articles as doe offend you, and for
your owne part, you will stand vpon the

negatiue. The resting vpō which, because
you say, it ys mistaken, lett vs heare your
expositiō, how it must be vnderstanded?
M. Iuell (say you) perceauyng vs to make this
auaūt,Defence. that the church hath taught as we doe,
these .xvC. yeares, dyd both wyselie and lernedly
see, that there was none so fytt way to
dryue vs from it: As to rest vpon this
true negatiue, that we haue, no suf
                        •
                     icient
proufe, out of the authorities of scriptures,
fathers, or councells.
But, Syr, how can your wysedome serue
you to think,Reply. that because you will haue
vs to proue our doctrine, therefor we
must do it? Yf euerie Catholike Bishope
in the world, should in his owne conscience
haue mislyked, the vse of the Catholike
church in sundrie articles, yet for
the reuerence, which they owe vnto antiquitie,
they should not without euident
and manifest reason, haue lightly geauen
ouer their old orders, for the strength of
tradition ys so great, that allthough I
could see no reason why I should defend
it, yet I should not contempne their authoritie,
from whom it was receiued. For
lyke as in the Epistle vnto the Romanes

(which epistell traditiō teacheth me to
be S. Paules) I must not blott out euerie
sentence, which vnto my iudgemēt may
seeme either vntrue, either vnprofitable,
but reuerently thinke, that all ys well, allthough
my vnderstandyng be very euill:
so when the churche of Christ doth generallie
receaue and folow a custome, I
ought to iudge the best of it, allthough I
were not able to proue it. To dispute of
that which the whole churche thorough the
world doth vse,
                  August. ad 
                        •
                     anu. epist. 118. 
                  it is (sayeth S. Augustyne)
a poynt of most insolent madnes. Yf therefor
being able to geaue no other reason
for my beleife, then only traditiō, I should
not rasshely depart from it, shall my aduersary
require of me a cause of my doinges
in wryting, and except I shew it owt
of hand, pull me away from my religion?
Lett me suppose that you browght M.
Iuell vnto me, and that he should find
me standing in this poynt of the Catholike
faith, that it ys not of necessitie required
in a Christen man to receiue vnder
both kyndes. What might he, (thinke
you) say vnto me either wysely, either

lernedly agaynst me? you would make
hym, (I know) to speake after this sort,
that I haue no sufficient proufe, owt of
Scriptures, Doctours, or Councells, to
make for me. Yes Syr (would I answer)
and please you, I haue sufficient authoritie
for my beleife therein, but I am not
disposed to tell you of it, and I would not
care to take a blowe for so answering a
Bisshope. Yes Mary (shall he saye) if you
had any, you would alleage it, and except
you tell me of one or other, you shall be
accounted to make only an auaunt, and
in deed to haue nothing. And here, I
trow, if all Catholikes should hold their
peace, in lyke manner as I do, it should
be declared at Paules crosse the next sunday
folowing, that the papistes haue no
one sentence or word to make for them,
in all Scripture, Doctours and Coūcells.
Well Sir then, allthough this be to much
iniury and oppression, because the Catholikes
were not disposed to refell your
negatiue, therevpon to conclude, that
they are able to say nothing: I will yet
goe further with you, and graunt for disputation

sake, that which for truth sake
is to be denyed. And what is that? forsoth
that I haue no other cause in all the
world, for defence of the article which
I mentioned, but only this one, that it
hath very long, and quietly continued.
How say you in this case? wyll you stand
still vpon the negatiue, which for trying
of your wysedome, I graunt vnto you?
And to keepe your negatiue, wil you deny,
that receiuyng in one kynd only, hath
not ben long vsed in the church? No verely,
that can you not doe, because it is
so playne and euident, that receiuyng in
one kynd hath continuance of tyme, and
approued practise of Christendome for
it, that your selues doe crye out and gapple
in pulpites, that many hundred of yeres
togeather before you were breathed
owt in to the worlde, all Christendome,
as in sundrie other pointes, so in that allso
was miserablie deceaued. How then?
you will perchaunse proue vnto me, that
my argumēt is not good, because all the
world hath hytherto ben seduced. And
truly, what other thing you might say, I

can not tell. For when I shold yeld vnto
you that I haue no Scripture, Doctour,
or Councel, for cōmunion in both kyndes,
and when you should not well call
me vnreasonable, for dwelling against
you in that article and opinion, alleageing
the cōsent and vse of Christendome
for me: either you must declare, that reason
of myne to be nothing worth the
staying vpon: or els you must hold your
peace, as hauing no more to saye vnto
me: or els you must repete your begynning
againe, and harpe madlye vpon one
string, in telling me that I can shew no
sufficient sentence, exāple, or authoritie,
why cōmunion should be geauen vnder
one kynd only. Now, as you haue to muche
varietie to harpe still vpō one point,
and as your hart is to great in you to be
tongtyde, so must it remaine that you wil
refell my argumēt, and tell me that I doe
not safelye and wiselie, to haue in regard
and estimation a generall consent of all
Christendome. After which bold saying,
you must come to the particulars, and
shew by councell, doctor, example or

scripture, that the whole church may be
fouly deceaued, and I miscarye in the folowing
of her. At which point if you tell
me of pilgrimages, images, pardons, or
purgatorie (with the misusing or mistaking
of which the church doth neuer beare)
I must answer you, that thei apperteine
to an other tyme, and that you should
more properlie talke of communion vnder
both kyndes, of which our question
is instituted, and of which you make your
selfe sure. In which matter, if you can and
will proue the whole world to haue ben
deceaued: then shall you be dryuen from
the rest vpon your negatiue, and take vpō
you the person of a plainetyfe, in prouing
vnto vs, that one kynd alone should not
be ministred, but both of necessitie receiued.
And if you refuse to doe so, you
shall hold your peace, and hold downe
your head for all your negatiue, which you
thought should defend you, because I put
the case so, that I would graunt you your
negatiue. Wherefor M. Iuells inuention
of his negatiue, hath neither so great wyte
nor lernyng, as you suppose, because

it would neuer serue hym, if the Catholike
should tell hym plainely, either that
he would not, either that he could not
answer hym. Now, as concernyng all this
question of apposing and answering, and
all the shiftes lykewyse, and practisies,
which are conūeighed vnder the name of
negatiues, it should haue becōmed right
well the professors of a new Ghospell,
not to haue made their cheife defence
vpon the weaknes (if any should be) or
behauyor of their aduersaries, but openly
and willingly to haue vttered their good
tydinges: and not to inuent in their writyng
what might greue the aduersary, but
rather to haue takē euery occasion, which
had ben able to edifie. Now, because you,
which haue taken vpon you the defence
(as you call it) of the truth against the Apologie
of priuate masse, doe leaue the
further discussing of these matters, vnto
some other meeter places, I shall be contented
lykewyse to geaue ouer with you,
allthough it would haue done vs no harme,
shortly to haue vnderstāded your iud
                     •
                  gement.
But this much yet is clearly goten,

that whereas it hath ben hytherto auouched,
that the Catholikes had no one
authoritie for their purpose: now yet there
ys come furth a litle Apologie of priuate
masse, conteinyng many good authorities
for the prouyng of the Catholike
faith, which boke, how truly and faithfully
it is answered, it shall appeare after
iust examination and heed taken.
            
            
               The second Chapiter.
               
                  HERE now we are come to
the very matter it selfe, in
which the author of the Apologie,
for auoyding of endlesse
brablyng, thought good to declare
hys meanyng, as cōcernyng the word and
terme, Priuate, when it is applyed to the
masse. And his conclusion is this, that if
you will take the word, priuate, as it is cō
                  trarie
vnto common, so the church hath
no priuate masse. But if a priuate masse
be vnderstanded for a masse in which the
priest receiueth alone, without any imbarring
of other to communicate with
hym: the church in deed doth alow sole

receiuyng. Mary, the terme of priuate is
not properlye hers, but inuented in the
scholes of heretikes. This distinction then
being layed, the master of the defence,
which wryteth against hym, is very much
greaued with his plaine dealing, as one
which could be well cōtent to fight with
his twohandsword, and so to chainge frō
one sense to an other, that he might not
be directly ouercummed. And therefor
in his anger, whereas the Catholike spake
it very sadlye, that the church acknouledgeth
no priuate masse, as priuate is contrary
vnto common, he madlye alleageth:
               That in deed we haue ben very bountifull
in bestowing the benefyte of our masse,Defence.
and especiallie when monie was brought
in abundantly.
               But, may you not be ashamed,Replie. to obiect
that against your aduersaries as their owne
deed and workyng, which you can neuer
fynd wryten in any of their bokes, or
by any of their talkes approued? what
if you can descant vpon diuerse matters,
and make gaye voluntary sport vpon no
laufull dittie, allthough your owne syde

might make you a Bisshope for your singing,
yet, when without all affection the
truth should be examined, all your exceding
melodie, would be found no better
then barkyng. Do you not thinke, that as
many poyntes might be fott vpon tapsters,
fiddlers, peddlers, baggpypers allso
and sowgelders (Syr reuerence) whiche
for idlenes sake do come vnto your ministerie,
and for lacke of better, are receiued
by and by: as you can make vpō such
wretched men, which make merchandyse
of their masses? yf you can proue, that
the church of Christ, doth not teache
her scholars, that the masse is a common
and no priuate seruice: then should you
speake vnto the purpose somwhat, and
be thought to write grauely: but when
you can say nothing to the matter, to
obiect against vs the bestowing of masses
for monie, such as the church neuer alowed,
we can gather no better sense hereof,
then that you can pleasauntly dallie.
And thus much for the first vnderstanding
of priuate Masse. Touching
the other significatiō of priuate, by which

the heretikes haue meaned sole receiuing,
the church doth hold, that the priest
may receiue alone at his masse, if no other
wil cōmunicate with him. Against
which conclusion, what one wyse word
haue you to bring furth? Marie, you find
fault, that the Catholike requireth you
to proue the affirmatiue, which is, that
euerie priest owght, when he receiueth,
to haue a cumpanie to receiue with him,
which is a shift (as you saie) of him that
mistrusteth his quarel. Then further, you
blame hym, that the question being of
priuate masses, he maketh his issue in sole
receiuing. And you aske the question:
               Is there no difference (thinke you) between
sole receiuing and priuate Masse?Defence. doth euerie
one that receiueth alone, saye a priuate
Masse?
               Aske not this question of Catholikes,Reply.
but of Lutherās. For the Catholikes haue
no such priuate masse, as you haue made.
It is the Lutherans inuention, whom it
pleased to call that seruice and office of
the church a priuate masse, in which the
priest receiueth alone. Which office the

church calleth masse, and the Lutherans
nickname it priuate, because of sole receiuing.
The church therefor doth not saie,
that he, which receiueth alone, saieth a
masse, or that sole receiuing and a priuate
masse are all one, but she openlie telleth
you that in deed no masse is priuate:
yet because she hath to doe with heretikes,
and for better expedition of matters
is contended to vse their termes, therefor
the Catholikes of this tyme doe call
that a priuate masse, at which the priest
receiueth alone, which they do not, out
of their owne bokes, but because they
read emong the heretikes, that they haue
such a sense of priuate masse. Wherefor
you haue done verie vnskilfullie to tell vs
of Tully & Panetius, and to require that
we should define priuate masse vnto you,
which haue not ben the inuentors and
first authors of that terme. And if the Lutherans
for the breeding of suspitiō, and
bringing furth of errours, haue so folishly
mengled sole receauing and masse togeather,
that it is proued an absurditie, that
he which receiueth alone, sayth thereby a

priuate masse: lett the shame light vpon
their heades, and not vpon the Catholikes.
And yet for all this you will make vs
beleiue, that we must define a priuate
masse, and whether we will or no, you wil
define it for vs. But it is well yet that you
amend the matter, in saying that you will
shew out of our owne authors (not what
we take, but) what you take our priuate
masse to be.
               It ys a sacrifice of the bodie and bloud of
Christ,Defence. vsed in the church,1 in place of the
Lorde his supper,2 by one priest alone offered
to God the Father for the sinnes of
quicke and dead, which,3 without any to
participate with hym, he may applie to the
benefite of what persons and thinges he
listeth.
               Yf this be the definition o
                     •
                   a priuate
masse,Replie. how will you define (I pray you)
that masse which is called, and is in deed
common? Or where find you in all our
doctors a diuision of masse, in to priuate
and common? here be so many faultes in
this definition, that not only the scholes
of the Catholikes would neuer haue made
it, but not so much as a reasonable

scholars head would euer haue permitted.
first you define that thing (and that
out of our owne authors you lye) which
we do not confesse to be extant, because
we beleiue, that there is no masse priuate.
For you may read in the scholemē of priuate
and solempne masse,D. Th. 
                        •
                     . part. q. 83. art. 5. ad 12. not as it were
ij. kyndes of masses, but at the most .ij. circunstancies
only, and accidentes of masse:
but of priuate and common to make
such differencies, as though the definition
of the priuate were essentially distincted
from the common, it ys such an inuention,
as may well becum perchaunse
your pregnant witt, but it ys not, I assure
you, in the Catholike doctrine. Yet, lett vs
consider the framyng of your definition.
A priuate masse (saie you of your owne
head by the Catholikes) ys a sacrifice. In
deed, if you vnderstand by masse, the offering
of the bodie and bloud of Christ,
so is masse properly a sacrifice: but considering
that you in reprouyng the partes
and ceremonies vsed in the celebration
thereof, and the common people togeather
with you do vnderstand it more largelye,

you should not without some distinction
so absolutelie haue called it a
sacrifice, whereas in the cōmoner sense,
it ys taken for that office or seruice of the
church, not which is it selfe a sacrifice, but
within which there is offered vp a sacrifice.
And therefor if I would not, without
addition, saie, of the masse it selfe which
we hold and defend, that it ys a sacrifice,
(except I would speake figuratiuelie, and
call that which doth conteine, by the name
of the thing which is conteined) how
much lesse would I saie that a priuate
masse is a sacrifice. But you add further
vnto your definition, it ys a sacrifice vsed
in place of the Lorde his supper: which wordes
do sound so strangely, that a Catholike
would neuer vse them, as which beleiueth
that he hath, not any such thing
which is in place of our Lord his supper,
but that vndoubtedly he hath the same
meate, which was geauen to the Apostels
the night before Christ suffered, and that
he enioyeth the selfesame supper in deed.
Againe to make vp your definition, you
saie that it ys a sacrifice by one priest alone

offered to God the father: As who might
thinke, that there were some kynd of masses,
in which more priestes then one dyd
offer vp sacrifice. And againe, these wordes
of one priest alone, were craftely thrust
in to the heape, that thereof might be
gathered some argument of priuate masse.
It foloweth further: which sacrifice without
any to participate with hym he may applie
&c. But why doe you make mention
of participantes with the priest? might he
then, applie the effect of the sacrament,
when any would cōmunicate with hym?
And is this it which greiueth you, that he
may applie it without any to participate?
Who doth not se
                     •
                   (which is a Catholike,
or els but indifferēt and lerned) that you
labor as much as you may to bring in such
phrases by which à priuate masse might
be suspected? for leaue out these wordes
of (one priest alone) and (without any to
participate with hym) there is nothing in
the definition, which might be enforced
to serue for masse priuate. And yet when
thei be added, we do right well know that
thei are not essentiall poyntes of a masse.

Wherefor I might iustly saie, that this definition
of a priuate masse, which you attribute
to the Catholikes, is farr vnmeete
for their lernyng, as being vnproper, hereticall,
superfluous, and wandering. But
for all this, you will proue the truth of
this definition vnto vs, wherein I wonder
at your presumption, that you will attempt
thinges impossible. But yet let vs
geaue you the hearing.
All your sort-doe rasshlie confesse,Defence. and
stoutly defend, that it is a sacrifice of
Christ hys bodie.
But first let me heare of what you speake?Reply.
Did you not goe aboute to define a
priuate masse? And doth all our sort saie
that priuate masse is a sacrifice? How oft
shall I tell you, that we know no priuate
masse? We confesse that in the masse
there is the bodye and bloud of our Sauyor,
and that it is our daily sacrifice, and
that it is offered for quicke and dead.
Yea, but doth one priest alone offer it? Yea
Syr except you thinke it necessarie to haue
more priestes then one to celebrate at
one aultar at one tyme. And doth not the

priest, make application of the Sacrament as
he li
                        •
                     teth? No forsoth, not as he listeth,
neither as you mak
                     •
                   definitions by adding
and taking away what pleaseth you,
but with reuerence and horror, and by
way of supplication and request, he serueth
for some one more then an other,
the vertue of the sacrifice in it selfe considered,
continuing allwaies perfect and
infinite. And be not all these thinges defended
of all your syde? Not these thinges
only, but .xx. other more allso, and yet euerie
one of those .xx. shall not be iumbled
vp togeather in one definition of
masse. But all this while, how proue you
that we define a priuate masse in such sort
as you haue inuented? You might haue
made it probable, if you had said that we
define Masse, after the same manner as
you report (and yet you should haue made
a lye, for all your sight in our authors)
but you can neuer be able to shew, that
we make such definition of a priuate masse,
whereas so expressely we answer you,
that we haue no masse priuate. But it is
to be noted the authoritie, with which

you make your conclusions.
I do therefor (say you) take priuate masse
to be not onlye as you &c haue wrested it,Defence.
but as it was commonly vsed in the world
before, and as it was sett furth in your
scholemen, to the great defacing of Christ
hys death and passion.
Yf you haue any face at all of à true man,Replie.
shew in what place of any scholeman, any
such priuate masse is spokē of as you define.
And I would allso that you had concluded,
whether you will take this word
(priuate) in such sense as by the Lutherans
it is apointed, to expresse sole receiuing.
For allthough you ioyne your issue
with vs, about this definition of priuate
masse which your selfe haue inuented: yet
you will not refuse alltogeather, to take
priuate masse as we do (thorough the occasion
of certen heretikes) for sole receiuing.
Which whether you do, because
you would not seeme to graunt vnto the
Catholikes, that priuate masse hath ben
in the primitiue church (which is cōcluded
easelie, vnderstanding by it sole receauing)
or rather because you would
haue some libertie to hyde your selfe vnder

ambiguities, and thereby to troble
your aduersarie, when he shold not know
where to find you, as I feare them bothe,
so I wil not determyn vpon any one. But
if you mynd to stand with vs vpon that
definition of priuate masse, which you
haue made, we saie that there is no such
thing emong vs, as you do enforce your
selfe to proue owt of owr authors. And
yet if you will put out the word (priuate)
which you neuer lerned of vs, for the rest
we will abyde by all that which the church
hath receiued and delyuered, cōcernyng
our sacrifice, and the value of it, and in
what sense the priest may applie a benefite
proper to some peculiar person.
               And therefor, when you will, begyn, and
you shall be answered: or rather answer
when you can, for we haue allreadie begon.
We, I meane, Catholikes, which
speake in all tonges, that if you find not
our argumentes in Englisshe, yet you may
resort to the Italian, Spaynisshe, French,
Laten, and to the Duch tong. But if now
on the other syde, you will admitt such an
interpretation of (priuate) which word

Luther hath ioyned vnto the masse, as
shall signify and declare sole receiuyng:
then shall we ioyne this issue with you,
that the priest is not bound to haue present
companie to receiue with hym, but
that without all daunger of God his indignation,
he may celebrate a priuate
Masse, as you terme it. &c.
            
            
               The third Chapiter.
               
                  FOrasmuch as M. Iuell with
other, do think thē selues to
hurt our church very much
in their stout deniall, that
there was any masse priuate (as they terme
it) in the primitiue church, the Catholike
therfor in his Apologie, although
he had good authorities to confute that
bold conclusion, yet for the better opening
of their weake kynd of reasonyng,
he so beginneth with them as though it
were true, that there was no ptiuate masse
in the primitiue church. And he seemeth
to make these argumentes for vs.
Not, if there were no priuate masse in the
primitiue church, therefor it must of necessitie

folow, that none might or should be vsed at
these daies. For many thinges were then interdicted,
which now are permitted. And
many thinges were not extant then in the
church, which now are to be maynteined.
Examples hereof may be perceaued in wasshing
of feete,10. 13. Act. 15. Luc. 22. Cyp. ser. 5. de laps. in absteinyng from bloud, in receiuyng
of the sacramēt after supper, in howseling
of infantes, in temporalties of Bishopes,
and Christenyng of Princes. To call therefor
such thinges to the state of the primitiue
church, ys, to inforce a taule man to returne
to his swathing clothes. Againe, men at that
tyme were so well disposed, that it was no wō
                     der
if at euerie masse there were cōmunicantes:
but now there ys such coldnes of charitie,
that if we should allwaies tarie for communicantes,
we should verie seldome haue any
masse at all. Furthermore, the people are not
commaunded, but counselled only to the frequentation
of their housell, but the priestes
are commaunded to celebrate oftentymes.
Therefor it ys no reason, that a dutie should
be omitted, and the priest made to waite vpon
the pleasure of the laitie. And so he shortly
concludeth, that, to prescribe of necessitie,

that there ought to be a cumpanie to receiue
with the priest, it is an itching folie. But
now, against these reasons of the Catholike,
what saieth the M. of the defence?
You would seeme to take from vs,Defence. fo. 8. the true
and right rule to reforme the church of
Christ?
You be verie suspitiouse Syr,Reply. or verie iniurious.
For no other thing was gone
aboute in this third chapiter, but that
all thinges should not be required to be
done, as thei were vsed in the primitiue
church. Which conclusion, do you simply
and plainelie yeld vnto, or els will you
dryue vs to the further prouyng of it?
Nay, you confesse it to be so euident and
true, that you maruell at the Catholike,
because he endeuored to open it. Where
thē is that fault which you find with him?
or what true and right rule of reformyng
the church might he seeme to take awaie
from you? He saied nothing els,An vnreaso

                     •
                  lyke

with hym, because of the speaking
of it. Here now it may appeare, who lurketh
out of the light, or who draweth
back. For, whereas you without distinction
haue abused the name of the primitiue
church, and made so litle rekonyng
of these last .ixC. yeares, and more, as
though you would admit no other thing,
then that which should be proued to agree
with the example of the primitiue
church: what thing is more necessarie to
be spoken of, then that discretion is to
be vsed in this matter, and that all thinges
are not absolutlie to be reduced vnto
the paterne of the primitiue church? For
allthough you, for your owne part, be of
such iudgement, that you can make distinction
betwene thinges necessarie and
indifferēt: yet whē the multitude of light
heades, do heare you to appeale simplie
to the primitiue church, and to crake that
the right and true reformation, ys from
thence to betaken: thei fall in to such a
conceit by and by, that except the Catholikes
can bring all their orders from
the primitiue church, thei will not be ruled

by them. And if I were so suspitious
as you, I could saie that your owne preachers
and masters do seeme to be of the
same opinion, when thei make so exact
rekonyng vpon the tyme, in which orders
haue by holy men ben brought in to the
church, as though nothing were to be
permitted, but that which hath come frō
the Apostles, or that those thinges should
be alltogeather now autētike, which were
vsed in the primitiue church. But if the
Catholike hath ben superfluous, in prouing
of that which no man (as you saie)
hath denyed, if you wyll charitablie forgeaue
hym this once, he shall within the
turnyng of one leaffe in your defence, do
the lyke again for you. And now (I trow)
we do agree in this one poynt, that for
ceremonies and thinges indifferent, we
are not bound vnto the Apostells tyme.
In what thinges then are we bound to do
after the example of the Apostels, and
the primitiue church?
               In truth of doctrines and right vse of sacramētes,Defence fol. 10.
as thinges in the church most necessarie.
               
                  And you doe alleage this cause of your

so saying: In doctrine there is but one veritie,
and but one right vse of the sacramentes.
               If I were able precisely to know,Replie. what
you meane by the right vse of Sacramentes,
I could sone answer you, how
farfurth we agree with you in this part
of your distinction. For to receiue in the
morning or euening, to receiue fasting
or after meales, and to receiue with cumpanie
or alone, they be such thinges as
you may, at your pleasure, vnderstand by
the right vse of the Sacrament, or saie to
disagree from the right vse of it.1. Cor. 11. For in
S. Paules tyme emong the Corinthians
they vsed to receiue at night about supper
tyme, and they made no matter of
conscience, if they had dined that daie
before. And you can not saie, but, notwithstanding
the breaking of their fastes,
or takyng of their suppers, they dyd
in that beginnyng of the church, rightly
vse the Sacrament. Yf therefor the vse of
the Sacrament, ys to be taken for that
manner and order which they rightly vsed
at the begynnyng in receauyng of the
sacramentes, I denie vnto you, that the

right vse of them, is to be accompted emong
preceptes and lawes vnchangeable.
For the right vse is but one (you saie)
and therefor lyke as thei of the Apostells
tyme, dyd sitt togeather in the church about
euening, and receiue, either after or
before other meates, Christ his verie naturall
body: so should we do now of necessitie
in these daies, or els we vse not
the sacrament rightly. To which case, if
you will answer, that tyme, place, and
maner of supping with common meates
(which then were vsed) do nothing apperteine
to the right vse of the sacramēt,
so shall I againe inferr, that number of
communicantes, and receiuing in one or
both kyndes, are as litle required to the
right vse of the sacrament. Therefor, to
auoid the occasion of stryuing, which
could not but be geauen if one part vnderstanded
not the other, our meanyng
is this, that in the articles of our faith and
necessary doctrine, we haue to keepe one
veritie, which hath ben from the begynnyng:
but in canons and orders which haue
ben added sence, vnto the substance of

our religion, the church of Christ is not
so straictly bound vnto them, but that she
may, with discretion, abrogate, or alter
them, or permit the discontinuance of
them. And in this kynd of orders we vnderstand
the vse of the sacramētes, which
in substance are to this daie one with those
of the primitue church, do thei neuer
so much differ in ceremonies, circunstancies,
and manner of vsing them. We do
not therefore graunt vnto you, that the
right vse of the sacrament ys but one, or
that the vse of a sacrament is in the same
authoritie and estimation, as the truth of
doctrine is. For he which receiueth alone
(if he be in state of grace) doth well, and
he which receiueth with cumpanie doth
wel, if his liffe be cleane. And then againe,
a conclusion in doctrine can neuer be remoued,
but in receiuing of sacramentes,
diuers vses may be permitted, except you
doubt, whether both parties should be
thought baptised a right, of which the one
were but once dipped, the other thrise
wasshed and perfunded. Wherefore the
vse of the sacramentes being▪ with vs a

thing indifferēt in it selfe, (allthough not
indifferent vnto euerie rasshe controller)
you speake very absurdly vnto our iudgementes,The intricate talke of the M. of the defence.
first in not bynding vs vnto the
obseruations of ceremonies and thinges
indifferent, and then againe requiring of
vs to keepe the ceremonies of the primitiue
church▪ For when you had said in
one sentence, (For the vse of ceremonies,
and thinges indifferent, we do not bind you to
the Apostles tyme, and the primitiue church,)
in the next sentence folowing, you call
for redresse, according to the scripture
and primitiue church, not only for vse of
sacramentes, or false opinions, (which are
referred to the first member of your distinction)
but allso as concerning ceremonies,
which allthough you call superstitious,
that you might seeme to haue
some iust cause of taking them awaie, yet
you do against right dealing, to call vs to
the primitiue churche for ceremonies,
which you said before were in themselues
indifferēt. And here loe you make a rule,
and saie,Fo. 10. &. 11. 
                  that nothing is to be added vnto the
first ordinances of the law, and that we must

bring thinges vnto the institution of Christ.
And againe: that we must not harken what
other dyd before vs, but what Christ first dyd,
that was before all. And yet againe: That,
that ys true, that was first ordeined: and that
ys corrupted, that ys after done: which rule
yf you wyll haue to be vnderstanded in
suche matters as cōcerne immutable doctrine,
then haue you proued that thing
which none of ours denyeth vnto you,
and so you are all fallen in to the same
lapse, for which you misliked with others.
But if you vnderstand generally, by truth
of doctrine, the vse of Sacramentes and
ceremonnies, then haue you much forgoten
yout selfe, which euen now made
ceremonies, indifferent. But if you do it
for that purpose, that a Catholike should
not know where to haue you, allthough
I seeme to aske your losse, yet, for truth
sake, amend that fasshion. And perchaūse
this myght be amended allso, that you
do not trulie alleage your testimonies,
saying that to be Saint Cyprianes in his
Epistle vnto Cecilius, which is not at all
to be found there, but in his goodly treatise

                  De simplicitate praelatorum. In which
place the seeking vnto the head,
                  S. Cyprian mistakē, of the M. of the defence which you
do mention, is not vnderstanded for to
seeke vnto the beginnyng of a doctrine
or custome, but vnto that head of whom
it ys wryten,Math. 17 
                  Thou art Peter (that is to
saye) a rocke, and vpon this rocke I wyll
buyld my church. But how rightlie you
alleage the doctours, and how much they
make for you, it wyll be perceaued before
we haue ended. Hytherto let it be
marked, that we refuse your rule of resorting
to the first institution for the redresse
about the vse of the Sacramentes.
Because the vse of them is a thing indifferent,
and it neither maketh neither marreth
to receiue alone or with cumpanie,
and to receiue in one or in both kyndes,
or at night or in the morning, or thrise
in the yere, or ones in all our liffe, so that
the church be obeied.
               And now we will come to an other
part of this third chapiter, in which you
do excedingly reproue the Catholike,
because of the similitude of a taull man
and infant, which he vsed to the openyng

of his purpose, and confounding of his
aduersarie. Which so much displeaseth
you, that you saie:
I assure you it was neuer inuented without
the spirite of Antichrist,Defence. fol. 11. nor can not be
mainteined withowt blasphemye agaynste
Christ, and singular reproch of his Apostells
and their successors.
Syr,Reply. I beseche you to pacifie yourselfe, and
to vse the matter so calmelie and quietly,
as you promised to do in the end of the .ij.
chapiter. Consider, I pray you first, whether
the Catholike hath such a meaning,
as yon make sense vpon hym. Let vs reherse
faithfully the wordes of the Catholike,
and then as farr as your grammar
rules will suffer you, make your construction
vpon them. He had spoken before,
of the cōmones of all thinges in the Primitiue
church,Apol. of priuate Masse fol. 5. of miracles, of couering
of womens faces, of temporalties of Bisshopes,
of receiuyng after supper, of eatyng
of blouddinges, and houseling of
infantes, of which all he saieth in manner
of a conclusion: To call such thinges
to the state of the Apostles tyme, and of the

primitiue church againe, ys nothing els but
to enforce a taule man, to come to his swadeling
clothes, and to crie alarme in his cradel
againe. These loe be his very wordes,
in which, do your worst, and tell vs what
fault you find? He resembleth the primitiue
church (saie you) to infancie, wich similitude
you terme, as please you, an inuention
of Antichrist, a blasphemie against
Christ, and singular reproch of his Apostells.
But see now, herein how much you be
deceaued. The Catholike doth not (as
you weene) saie, that alltogeather that
church was an infant, but in such thinges
as he speake of, concerning order or
dispensation which then was vsed in the
church, he saieth, and saieth it truly, that
to require that all thinges shold be now
in these daies obserued, as thei were then
vsed, it were no more nor better, then to
bring a taule man to his swadeling clothes
againe. And yet, as though he had
made no more of the primitiue church,
then as if none but boyes had lyued in it,
so you ful manly reason against hym, and

For you saie:
Yf that tyme were the state of infancie in
the church,Defence. fo. 11. whē Christ hymselfe instructed,
when hys Apostles taught, when the holy fathers
gouerned next their tyme:A fond collection of the M. of the defence then we
must needes recken Christ, the Apostles, the
fathers, to be infantes in religion, to be babes
in gouernement of the church.
Yf we must needes do so as you saie,Replie. then
is there no remedie. But certenlie it is
wonder vnto me, how any such necessitie
should be concluded: yea allthough
I would affirme it, that not only in a few
particular causes, but allso cōcernyng the
whole state of her, the church was then in
her infancie. For allthough the whole
house be full of childerne, yet it must not
straitwaies folow, that the goodman and
the goodwiffe must needes be childerne.
Or if in a schole of one hundred of scholars,
the best is not come vnto his Catechisme,
or the institutions of Caluyne in
Englisshe, (bokes which will sone make
one a Doctour) it must not folow of necessitie,
that the master vnderstandeth not
his accidence. The Apostells of our Sauyor
Christ, before the cummyng of the

Holyghost in fierie tonges vpon them,Luc. 18. f 10. 20. b.
thei were allwaies full of imperfection,Math. 16. c.
both in will and allso vnderstanding:Math. 26. f ergo
was Christ our master to be reckened
for an ignorant person? For so runneth
your wyse reason, that if that tyme were
the state of infancie, then we must needes recken
Christ to be an infaent in religion. The
Christians allso, after the ascension of
Christ, and preaching of the Apostles,
were for the most part fraile and weak,
of which the Apostle had need to saie:
If a man be preuented in any fault. &c. And
againe:Gal. 6. 
                  I speake gentlie and fauorablie,
                  Ro. 6. 
                  because
of the weaknes of your flesshe. And
vnto the Hebrewes:Heb. 5. 
                  Euerie bodye that is
partaker of milke, is voyde of the talke of
iustice, for he is litle one: but the sound and
strong meate is for the perfect. Yet, not
withstanding the imperfections of the
weaker, there were many spirituall men
apt to instruct others: and the Apostle
had many thinges to tell his countriemen
which could not be well interpreted, because
thei were vnable to heare hym. But
you, to make your part the stronger, do

proue that the primitiue Church had vse
of reason, and wysedome, and you goe so
farr in the matter, that you define vnto
vs what the word Infancie doth signifie,
and you saie, that young age ys for no other
cause named infancie,
                  Defence fo
                        •
                     . 12. 
                  thē for that it hath not
the vse of tong and can not speake. But the
primitiue church could speake, ergo you
would haue vs discredited, because we
saie that she had her infancie. In very deed
it had ben better for you, if you coulde
haue neither spoken, neither wryten so
childishly. For (to let that reproufe which
you deserue, to passe, that you doe not
rightly cōceiue hys meanyng, whom you
would seeme to aunswer) you must consider,
that he which shall compare the tyme
of the primitiue church vnto infancy,
may haue right good meaninges therin,
such as yourselfe must alow. For,How the churche may be saied to haue her infancie. lyke
as to infantes many thinges are permitted,
which afterwardes shall leisurely be
taken awaie: so in the primitiue church
vnder the sight and gouernement of the
Apostells, some ceremonies of the old
lawe were suffered to continue, which

now emong all Christians are vtterly abrogated:
                     Act. 15. 
                        •
                      &c. 21. d
                  
as circuncision, purification, and
absteinyng from certen meates. Againe,
lyke as all thinges are not opened vnto
childerne, which in further processe of yeres,
serue for their profit and vnderstanding:
so the wysedom of God, which was
abundantly in his Apostells and their successours,
did not straitwaies put furth in
writyng all misteries, but as occasion afterward
required, so it brought furth in
to the open knouledge of the church, the
auncient and Apostolical verities. I might
allso saie, that because the church then,
was, in externall shew, both poore and
naked, and subiect to persequutions, therefor
it was in her infancie, but now whē
it is so glorious, so strong, and mightie,
that she hath the Princes of the world obedient
and subiect vnto her, and hath noblely
spreaden herselfe ouer the cumpasse
of the whole world, it is no great absurditie
(I trow), if she be said to haue come
to a perfect age and stature. Which
yet, if you will call dotage, because of many
euill maners and enormities extant in

her, I would not striue with you vpon it,
concernyng some members of her, if you
dyd so speake without priuy spite and malice.
But yet this doth folow, that the same
was then, by our saying, in her infancie,
which now is come, as you report, to
her dotage. And as infancie then, dyd nothing
preiudicate vnto her wysedome, by
which she was well able to gouerne and
rule her childerne, so her dotage now,
which is seen in the liffe of manie, doth
nothing excuse you, for contempnyng
your old mother. If therefor now, it may
be well said, in sundrie waies and senses,
that the church in the Apostells tyme, was
in a certen infancie, what spryte moued
you to make such a sense of it, as against
which you might vse your indignation,
without the matter and purpose? Or with
what honestie could you cōclud, that the
Catholikes do make Christ and his Apostells
infantes: of which the one, thei honor
as true God, the others, thei worship
as Doctours and Patrones of the world?
Brothern (saieth the Apostle)I could not
speake vnto you as vnto spiritual,
                  1. Cor. 3. 
                  but as to

carnall, lyke as to litle ones in Christ, I gaue
vnto you milke to drinke, not meate. For as
then you were not able, no neither yet you
can. For as yet you be carnall. And to the
Galathians:Gal. 4. 
                  O my litle childerne (sayeth
he) with whom I am in trauaile againe, vntill
Christ be formed in you. Doe not therefor,
Sir, I pray you, so ernestly take the
matter, when you see the Apostle hymselfe,
not to leese any of his own strength
and wisedome, because of the imperfection
of the Corinthians and others: and
consider allso, whether thei might not be
called infantes, which as yet, were to be
fedd with milke. But let vs goe further
in to the chapiter.
You laie the cause of priuate Masse vpon
the keycold charitie of the people,Defence. fo. 14. (and
perhappes the first occasion came thereof
in deede) but. &c.
Who tould you that this was the cause
of priuate Masse? You read it not, I am
assured, in the Apologie which you would
faine answer: and yet you buyld so much
vpon it, as though it had ben a most plaine
conclusion of it. The Catholike in

hys Apologie sayeth, that the constant
faith, the pure liffe, the feruent charitie,
&c, whiche florisshed in the primitiue
church, were causes perhappes, why no
Masse was then celebrated, but that diuers
Christians dyd communicate. But
what conclusion doth he inferr there vpon?
not that truely which you dreame
of,The M. of the defence mistaketh the Catholike. but this only which he labored to
proue, that you should not therefor require
the lyke manner of cōmunicatyng
with the priest, to be at these dayes vsed,
when the lyke deuotion and charitie ys
not in the peoples hartes grounded. He
said not, that the keycold charitie of the
people shold be the cause of priuate masse,
no more then he saied that the number
of communicantes was the efficient
cause of saying masse, as though there
might haue ben no masse att all, except
there had ben some prepared to receiue.
Is there no difference (trou you) betwyxt
 these ij. propositions: There were no masses
saied in the primitiue church, but there
were some readie to comm
                        •
                     nicate, and, Except
 there had ben some readie for that purpose,

there would haue ben no masses in the
primitiue church. The first perhappes was
true, and the cause thereof ys attributed
in the Apologie, vnto the deuotion of
the people. The second ys denied playnely
vnto you, because the sacrifice of the
church of Christ, doth not depend at all,
vpon communicantes▪ for lyke as in these
dayes at an Easter tyme, the perfect holy
men may be espyed to go closely in to
some one chapple, and there saie priuatelie
a masse, in great deuotion and silence,
the cause of which is, not in the lacke
of such as would communicate, but, togeather
with many other causes, the desire
which thei haue geauē in to their hartes,
to goe so much the further from the
sight and respect of men, by how much
the neerer they would come to the contemplation
and admiration of God: so
it might right well haue come to passe,
without any scripture, a
                     •
                  thoritie, or reason
to the contrary, that euen in the most
best tyme of the primitiue church, such
masses were saied now and then, which
you do odiously call priuate. Wherefor

seing there is so great fault committed
of you in the misconstruing of the Catholike
his reason, no wonder if you haue
taken great peines in commentyng vpon
it all out of purpose. As when yow
tell vs of many cōmodities, which grow
by the oft receiuing of the sacrament &c.
But who shall bring the people daily or
weekly, yea quarterly rather vnto the receiuyng
of their maker, yf thei will not
themselues? The priestes (saie you) should
warne them and instruct them,
                  Defence. fo. 16. 
                  and tell them
plainely, that if they be gasers only and no
receiuers, they runn thereby in to displeasure
of God: with many other vehement sentences,
which for that purpose you alleage
owt of S. Chrisostome. And you make
the matter so easie, as though for the
speaking, the priest could bring the people
vnto the cōmunion: whereas it doth
presently appeare euē in your late erected
churches, that, for al that you are able to
do, you haue most often tymes no cōmunion
at all. And except it were, more for
the princes law, then for that by your vehement
exhortations you shold perswad

the people, I thinke there wold be fewer
cōmunions by four partes, then are now
in England, which as many as they are,
do not lightly excede one or .ij. a quarter
in most parisshes.Math. 7. First therefor pluck the
beame out of your owne eie, and then
you shall be better able to take a mote
out of an others eie. And when you shall
perceaue by experience (which allreadie
in part doth trie it) that except you cō
                  straine
men by act of parleamēt, you shall
neuer bring them, by the strength and
dailynes of your preaching, vnto the frequentyng
of the cōmunion, then lo you
shall be more mercifull towardes others
in your owne exact iudgement, and thinke,
that with good cause, that may be vnspoken,
in which you shold haue no hope
of redresse to be made by your speakyng.
But of the diligence and discretion
of the church which she hath vsed, concernyng
the calling of people vnto their
housel, because of better occasion which
hereafter foloweth, I will in this place
leaue it vncounted.
               But ye obiect,Defenc
                        •
                      fol. 17. that priestes are bounden of

dutie to the daily frequentation of it, and the
people left free. That would I faine lerne at
your hande, and see some good proufe of
the Scripture, for the same.
               Yf you would faine lerne,Reply. tary vntill I
bring our doctors and readers vnto you.
But as though you had all the lernyng of
the world, sett in a table before your eies,
so you answer, that we haue lesse then a
light shadow to hyde our assertion in.
               Truly, Syr, you geaue testimonie against
your selfe, that you be very blind, because
you can iudge no better of colours. For
this first I trust you will graunt, that priestes
and laye men are not alltogeather one.
You must graunt allso, that as we are
vnder a proper and most excellent law,
so lykewyse that we haue a correspōdent
priesthode: as it is writen,Heb. 7. 
                  VVhen the
priesthode is transferred, it must needes be,
that there be made a transferring of the law
allso: because law and priesthode do go
                     •
                  
ioyntly togeather. Then it foloweth herevpon:
That euery Bisshope chosen out
of men,
                  Heb. 5. 
                  is apointed for men, in those thinges
which are to Godward, that he should offer

vp giftes and sacrifices for synnes. &c. But
sacrifice for synn there is none in this law
and tyme of grace, besides the body and
bloud of our Sauyor, ergo that must be
offered. Yet no man should take an office
vpon hym, except he were called, and
there is no place in all scripture, where
that calling ys expressed, but only in the
last supper of Christ.Priestes are bound to offer. therefor whereas he
in that his last supper gaue authoritie vnto
priesthode in saying:Luc. 22. 
                  Do this in remembrance
of me. I conclude, that priestes
only, are bound to blesse, to breake his
body, and consequently to eate it. I saie
not that euery priest is bound to daily
frequentation of the sacrament, (which
if you thinke vs to do, you speake without
boke therein, and misreport the Catholikes)
but concernyng the whole body
of priesthode, and the necessitie of a
daily sacrifice, priestes are not only bound
to offer, but to prouide that there be daily
offering. Knowing this,D
                        •
                     . 12. that it is a most
sure token of Antichrist his presence, whē
the Iuge sacrificium, the daily sacrifice, shall
cease to be offered. For thei only are called

to that high office, and their dutie is
to folow their office. And this thing being
rightly considered of the auncient fathers,
made them so reuerently to behaue them
selues, towardes the blessed sacrament.
               As S. Denyse the Areopagite, speakyng of
the order of masse in his tyme, saieth, that
the Bisshope excused hymselfe, that he offered
vp the helthsome sacrifice, which is aboue
his power, and that he cried out decently,
saying vnto God,Lib. de Eccle. hier. 
                  Thow hast saied: Do this
in my remembrance. As who sould saie, except
thow hadest geauen licence and authoritie,
what man would haue bē so bold,
as to come nigh to the touching of so diuine
misteries. S. Iustine allso the Martir
witnesseth,Apo. 2. 
                  that the Apostles in their cōmentaries,
which are the ghospells, do declare that
Christ cōmaunded them to consecrate the bread
by the prayers of his word: at what tyme he
toke bread, and after thankes geauing, saied:
Do this in remembrance of me. And S. Cypriane
more plainely saieth, that in Christ
his last supper, those sacramentes came furth,
which had ben signified from the tyme of Melchisedech,
                  Cypr. de coena do.
                  and that the high priest bringeth

furth vnto the sounes of Abraham, which do
as he dyd, bread and wyne, sayng, this is my
body. Of which bread (saieth this blessed
martyr) the Apostells dyd eate in the same
supper before, according vnto the visible forme,
but sence the time that it was saied of our
Lord (do this in my remembrance, this is my
bodye, this ys my bloud,) as often tymes as
the thing is done with these wordes and this
faith, this substantiall bread and chalice,
consecrated with the solemne blessing, profiteth
vnto the liffe and health of all the
whole man, being both a medicine and a sacrifice,
to heale his infirmities, and purge
his iniquities. Wherefore if you, Syr,
would consider, how great this misterie
ys, you shoulde perceaue how great honor
and preeminencie all priestes are indued
with. For when they worke,
                  Chry. li. 3. de Sacerd. 
                  then are
these holy thinges, which I speake of, begon
and perfected. But say you.
               Christ his institution was generall, and his
commaundement therein stretcheth as well
to the people,Defence fol. 18. as to the priest.
               I haue proued vnto you the contrary,Reply.
both by reason, (because priesthode ys a

distinct office, vnto which certen onlye
are apoynted, and chosen owt from the
laitie) and by scripture (as you may cō
                  sider
by S. Paule to the Hebreues) and
allso by Doctours, as S. Denyse, Iustine,
and Cypriane, do plainely testifie. But
then you byd vs to vnderstand,
That S. Paule, a good interpretour of Christ
his mind,Defence ibidem. applieth the wordes of Christ to the
whole congregation of Corinth, where it ys
certē, were both ministers and cōmon people.
Nay Sir,Replie. vnderstand you this rather, that
you vnderstand not S. Paule, which in
that his chapiter alleageth the institutiō
of Christ to this purpose, that the Corinthians,
by consideration of the charitie
and maiestie which was represented
therein, shold be more felolyke in the cō
                  municating
of theyr common meates,
from which they were fallen vnto seuerall
and priuate tables or suppers in the
church. And he doth tell historically,
what Christ saied vnto his disciples, not
what Christ apoynted the Corinthians
and euery other of the Christians to do.
For I haue receiued of owr Lord that which

I haue delyuered vnto you,
                  1. Cor. 11. sayth the Apostell.
But what meaneth he by these wordes,
I haue deliuered? he spake vnto all
the Corinthians without respect of spiritualtie
or temporalty, but dyd he speake
by waie of instruction, or by waie of
geauing some office and function vnto
them? And that which he receiued of
Christ, did he delyuer vnto them as a doctrine
and article to be lerned, or as a cō
                  maundement
to be exequuted? if you
meane the first, you agree with vs: if you
meane the second, you disagree from cō
                  mon
sense and euident truth. for if it apperteine
vnto all Christians, without distinction,
to doe as S. Paule receaued of
Christ, and as the Corinthians receaued
of S. Paule: then must euery Christian take
bread, geaue thankes, and breake it,
and when euery body is a minister, who
then shall be a receauer? Againe, in the
wordes of our Sauyor (Do this in remembrance
of me) how much is wylled to be
done? Are the wordes, (do this) to be referred
only to the takyng and eating? no
truly. for (do this) doth not folow in Sainct

Paule, immediately vpon the wordes (take
and eate) but after the wordes (thys ys
my body) and it were better and plainelier
englyshed (make this) then (do this) thereby
to geaue you to vnderstand,Hoc facite. Make this. that by
those wordes, authoritie of makyng and
consecrating Christ his body, was geauen
vnto the Apostles. But taking (do this) after
the largest manner, it can not yet be
referred to takyng or eatyng only, but
must allso be vnderstanded of, blessing.
now, if you will haue these wordes of (do
this in my remembrance) to stretch as well
vnto the people, as to the high order of
priestes, then may you cōplaine not only
that thei receiue not as oft as the priest,
(which thei will not, I warrant you, for
all your greate mouyng) but allso and rather,
that they take not the bread in to
their handes, and blesse it themselues, and
say masse, such as may be called priuate in
deed. Which vnsensible and pernitiouse
folissh opinion, because you will not suffer
to enter in to your hart, therefor you
must of necessitie graunt, great difference
to be, betwyxt the priest and the people,

and confesse that, taking, blessing,
and breaking, is so properly his, that it
can not rightly be the common peoples.
Yea marie (saie you) but
Christ tooke the bread,Defence. &c. then the priest
in his ministration must do as Christ dyd,
and no otherwyse, that is, to take breake,
and geaue vnto the people. &c.
Speake you this of your owne mynd,Replie. or
do you speake it, as it were vpon occasion
of the Catholikes wordes? Yf you
thinke as you speake, why find you no
fault with your cōmunion, where no rule
ys apointed vnto ministers, of taking the
bread in to their handes, or of blessing it,
which Christ hymselfe dyd? But if you
beleeue not, that of necessity euery thing
must be done, as Christ dyd, at his maundy:
what cause then moueth you, whi distributyng
should be more required, then
taking and blessing of the holy host, which
by your seruyce is omitted? For, the Catholike
church doth teach, that as the body
of Christ is a sacrifice and a sacramēt,
so lykewyse that it ys two distinct actes▪
his body to be offered, and the same to

be receiued. And as S. Cypriane,The body of Christ is a sacrifice and a sacr
                        •
                     ment. whom I
haue alleaged, doth testifie, that the bread
which the true Melchisedech, and our high
priest Christ, gaue to his Disciples, was both
a whole burnt offering and sacri
                        •
                     ice, and allso
a medicine, so, as it is a medicine, it is to
be receaued of all Christians, because all
without exception are diseased: and as it
is a sacrifice, it is actually to be offered for
all persons, by such as are properly apoynted
out for that purpose, because no man
should take an office vpon hym, before he
be called. Yet because one may iustly saie,
that to shew furth the death of our Lord
vntill he come, doth well agree with euery
Christian man his part and office, and
therevpon vntruly conclud, that Do this
in remembrance of me, (which is, by the interpretation
of S. Paule, to shew furth the
death of Christ vntill he come) should
in all pointes be referred as well vnto the
people, as the priest: therfor I answer further,
that allthough many thinges which
Christ spake to the Apostles onlye, and
their successors, may be truly applied vnto
euery Christian, so is it in this case of

which we talke. Christ saied vnto the Apostles
onlye, You haue not chosen me,
                  Ioan. 15. 
                  but
I haue chosen you. which allthough it may
be truly verified of euery Christian man,
woman, and child, (because that Christ
in deed hath chosen vs to his people, so
many other besides cōtinuing in their infidelitie
or Iuisshnes) yet it must not folow,
that Christ dyd not meane by those
wordes, that the Apostles were singularly
chosen vnto the proper office of preaching,
and ministring his sacramentes.
Therfor allthough one may vse the wordes
(Do this in remembrance of me) in respect
of the common peoples affection,
yet it is not true that Christ had no larger
or greater meanyng in them, then that
by eatyng of his body, we should only remember
that he dyed for vs, which euery
one may do as well as a priest. Wherefor
Syr, as you haue cōcluded, that the priest
is not bound to minister to other, if there
be none to receaue, (which is quickly to
be graunted vnto you) so I say, that you
haue nothing at all proued, that Christ
his institution, stretcheth as well to the

people, as the priest, or that the priest
could not laufully receaue, except there
were some cumpany. But where now are
your scriptures, your Doctours, your generall
councells, and your crakes, by which
you should directly answer, to that which
is required of you. We shall perchaunse
hereafter in your defence, read many great
argumentes against vs, but in the meane
tyme, you thinke it good to prouyde for
a place of refuge, when the ouerthrow
shall be geauen vnto you. And therefor
you saie:
Yf we had no scripture at all,Defence fol. 18. to proue that
the priest should not receaue without cumpany,
yf ye dyd geaue vs the ouerthrow in
that, yet could ye not triumph therein, as
though ye had wonn the field.
And why so, I pray you?
Our contention (you answer) ys for priuate
Masse, &c.fo. 19. of which sole receauyng,
ys but one part.
You pitch your campe,Replie. Sir, in a very wyde
field, and your kind of fight is such, as we
perceaue, you would neuer be ouercummed.
The church of God, whose armies
of doctrine and verities do allwaies stand

in good order, if she be iustly ouercūmed
in any one thing, which she absolutelye
mainteineth, she straitwaies shall be forsaken,
as one which is not to be credited.
But you (in whose name I will not saie)
are so trimlye prepared, that allthough
you be ouerthrowen in one of your articles,
yet you will not be ouercummed in
the state of your whole religion. Yet
how well this may be graunted, lett vs
consider. Do not you distinct thinges,
some in to necessarie, some in to indifferent?
Do not you saie,Defence fo. 10. &. 18. that the sole receauyng
of a priest by hym selfe, is not a
thing indifferent? And do not you make
a necessitie of doctrine in it, that the people
must receaue with the priest, or els
Christ his institution is broken? Tell me
then now further:1. Tim. 3. Is not the church of
Christ, the pillar and staie of truth? And
can that be possiblie his church, which
would sett furth a lye? No truly. It is impossible
that the church should err in doctrine,lo
                        •
                     . 16.
to whom the Holyghost was promised
to teach her all truth, and allso to
tary with her for euer. And if but one article

which she defendeth, be proued false,
I will not saie, that all the rest which
she vttered is false, but this is most certen,
that she is not the church, which is to be
folowed. Yet see, you can so dispose your
selues, that allthough you be proued lyers,
in one of those your articles which
you make necessary, yet you will not be
mistrusted, but that neuerthelesse you be
the true church of Christ. And whereas
the Holyghost,Ioan. 16. which was promised vnto
the church, doth teach her all truth, yet
you so vnderstand the matter, that for all
the ouerthrowing of one whing of your
battaile, you neuerthelesse will not leese
the whole field and victorie. Which one
saying of yours alone, without further
stroke geauē, doth so wound your church
and confound it,he that discrediteth the church in one poīt, must either seeke an other chur
                        •
                     che, or recant his saing, & iudgement. that in deed you haue
lost the victorie. And it may well be, that
your tong is yet free, and that your feete
may serue you to runn in to other questions,
besides the purpose, but as concernyng
the truth (which is with you in all
poyntes, if you be the true church) you
haue lost for euer the grace of it, either

because (as we know) you can not disproue
sole receiuing, either because yourselfe
saie, that if you were therein ouerthrowen,
you had not yet lost the victorie.
Which is thus much in effect, that
the church of Christ, (which honor you
challenge vnto yourselfe) might in any
one article be deceaued, and teach that
sole receauyng is against the institution
of Christ, and graunt for all that, that no
ouerthrow is taken, if the cleane contrary
be proued. But lett vs consider now,
what shiftes you can make, to the disapointing
of our purpose?
Our contention is for priuate Masse. &c. of
which sole receauing is but one part.Defence.
                  
               
               You may freely make, as many and as
few partes as you will herein,Replie. because it
ys alltogeather of your owne priuate deuising.
The Catholike church, (as it is
oftentymes told you) hath no priuate
masse, and we can not find, for what other
cause you nickname it a priuate masse,
then, for that the priest alone receaueth.
And if we hitherto haue not vnderstanded
your meaning, your selues are

very much to blame, which haue not defined
it vnto vs. All be it, if one may come
to an others mynd, by considering his
waies in reasonyng, we can thinke no other,
but that you meane the priestes sole
receauing without the people, by the
name of priuate masse, because in all
your speakyng against it, you argue directly
and only against sole receauing.
Which whether we haue concluded against
you or no, what haue you to the
contrary? This you saie:
It folowth not,Defence. fol. 19. to saie, the priest in case of
necessitie, when none will receaue, may take
the Sacrament alone, therefore he may do
it without necessitie, when he may haue other
to communicate with hym.
               
               Yeas truly,Reply. it foloweth very well. for if
it be so as you report, that the right and
necessarie vse of the sacrament, ys, to receaue
it with cūpanie, then can the priest
neuer receaue it alone by hymselfe, what
so euer necessitie should come vpō hym.
for in such thinges as apperteyne to the
substance of the sacrament, no creature
can lawfully vse the contrary vnto them.

But sole receauing seemeth to be graunted
of yow to vs, in case of necessitie,
(which prouision or exceptiō you proue
not hytherto, out of the expresse word
of God), ergo it is no part of the necessary
substance, which must be obserued
about the sacrament. And if it be not essential,
then doubtles it may be dispensed
with all, then allso may the Church of
Christ without breach of his institution,
lett the priestes alone with their sole receauyng.
what say you then? ys receauing
with cumpanie necessarie? if you saye,
yea: then is it for no mans pleasure or ordinance,
in any case to be altered. Yf you
saie, no, that is, if you graunt it to be indifferent:
why then might nor the priest
receaue alone, for any commaundement
of Christ or his Apostels? And what law
haue you, either of God or good man,
that chargeth hym, to haue alwaies communicantes
with hym? And this I speake
concernyng your weake argument, and
allso of the libertie which is in the priest,
if he be disposed to vse it: Allthough in
deed that you can not shew the example,

where the priest dyd receaue alone whē
others would communicate with hym.
But now Syr, I pray you, come neerer
to the matter, and shew vnto vs due and
good proufes against the priests sole receauyng.
Because ye vrge so ernestly,Defence fol. 19. to haue due proufe
against sole receauyng by the priest if the
people will not communicate, I will shew you
some reasons: But before I enter. &c.
Take our whole meanyng with you,Reply. Sir,
we require to haue your proufes, against
sole receauing by the priestes, not conditionally,
(with your if the people will not
communicate) as who should saie,see how the M. of the defence ys euer going from the purpose. that the
onlye cause of the sole receauing, were
thought of vs to be in the lacke of cumpanie,
and as though necessitie, which
hath no lawe, and not the truthe of the
cause dyd make our assertion good: we
will not (I saie) so vnperfectlye goe to
worke against you, but we beleeue and
hold absolutely, in the nature of the thinges
themselues, that the sole receauyng is
not against the word of God. And now,
do you what you can, to proue, that vpon

paine of God his indignation, there ought to
be a cūpany to receaue with the priest at euery
masse▪
                  
                  Apologie fol. 10. as the Catholike in his Apologie
requireth of your side: Or that it were better,
not only to plucke hym from the aultar,
but allso to cast hym out of the church to, rather
then he should receaue alone, and alter
the institution of Christ (as you vnderstand
it) and cause the people to runn headlong in
to God his displeasure.
                  Defence fol. 17. which wordes whether
you spake in vehemencie of spryte
or spyte I can not tell, (yet who should
presume to plucke Ambrose frō the aultar,
when the Emperour hymselfe ys cō
                  maunded
out of the quyer) But if you
spake as you thought, and can proue that
which you spake, lett vs haue a copie of
your reasons, & of the authorities, which
so necessarily do moue you. And to the
end that it may be perceaued, who dealeth
plainely, and who goeth from the
purpose, let this be the forme of the question,
which is to be talked of betwixt vs.The stat
                        •
                      of the cō

Now, that you may not saye, that sence
your defence hath come furth, the state
of the controuersie ys quite and cleane
altered, turne you, vnto the .7. and .10.
leafe of the Apologie, and you shall reade
most manifestly, that, vnto this state,
the question ys dryuen. Therefor Syr, after
you doe perceaue the ground vpon
which we do, and you shold stand, march
you forward in your captaine his name,
(what so euer he be) which moued yow.
You saie then:
I will shew you some reasons.Defence. fo. 19. But before I
enter in to that, I must warne you once againe,
that if our reasons, were not so well
able to proue necessitie, yet could you not cō
                     clude
your purpose, for that your priuate
Masse is nothing lesse then necessitie.
What we can conclude,Reply. it shall appeare
before we depart. But it may be gathered
allready, that you are concluded vpp in
to a very hard case,Is it not plaine, that the M. of the defence shrinketh? which make such protestations
before you come to the matter.
You saied a litle before, that if we dyd
geaue you the ouerthrow, yet we could
not triumph: and now you warne vs, that
if your reasons be not so well able to proue

necessitie, (which is ment, I trow, by
the necessitie of some to cōmunicate with
the priest) that yet we could not conclude
our purpose, because our priuate masse
is nothing lesse then necessitie, (by which
necessitie, you vnderstand, I thinke, the
lacke of communicantes, when the priest
would receaue) wherein if I do not rightly
interprete you, you must be contented
to excuse me: because that if you yourselfe
were at this place in so greate necessitie
and lacke of wordes, that you
could not plainely expresse your mind,
no wonder, if he, which readeth your sentencies,
be brought in to doubt, what
sense he should make of them. As for necessitie,
in which many thinges are graū
                  ted,
and as concerning the blessed thefe,
which neuer (you saie) was baptised,
(which you saie truly in that he was not
dipped in water, and yet he was baptised
in the Holy ghost, and in his owne
bloud) because of our principall questiō,
I will not stand about him. And whether
in the ordinarie vse of it, the supper of
the Lord, ought of necessitie to haue cōmunicantes

to be partakers of it, (as you would
make the controuersie to be,) I will not
reason with you at this tyme. Either because
it ys not perceaued, what you will
meane by the terme (ordinarie vse,) either
because the question ys more generall, as
we haue put it furth vnto you. And wheras
at other tymes,The wauering of heretikes, & vncertaine senses. in your pulpites and
allso bokes, you appeale vnto the institution
of Christ, and make the matter so
weighty, as though it might neuer be suffered,
that one should receaue alone with
out cumpanie, yet now you talke of an
ordinary vse of the Sacrament, as who
should thinke, that you neuer denied, but
that in particular cases, and for extraordinary
causes, one alone might receaue,
without any iniurie done vnto the institution
of Christ. And yet againe, when
the Catholikes do alleage diuerse examples
and authorities, to proue, that cumpanie
ys not necessary, absolutely, in the
vse of the Sacrame
                     •
                  t, then loe you be so
ernest against them, as though it were in
no wyse to be graunted, that in the primitiue
church any one example, authoritie,

or argument might be shewed, to
proue sole receauing, as thowgh yowr
cause were anyiote hindered by it, if in
deed you hold the question not absolutely,
but only concernyng the ordinarie
vse of the Sacrament. Wherefor seeing
that you goe so in and out, hyther and
thyther, without all maner of keeping of
order and place, like dimilaunces or light
horsemen, or els like the wild Irisshe in
their fighting. I therefor thinke it necessarie,
againe to byd you remember your
selfe, and to cōsider the state of the question,
vpon which the Catholike rested.
               And thee (gentle Reader) I desire to
marke exactly, the cheife and principall
matter which we haue to debate vpon.
which is this. Not, whether in tyme of
necessity a priest may receaue alone, Not
whether the ordinary vse of the Sacrament,
ought of necessitie to haue communicātes,
we will not at this tyme, medle
with these questions, because we haue
allreadye a greater and more principall
in hand: but our question ys this,
Whether (as I haue sayed before) vppon

paine of God his indignatiō, the priest ought
to haue allwaies cumpanie to receiue with
hym. Let this be first examined, and then
shall the other, be quickly answered. Trusting
therefor that thow wilt marke diligently,
where vpon the catholike striueth
against the aduersarie, I now returne againe,
vnto the M. of the defence, and
require the to consider the maner of his
fighting. In answering the Catholike his
demaund, he saieth:defē. f. 19.
                  Our proufe ys this.Maior. In the celebration of this
sacrament of the Lorde his supper, we ought
to do that only and nothing els,Minor. that Christ
the author of it, did in his institution: But in
Christ his institution, appeareth neither sole
receauyng,Conclusio. nor ministring vnder one kynd:
therefore in celebration of the sacrament,
neither sole receiuing, nor ministring vnder
one kind ought to be vsed.
               
               First to the maior, then to the minor,Reply.
Syr I deny your maior vnto you,To do all that Christ did in his last supper, is not, with out all exceptiō and limitation, necessarie. because
you affirme, that generally, which ys true
only in certen pointes of Christ his maū
                  dy.
For, if we must do that only, which Christ
dyd at his supper, and doe nothing els but
that, then must we vse sitting, and not
kneeling or standing, then must the Sacrament

be delyuered vnto .xij. persons
and neither to more nor lesse: then shall
we not celebrate before dyner, or in a
cope or surplesse, or with psalmes, organes,
and solempnitie, such as you allso
vse, because we must do nothing els but
that, which Christ did, as your maior importeth.
Now if you be to wise and lerned
to thinke that in such a generall mā
                  ner,
we ought to do as Christ did at his
last supper, then haue you iust cause to
correct your maior, and we can not but
deny it, vntil we may vnderstand of your
limitation, which you will (we trust) add
vnto it. And what limitation might that
be, which being added, we would graunt
your proposition. Forsoth if for the terme
institution, you woulde put tradition.
For what so euer Christ dyd about the
cōsecrating or delyuering of his pretious
body, it may be truly saied, that he dyd it
in his institution, but yet such circumstancies
as he then vsed, are not beleeued
to be his tradition. For it is allso one
thing, to saie, thys is Christ his institution,
and it hath a farr other meanyng, to saie,

                  Christ dyd this in his institution. For his institution
importeth a law, and is directly
to be obserued, but the phrase of in his institution,
importeth a signification of tyme,
and place, and circumstancies, within
which his institution was vttered. Which
thinges, as thei be not essentiall, but stand
only about the substance, themselues being
accidentall and chaingeable, so thei
may be, without all hurt, altered, as the
church shall thinke good and conuenient.
Therefor, as I graunt, that in matter of
weight and substance, Christ onlye, and
no other, is to be folowed: so in that generall
māner of speach, which you do vse,
I am sure, it can neuer be proued. Yeas
saie you:
The maior is S. Cyprianes,Defence fol. 19. proued at large
and much staied vpon, in his epistle ad
Cecilium, de Sacramento sanguinis.
               
               You may be for euer ashamed,Reply. that you
alleage Saint Cypriane for the proufe of
your proposition, which nothing at all
maketh for you, and that you do so wickedly,
in so ernest a matter, abuse the simplicitie
of your countriemen, such as can

vnderstand no Laten. And because it is
not once or twyse, that you appeale vnto
this epistle of S. Cypriane, I will therefor
sumwhat at large, shewe it furthe in this
place, to the Reader, that he take good
heed for euer, of geauing hastie creditt,
vnto strainge and newfound teachers.
               There were in S. Cyprians tyme, some
such priestes, which, either for simplicitie,
or for custome sake, or for certen deuout
causes, dyd offer vp at the tyme of the misteries,
not wyne and water togeather,
but only water by itselfe. Against whose
doinges in that point, S. Cypriane most
ernestlye writeth,Cyprian. li. 2. epi. 3. and it is the only scope
and marke, at the which he shooteth in
all that long epistle: alleaging first the
example of Melchisedech,Gen. 14. 
                  which brought
furth bread and wyne, for he was the priest
of God most highest: afterwardes the saying
of Salomon,Prouer. 9 
                  how that wysedome killed
her sacrificies, and mingled her wine in a cup:
then further, the prophesie of 
                     •
                  acob, speaking
of his soun Iuda in the figure of
Christ,Gene. 49 and saying: he shall wasshe his robe
in wyne, and his cloke in the bloud of the

grape: after that againe, the testimonie of
Esai,Esa. 63. 
                  when he saw the vestmentes of Christ
full of redd spottes, as if he had come lately
from the wynepresse:
                  Math. 26. he alleageth allso the
institution of Christ,1. Cor. 11. and the testimonie
of S. Paule, by which both places he proueth,
that we should offer vp not water
onlye, but allso wyne. Then he maketh
further argument, saying,That wyne and water should be mengled togeather in the chalic
                        •
                     . that the mixture
of wyne and water in the chalice togeather,
doth signifie the coniunction of
Christ and his church, and that if wyne
be offered vp alone, the bloud of Christ
is without vs: and that if water alone be
offered vp, then the people begyn to be
without Christ. Which reason of his, if
you wyll cōtempne, I am sory, that S. Cyprian
hath so sone displeased you, whom
you seemed to make so much of, before.
But as concernyng the argument of that
epistle, he proueth by those testimonies,
which I haue touched, and by many other
waies, that in the offering, which the priest
maketh, water and wyne bothe, are to be
mengled, and that it was Christ his institution
so to doe, and that Christ only is

to be folowed therein, and that we must
do herein no other thing, thē that which
Christ hymselfe dyd first of all. Now, Sir,
then, with what face can you alleage S.
Cyprian, for proufe of your proposition
which is generall, whereas he speaketh of
water and wyne to be mengled, when the
priest doth sacrifice, which us a speciall
case onlye? And see how the dyuel dyd
owe you a shame. If you wyll refuse Saint
Cyprian in that place, then standeth your
maior like a miserable proposition without
any similitude of defence. If you alowe
S. Cyprian, how standeth your religion,
in whose communion and Lordes
table, water and wyne are not mengled
togeather, which should be so duly and
necessarily obserued? Will you saie here
that the field is not lost, and that this is
but an ouerthrow of one wing only? Do
you fight for the victorie, and not for the
veritie? so that you may be semed to have
somwhat allwaies to saie, do you make
no conscience nor rekonyng, of your
vniust and foule plaie? Answer directly
vnto this one argument, or confesse your

falsehode or ignorance, and geaue ouer
your stryuing against the manifest veritie.
If all thinges are to be obserued in such
manner as Christ hath them instituted:
wherefor haue you no water in the chalice,
which Christ (as S. Cyprian proueth)
hath so solemply delyuered?Let this be answered. Now, on the
other syde, if some thinges may be well
vnfolowed, which Christ hymselfe apointed:
why make you such a generall stoute
proposition, which by yourselfe is so
quicklye neglected? For the mixture of
wyne and water in the chalice, you can
not saie that you haue no authoritie of
scripture, no example of primitiue church,
no testimonie of auncient Doctour, for
in that one epistle of Saint Cypriane, of
which we speake, which you seeme not
to haue readen onlye, but allso to alow,
you shall find all those places, by which
the veritie of this tradition may be proued.
Where then is your memorie? That
which S. Cyprian of purpose declareth,
of the mixture of wyne and water in the
chalice, you either see not, or regard not.
and that which you put furth of the generall

obseruing and keeping whatsoeuer
Christ dyd in the institution of his sacrament,
is not at all in that epistle, and yet
you can read it there proued at large.
And here now,Note diligētly how S. Cyprian ys misconstrued, and the reader abused by the M. of the defēce. I haue to saie further against
you, that you do not rightly interprete,
not only his mynd, but not so much
as his wordes. For whereas that blessed
martir saieth: Admonitos autem nos scias, vt in calice offerendo, dominica traditio seruetur▪
                  
which is: Know you further, that we
be warned, that in offering of the chalice,
the tradition of our Lord be kept. you interprete
it after this fasshion: Do you know therefor,
that we be admonisshed, that in offering
the sacrament of the Lords bloud, his owne
institution should be kept. For examinyng of
which your interpretation, if you should
be brought, but vnto a Grammar schole,
dominica traditio, is to shortly Englisshed,
his owne institution, and, in calice offerendo,
is to ignorantly Englisshed, in the offering
of the sacrament of the Lords bloud. so that
I beleeue verely, if the Scholemaster were
not very much a sleepe, he would beare
softly at your backe doore, and make you

to remember yourselfe better. But if litle
regard be taken of construction, which is
made in scholes, yet it is to be prouyded
diligently, that no false construction be
sett furth in print, especially in such kind
of matter, as apperteineth vnto our sowle,
and is of so great weight and efficacie,
that it maketh or marreth an heresie. You
Englissh traditio, not tradition, but institution.
And whi rather institution, then tradition?
Verely for no other cause, I thinke,
but for that you abhorr the name of
tradition, and because you would seeme
to the ignorant Reader, to be a great fauorer
of Christ his institution. You Englisshe,
in calice offerendo, after this sort,
in offering the sacrament of the Lords bloud,
and whi not rather, in offering the chalice,
as the wordes themselues do signifie? You
had no litle craft in your mynd, when you
sett vpon the translating of this plaine
sentence, and for the word, chalice, to substitute,
the sacrament of the Lords bloud, it
was a deceitfull enterprise. For if you
would haue plainely saied (as S. Cyprians
wordes do signifie) that, in offering

the chalice the tradition of our Lord be kept,
the diligent Reader would haue ben moved
to require, what tradition that should
be, which must be obserued in offering
the chalice? and he should be truly answered,
that it was the tradition of vsing not
wyne alone or water alone, but water and
wyne both, in the chalice, togeather.
which would much disgrace your communion.
But when you make S. Cyprian
to sound after this sense, that, in offering
the sacrament of the Lords bloud, his owne
institution is to be folowed, you geaue occasion
to a simple and vnexpert Reader,
to thinke, that hereby it is manifestly proued,
that the lay people at these daies allso,
must necessarily receiue his bloud, because
he, in his institutiō of his sacramēt,
delyuered furth allso his bloud. Whiche
S. Cyprian yet dyd no more thinke vpon,
then he feared least any grāmarian should
come, many hundred yeares after hym,
and interprete his plaine wordes in such
a froward sense as you haue done. And so
in the Englisshing furth of the selfesame
sentence, after these wordes, and no other

thing to be done, then that the Lord dyd first
for vs hymselue, you make a full periode
and point: whereas it foloweth in S. Cyprian,
as clause of the same sentence, that
in deede we should doe as our Lord had
done first hymselfe, but wherein and how
farr, trowe you? in all thinges, and all circumstancies?
no truly. For straitwaies it
foloweth, in S. Cyprian, and it is the limitation
of the whole proposition, that the
chalice which is offered vp in commemoration
of hym, be offered vp mixt with wyne. By
which wordes he plainelye declareth his
intent and purpose, which was that for
the tradition of mengling water and wyne
in the chalice, we should not folow
any other order, then that, which Christ
hymself fyrst vsed. Therefor, if you meane
by your maior proposition, that which
S. Cypriane meaneth, the plaine sense
thereof is this, that as concernyng the offering
of wyne alone, or water alone, we
should folow Christ his tradition only,
which apointeth for the chalice both water
and wyne. But then your argument
will be very ridiculous, as in example:

                  
                     We ought to do that only,Maior. which Christ did,
and nothing els, as concerning the ordering
and tempering of the chalice:
                     But in Christ his institution appeareth,Minor. neither
sole receiuing, nor ministring vnder one
kynd:
                     Therefor (you may inferr whē you will)
that,Conclusio. if all abbeis were destroied, we should
haue fortie egges for a penie.
                  
               
               The maior of this argument is S. Cyprians,
and much staied vpō in his epistle
ad Cecilium. The minor is your owne.
The conclusion ys lawfull and currant.
For to suche agreeable and proper premisses,
euerie conclusion will serue will
inowgh.
               But now if you will haue your maior to
be generall: first I flattly denie it: then I
haue declared that it ys not extant in S.
Cypriane: and thirdly, I answer vnto you,
that you do not beleeue your owne maior,
because that in your communion no
water is put in to the chalice.
               Now as concerning your minor, I graunt
it vnto you, that in the last supper of
Christ, there appeareth no sole receyuing.
I allso confesse, that S. Iustine, and

S. Denyse the Areopag
                     •
                  te, whom you alleage,
do well proue, that in their daies
there were cōmunicants to receiue with
the priest. But, as I must tell you againe,
our question is not of what was done,
but of what might haue ben done then,
and now ys done withowt offence of
God, and breach of Christ his cōmaundement.
               I answer:Defence fol. 26. Christs institution, the example of
the Apostles, the common vse of the fathers,
was otherwaies: therefore the priest should
not communicate without other.
               I denye your argument.Replie. for their vsages
and doinges, are not lawes vnto the
church, so as they may not be altered.
And by this reason you may bring vs to
receiue after supper, because of the institutiō
of Christ,Luc. 24. example of the Apostles,
and cōmon vse of the primitiue church.
As we againe myght bryng yow to take
the sacrament in one kind, because of the
authoritie of Christ, and example of the
primitiue church. But you seeme to yeld
that you haue no expresse commaundement
to bryng furthe agaynst vs, and yet

that notwithstanding, you will haue vs to
be ouercummed. And to this purpose,
you saye:
You haue no expresse cōmaundement,Defence. fol. 26. which
forbeadeth you, to baptyse in the name of
the father only: but that Christ his institution
was otherwyse.
What was the institution of Christ therein?Reply.
was it not, that his Apostles should
baptise, in the name of the Father, the
Soun, and the Holighost? Yet the Apostles
did baptise, in the name of IESVS
only, without mention made of the Father,
or the holighost. Yf thei did breake
Christ his institutiō, thei were not faithful
Apostles, and yet, thei do not seeme to
keepe it, when thei do not baptise in the
name of the three persons. What then
shall we saie? Truly, that you vnderstand
not the institution of Christ, and that the
church is the staie of all the Catholikes,
which doth interprete vnto them Christ
his full mynd and order. And lyke as it
is answered by autentike, and good authoritie,
that in baptising in the name of
Ihesus Christ, the sacrament is full and

perfect. For he which saieth, CHRIST,
cōprehendeth in that one word the father
which anoynted hym, and the holyghost
with whom he was anoynted, and
then Christ, which is by interpretatiō the
anoynted, and so doth make vp the misterie
of the three persons: so in receauing
vnder one kynd, we receaue both flesh &
bloude, as perfectly as if both kindes had
ben ministred: and in receauing alone,
we receaue as much of the true and reall
profit which cummeth vnto vs by the sacrament,
as if all the parishe dyd beare vs
cumpanie at the aultar. Therefor, when
you talke of Christ his institutiō of baptisme,
you speake you can not tell what,
and you know not,Ioan. 3. & 4. I beleue, when Christ
instituted that sacrament. For he baptised
before his resurrectiō, were it by himselfe
or by his Apostells, and he gaue not
the commaundement of baptising,Math. vlt. in the
name of the father, the soun, and the holighost,
before the tyme of his ascensiō.
And againe, when yow tell vs, that we
haue no other proufe against hym, which
would baptise in the name of the father,

then Christ his institution,The bold ignorance of the M. of the defence. yow would
seeme to vnderstand and know all our
reasons and conclusions, and yet you be
as ignorāt in that point, as he which neuer
had readen any other then his owne
doctours. Reade in Petrus Lombardus,
that lerned Bishope, in what sense it may
be true,Senten. li. 4. dist. 3. that one might baptise in the name
of the father, without specifying of
the Soun or the Holyghost. Therefor to
conclude, you haue hytherto, either not
prouyd your purpose, either spoken owt
of the purpose, either made directly against
your owne purpose.
            
            
               The fourth Chapiter.
               
                  THE Catholike in his Apologie,
folowing his principall
purpose, beginneth to shew,
what the priest may doe. And
he alleageth S. Chrisostome, by whom
he would make yt plaine, bothe what
the priest may doe, and what the people
should doe, that yf the people will not
folowe good exhortations, then the
priest without all doubt, maie doe his dutie.

As who should saie▪ if communicantes
were to be had, then were the questiō
a great deale more doubtfull: but if none
will be brought to receaue with the
priest, then is there nothing to staie hym,
but he may receaue alone. For as all surseasing
of sutes in the lawe, ys first to be
wished, and if that can not be obteined,
that then a man may sue for his right: so
all good men may wishe, that the people
should be allwaies well disposed, and yet
yf they will not be brought vnto it, the
priestes may sue for their right. Which
similitude being alleaged, and seruing also
well for this purpose, that if we can
not come to the best, we may laufully take
the next best vnto it, yet the M. of the
defence, doth make such a doe against it,
as though it were a principal argument
of ours, in refelling of which, he might
shew his florishies. And thus he saieth:
In recityng the authoritie of Chrisostome,Defence. fol. 27.
you bring in a similitude or cōparison, which,
of how small force thei be in prouyng, your
lerning can not be so litle, but that you must
needes know.
               
               
                  
The similitude (of which you speake)
was not brought in,Reply. so much to proue, as
to open and expound that, which then
was to be approued. And whereas you
confesse, and we know, that similitudes
are of small force in them selues, wherefor
doe you discusse so narowlie, all the
partes of this similitude, as though there
had not ben one speciall point, for the
which it was alleaged? which is this: Yf
we can not obtaine the best, that then we
should take the next best vnto it. which veritie
being so natural, and reasonable, the
author of the Apologie was not so scrupulous,
as to passe vpon a most perfect
squaring of his similitude, whereas, to his
intent and conclusion, it was, he thought,
well inowgh framed. But yet let vs consider
your wisedome in vsing of your aduersarie,
and the mightie strength of your
reasons, which yow bring furth against
hym.
Besides this you conclude here only the case
of necessitie,Defence. which helpeth the common vse
of the priuate Masse, very lytle.
               
               As for the common vse (as you speake

now) or the ordinarie vse, (as you spake
before) or the terme of necessitie,Fol. 20. p. 1. (in
which necessitie, it seemeth by your owne
confession, that we proue vnto you our
sole receauing, which you call priuate
Masse,) all these are but shiftes of yours,
and starting holes, in whiche you may
couche, before the ignorant, and seeme
to haue some hart left vnto you. As for
vs, if we proue that in necessitie, when
the people wil not receiue, the priest may
take and eate alone: ergo sole receiuing
may be vsed, ergo the indignatiō of God
hangeth not ouer hym which hath no felow
communicantes, ergo we haue our
purpose, which was, to make the state of
our question, not vpon common vse or
ordinarie vse, but generally vpon sole receiuing,
whether, absolutely, it be against
Christ his cōmaundement and his truthe
or no. but let vs come to the forsaid similitude
which so much displeaseth you.
               You make your comparison,Defence betweene thinges
very vnlike and of nature diuers: that is,
betweene possible and impossible, and lawf
                     •
                  ll
and vnlawfull.
               
                  
I wyll not greatly wonder,Reply. if you haue
strainge opinions as concernyng diuinitie,
whereas in naturall matters and reasonable,
yow make new conclusions besides
all truth and consequence. What call
you then impossible? Mary (saie you) that
all cōtention should be banisshed from emong
men in this world. What thinke you then
of virginitie? Is it not as impossible, that
it should be kept of all Christians, as you
thinke it impossible, that an vniuersall cō
                  cord
might be contynued emong men,
whiles thei lyue in this world? No doubt,
but you wyll graunt my saying true, in respect
of the whole number of Christians,
whereas many of the spirituall fathers,
and brothers of your syde, do thinke that
virginitie can not be kept vndefiled, no
not in any one person of the world. As
a Prophete of your owne, boldly preached
at Abingdō, in presence of the whole
deanery,A holy prea
                        •
                     her. to the great commendation,
forsoth, of his chastitie, that
All thinges which beare horne or heare,
must goe to their mate, once a yeare.
But, I thinke not so euil of you, that virginitie

should be altogeather impossible,
mary that generallie it is to be no more
looked for, then surseasing from all contention,
in so miserable a world, I am sure,
you confesse it vnto me. Yet, I dare
to make this similitude, and stand in it
allso againste you, that, lyke as queene apples,
(or take what other name of good
apple yow will) are most to be chosen, and
yet yf a man loue a crabb better, God make
hym mery with it: so it were to be wisshed,
and it ys most best in deed, that all should,
be virgins, yet yf any body haue a mind to
mariage, I am not master of his tast, therein.
How say yow Syr, to this comparison?
will you tell me, that the nature of apples
and virginity,A similitude may be made betwene thinges, in nature, diuers. are very vnlyke? or that
crabbes are sowre, and mariage is sweete?
or that it is impossible that all should
be virgins, but in any markett daie of the
yeare, a man shall find good apples? or
that mariage is honorable, and that crabbes
are meate for swyne? will you make
such a serching or Anatomie of a simple
and plaine similitude, and gather so euill
a sense of it, as either folie or malice can

deuyse? Or els rather, will you examine it
no further, then the present matter and
cause required, for which only the similitude
serued? for as I doe not deny but
that a pleasaunt felow wold make much
sport vpon my similitude, yet neuerthelesse
my meaning is very true and honest:
that if a man will not folow counsell in
the best, he may be suffered to folow hys
fancie, in that which is not the worst.
               Crabbes allso, are not euil, as some choke
peares are, and they add a certen grace
vnto the cupp when they be rosted: and,
to be short, they are not so farr behind
good apples in worthines, as mariage is
farr beneth virginitie, be it spoken without
irreuerencie, vnto the Sacrament of
wedlocke. Therefore, your conclusion,
vpon the Catholikes comparison, is very
false and faultie, because I haue shewed a
good and true similitude, in whiche yet
after your interpretatiō, the one member
is impossible, & the other is possible. Also
your mery folowing of the catholikes
similitude, and your cōcluding (as it were
by the like argument) that bisshopes must

not forbydd priestes to haue such cussons
with whom Si non castè tamen cautè: ys
much lyke as when Iacke an Ape,Neither apes, men: neither the M. of the defēce doth folow well the Catholikes. doth
besides the right waye and maner, put a
reasonable man his cote vpon hymselfe.
For as the suing for our ryght is lawfull,
so will we proue that sole receyuyng is
lawfull: but as the suing for a man hys
right is lawful, so neither you neither we
do thinke, that priestes to haue lemmans
is lawfull. We also come to our conclusion
by an honest principle, as, When the
best is not obtained, let vs yet take the next
best vnto it, but the principle vnto your
cōclusion must be this, (when the best is not
obtained, let vs take that, which is naught.)
Yea truly, not in sport but in sadd ernest,
you make a worse kind of reason, fauling
from the not obtayning of the best, to
concluding of that, which is worse then
naught. As, when you can not haue ministers
to lyue chast, to geaue them free
licence to take open harlottes. whom although
you couer, with the name of wiues
or sisters, yet are they in very deed,
no better, then I haue termed them.

Now after all this, you saye that all our
whole drift ys, by alleaging the corruption
of maners in the world, to proue that
priestes must therefor receaue alone, because
none will receaue with them. But
once againe, I tell you, you vnderstand
not our dryft. for yf the whole worlde
might and would receaue togeather with
a priest, yet we hold, that sole receauyng
is, in itselfe, alowable. And as you do misvnderstand
vs in this, so do you in an other
poynt, saying:
Ye haue taken order for the people,Defence fo. 28. generally
to receaue, only at Easter.
               
               As who should saie,Replie. that the church hath
prouyded, that they should not receaue
generally at other tymes of the yeare, but
only at Easter. Which is as false as God
is true. For the Canon and decree of the
church, is, that who so doth not receaue at
Easter, shall not be accoūted a Christian.
The wordes are these. Omnis vtriusque
sexus sidelis,
                  Cōcilij Lateranensis sub Inno. 3. ca. 21. 
                  postquam ad annos discretionis
peruenerit, omnia sua solus peccata confiteatur
fideliter, saltem semel in anno, proprio sacerdoti,
& iniunctam sibi poenitentiam studeat

pro viribus adimplere, suscipiens reuerenter,
ad minus, in Pascha, Eucharistiae sacramentnm,
&c. and they are thus much in
Englishe, Let euerie faithfull man, woman,
and child, after they come to yeares of discretion,
confesse by them selues, faithfully, vnto
their owne priest, all their synnes, once a yeare
at the least, and studie to fullfill according
to their power, the penance inioyned them,
reuerently receauing the Sacrament of the
Eucharist,
                  Note the M. of the defēce his honesty or knowledg
                        •
                      ī vnderstāding of generall councells. 
                  at Easter, at the least. &c. By
which decree she doth not (I trow,) take
order that the people shall generallie
receaue onely at Easter, but that if they
receaue not at that tyme (ad minus, at the
least,) they shall be punished for it. Declaring
hereby how much she mislyketh, that
the people will not voluntarilie prepare
them selues to receaue their maker, wheras
she is constrained to put furth a law,
that, at the least, they shall receaue at Easter,
or els be accoūted for not Christans.
where lerned you then, that the people
were apointed to receaue onlie at Easter?
Or in what text or glose do you find it,
that the church hath takē order for them,

not to receaue generally at other tymes?
Tell vs, I praie you, whether all be one in
your iudgement, to saye, you shall receaue
at Easter, at the least, and, you shall receaue
only at Easter? The first the church decreeth,
constrainyng thereby, herr childerne
to remember their dutie, and to
receaue the cumfort of their sowles. The
second is only by you imprinted, to make
the laity suspect the gouermēt of the Catholike
Bishopes, as though they should
study how to diminisshe the cōmon peoples
profit and knowledge, and therefor
had taken order and diligence, that they
should receaue only at Easter. What authoritie
you haue to make such open and
wicked lyes, I knowe not. but allthough
it might be geauen, yet a good man wold
not vse it. And allthough you might scape
vnespied, thorough the greate credence
in which your brothers haue you
perchaunse, yet should you not shew such
malice or boldnes towardes the good
and indifferent reader, or towardes a neuer
so euillbeloued aduersarie. But now
to an other matter. An other matter I

maye well saye. For whereas it was consequent,
to bring in the testimonie of S.
Chrisostome, you deferr that ouer vnto
the fifthe chapiter, and occupie the reader
and the replier allso, (when any such
would be found out for you) with the
question of the sacrifice. In which matter,
although I might be long and copious in
answering you, yet, as much as I can prouide
for it, I will be short and compendious,
in declaring the truth. Therefor
let vs heare of you, where your griefe is,
that, by answering yea or no vnto it, we
may the quicklier end this extraordinarie
eruption of yours, against the truth of
our sacrifice. First you alleage, that to
saie, that the priest is bound to offer vpp
the daily sacrifice, ys,
The roote of all the abuses of the Lords
supper,Defence fol. 28. that haue ben brought in to the
church of Christ. &c.
Do you thinke then,Replie. that if priestes were
not bound vnto it, all abuses which haue
sprong vpp (as you saie) would straitwaies
decaie and wither, the roote of them
being taken awaie? But who shall then

stand at the aultar, and intend vpon the
misteries, for dutie sake? And when the
parissheners shall make courtesie, and saie
one to the other, (Goe you, and, nay goe
you, and, by my trothe I am not readie, and
by my trothe then, lett all stand) wyll you
permitt such disorder to contynue, when
the roote of abuses shall be taken awaie
by you? or will you apoint some one or
other, which shall be bound to serue in the
office? whom yet if you will apoynt to
be a reader only, and to haue no further
authoritie, thēto open the boke, and tell
what is writen in it, then shall you disgrace
very much the priesthode and order
of the newlaw, which by all common
reason, should be more worthier, then any
ptiesthode that euer was in the world.
               Now, if you, being venterous to take the
rule of Christen sowles in to your owne
handes, are enforced to keepe officies and
dignities emong you, for the better commendation
of your Ghospell, thinke you
that the wisedom of God, and a God hym
selfe Iesus Christ, would gather a multitude
of natiōs togeather in to one faith,

one hope, and one absolute forme of seruing
and honoring God, and prouide no
officers cōcernyng that effect, ouer them?
Or when he hath apointed most perfect
and excellent offices to be taken and exequuted
of men, for the wealth of his
welbeloued, would he leaue them to their
pleasure, whether they did folow their office,
or no, and lett them stand vnbound
and vncharged? It seemeth then, that as
by his diuine prouidence, he, as man, began
a priesthode to serue for his church,
in matters apperteinyng vnto God, so by
as necessarie consequēce, he charged his
leuetenantes and vnderofficers in that
kind, to exequute his wyll, and doe their
dutie. Wherefor that priestes should be
bound to daily offering (concernyng the
whole body of priesthode, and not euery
particular person) it is so farr of, to be
the roote of abuses, that except such a dutie
were folowed, we should by this tyme
haue had no supper of our Lords at all,
I warrant you. Iniquitie would so much
haue preuailed, when the dayly sacrifice
should haue ceased, and no man his law

could haue continued it, if by the law of
God, it had bēfound vnrequired. And further
I saie, that the church hath brought
in or alowed no abuses in the ministration
of any sacramēt. But you goe forward
and lie:
This is,Defence. fol. 29. wherewith you do pitifully deface
the death and passion of Christ, makyng
your selfe, for your glories sake, as it were
meanes of reconciliation, between God
and his people.
               
               This is a shamefull lie,Reply. yea rather it is a
slaunder, whereas you make the desire of
glorie to haue ben the cause in the church
of Christ, of hauing her priestes endued
with such excellencies and prerogatiues.
And you speake so aduisedlie, as though
Aaron had not stode laudablie, betwyxt
God and the people, when the plague
was sent furth against them,Num. 16. Num. 14. or Moyses
had done presumptuously, to be the spokesman
for the people vnto God, or as
though Christ had not sent his Apostells
euen as his Father sent hym,Io. 20. or S. Paule
had not geauen warnyng vnto the Corinthians,1. Cor. 4
cōcernyng such as he was hym

selfe, that they should take them so, as the
ministers of God, and dispensators or distributours
of his misteries. Againe,
This ys it,Defence. that hath discoraged Christen
people from the often vse and frequenting
of the Sacrament.
As though that,Replie. if there were no priestes
at all, there would be continuall receauing,
or that priestes would receaue more
oft then they do, if they were free and
not bound vnto it. The people (say you)
is left free to come as seldome as they wil.
You speake cuttedly and vntruly: Vntrulie,
because yourselfe confesse, that the
church hath takē order, that the people receaue
at Easter, and then are thei not left
free to come as seldome as thei wyll, which
must come ones a yeare: And cuttedlie,
because thei are left free to come in one
yeare, not as seldome as thei wyll, but allso
and rather as oft as they will. And if
it be in their wil and power, to come euerie
weeke or daie, in which masse is celebrated,
how should the state of the priest
be the cause of stopping their libertie?
               You shall goe with hym for his wysedome,

which being condempned for robberie,
sayed, that if he had neuer praied
to Sainct, he had neuer come to hāging.
As you do now put the cause of the peoples
fault, in the holye order and office
of priesthode. But, I trust, you had somwhat
that moued you against priestes,
about their office of sacrificing. Where
vpon it foloweth:
Sure I am, that neither the institution of Christ
maketh mention of any oblation or sacrifice
to be done by the minister, sauing only the
sacrifice of thankesgeauing, nor yet the scripture
apointeth any bounden duetie for the
priest, more to vse the sacrament, then other
godlie and well disposed Christians.
               
               Whether the priest ys bound to vse the
sacrament, more thē other good people,
it is nothing to the purpose to aske it, except
you take the word (vse) for sacrificing.
I tell you so oft of your euill maner
herein, because you should hereafter amend
it. But for the other matter, which
in deed ys now in question, what if you
reade not in the institution of Christ,
speciall mention, of oblation to be done
by the priest, are you straitwaies at your

wittes end, that you can not tell where
to seeke further for the truth? Doe yow
not know, that our Sauior was found after
iij.Luc. 2. dayes seeking, in the middle of doctours?
and, doe not holy men interprete
vs our Sauiors meanyng, such as ourselues
should neuer find in scripture, yf
we loked till our eies were out, in the letter
only and text of it? Allso where find
you in the institution of Christ, any precise
mention made of the sacrifice of thā
                  kes
geauing? which onlie sacrifice yow
find there, or els you lie. Then, as you
might thinke vs of very small iudgemēt,
if we would denie the sacrifice of thankes
geauyng, because we doe reade no such
word (sacrifice) in the text of Christe his
institution of the sacrament: so, (as we
may be content, that you shew vnto your
selfe therein, some part of fauor, and beleue
that which is not expressie writen)
yet do ye not vse, such argumētations by
negatiues, with vs hereafter, except we
should reason, only for makyng of sport,
or spending of tyme. Yet to declare vnto
you shortly, that some see more then you

doe in this matter, I answer that (hoc facite)
which is to saie, doe this or make this,
standeth emong other his significations
there, allso for sacrificare. For so is facere
taken, in sundrie places of the scripture.
And if you take (facere) in his most common
signification,Leu. 24. lud. 13. Ezech. 45 I saie, that Christ dyd
make an oblation and sacrifice of his bodie,
in his last supper, and his Apostles are
authorised and charged to do as he dyd,
ergo thei were bound to offer, and to sacrifice,
Bishopes also & priestes now must
folow their example, whom thei succede
in office.The priestes are bound to offer. For Christ our Sauior, after he
had ended the eating of the lambe, according
to the manner of the old law, he instituted
and brought in, the eating of his
owne fleshe, of the truth of which the old
paschal was but a figure. Reade S. Hierome
vpon the. 27. of S. Matheu. But the
paschal lambe was off
                     •
                  red vp to God before
it was eaten,Ex. 14. therefor vndoubtedly,
(that the truth might answer the figure)
Christ offered hymselfe in his maundie
before the Apostles receaued hym. Consider
allso, that a sacrifice properlie, ys,

when any thing is made holie to the honor
of God: and what thing in old or new
testament, did euer sett furth the honor
of God more worthely, then the geauing
of his owne flesshe to feede wretches?
               Or where was there any thing euer made
of prophane holie, if not then, when
Christ toke breade in to his handes, and
saied in his allmightines,Math. 26. 
                  This ys my bodie?
I note, besides all this, vnto you, that
in S. Luke his Ghospell it is saied expreslie
of our Sauior, takyng the bread in to
his handes,Luc. 22. 
                  This ys my body, which ys geauen
for you. Not, which shall be geauen
only vpon the crosse, but which presently
is geauen, neither geauen only to you
at this present, as though all consisted in
the eating, but euen now geauen for you,
by which, an oblation, a present, a sacrifice,
or some such seruice of his bodie, is
signified. Thinke you thē, that you might
not reade in the verie institution of the
sacrament, that his bodie was offered of
hymselfe, and that the Apostles had commaundement
to folow his example therein,
if you had a simple and faithfull eie,

to see all that to be true, which the church
spelleth vnto you?
But a sacrifice is a thing geauen vnto God,Defence. fol. 30.
the sacrament was a thing geauen vnto vs,
nothing can therefore be of nature more
contrarie, then your sacrifice, and Christ his
sacrament.
               
               You must not stand herein,Reply. if you doe
well. For Luthers opinion, and Zuinglius
encountring hym in the sacrament, are
a thousand tymes more contrarie,A sacramēt and sacrifice maye stand togeather. thē
a sacrifice and a sacrament. For thei can
neuer be brought to agreement, but sacrament
and sacrifice, doe very quietlie
stand togeather what? Dyd you thinke
that we offered sacrifice vnto any other
then to God? Or if we had any part in it
for ourselues, weened ye, that God must
be vnserued? Marie, Syr, if there were nothing
els, yet because we haue a God,
there is nothing more conuenient, then
to haue a sacrifice for hym, and nothing
to hym ys more wellcome, then his verie
owne soun his body. Were it not a great
absurditie, that of our corne or any lyke
thing, we might make both an offeryng

vnto God, and meate allso for our selues
afterwarde, and that Christ of his bodie,
the true and sweete floure or meale, shold
make no larger commoditie, thē to geaue
vndeserued breade to synners? where
lerned you, that one, the selfe same thing,
can not be both a sacrifice and a Sacrament?
we haue sucked (you saie) our error,
out of the fashions of speaking, which the old
fathers vsed (peruerted yet of vs,) but what
old father or young brother hath taught
you, the mightie contrarietie (which you
speake of) betweene sacrifice and sacrament.
Yet goe to, if we haue mistaken
the old fathers, how well doe you vnderstand
them? you can not denie, but the
old fathers do call the sacrament an oblation
or sacrifice, but you will expound
their meanyng vnto vs. Wherevpon, you
tell vs, that in the beginnyng, the people
at the celebratiō of the Lord his supper,
offered vp, wyne, breade, and other victuals,
partlie to find the priestes, and partlie
to refresshe the poore, and allso to serue
the communion. And so partlie

                     It came to passe (the example being taken firstDefence fol. 30.
                        
of the common people) that the administration 
of the sacrament of this offering, was called
an oblation:
                     An other occasion,fol. 31. that the Doctours vsed
those termes of sacrifieng and offering, was,
that in the celebration of the sacrament, thei 
had praier for all states, and thankes geauing
to God, for all benefites:
                     After,Ibidem. the fathers called euerie good action
a sacrifice, were it priuate or common: And
therfor their successors by litle and litle, bent
the same name, vnto the action and celebration
of the Sacrament:
                     An other cause that the holie fathers call the
sacrament an oblation or sacrifice,Fol. 32. is, because
according to Christes ordenance, we celebrate 
the remembrance of his death and passion,
which was the onlie and true sacrifice.
                  
               
               Where I may begyn to speake against
you,Reply. for this your diuision of sacrifice, I
can not readelie tell, there are so many
thinges, which are to be moued and reproued.
First the imperfectnes, that you
haue vsed in it▪ because you haue not expressed
the full cumpasse of this word,
sacrifice, as the holie Fathers haue vnderstode
it. Then your superfluousnes, because
you make many partes of that, which
you should haue concluded in one member.

As, if euerie good action be called a
sacrifice, thē should you haue well brought
the other kindes which you speake of, vnder
this one signification, as the principall
largest, aboue all other. Allthough
you, in deuising three maners, after which
the fathers take the word sacrifice, do leaue
this one out of the number, by which
euerie good action (as you report) is called
a sacrifice, which yet deserueth to haue
the first place emong them, if that which
is most generall, should not be omitted
in diuiding. Thirdlie your diuision is to
be reproued, for the greate vntruth which
is conteined in it, as I shall declare vnto
you hereafter. If first you will consider,
what an other maner of diuision was to
be lerned out of the Doctours, and in
what sense it is spoken and beleiued of
vs, that a sacrifice propiciatorie is offered
in our misteries.what a sacrifice is. Vnderstand you therefor,
that A sacrifice, is a reuerent seruice
and worshipp, due vnto God onlie. Now
againe: Of sacrificies, some be internall
and inuisible,August. li. 10. de ci
                        •
                     i. Dei ca. 4. other some externall and
visible. The inward and internall sacrifice

may be thus defined: It is that worshipp
and seruice,
                  what an internal sacrifice is. 
                  in which our hart and will is geauen
vnto God, and this is done vpon the
aultar of our hart, when either we burne
the incense of holie and deuoute loue in
his sight, or when we vowe to hym ourselues
and his giftes in vs, or when we remember
his benefites in solempne feastes
and holidaies, or when vpon the aultar of
our hart, with the fyer of charitie, we burne
the offeringes of humilitie and praise,
vnto hym. And this is the pure and acceptable
sacrifice, which onlie God requireth
of vs, not because of his owne
profit and vantage, but that we, by vniting
of ourselues to hym, might liue and
continue for euer with hym. But how
shall a man know, that there is such a spirituall,
inuisible, and acceptable sacrifice?
Of his owne doing a man perchaūse may
know, but of an others mynd, who can
tell, without some externall signe or token
shewed? Againe, if a man would vtter
his owne inward deuotion, how can
he exemplifie it, without some externall
signe, either of bowing of knees, or holding

vp of handes, or lifting vp of eyes,
or knocking of breast, or offering vp of
some gift? yea rather the soule and bodie
being so nigh togeather as they are, it
ys impossible, that the hart & soule, shold
entierlie be occupied, in the true worshipe
of God, and that by no maner of similitude
it shold be perceaued in the bodie.
Therefor, by necessarie and naturall
consequence and folowing, there must
be an externall sacrifice. And that is defined
of S. Augustine, by these wordes,
The visible sacrifice ys a sacrament,
                  what an externall sacrifice is 
                  that ys
to saie, an holie signe of the inuisible sacrifice.
Of this second kind of sacrifice if you require
exāples, you may easelie find them
in the sacrificies of Abel, Noe, Abraham,
and others in the law of nature,Gene. 4. 8. 13. &. 20 and in the
boke of Leuiticus, as concerning the old
law, and in the churches and deuotions
of Christiās in this tyme of grace, as whē
thei offer candells, burne frankincense,
take ashes, beare palme, and do anything
outwardlie to the honor of God. In
which thinges, except the offerer haue an
internall deuotiō and pietie, all those externall

ceremonies are not to him worth
the vsing, and if he be in hart and memorie
fullie disposed and aduised to consider
his owne miserie, and god his mercie,
then are these outwarde actions and
obseruations, holie signes and tokens of
the internall sacrifice, and may be called
externall sacrificies. But let vs speake of
one singular example for all. The visible
and bitter death of our Sauior Christ vpon
the crosse, was an external aud bloudie
sacrifice. But in what sense and meaning?
vndoubtedlie as it was and is called
visible. But what meane I by visible?
I meane, that so painefull maner of hys
hanging by the handes and fcete vpon
the crosse, and so vniuersall a wounding
of euerie part of his pretiouse bodie, so
that from the croune of his heade to the
soele of his feete, there was no whole place
in hym, and the panting of euerie vaine
and stretching of euerie ioynt, and incredible
torment in all his blessed fleshe,
these thinges with manie other, were (I
meane) holie signes of his inward sacrifice,
in which he offered vp (before hym

and to hym which seeth all secreates) his
liffe, his hart, his will, his thankes, his praises
and praiers, and all that was his, for
the sauing of mankind, and satisfieing of
his fathers Iustice. Yea, concernyng the
eies of men, not onlie the sight of God,
who may doubt of his patience, which in
all those tormētes dyd neuer once murmur?
who can mistrust or suspect his charitie,
which emong so manie cruellties
done to hym, forgat not to loue his enemies?
who should not but consider hys
endlesse obedience, whose soule could
not be remoued from the keeping of his
fathers will, when the bodie was disioynted,
the one member from the other? In
verie deed, this was an holie signe and
sacrament, of the inuisible and principal
sacrifice of his pure hart and mynd, and
by this we vnderstand, that God excedinglie
loued man, which of mere good
will and compassion, was content so to
suffer for man. What shall we geaue then
againe vnto God, for all this, which he
hath done for vs? we owe to hym remē
                  brance
of these benefites: we owe vnto

hym thankes: we owe vnto him loue. Remembrance
is moued by representation
and signe: Thankes require a present and
gift to be vttered by: Loue desireth to be
made one with that which is loued.
               To keepe his benefites in remembrance,
we might vse, either reading, or hearing
of his actes out of bokes, or painting of
his passion, and expressing of his liffe in
colours. But images, we knowe are similitudes
only, and are farr from the thinges
themselues. To the signifieing of our
thankes, we might either sing them by
mouth, or sound them by instrumentes,
of shew them in the buylding of churches,
and decking of them with ornamentes.
And as concernyng Loue, we might
fetch deepe sigthes, and haue ernest desires,
but as the seruantes of holie Iob
saied by theire master, in token of their
exceding loue, who might geaue vs to haue
our full of his flesshe?
                  Iob. 31. We ought to render
singular deuotions, because we haue
receaued singular benefites, but our memorie
ys so vnstable, our power so litle,
and our charitie so faint, that allthough

verie reason persuadeth, that we, after a
most best manner, shoulde remember,
thanke, and loue, so mercifull and bountiefull
a Sauior as Iesus ys, yet the miserie
of nature declareth, that we are not able
to doe, either as we should, either, perchaunse,
as we would.
               In this doubt therefor, who shall helpe
vs, but he, which hath dyed for vs? which
because he is made our heade, hath therfor
this office to direct and rule the bodie.
And so trulie he hath done. For in his
last supper he toke bread, and saied This
ys my bodie, he toke the cupp, and saied,
This ys my bloud of the new testament, and
with this bodie and bloud which he hath
and doth geaue vnto vs, we are able to
discharge all our duties, and make a full
and perfect offering. Of which bodie,
and the misteries and treasures thereof,
if I would particularlie speake, all tyme
and studie were to litle for the greatnes
of the matter. But for those three pointes,
the which I make mention of, thei
may be perfectlie brought to passe, in the
hauing and enioying of his true bodie.
               
                  
For as concernyng our charitie and loue,
it is the most that we can desire in the
state of his liffe, to be corporallie, spirituallie,
reallie, faithfullie, bodilie, and
ghostlie ioyned vnto hym, which onlie is
to be loued.Cōmunio. Of which our coniunction
with Christ our God, the body and bloud
which he gaue vnder the formes of bread
and wine, are a signe and sacrament, and
are called in respect of this signification
and effect, 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   in Greeke, Communio in
Laten, and Communion in our Englisshe.
               Then for geauing of thankes, what
greater present is there in earth or heauen,
thē the firstfruct of the virgins wombe,
and the cheifest portion of all creatures,
which is the bodie and bloud of Iesus
Christ? So that if holie Abel, No
                     •
                  , Abraham,
and other, haue testified their inward
sacrifice of thankes, by lambes, corne,
grapes, oyle, and so furth: and if Moises
with all his people hath pleased God,
in offering the firstfructes of their vineyardes,Exo. 23. &. 34.
and glebeland, with firstfructes of
men and beastes,Eucharisti
                        •
                     . in testimonie of the honor
and thankes which thei gaue vnto

God: how much more acceptablie, are
we now able to offer vnto God a most
worthie and pretiouse gift, which haue
receaued for that purpose the bodie and
bloud of Christ, in whose only bodie, the
particular values and prices, of all other
presentes, that euer were vnder any law,
are shortlie cōprised, and reckened summarelie?
And so in this respect, the body
of our Sauior is vnto vs Eucharistia, or a
sacrifice of thankes geauing.
               But now, for the third point, who thanketh
hym, whom he remembreth not? or
who remembreth hym, whom he is not
warned of? or what warning can be greater,
then the reall presence of the partie?
and the partie being present, what is first
cōsidered but his cheefest and worthiest
benefite? That we should therefor allwayes
remember our Sauyor hys deathe,
which he so openly suffered, that all creatures
should behold it, he left vnto vs the
same bodie that suffered for vs.
               In presence of which, yf we wyll not be
brought to remēber him, we wil neuer be
brought. And in this respect, our Sacrament

is called a Sacrifice,Sacrifice. because it is,
vnto all such as haue the true and sincere
faith, a most holy signe and token of that
sacrifice of the crosse, which so long tyme
sence is ended, as concerning the painefullnes
and bloudnies of his crucified
bodie, and yet continueth styll in fresshe
memorie, by reason of the reall presence
of the same bodie which then suffered.
               And lyke as when Easter draweth nygh,
we saye, to morowe or the next daye after,
is the passion of our Lord, because it
is a lyke daye vnto that in which he suffered
hys passion: so, because that in the
misteries of Christians, the representatiō
of Christs perfect sacrifice, which he offered
once for all, ys perfectlie worked,
therfor it beareth the name of that bloudie
sacrifice, which it representeth. For
in deed, we doe not at this daye, sacrifice
Christ bloudelie, but rather celebrate the
memorie of his paineful sacrifice, which
memorie is by no meane, more effectuallie
preserued, then by this, that the same
bodie is now made reallie present before
vs, which at that tyme was sensiblie offered

for vs. But how then is it propitiatorie?
forsoth, because of the offering of
one selfesame bodye. for allthough we
make a cōmemoration only of his death,
& not put Christ to death in deed, yet we
haue (thorough hys gyft) the selfesame
body, which thē being put to death rose
againe to lyffe, that it might neuer more
die, which then was offered vpp bloudelie,
and now is offered misticallie, and is
in both maners the same Christ verelie,
and to the same effect dispensatiuelie.
Therefor, as Christ is the true fontaine
of lyffe, and the euerlasting and shyning
light of cumfort, and as his pretiouse syde
after it hath ben once opened, is neuer
shut vpp and stopped againe, but alwaies
geaueth out the streames of mercy
and peace: so it can not but make for the
clensing of their synnes, which stand before
it, and hope after remission, forgeauenes,
and mercie, by it. And as the word
propitiation, doth signifie nothing els, but
graciousnes, fauor, cause of fauor, or some
such like, so the misticall offering of
his reall person, which is the deseruer and

geauer of all perdon, can not be but propitiatorie
vnto them, which come lowlie
before his gr
                     •
                  ce, and do hym faithful honor,
not withstanding his externall basenes,
and the curteins, whiche he keepeth
hym selfe vnder.
               Thus I haue shortlie declared, what a
sacrifice is: And, that one is internall, an
other externall: And that vnder the name
of internal sacrifice, all pietie and deuotion
of the hart is cōteined, in to how
manie kindes so euer it may be deuided:
And that all good externall actions, done
in respect of God, are comprehended vnder
the name of externall sacrifice, with
all the varietie and number of them, be
they neuer so diuerse and manie. In
which kind of externall sacrifice, I haue
putt the sacrifice of the churche, geauing
warning vnto you, in what sense the
church doth call it a sacrifice.
               And now therefor to returne vnto your
diuision of sacrifice, you maie lerne hereafter
to doe your thinges, in better order.
For the oblations, which the people made,
of bread, wine, and other victualls: likewise

the praying for all states in the ty
                  
                     •
                  e
of celebration
                     •
                  : thirdlie euerie good
act and consequentlie the action of the
priest at the aultar, should haue ben putt
of you, vnder the title or member of externall
sacrifice. And then you should haue
spoken sumwhat of internall sacrifice:
And before you had come vnto that, you
should haue defined vnto vs, what a sacrifice
had ben, that we might haue a little
perceaued your good iudgement in
the doctors. But let vs forgeaue you this
vnskillfullnes, and consider now, whether
that, which you haue spoken without order,
be not spoken allso of you, without
trueth or reason.
               First we agree with you, that the people
made such offeringes as you speake
of.the oblations
of the people, in bread, wine,
and victuals, was not the cause why the doctours call the sacrament a sacrifice. But we denie, that the offering of the
people, was cause vnto the holie fathers,
that they should geaue the title of sacrifice,
vnto the sacrament. For it is vnreasonable,
that the Sacrament should borow
the name of oblation, of the peoples
offering, and not rather the peoples wine
and bread, be honored with that title▪
                  
because of the Sacrament. For in euerie
kind of thing, the first and cheifest in
that kind, is first and formest to be accompted.
As for example, the offering of
Christ, which he made of hymselfe vpon
the crosse, because it was the most perfectest
and best that euer was made, you
should not therefor saie, that by the example
taken of the offering vpp of calues,
sheepe, or lambes, Christ is saied to
be offered, but rather because of his principal
sacrifice, all other must from thence
haue and borow their name. And so because
the oblation, which ys made in the
misteries, is of more excellencie, and of
higher degree, then the offeringes of the
people: no doctour of the church wold be
so vnlike hym selfe, as to call that, which
the priest cōsecrated at the aultar, by the
name of sacrifice, because it was a selected
portion out of the peoples offering.
Againe, yf yt were true, that in respect
that the bread and wyne was taken out
of the peoples offering, therfor the bread
and wine consecrated, should haue the
name of an oblatiō, yet you could neuer

call the priest an offerer, except for some
action, in which his offering might be
perceaued. And this shall be the better
proued, by considering of your example,
which, to shewe your purpose, you bring
out of S. Irenei, which speaking of the
bread and wine, of which Christ saied,
Thys ys my bodie,
                  Iren. lib. 4 cap. 32 
                  thys ys my bloud, witnesseth,
that Christ therein taught them
(not vs, as you conster it, but the Apostles
first, and after them, and by them, vs)
a new oblation of the new testament, which
the church taking of the Apostles, offereth
vpp to God in all the world. Here loe in
this sentence, if it were possible that the
terme (oblation) should be applied, not
properlie vnto the sacrament, but in respect,
(as you thinke) of the oblation of
the people, yet how doth the church offer,
when by your saying, there is nothing
to offer. But consider for shame the wordes
of S. Irenei: He taught (saieth he)
the Apostels, a new oblation of the new testament.
Yf Christ taught them, thei were
to lerning of it: if he taught them a new
oblation, it was such as thei neuer had before.

Yet of the offering of bread and wine,
and such like,Leu. 23. thei had not onlie hard
of before, but were allso offerers of it
them selues, because all the nation of
Iewes had example or commaundement
of it, in the law. Againe, if it were a new
oblation of the new testament, it is plaine,
it was more worth, and more royall,
and more true, then any of the old law,
what tyme all thinges chaunsed vnto thē
in figures,1. Cor. 10. and were done for vs, which
lyue now in the later end of the world.
               And therefor, if in the old law, the priests
oblations were true oblations, and had
not that name or title, because thei were
offered vp before of the people: what a
vile reproche is this, to the euerlasting
and new testament, to saie, that when the
Doctours do speake of the oblation made
at the masse, thei meane thereby, that
the common people made offeringes of
bread and wyne, to serue therewith the
aultar, the priests, and poore beggars.
               Allso, this holie father saieth, That the
church, receauing (that oblation) of the
Apostles, doth offer it vpp to God, in all the

world. Furthermore he bringeth in, the
testimonie of the Prophete Malachie, to
proue that the sacrificies of the old law
should be abolisshed, and one pure and
cleane sacrifice succede them, and please
God more then all thei had done. I haue
no mynd to you,
                  Mala. 1. (saieth God, by the Prophete,
vnto the Iewes, as cōcerning their
sacrificies) because, from the East to the
weast, my name is greate emong the Gentiles,
and in all places there is sacrificed and
offered vpp vnto my name, a pure oblation
or offering, because my name is greate emong
the Gentiles. This testimonie of the Prophete,
S. Irenei alleageth, to proue the
new testament of which he spake. And by
all this, which the church hath receaued,
the Apostles haue delyuered, the Sonn of
God hath taught, the Prophete hath forshewed,
the whole world doth celebrate,
is this (trow you) vnderstanded, that the
people should in the tyme of the new law
and kingdome of Messias, come in to the
churches with bread, wyne, butter, egges,
and cheese, and other good victualls, that
of the bread and wine, which thei offer,

a portion should be taken, to serue at the
communion? I will be short with you,
we the Christians, either haue no externall
sacrifice, and then we be in more worse
and discumfortable case, then euer any
before haue ben, in any kind of religion,
or els we haue an excellent oblation delyuered
vnto vs, as the Prophete Malachie
foreshewed, and Christ exhibited,
and the church obserueth. But this excellent
oblation, and so much spoken of,
is not the oblation, which the people make,
(for the offering of come, wyne, and
victualls, was more largelie and plentifullie
vsed emong Iewes and Panimes both,
then it is with vs) Ergo the Prophete Malachie
spake of an other and better kind
of offering. Ergo allso S. Irenei, dyd not
meane in his sentence by you alleaged,
the simple and obscure oblations of the
people, because he speake of that, which
the Prophete Malachie had writen of.
               Yet to shew the grace which you haue in
vnderstanding of the Doctours, whereas
this present testimonie of S. Irenei maketh
so plainely against you, you saye, that

he expoundeth hymselfe in an other place,
as in the .34. chap. of the forsaied boke,
And signifieth, that he speaketh not of the
offering of the sacrament consecrated,Defence. fo. 30. but
of the bread and wyne, offered partlie to
the vse of the supper, partlie to the finding
of the poore.
It is wonder to see your boldnes.Reply. For the
place of S. Irenei, by which you would
proue this your comment, doth neither
make mention of the vse of the supper,
                  An auncient doctour foulie abused by the M. of the defence. neither
of finding the poore. But rather he
saieth, we make offering vpp to God, &c. offering
vnto hym the firstfructes of his creatures,
&c. and this pure offering, the church
only offereth to our maker, &c. But where
doth he saie in that place (which either
should haue serued your purpose, or els
not at all haue ben alleaged) that the
new oblation of the new testament, and
the prophesie of Malachie, of which he
had spoken in the 32. Chapiter before,
were to be vnderstanded of the bread
and wyne, offered to the vse of the supper,
and finding of the poore? we do not
denie, but that the people offered bread

and wine for such intentes, but you shold
haue proued, that same to be the pure
offering, which the church onlie offereth,
as S. Irenei saieth. Which can not possiblie
be euer concluded, because neither
the offering of the people singularlie pure,
neither the Church onlie doth offer
bread, wyne, and firstfructes, which the
verie panymes, & that naturallie, do offer
vp, against reason, vnto their false Goddes
& Idolls. wherefor you haue brought
S. Ierenei out of place, not to expound
hymselfe, but to confound your miserable
lying. And thus much for the first signification,
which you make of the word oblation
and sacrifice.
               
               Now as concernyng the second, we
graunt, and the church allso hath taught
it you, that there is a sactifice of praier,
and a sacrifice of thankes geauing. But
how can you proue, that the sacrament it
selfe is not allso a sacrifice, that is to saie,
an externall and visible signe, of our thā
                  kes
geauing and praier? for not onlie Te
Deum laudamus, or, Agnus Dei miserere
nobis, are sacrificies of thankes geauing,

and humble praying, but most especiallie
the holie host consecrated. And you
must not by one truth take awaye an other,
as, because no mā wil deny, that the
praiers to God, and prayses of God vsed
in the masse, are true sacrificies, to conclude
therefor, that the bodie and bloud
of Christ, are for vs no sacrifice. Further,
where you saie, concerning the prayers
and thankes geauen at the celebration of
the sacrament:
That the Doctours in infinite places affirme,Defence fol. 31.
that to be the true and onlie sacrifice of
the new testament:
               
               It ys most false and vnreasonable.Reply. For
thankes and praiers are cōnion sacrificies
vnto all religions, and all lawes, new and
old, supernaturall and naturall. And then
if we should speake exactlie, there is none
true and pure sacrifice,Our thankes & praiers are not the onlie and true sacrifice. but onlie that
which our Sauior maketh of hymselfe, in
what so euer forme, place, and maner, it
pleaseth hym to be offered. For all our
Iustice, considered by it selfe, without relation made vnto the holines and merites
of Christ,Esaie. 64. are like the foule clothes

of women, all vncleane and polluted. And
the starres themselues being not cleane in
his sight,Iob. 25. muchlesse any praiers or praises
of men, if without mercie thei should be
considered. Againe, where you drawe the
matter out with more length then truth.

                     That the fathers called euerie good action,
a sacrifice,
                     Defence fo. 31. 
                     were it priuate or common, as
S. Austine allso signifieth: (but you tell
not where) you report of them vntrulie,Reply.
as S. Augustine may proue vnto you. For
he saieth not,Not euery good worke is a Sacrifice, but: that euerie good worke absolutelie,
but euerie worke that is done to
the intent we might cleaue vnto God in holy
societie, is a true sacrifice. As if you should
geaue an almes to one, because he is your
poore frind which asketh it, and not referr
the geauing of it vnto that supreme
end and point, which is God hymselfe, all
though the act be good morallie, yet can
it not be called a sacrifice. After this you
bring in Ireneus,The M. of the defēce occupieth himselfe in matters which are not in question. Eusebius, Chrisostome,
Austyne. but to what purpose? verelie to
proue that which is not denied, that the
Christians do offer vpp the sacrifices of
thankes geauing, of praiers, and the remembrance

of that great sacrifice of the
crosse. For who denieth this vnto you?
I tell you againe, that (to goe no further
then the selfesame places of the Doctours
which you recite) we offer to God most
high,
                  Euseb. de demonstr. Euan. li. 1. 
                  a sacri
                        •
                     ice of praise, but allso as it foloweth,
we offer a ful, a sweete, and holie sacrifice,
after a new sort, according to the new
testament. Yet if you meane the simple
praises of our hart and lippes, thei are
not worth the honor of so manie epithetons
and titles, as Eusebius attributeth
vnto the sacrifice of this owr tyme
of grace.The M. of the defence beatē doune with his owne weapons. Againe, according to the same
Eusebius, true it is, we celebrate the remembrance
of that great sacrifice, but yet we take
that which foloweth, according to the
misteries instituted by Christ hymselfe. By
which wordes he geaueth you to vnderstand,
that the matter hangeth not vpon
your newlie deuised apprehension, by
which we represent vnto our memorie,
the passion and merites of the Soun of
God, but thorough the institution of the
misteries, which the fatihfull haue allwaies
honored, that remembrance of the highe

and bloudie sacrifice, ys continued
and celebrated accordinglie.
               We hold furthermore,Lib. 22. de ciuit. Dei cap. 10. with S. Austine,
that the Martirs are the misticall body of
Christ, but yet we hold allso with hym,
that, at the sacrifice which we offer vnto
God, the Martirs in their place and order,
are named. For as our Sauyor hath
true bodies, one misticall, an other naturall,
so the offering of the misticall, must
not exclude the presence and offering of
the naturall. Yea rather, how can the misticall
bodie be offered, except it be thorough
the presence of the naturall? For
the offering of ourselues, is not the offering
of Christ his whole misticall bodie,
although you affirme it. And if the whole
parisshe would ioyne itselfe neuer so
stronglie togeather, how doe thei offer
S. Peter, S. Paule, and all the rest of the
elect and chosen? But when the naturall
bodie of Christ is offered, (vnto whom,
as the head, all the elect, as members, are
ioyned, and not onlie thei which are departed
this world, or which are in it at this
present, but all thei which euer hereafter

shall be borne, vntill all the number be
fullfilled) then loe and onlie then it is verified,
that Christ his misticall bodie is offered:
because he the head is offered,
which, as cōcerning God his euerlasting
apointmēt, will, and pleasure, neuer wanteth
any one part of hys perfect and full
misticall bodie. Otherwyse how can the
bodie be well offered without the head,
which for that cause onlie is an acceptable
bodie, and worthe offering, because it
cleaueth vnto such an head. Againe, S.
Austine in this place, allthough he denieth,
that the priest offereth sacrifice vnto
the Martirs, yet he confesseth, that the
Martirs are named at our sacrifice, declaring
thereby most plainelie against you,
that we haue a sacrifice, which thei are
not, but at which thei haue a due and
conuenient commemoration.
               
                  Likewyse againe, we saie with Chrisostome
as you doe,
                  Chris. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . 17. ad Hebr. that we offer euerie daie,
doing it in remembrance of his death: but we
add further out of the same place, that
this sacrifice is one, and not manie. And allso,
that we do not offer vpp now one, tomorow

an other, but allwaies the selfesame.
For els, because it is offered vpp in manie
places, thei be manie Christes. Not so. But
Christ is euerie where one, being whole both
here and allso there, one bodie. For lyke as he
which is offered vpp euerie where, is one bodie,
and not manie bodies, euen so is the sacrifice
allso one.
               Therefor to conclude with S. Austine,
true it is, that in our sacrifice, there is a
thankes geauing and remembrance of the bodie
and bloud of Christ,
                  Aug. 
                        •
                     . de fide ad P
                        •
                     . (but consider that
which foloweth) that he gaue and shedd for
vs. By which wordes he willeth you to
vnderstand, that we haue in deede a remembrāce
of Christ his body and bloud,
not in respect of his reall absence from
vs, but in respect of his painefull suffering
for vs. You may see then by this tyme,
that you haue proued a sacrifice of praiers,
of thankes geauing, and a remembrā
                  ce
of Christ his passion to be celebrated
in the church, (which the scholes did teache,
manie hundred yeares before you or
Luther war borne, and which we knowe
better then you) and that you may be ashamed

to haue gone so farr besides the
purpose, being in deed able to disproue
by no authoritie the sacrifice propitiatorie
of Christ in his church,An euyll maner of reasoning by authoritie, negatiuelie. against which
all your malice is. I except this argument
onlie, which in deed your wisedome doth
vse more then once, when you saie: Eusebius
here maketh no mention of propitiatorie
sacrifice,
                  De demōst. euang. li. 1. Aug. lib. de fide ad Pet. and, S. Austyne saieth not, that
here is an offering of Christ his bodie and
bloud for sinnes, Ergo there are no such thinges
at all. As though that all thinges could
be spoken at once, or all misteries should
be straitwaies reuealed, or as though there
were no difference, betwyxt not speaking
of the thing, and denieing the thing.
In which kind of reasoning, you cōtinue
for the reste of your chapiter, alleaging
out of S. Cypriane, (you tell not where)
& out of the Greeke canō of the Masse,
that thei offered for our Ladie, and out
of S. Chrisostome, that thankes were offered
for the whole world, and as well for
them which were before, as them which
shall come after, of which you conclude,
saying:

                     
This was their offering for the dead,Defence. fol. 34. and
not a practise to pull soules out of purgatorie,
for merchandise and monie, as you
haue vsed in your priuate Masse.
               
               This ys your practise, both in reasoning
and in slaundering.Reply. In slaundering, because
you attribute vnto our religion, a
selling and byeing of soules out of purgatorie
for monie, which you neuer find
to be taught or alowed of any one good
man, and much lesse of the whole church:
In reasoning, because you conclud, that
not to be at all in the author, which you
find not expressed in some place which
pleaseth you. For (to cōtinue in the testimonies
which you doe bring) allthough
S. Cyprian,Cyp. li. 4. Ep. 5. in the .5. epistle of his fourth
boke, make mention of sacrifice for martirs,
vndoubtedlie to thanke God for thē,
yet in his first boke and .ix. epistle,Lib. 1. ep. 9 he proueth,
that there is an oblation which the
priestes doe make for the deade, such as
were no martirs, and he testifieth allso of
a deprecatiō and praier which the church
vseth in their names. For in chargeing
the clergie, vnto which he there writeth,

to make no oblation and praier, for the
soule of one Victor, which had transgressed
a canon and decree of the Bisshopes,
he sheweth therewithall, what the clergie
would haue done, had not his cōmaundemēt
staied them, and he proueth that,
for some kind of such as were departed,
not onlie praises and thankes, but supplications
rather and praiers were offered.
               Then as concerning the greeke Canon,
which of them you did meane, I cold not
tel, but now, by reason of M. Grindal sermon,
which he made not long sence at
an Englisshe funerall, of Ferdinand the
Emperor, it is euident vnto me, that you
meane the masse of S. Chrisostome. In
which,One truth must not be impugned by an other. allthough I can not find any oblation
made for our ladie, the prophetes,
or Apostles, (allthough that a commemoration
of thankes may be offered also
for them,) yet if it were true, that in one
place of that greek Canon, an oblation
were made for our ladie, that doth not
proue, but in an other place of the same
Canon, an expresse oblation and praier
was made for the deade, such as were not

yet at rest. For after the consecration of
the sacrament ended, he saieth within a
few lynes,Chris. in Liturg. 
                  we offer vnto the, this reasonable
seruice, for those which slepe and rest in the
faithe, for our fathers and our greate graund
fathers, thorough the intercession of Patriarches,
Prophetes, Apostels, Martirs, and
all Sainctes. But especiallie, for the supplications
and praiers, of the perpetuall virgin
Marie mother of God, our Qnene, for euer
blessed, vndefiled, and most holie, Sainct Iohn
the baptist, prophete and precursor, the holie
and most renoumed Apostels, and the Sainct
whose memorie we celebrate, and all thy
Sainctes, visite vs (o God) and remember all
them which sleepe in our Lord, in hope of the
rysing againe vnto euerlasting life, and graūt
them rest, where the light of thy countenance
doth intend ouer them.
               
               Now againe, allthough you alleage a
true saying out of S. Chrisostome, vpon
the .viij. Chapiter of S. Mathew, that the
priest standing at the Aultar, when the
sacrifice is sett furth, commaundeth the
standers by, to offer vp thankes to God
for the world (in which testimonie it ys

playne to see, that the sacrifice proposed
is one thing, and the sacrifice of thankes
an other) yet, (to lett goe this vantage)
you can not denie but he in an other place
saieth,Chris. ho. 3 ad Philip. 
                  It was decreed by the Apostles,
not in vaine, that in the celebratiō of the venerable
misteries, a memorie should be made
of them, which were departed hence. Thei
knew, that much commoditie and much profit
dyd come hereof vnto them. For the whole
people standing by, with lifting vpp their
handes vnto heauen, and also the cumpanie of
priestes: and the venerable sacrifice being laied
out and proponed, how should we not pacifie
God, in praying for them?
               
               Therefor it is cleare, that your argument
is verie vnlerned and childissh, to
saie, that Chrisostome vpon the .viij. of
Mathew, maketh mention onlie of thankes
geauing for all men which are passed,
or which are to come, ergo there is no
other sacrifice but thankes, to be offered
for the soules departed: or els, (to declare
more sensiblie the absurditie of your
reason,) ergo in hys thirde homelie vpon
the epistle vnto the Philippians, he

hath no word of the Apostels tradition,
that in the presence of the reuerend misteries,
praiers shold be made for the deade,
to cause God to be mercifull vnto
them. But see againe:
S. Ambrose offered for Valentinian the
Emperour then dead,Defence. and S. Ambrose
doubted not of his saluation, ergo he dyd
no more but thanke God for hym.
               
               This is your argument without reason
and knowledge.Reply. For euerie soule, of whose
saluation we need not to doubt, is not
straitwaies in heauen. As S. Austine, allthough
he doubted not but that his mother
Monica, dyd yeld at her death a saued
soule vnto God, of whom he testifieth,
that she so lyued, that God was praised
in her faith and maners, and that she
was a mercifull woman, and forgaue all
them which had trespased againste her,
and that she came euerie daie to church,
and serued God before the aultar, from
which she knew the holie sacrifice to be dispensed,
by which the byll of debt, which was
contrarie vnto vs, was put out and cancelled,
Yet for all this, knowing the accompt,

which euerie soule shall geaue,Mat. 12. for the
least word that is spoken against the cō
                  maundementes
of God, and leauing a
side her good deedes, for which he ioyfullie
thanketh God, he praieth for his
mother, that her sinnes might be forgeauen,
and saieth, Lett no creature pull
her from thy protection.
                  Conf. lib. 9. cap. 13. 
                  Let not the lyon and
dragon put hym selfe in betweene, neither by
force, nor by subteltie: &c. Graunt, that she
may be in peace with her husband, before
whom and after whom she was maried to no
other, &c. And inspire, in to thy seruantes
my brothers, and thy childerne my masters,
that, as manie of them as shal reade these thin
ges, may remember at thy aultar, thy seruant
Monica with Patricius her husband.
               
               Therefore that you maie know your
folie, and lerne from hence forward to
harken vnto the whole tale, before you
geaue definitiue sentence, I will saie vnto
you with S. Austine vnto Laurentius, It
ys not to be denied, that the soules of them
which are departed,
                  In Enchiri dio, c
                        •

                     otion of their frindes lyuing, when the
sacrifice of our mediator ys offered for them,

or when almeses are geauē in the church. &c.
and, in the end of the chapiter, he concludeth,
Therefore, when the sacrificies, either
of the aultar, either of any kind of almes,
what so euer it be,
                  Prayers & helpes for the dead. 
                  are offered, for all such as
haue departed with baptisme, they are for 
the verie good, thankes geauing: they are 
propitiations, for such as are not verie euill:
for the starke naught, allthough they are no 
healpe, as concerning them being now dead,
yet they are cumfortes, (such as they are,)
for the quicke. Vnderstand you this Englisshe?
and do you marke, how one selfesame
sacrifice, doth serue to render
thankes by it, and to be allso a propitiation
for sinners, such as die not desperate?
Will you beare awaie the distinctiō
of three sortes of men, which S. Austine
here maketh? and see by reason, that some
die in such case, as not praises but
praiers rather are to be made for them?
doe so I praie you then. And neuer fill
your papers in writinges or your audience
eares in preaching, with such argumentes,
as are taken of authoritie of holie
fathers negatiuelie, or with such commendaciō
                  
of one truth, as craftelie shall
disgrace an other,Note the sheepe skinnes of 
                        •
                     eretykes. as true. Like as manie
vse to proue, that the true fast ys in absteinyng
from synn, (which no man denieth,)
and inferr therevpon wylilie, that
to absteine from corporall meates, serueth
not to any kind of reasonable fasting.
Or, as some do shew by manie authorities,
that Christ is to be receaued
spirituallie by fayth, and denye therefor,
that he ys eaten reallie, which yet is as
true, as the other. Or lyke as you in this
chapiter, haue abused your reader, in
prouing a sacrifice of prayers and thankes
geauing, and denying any oblation
to be in the church for sinnes, which yet
the holie fathers in theyr writinges haue
expressed.
            
            
               The fifthe Chapiter.
               
                  IN this chapiter, you find fault
with the Catholike, that he
alleageth the place of Chrisostome,
other wise then it ys
in hym. which as concerning the interpretation
of Musculus, you myght saye

perhappes, but, (I trowe,) ye should not
report of him, that he reciteth the place
otherwyse then it ys in S. Chrisostome,
except you disproued hym by the greeke
text it selfe, which you haue not. And
trulie, what great reproueable diuersitie
should be, in saying: Sacrificium frustra
quotidianum offerimus, or, frustra habetur
quotidiana oblatio, whereas both come to
one end, that the dailie oblation or sacrifice
ys made in vaine, I can not redelie tell,
except you mislike the terme of offering,
and thinke that the hauing of a daylie sacrifice,
might be made without the act of
offering. But goe to, for quietnes sake,
we are content with Musculus interpretation,
and what saie you then vnto the
argument of the Catholike? The wordes
of S. Chrisostome are these: Frustrà habetur
quotidi
                        •
                     na oblatio, frustrà stamus ad
altare, nemo est qui simul participet, Our
daylie sacrifice ys had in vaine, we stand at
the aultar in vaine, there ys none to take
part with vs. By this testimonie, to conclude
shortlie, there was dailie sacrifice in
S. Chrisostoms tyme, and there was not

daylie receiuing with the priest, ergo to
haue communicantes, is not of the substance
of the Catholike masse. Vnto this
argument, I find, as it were fower answers
for your defence, of which the first
ys, that
Chrisostom, to exaggerat the peoples slacknes,
saieth, (there ys none to be partaker) meaning
they were verie few and seldome,Defence. fol. 37. The first answer to S. Chrisostomes places. in
comparison of that their dutie was.
               
               Do you thinke then, that euerie daie,
there was one or other of the people,
which dyd come to the communiō? then
dyd he not stand in vaine at the Aultar,
except you can proue, that in that world,
such a canon was made, that there should
be no communion without .iij. to receiue
at it: on the other side, if in any one
daie at all, there was found no one to cō
                  municate,
the sacrifice being offered euerie
daie, it was celebrated some tymes
without cōmunicants. For, it is not materiall
vnto vs, whether the people receiued,
some at Easter, some at tweluetyde,
and other some more ofter, but whether
as the oblation was daylie, that so the receiuing

appropriated (as you thinke) vnto
it, should haue ben dailie. And all the
authorities which you bring of S. Ambrose,
Austine, Chrisostome, and Concilium
Elibertinum, to proue that the people
dyd communicate more then once in
the yeare, and that greate fault was found
with manies slacknes in that behalfe:The M. of the defence speaketh out of his purpose, to the Catholikes commoditie. as
thei do make directly against hym, which
would mainteine the opinion, that the
people neuer receiued but at Easter, so
thei confirme rather our cōclusion, which
is, that communicantes are not necessarie
at euery tyme of masse to be celebrated.
For, whereas the Bisshopes or Synodes,
as you confesse, apointed and charged
the Christians to receiue once, twyse,
thryse, or fowre tymes in the yeare, and
whereas the councell called Elibertinum,
decreed that all the faithfull should communicate,
at the least, thrise in the yeare,
it may be verie well gathered hereof, that
there was no daylie receauing with the
priest. Because the councell, in charging
them to receiue thrise at the least, sheweth
thereby consequētlie, that thei came

not so oft, as thrise in the yeare. And S.
Ambrose, in that he reproueth the custome
in the East partes,Amb. li. 4. de Sacra. of receiuing no more
then once a yeare, he proueth therein
vnto you, necessarilie, that there was such
a custome. Wherfor, to graunt vnto you,
that S. Chrisostome, in saying there is none
to communicate, vseth a certen exaggeration,
and meaneth that there are verie few
and seldome which communicate, yet the
sacrifice being dailie, he offered and receaued
some tymes without communicants.
For allthough a few might haue
come dailie, and so haue made vp a communion,
yet when S. Chrisostome meaneth,
(after your comment vpon hym)
that they came seldome allso, there were
vndoubtedlie some vacant daies betweene,
in which the dailie sacrifice was offered,
and yet none dyd cōmunicate with
the priest.
               But let vs come to your second answer,
in which you saie, that allthough this place
dyd proue,the second answer. that none of the common
people would cōmunicate, (wherevpon
we haue concluded, that the priest receiued

alone, for any cummyng of theirs)
yet, saie you to vs:
Ye can not,Defence fol. 37. by this testimonie, declare, that
none of the ministers and clergie receiued
with hym, being Bisshope there. &c. for the
maner was not then, as you do vse it now.
&c. but all the ministers and clergie dyd
communicate togeather with the Bisshope,
or chiefe minister that celebrated.
               
               You speake herein verie reasonablie,Reply.
that the Bisshope hymselfe celebrating,
had (according vnto the manner of that
tyme) not all the cleargie, I beleeue, but
allwaies some of them to communicate
with hym. And lykewyse in Cathedrall
and principall churches, it is verie credible,
that some of the clergie dyd receaue
with the chiefe minister. Such was the
order then, and manner in the churche.
But how can you proue, that the Bishope
hymselfe, celebrated euerie daie, solemplie?
or that he said masse allwaies in a
greate or Cathedrall churche, with his
priestes, archedeacōs, deacons, and other
officers, about hym? Or that there were
no small and litle parisshe churches; oratories,
chappells, and such like, in that

world, whiche one priest and a clarke
might haue serued well inough, without
more cumpanie of the clergie? Then allso,
if the populous cities of Antioche or
Constantinople, (in which S. Chrisostome,
dyd bestowe the most of his life and
lernyng,) had either but one Cathedrall
church, (which is as conuenient and reasonable,
as one citie to haue one Bisshope,)
or if they had a number of faire and
greate churches, and them all furnisshed,
with priestes, archdeacons, deacons, subdeacons,
readers, singers, exorcistes, and
other officers perteinyng to the clergie:
yet, that the clergie and ministers, dyd
euerie daie receiue with the priest at the
aultar, (as we graunt that somtymes they
dyd so in deede,) or that the sacrifice
went not forward, except some cōmunicantes
were prepared, (which properlie
ys our question,) I denie it flattlie vnto
you, vntill you can proue the contrarie.
For I see no vrgēt cause, why I might
not thinke, that the clergie allso of that
tyme, was slacke in the dailie cummyng
to the communion, and that thei hauyng

one to exequute and to offer the dailie
sacrifice, for the rest, cōtended them selues,
with communicating in praier onlie
and spirituall eating, and not in the Sacramentall
receiuing. Especiallie if it be
considered, how vehementlie S. Chrisostome
noteth and reproueth his clergie,
for laughing not onlie abrode with good
merie felowes, but allso in the church it
self,Chr. ho. 15. Epist. ad Hebr. at the tyme of praier. Against whom
emong other strange argumēts, and well
worth deepe consideration, this ys one,
that he saieth, The priest of God doth stand
offering vp the praiers of all, and thow doest
laugh, and he trulie doth tremble in offering
praiers for the, and thou settest light by the
matter. By which, it is credible, that not
only the people, whō canons had need to
cōstraine to come thrise a yeare to receiue
their maker, did suffer the priest to receiue
alone, but that allso in the clergie,
there was such lacke of consideration (as
it ys in manie Catholikes now, whose faithe
is stedfastinough) that thei were not
in hast to accumpanie dailie the prieste
which celebrated, nor glad to make them

selues readie to communicate with him,
but talked or laughed (the more pytie) to
geather, thinking perchaunse that all will
be well inough, because the priest, in all
their names, offereth a most acceptable
sacrifice for thē. The which fault, I would
it were not emong the Catholikes, and
that thei would keepe themselues as attent
and deuoute, when thei heare masse
onlie, mynding not to communicate
sacramentallie, as the truth is, that their
part is in the oblatiō, and remember that
not onlie the priest must behaue hymself
reuerentlie, but all the clergie and laietie
present, though thei stand neuer so farr
from the aultar. Therefor, as we will not
stryue against you in this one poynt, that
the ministers receiued with the Bisshope
or chiefe priest, so we bydd you to proue
it, that allwaies the ministers dyd cō
                  municate,
when the daylie sacrifice was
offered. Which, because you thought (as
I gesse) that it shold be ouer hard for you,
therefor you inuent a third shift, for your
defence, which is this:
But if I should flatlie denie,Defence. fo. 38. that the minister

receaued, when none of the people were partakers,
how could you proue it,A third answer or shift. by this place?
               
               This is your third answer to S. Chrisostome.
As who should saie,Reply. if I can not
proue, first, that the people dyd communicate
with the priestes, or secondly, that
the clergie did allwaies communicate, yet
thirdlye will I answer, that the priest at
the aultar dyd not receaue, when he saw
that none wold come and eate with him.
And here, you require our proufe against
our saying: vnto which I answer, that because
the oblation and sacrifice was dailie,
therefor it was offered and taken of
the priest, allthough none were prepared
to receaue with hym. But you are
not pleased with this, and therefor you
interprete S. Chrisostome, that
He named it oblationem,Defence. fol. 38. either for that it
was done in remembrance of Christs sacrifice,
or for the offering vp of the bread
and wyne, to the celebration of the Lords
supper.
Well Syr,Reply. first of all, what vnderstand you
by that, which, you saie, was doone, in remembrance
of Christs saerifice? Can, you
vnderstand any other thing but the taking

and blessing and breaking of bread?
for in doing these thinges, we folow
Christs example, and remember his passion.
Yf then, according vnto your first
sense of this terme, oblation, you graunt,
that, without anie to cōmunicate, the priest
alone dyd offer, ergo you graunt as much
as we require, that the priest dyd take,
blesse, and breake, in remembrance of
Christs sacrifice.
               But on the other side, if you take the
word,The M. of the defence put to the foile on bo
                        •
                      the sides. oblatiō, for the offering vp of bread
and wine for the prouision of the Lords
supper, that was not the priests offering,
of whiche S. Chrisostome speaketh, but
it was the offering of the people. And
according vnto this your sense, S. Chrisostome
could not saie, that there was
none to communicate, because the good
people, which offered the bread and wine
towardes the supper of the Lords, were
in that point, not onlie communicantes,
but allso chiefe ministers and doers.
Or, at the least, the priestes and poore
folke, which were susteined by such oblations,
were neuer so euill taught, that

they would not remember their dailie
bread, or so wel fedd otherwyse, that they
needed not to care for the welthiers almes,
and make S. Chrisostome to complaine
vpon it, that there is no bodie to
communicate. And further more, none
of these .ij. kindes of oblations, of which
you now speake, were in vaine or fructlesse
vnto the people, but as concernyng
the oblation which S. Chrisostome meaneth,
his wordes be plaine, that the dailie
oblation ys in vaine offered. Allso, if these
wordes, (dailie oblation and sacrifice,) by
putting the case that none at all dyd receaue,
are to be vnderstanded for that
which is done in remembrāce of Christs
passion, or for the offering vp of bread
and wine to the celebration of the Lords
supper, you leaue (I do trust) a more excellent
sense of these wordes (dailie oblation,)
for that tyme and place, when the
people doe communicate with the priest. For
if you doenot, then is the oblation all
one, whether some or none do receaue:
and if you doe, then must you tell vs of
one waie more, of taking this word oblation,

then you haue yet vttered. Againe
if a man will consider how royallie, and
yet trulie,ho. 3. ad Ephes. S. Chrisostome in the forsaid
homelie, speaketh of this dailie sacrifice,
calling it an oblatiō, at which the verie Angells
doe tremble,
                  Consider how reuerentlie we shold behaue our selues in the presence of the sacrament. and warning the people
to thinke well vpon it, how the kings table
standeth there, that, the Angels are wayting,
and seruing at it, that, the king hymself
is present, that, Christ the lambe of God is
offered vp: further, if one should marke
wel, but those externall preparations, of
which he there speaketh, as, the drawing
a syde of curteines, the making cleane of
the table, the setting down of patins with
all reuerence and diligence, can he thinke
that S. Chrisostome dyd meane, by dailie
sacrifice, no more but a remembrance
(you doe not tell what) of the sacrifice
which Christ made vpon the crosse, or els
the onlie offering vp of bread and wyne
towardes the mainteaning of the Lords
supper? But let vs goe further. Yf you be
so cunnyng, in expounding of (oblation)
against the mind of the author, and besides
all colour of reason, make an end of

your comment, and tell vs what Chrisostome
meaneth by quotidiana, dailie?
               
               
                  He calleth it Quotidianam,Defence fol. 38. to the imitation
of the sacrifice of the old lawe.
May one then imitate the old law in speaking?
he may doe it vndoubtedlie.Reply. Yet
you, fo. 33. of your defence, do make that
odiouse, by an vnreuerent and suspitiouse
manner of vttering it, which in itselfe is
honest and lawfull, and which yourselfe
do vse at this present. For to saie, Quotidianam,
and daylie sacrifice to be so called,
to the imitation of the sacrifice of
the old law, it soundeth well and tolerablie,
and yourselfe do take S. Chrisostome
an that sense to no dispraise or contempt
of hym. Yet when the Catholikes
now a daies, call their misteries by the name
of sacrifice, you will not saie, that thei
haue taken that manner of speaking out
of the old law, (for that soundeth to no
reproche) but of the Iewisshe priestes,
as who should gather a suspition of Iewisshnes
vpon vs. It is worth the noting,
because it is worth the amending. But to
S. Chrisostome his Quotidianam, what

answer you?
               He calleth it Quotidianam.Defence. &c. not because
it was done euery daie, without intermission.
               How then doth it imitate the old law,
which had dailie offering?Reply. or how can it
be called Quotidiana, which is dailie? The
dailie sacrifice of the old law, was .ij. lambes
of one yere, without spott, which God
apoynted to be offered vp in sacrifice,Nu. 28. euerie
morning and euening, for euer, and
thei made the quotidianum, the iuge, and
the dailie sacrifice of the Iewes. You saie
therefor,the inconstancie of the M. of the defen. and vnsaie. First, that the sacrifice,
which S. Chrisostome calleth Quotidianam,
is so termed, to the imitation of
the Iewes, whose dailie, and speciallie allso
dailie sacrifice is cōmaunded by God
to be allwaies continued, and then you
tell vs, that it was not done euerie daie
without intermission, which is in effect to
saie, that it is not called quotidian to the
imitation of the Iewes. Yet lett vs heare
further:
He calleth it Quotidianam, not because it
was done euery daye, but for that it was oftentymes
celebrated,Defence. fol. 38. that is, so often as the

people assembled togeather to the church or
common place of prayers etc. at which tymes,
he allwaies had, either some of the people,
or the residue of the ministers and clergie,
to communicate with hym.
               
               Marke here,Reply. gentle Reader, the folissh
hardines of this M. of defence, and consider
by this one example, how wickedly
the lerned and holy doctours are abused.
Dyd the seruice then of the church, depend
vpon the cummyng of the people?
or dyd some one or other allwaies receaue,
when the dayly oblation was offered?
where should we seeke more better for
the truth of this question, then in Saint
Chrisostome hys owne masse and workes?
for as concernyng the daylie saying
of masse in the latin church, it ys plainely
concluded by the testimonie of S. Austine,
which reporteth of hys mother, that
she serued and honored God at hys aultar
nullius diei pretermissione,
                  Conf. li. 9. cap. 13. without letting
one day passe. But let vs be contented
with that which S. Chrisostome alone
shall geaue vs. It appeareth then in
hys masse, that they had for euerie ferie

in the weeke, a certen song in the prayse
of our ladie, S. Michel, S. Iohn the Baptist,
and other,Chrisost. in Liturg. which they vsed immediately
after the Ghospell, and called it apoliticion.
Further it appeareth, that they
dyd not first aske emong the people who
were disposed to receiue, and vppon the
answer geauen,That the sacrifice of the church was dailie in deed, & not dailie, that is to saie often. frame the matter to a cō
                  munion,
but first of all they went to the
consecration, and after that the oblation
was finisshed, and the priest with such about
hym as would, had receyued, then
dydd the Deacon turne hymselfe to the
people, and saie, Come you neere in the feare
of God. Which is confirmed by Sainct
Chrisostome againe, in hys Homelies vpon
the Epistle vnto the Hebreus, where
he fayeth, that the Deacon cryeth out,
and calleth vnto the people with these
wordes, sancta sanctu, which ys, these holie
thinges are for the holie, not before the
priest doth consecrate, but, hanc emittit
vocem post
                        
                           
                        
                        quam
                      sacrificiū perficitur, he speaketh
this word after the sacrifice is thoroughly ended.
Wherfor as the offering of the sacrifice
did not then hang vncertenly vpō the

cummyng or going of the people, so, it
ys vnreasonablie and vnlernedlie spoken,
that the daylie sacrifice had that name,
not because of the daily celebration, but
because of the seldome vsing of it, when
the people dyd gather themselues vnto
the churche. Furthermore, yf for your
pleasure sake, (Quotidiana) when we talke
of oblation, doth not signifie dailie, what
will you saie vnto singulos dies, euery daie:
by which we shal better perceaue the disease
of your quotidian. Nónne per singulos
dies offerimus?
                  ho. 17. ad Hebr. sayeth Chrisostome,
Doe we not offer vpp daie by daie? how can
so expresse mention of offering daye by
daye, be interpreted of you, (without a
manifest lie) to signifie a sacrifice celebrated,
not daylie, but oftentymes? you
haue readen allso, (yf you remember it,)
that the greeke church in the lent season
dyd not celebrate but vpō saturdaie only
and Sunday, vsing for the rest of the weeke,
those hostes which were consecrated
before. And what other thing ys this speciall
obseruation of theirs,Concil. Const. 6. can. 52. in the lent,
but a manifest argumēt that all the yere

before and after, they vsed daylie consecration?
Therefor trulie Syr, you were
to hardie in ventering vpon so strainge
and vntrue interpretation of quotidian
sacrifice, especiallie whereas in so doing
you are come within daunger of much folie.
For whereas by dryuing of your dailie
oblation vnto seldome, you would seeme
to gather cumpany for euery such seldome
oblation, you forget the Sundaies and
manie feastes of our blessed Ladie, Apostels,
and Martirs, which in the primitiue
church were deuoutlie obserued, by fasting,
watching, lying on the ground, and
praying, vnto all which, the people resorting,
if thei dyd receaue at them all, then
make you S. Chrisostome, yea and S. Ambrose,
S. Austine, and the councell named
Elibertinum, verye forgetfull and hastie,
which either reproued the people, because
thei dyd communicate onlie at Easter,
or at some one or two feastes more in the
yere, either prouided against their slacknes,
that thei should receaue at the least
thrise a yere. Whereas, (after your saying)
there failed no such daie, in which

the people assembled togeather for praier
sake, but that ordinarilie communicants
were readie to go vp and receiue with the
priest. Which yet is so vnlikelie, (that, I
meane, at euerie holydaie, the cummyng
togeather of the people, dyd allwaies serue
to haue cōmunicants) that you maie
well doubt, whether the best emong the
people dyd receaue at the verie principall
feastes and solemnities. For, by S. Chrisostome
hymselfe it appeareth, that the
end of his vehemēt calling vpon the people,
was not, to haue them in all hast to
cōmunicate, but to make them prouyde
for cleanes of lyffe and conscience, that
thei might safelie and profitablie cōmunicate.
For,Hom. 17. ad Hebr. sayeth he, we doe alowe, neither
those which receaue once, nor those which often,
nor those which seldome, but those which
come with a pure conscience. And the preparation
which thei were bydd to make,
was of such reuerent manner, that euen
the honest maried men should absteine
from the cumpanie of their lawful wiues,
certen daies before thei receaued, as it is
manifest by a decree of Concilium Elibertinum,
                  
and by S. Austyne in his sermons
vnto the people.Ser. 2. do. 10. post trinitatem. What would S. Austine
thē, or the fathers of the primitiue church
haue thought of your maried priestes,
which within an houre, two, or three, after
thei are departed frō their paramours,
doe come vnto the cōmunion table with
heades full of wordlie cares and nightes
fansies, and there dare to call for the people,
and presse them, (if thei come not)
with the institution of Christ, and Paule
the first vnto the Corinthians the .xj.
chapiter? Whereas, if there were any reuerence
or regard of Christ, in this new
law of yours, the example should neuer
be suffered, by which his speciall ministers
might be prouoked vnto carnalitie. For
if laie men, before thei communicated,
were cōmaunded to absteine from their
lawful wyues, what doth a minister, a mā
of God, and quicke of the sprite, with an
vnlawfull woman or yokefelow, which
shold exhort others to the right and worthie
manner of receiuing? And againe,
if such cleanes was required in them,
whose life was occupied in worldlie busines

and labor, how could thei receaue
dailie, which could not be readie dailie?
And yet the dailie seruice of the church
failed not, because that peculiar and proper
ministers were found to intend vpon
it, and the sacrifice depended not vpon
the cummyng of the laitie, because it is
a principall and singular part, of the clergies
dutie.
               
                  But this, you saye, ys dallying, to stand
vpon the proper signification of the word,
quotidianum. As though it were in you,
true dealing, to bring by your exaggeration
a quartan to a quotidian, or by your
extenuation a quotidian to a quartan, as
to saie, that the sacrifice is named, dailie,
in respect of the peoples receauing, which
perchaunse was but quarterlie, or to denie
that the sacrifice was dailie, because
the people were not readie but at principall
and quaterlie feastes of the yeare.
And herein, to greue vs againe, you presse
vs with the word frustra, in vayne, yet
you doe it so manerlie, that allthough
much wrong be done therein vnto vs, we
should not, for al that, be iustlie or greatlie

offended with you. For if we wil geaue
ouer the hold, which we haue in the
word quotidianum, then will you allso, let
goe the word frustra, but if we wil defend
(as the wordes literallie do sound,) that
by S. Chrisostomes testimonie, the sacrifice
in his tyme was daily, then saie you.
Then must you geaue me leaue,Defence. fo. 38. as extremelie
to vrge these .ij. sillabes frustra. in vaine
is our oblatiō, in vaine is our sacrificing, &c.
because it ys done without cumpanie to receiue
with vs.
               
               It lyeth not in vs,Reply. to geaue you leaue to
make a lie. and if the place itselfe will
admitt your interpretation, you are not
so shamefast, as to spare your aduantage,
for reuerence of the church your mother.
But,How faine the M. of the defence would be at one, or diuide stakes? whether you can haue any vantage
in the extreme vrgyng of these .ij. sillabes
frustra, it ys not in vayne to cōsider. First,
we saye with S. Chrisostom, that the oblation
was dailie, and we take the worde
daylye, in his proper signification. Then,
(say you) I will vse the worde frustra, and
I will saye, that the daylye oblation was had
in vayne. There is no reason to lett, that

you shold not vse it. For we both doe see
that it is plaine, in S. Chrisostome, frustr
                        •
                     
habetur quotidiana oblatio: the daylie sacrifice
is had in vayne. And as we require, that
(Quotidiana) be takē in his proper significatiō
of daily, so do we graunt vnto you
that you shall vse the worde frustra in his
most proper signification, neither do we
cōtrarye you in it, but that frustra in this
place, is taken for vayne. Therfor, you
can vrge the worde frustra no more extremely
then we doe, except you can make
worse of it then vayne. Yea, (say you
further) it was done in vayne, because it
was done without cumpany, but we thinke
rather it was in vayne, as concerning the
priest his looking for the people. And so
it appeareth that you doe not hurt vs in
alleagyng of (frustra), which we take in
the proper signification of it as well as
you, but our stryuing must now be vpon
the referring of that worde, vnto the peoples
receauing, or vnto the offering of the
sacrifice. And further, it appeareth, as we
doe vrge the worde Quotidiana, that you
doe not so vrge the worde frustra, (as you

asked leaue to do) but quyte leauing the
signification of the worde, (as vpon the
which we do not disagree) you runne vnto
the constrewyng of the worde. And if
we will haue the oblation to be daylye,
you will haue it so vnderstanded, that, by
Sainct Chrisostome his owne wordes, it
should seeme to be done in vayne, because
it was done without cumpany, which
how well it may follow, I require but indifferent
iudgement. For if it were (accordyng
to your thinking) done in vayne,
whē the people did not receiue: ergo
yet it was done. In vayne, you say. Be it
so, for a while. But yet it was done. For
of that which is not done at all, you can
not say any thing, the one way or the other,
to the prayse or disprayse of the doing.
Now, if the sacrifice were offered in
vayne, when no cōmunicantes were readye,
doe you make such a trifle of Sainct
Chrisostome, that he wolde do any thing
which he was persuaded, should be in vayne?
And if he did thinke, that all was to
no purpose, which he did in the sacrificyng,
except the people did cōmunicate:

wolde he not first of all, haue ben assured
to haue communicantes, before he wold
enter vnto the act of offering? And in so
hygh matters, wolde he haue entred in to
the celebratiō of masse, of which he could
not presentlye tell, whether he should say
it in vayne or no? Nay, the church of England
yet is more wyser then so. For, left
their paynes should be lost, in the Lordes
supper, the ministers must be warned
before hand, yf any will communicate,
that (according vnto your interpretatiō)
the oblation be not in vayne, if they shall
haue no cumpany to receiue with them.
And yet, your wisedome, to proue that
our dayly oblation, which we gather owt
of S. Chrisostome, should not be as we
vnderstand it, doth bring S. Chrisostomes
saying vnto such a sense, which doth not
become any cōmon witt and vnderstanding.
For by you S. Chrisostome might
haue this meaning: Here good people,
I haue stode all this while at the aulter,
and haue prayed for all states, and haue
consecrated the sacrament of the Lordes
body, which you should receaue with than

kes geauing: and now I perceiue, all that
I haue done, is in vayne, because there is
none to receiue with me. But, phye vpon
such a sense, in that lerned and godly harte
of Chrisostome. For we might say vnto
hym: Syr, you which do make so greate
pryce of the misteryes, why did you goe
vnto them, before you were sure to make
a fructfull end of them? why did you not
send your Deacon, to know how many
would receiue with you, lest you might
procede further in vayne, whē you should
in the end lacke communicantes? And if
you were perswaded, that you did receiue
in vayne, except some cōmunicated with
you, whi wolde you receiue at all? or how
doe you, but receiue that to your owne
cōdemnation, in which you doe not followe
the institution of Christ, and take
cumpany with you? This, with much more,
mighte be iustely sayed against Sainct
Chrisostome, if the dayly sacrifice, which
we reade so playnelye in hym, could be
thowght of hym to be done in vayne, yf
none did communicate, as you full clerkelye
doe vrge the two syllabes frustra.
                  
Then besides this, I answer, that how so
euer you will take the worde sacrifice, allthough
none, either of the clergye or layetie,
wolde communicate with the priest,
yet the act of sacrificyng can not possiblye
be therfor vayne, because there lacketh
cumpany to receiue. For, yf you vnderstande
by dayly oblation, either daylye
almes, or daylye prayses and thankes, or
dayly remembrance of Christes passion,
or the very bodye and bloude of our Sauior,
what one of all these are vayne, only
because the people do not cōmunicate?
Therfore in grawnting vnto vs, (which
you can not deny) but that the oblation
was daylye, how can you vse the worde
frustra, to proue (as it were by S. Chrisostomes
owne meaning) that it was to no
purpose, when the people did not receiue?
Whereas euery kynde of Christian
mens oblation, ys good and acceptable
in it self, by reason, either of the good will
with which it is offered, or the pryce and
purenes of the thing which is offered, as
in the example, of the body and bloud of
Christ. Who, but vnsensible, can thinke

that S. Chrisostome dyd iudge, at the end
of his masse, when cumpany did not come
to receiue, that all his supplications
and prayers, which he had made before
with all his harte and power, for the quicke
and the deade, and all his praysinges of
God in the memorye of his Sayntes, and
all his prayers vnto Christ in the sacrament,
that he might not receiue hym to
his condempnation, which sitteth at the
ryght hand of God his father in heauen,
and yet was ther inuisibly present before
him: who (say I) can thinke, that S. Chrisostome
did eōclude all those thinges to
haue ben done in vayne, because the people
did not receiue? How then? Yf the
people doe receiue, are all thinges straitwayes
trymlye wrought? Ergo it is the
peoples wyll, which geaueth strength vnto
the sacramentes, and not the institution
of Christ. And the consecration ys
perfyted, not by the allmightynes of the
worde (as S. Cypriane sayeth),Cypri. de coena Domini. nor by these
wordes of our Lorde, This is my body,
(as S. Ambrose witnesseth),Amb. li. 4. de S
                        •
                     . but by the
cumming of the people to receiue, at the

end of seruyce.Liturgi
                        •
                      Chrys. For as I haue shewed before,
after that the priest had receiued,
and had fully ended his office in offering,
thē were the people called, and then were
they serued without the chauncell, in a
place meeter for them. Now, these thinges
not with standing, you be so vayne in
your two syllabes frustra, that allthowgh
at the begynnyng you asked leaue to vse
them, and toke leaue also to doe it, conditionallye,
yf we wolde abyde by it, that
the worde Quotidianum signifyeth dayly,
and not seldome, yet in further reasonyng
you doe so farr passe your owne self in
knowledge, that you affirme absolutelye,
that these wordes, (the dayly oblation is
had in vayne) declare playnelye S. Chrisostomes
mynde, that he thought it to be
of the substance of the sacrament, that a
number should be partakers of it. As who
should say, that in the thirde Hom. vpon
the Epistle to the 
                     •
                  phesians, he had spoken
against sole receiuing, and not rather
signifyed vnto them, that he labored, not
vpon their dayly cūmyng, but onlie their
deuoute and worthye cummyng. For,

after he had sayd:Chr. ho. 3. 
                        •
                     d Ephes. 
                  we stande at the aultar in
vayne, there is no bodye to communicate:
least the people should thinke, as you doe
now, that their receiuing parteyned to
the substance of the sacramēt, he addeth:
I speake not these thinges, because ye should
simplelie communicate, but that you should
make your selfes worthye. Doe we then
deny, that the dayly sacrifice was done in
vayne? No. But we vnderstande it, how
it was done in vayne. Not in respect of
the sacrifice it self, but in respect of the
people, for whom the meate was readye,
and for whom preparance was made, but
they wolde not come vnto it. As in an other
place, speakyng agaynste certayne,
which did not consider and beare awaye
the textes of scripture, which were readen
in the church twyse or thryse in the
weeke, the reader allwaies telling them
the name and place of the Prophet which
was then in hande:Chr. ho. 9. 
                        •
                     d Heb. 5. 
                  Therfore (sayeth he)
they owght to be more clearer vnto you, and
you owght to know not onlie the text, but the
cawses allso, of the thinges which are wryten,
and his name which wrote them. But all

is in vayne, and without fruct. Yet he meaned
not absolutelye, that all the labor of
the reader was in vayne, nor that all the
hearers were fructlesse, (of which he excepteth
a few in that very place) but that
as concerning the peoples common profytt,
which was intended in those lessons,
all was vayne and fructlesse. Which being
so reasonable, and so conuenient a sense,
it is wonder that you would not se it, but
folow rather your owne inuention, and
leese the meaning of S. Chrisostome. And
trulye no greate meruell, yf you mistake
an other mans mynd, wheras in your owne
inuentions you may be proued so forgetfull.
For in this last end of your fifth
chapiter, you conclude playnelie, that S.
Chrisostome vnderstandeth, the oblation
to be vayne, which hath no cumpany to
receiue at it: and that cumpany is taken
of hym, to be of the substance of the sacrament:
to which purpose you alleage,
that who so euer is not partaker of the
misteryes, doth impudentlie and wickedlye,
to stand there by in presence. Well
Syr, if you call this vayne, how doth S.

Chrisostome saye trulye, that the oblation
is had in vayne? For now you call it
vayne,the M. of the defence is ouer cast in his owne turnyng. because of lacke of cumpany, and
by your answers in this chapiter before,
you proued that he neuer lacked cumpany.
How can you make these your two
deuyses to agree togeather? Our daylie sacrifice,
sayeth S. Chrisostome, is had in
vayne. He meaneth (say you) that he had
no cumpany, the hauing of which being a substanciall
poynt, ergo that must be in vayne,
which was done without it. But (say I now
against you) S. Chrisostome dyd neuer
lacke cumpany, when he receaued, ergo
it is not trulye sayed of hym, that the oblation
was in vayne. Either he then, so
good a Bisshopp, lyeth, which so sayeth
that the oblation was in vayne: or you do
lye, in the interpreting of hym, and making
hym to haue such a sence of this worde
vayne, as destroyeth a certayne other
veritie, as you do make it. But how proue
I, that he neuer receiued alone? Trulye
not by my owne knowledge, but by your
answers. For, your second answer, vnto
the Catholikes obiection, was, that in S.

Chrisostomes tyme, the clergie did allwayes
receiue with the Bishope, or cheife
ministre. And this you promised to proue
more largelye hereafter. But the better
you proue it hereafter, the worse it is for
you in this present place. You sayed agayne,
that daylye was taken for, often,
and that at those tymes, in which the people
did not daylye, but often come, he allwayes
had either some of the people, or
the residew of the ministres and clergie,
to communicate with hym. So then, by
these your owne conclusions, I proue,
that the priest did, at that tyme, neuer receaue
alone. How haue you then now so
forgoten your selfe, in this end of your
chapiter, that you make S. Chrisostome
to saye, that none doth cōmunicate with
hym, and that the oblation is therfor in
vayne? wheras at the begynning of this
chapiter, you would haue it cleere and euident,
that the priest neuer lacked cumpany
to communicate with hym solemplye.
Syr, I confesse playnely, we shall be
ouercummed, if we stryue long with you,
or if we can not be ouercummed, because

fayth doth not referr herselfe, vnto the
euent of disputations, yet we shall be (I
trow) confownded, because we can not
tell where to haue you. For, when we
thinke, that vpon the sight of S. Chrisostomes
wordes, which we haue so much
spoken of, you would saye, that we had at
the least some colour of argumēt for sole
receauyng, you make shift by and by, with
all the learning that you haue, to proue
that ther was allwayes some cumpany or
of clergie, or of layetie, to receiue with
the Bishop, or cheife minister. And when
we thinke to fynde you standing in that
cōclusion, and draw neerer vnto you, strait
wayes you fall besides your self, and runne
in to a contrarye corner, where you fight
against your owne saying, and proue, that
allthowgh there were oblation and sacrifice
daylye, which, by force of the worde
Quotidianum, you could not denye vnto
vs, yet that graunted, none receiued with
the priest, (say you) and therfore it was
frustra. Wherfore (good Syr) take the
counsell vnto your selfe, which you doe
geaue vnto vs, and vse not to ground doctrines

vpon the coniecture of a few sillables:
and (with further counsell vnto
you) beware that you geaue not your aduersary
so much, that you make your owne
case the worse: as to permitt vs to enioye
Quotidianum, in his proper sense, by
which we proued daily sacrifice, and then
to labor to proue that it was in vayne, because
of lacke of cūpany, as thowgh you
had not concluded before, that no oblation
was without cumpany. Which to
tell you of, allthough it be a litle disauantage
vnto vs, yet it is recouered an other
way by hauing of a reasonable and playne
dealing aduersarye.
            
            
               The syxt Chapiter.
               
                  
                     THat which is not euidentlye determined
in scripture (saieth the
Catholyke vpon his aduersaries
graunting, of this vayne
principle) ought to stand as indifferent.
               
               
                  But the necessitie of cumpanye to receyue
with the priest, ys no where determined:
                  Ergo it ought to remayne indifferent.
               
               In denying and controlling the partes

of this argument, the Master of the Defence,
doth bestow his syxt chapiter. And
first he denyeth the second proposition,
afterwardes he cometh to the declaration
of the first, in which parte, he casteth in,
betweene so many new deuises and conclusions,
that we haue to abhorr them,
which are not of the auncient religion.
Let vs folow the same wayes which he
taketh, and lett vs defende the Catholike
his argument, in that selfe same order, by
which he doth impugne yt.
               Goe to then Syr, what myslyketh you in
our argument?
               Your second proposition ys not trew.Def
                        •
                     nce. fol. 41. For I
saie, that it is determyned in Christ his institution.
In luke he sayeth, Take this, and diuide
it emong you.
               Ys this your text,Reply. by which you will conclude,
that the priest must haue of necessitie
cumpanye to receyue with hym?
Christ,Luc. 22. you know, spake then to his Apostles
onlye, he spake nothing of the people
to receyue with them. Take (saieth
he) and diuide this emong you, and not,
(as you would fayne haue it to be,) take

you and diuide it emong other. For as
concerning other, whom afterwarde they
should haue the gouernment of, he left
it vnto their wisedome, to geaue it or
denye it, as they should see it expedient.
Except you thinke, that the priest, for diuers
considerations, might not kepe back
the Sacrament from some, which would
receyue with hym. whiche yet, (if they
would be ruled by you,) being repelled,
might aunswer the priest agayne, and
stoutly saye, that it is of the substance of
the Sacrament, that it should be diuided,
and therefor that they haue great wrong
done vnto them, except they maye be
admitted. And they might trulye alleage,
that Christ gaue the Sacrament vnto Iudas
the traytor, which without controlling
did receyue it, bycause of Christ his
institution, Take and diuyde emong you.
But, as all the Christians generallye, can
not by vertue of these wordes, (diuyde emong
you) challenge their part in the cō
                  munion,
yf the priest should thinke them
vnworthye, euen so, neyther Christ had
this meaning in them, that they should

be as a necessarie commaundement to
charge therby his priestes, allwayes to diuide
and distribute his sacrament, but for
that present cumpanye of his most dearest
Apostles, he said, Take and diuide it
emong you. How then? Maye not the sacrament
be diuided emong the people?
Yes trulye. But that it should be diuided
emong the people, such necessitie is not
gathered out of, Take ye, and diuide it
emong you. But saye you
How can it be taken at the minister his handes,Defence.
and diuided or distributed emong them,
vnlesse there be a cumpanye?
               
               But what talke you,Reply. of, to be taken at the
minister his handes, as though that S. Luke
did make thereof any signification? He
telleth vs, that Christ our Sauyor saide vnto
his Apostles, Take this: but he maketh
no worde at all, of taking at the minister
his handes. But, this would serue well your
purpose, if that when Christ said distinctlye
vnto his twelue, Take this, you could
perswade the rude, that he spake vnto the
people, and commaunded them to take
his sacrament at the minister his handes.

Then further, where you aske, how it can
be distributed emong them, except there
be a cumpanye? For whom you do speake,
I can not redely tell. For if you meane
the Apostles, there was a good cumpany
of them, to take that which was distributed:
and if you meane the people,
I wonder whye you call them vnto this
matter, the Euangelistes speaking of the
Apostles onlye. You alleage the text of
the scripture: goe not then, I praye you,
from the text. The wordes be playne:
Take and diuide emong you. Yf it had bene
sayd indefinitelie, diuide, you might haue
thought with some reason, that a commaundement
of distributing the sacrament
for euer afterwarde, had ben geauen
in those wordes. But, our Sauyor determineth
the worde diuide, in saying,
Diuide this emong you. Which wordes yet
if you thinke to haue ben spoken, not onlie
to the Apostles personallie, but to all
Bishopes and high Priestes, which should
haue in tyme to come, the place or office
of the Apostles, as I graunte this sense,
because it is conuenient and true, so yet

the people (you see) are not comprehended
within the text of which we speake.
For,The M. of the defence hath promised more then he can performe▪
                   of theis three pointes, Take you, diuide
you, emong you, no one can be vnderstanded,
as spoken vnto the people. And
if one maye, why not all, as well as one,
seing that in those three pointes, the persons
are not varyed? Where then do you
fynde now any cōmaundement of distributing
the sacrament vnto the people?
It can no be diuided, (saye you) except
there be cumpany. You speake somewhat
therein, but tell vs fyrst, what cumpanye
you meane?The sacramēt is truly diuided emong vs euerie day. For I say, that vnto this daye,
if you consider the whole church, as one
howse, and euerye aultar in the world, as
one table, and the body of Christ, as it is
one, allthough the mysticall signes of it
be in many places, so shall you see it performed,
that which you be so glad to heare,
that the sacrament is daylye taken, eaten,
and diuided emong vs. But now, tell
vs further, what necessitie you fynde, why
it should be diuided? In deede distribution
presupposeth cumpanye. But we aske
what necessitie doth requyre distribution?

For the wordes of our Sauior doe
not absolutelye commaunde it,Let the M. of the defence speake to the question. but vnto
the Apostles especyallie his wordes were
directed, because thei were with hym, to
receiue at his handes. And so, the same
wordes maye appertayne to all that celebrate
masse, when some are readie to receiue.
But as, if twelue be not readie to
receiue, yet fower maye: so, if fower be not
readie, one maye receiue alone. But then
you complayne vpon vs, and saye, that we
maye as well leaue out, eatyng, drynkyng,
and doyng in remembraunce of Christ, as we
doe dispense with distributing. Feare not
(I warrant you) we be nothing so folish.
For meates are necessarye, but not distribution,
and without other mens mouthes
we can eate: but we can not distribute,
without others handes or mouthes to receiue
it. Also, the remembrance of Christ
his passion, is and maye be allwaies vsed:
but distribution of the Sacrament, is not
allwaies possible. And (to be shorte) the
sole receiuing can not be without eating,
&c.: but the sole receiuing at masse, is and
maye be without distributing. And here

now, for feare least we should not regarde
the institution of Christ, you tell vs
againe, out of Sainct Cypriane, that nothing
must be altered in the preceptes of
Christ, which saying you extende vnto sole
receiuing▪ and receiuing vnder one kynde,
(which S. Cypriane neuer thought
vpon in that epistle,) and you forget to
mengle water and wine togeather at the
communion, which S. Cypriane in that
place so earnestly requyreth to be done,
as I haue before declared at large. Wherfore
Syr, haue no mistrust, but that God
the Holyghost prouideth abundantlye,
that Christes and his owne institution,
shall neuer be broken of the church: and
when you be deliuered of this feare, see
whether you can proue any better, then
you haue done hitherto, that the necessitie
of cumpany to receiue with the priest,
is determined in scripture. And if it be
not determined expreslie, it standeth as
a thing indifferent, by your owne vayne
principle, and then it is no breache of
Christ his institution, to vse sole receyuing.
How saye you then? Will you forsake

that fonde principle of yours, that
nothing is of necessitie to be credited,
but that which is expreslie in the scriptures?
No, you will not, I know, your harte
is so great against traditions. Make then
no more a doe, but graunt, that the obseruing
of number and cumpanye, is no
more requisite, then the obseruing of the
tyme, place, kynde of persons, and other
circūstances, which the Ghospell sheweth
to haue ben vsed at the institution of the
Sacrament. No saye you, that
Many circumstances of place, person, and
tyme, maye be altered &c. we graunte you:
but, that cumpanye in receyuyng is one of
those circumstances, that we can not graunte,
as well for the reasons before declared,
as allso that we haue none example of the
Apostles, or primitiue church, that we maye
so doe.
               
               Consider, I praye you Syr, the maner of
your reasonyng. We cōclude vpon your
owne principle, (which againe we must
call vayne, leste anye should thinke, that
we doe allow it) that cumpanie in receiuing,
is by expresse scripture, of no more
necessitie, then the circumstances of tyme

and place, which Christ vsed in the delyuering
of his sacrament: and you answer,
that it is not founde in the example of
the Apostles, or primitiue churche, that
the cumpanie in receiuing was omitted,
as tyme and place are founde to haue ben
altered, in which saying you doe but enlarge
your vayne principle, vpō the graunting
of which our argument proceeded.
Cumpany in receiuing, in respect of the
sacrament receiued, is no greater matter
then the circumstance of tyme and place▪
but yet of sole receiuing (saye you)
we haue none examples of the Apostles,
or primitiue church, as though nothing
might be vsed otherwise then as of former
example it maye be gathered, which
addition, if you thinke good to vse, to
make your foresaid principle vayne absolutelye,
lett it be so then, and according
to this reformed principle, our argument
shall thus come against you. What so euer
Christ did, at the institution of the
sacrament, which we fynde not to be altered
by the authoritie or example of Apostles,
or primitiue churche, that is of

necessitie to be obserued. But, our Sauior
delyuered the sacrament at night, and the
Apostles with the primitiue churche of
their tyme, haue no example or manner
to warrant vs to doe otherwyse: ergo, we
must of necessitie receiue at night. But,
it is vnreasonable to bring in such a necessitie:
ergo it is a vayne principle which
maintayneth such absurditie. And what
you might aunswer vnto this, I can not
diuise, except you will take examples of
the primitiue church which folowed the
Apostles. But then remembre what you
be wonte to saye out of Tertullian, how
that is best which was fyrst: and agayne
out of S. Cypriane, Christ is most to be
followed, which was the first of all. And
consider allso,1. Cor. 11. whether the church of Corinth
dyd not receiue the sacrament at
night,Acto. 20. and reade in the actes of the Apostels,
whether there was not breaking of
bread at night: and fynde, if you can, in
all scripture, that ministring of the sacrament
was vsed in the mornyng. Are you
wiser then Christ? can you better dispose
the tymes, then the maker of tyme hymselfe?

Did not the Corinthians receiue
at night?An easie matter it is to troble the church if mē wold folowe the cōmon places of heretikes. Is there anye mention in scripture
of receiuing before none? These,
loe, be your common places, which if I
would follow, I could make as great exclamations
at the breaking of Christ his
institution in the tyme, as you doe make
for the lacking of communicantes. For it
is no matter to vs, whether you do bring
two or three causes, wherefore the receiuing
at night, is or maye be altered, (for
if good causes would haue preuailed, you
would neuer haue plaied so madd partes
in crying out against sole receiuing) but,
all thinges (you saie) must be brought to
the institution of Christ, and as he gaue
example, so must we follow: and wherfore
then, might not one first breake his
fast, and afterwarde come to the Lorde
his table? And, if busynes lett a Merchant
all the daye, why might he not receiue at
night? If you can dispense with one thing,
you maye do the lyke with all. If you alter
the tyme, you maye alter the maner,
the place, the bread, the wyne, and all that
Christ did. This kynde, Syr, of Rhetoryke

and Logike we learne of you, which
if you do greatly myslyke, when you heare
it of an other besides your selfe, looke
then vpon your selfe better, and correcte
that vayne glorious principle, which hath
a shewe of learning and pietie, but is in
deede most rude and wycked, when you
saye, that nothing should be necessarylie
obserued, which is not expreslie in scripture,
or, nothing thereof might be altered,
without auctoritie or example of the
Apostles and primitiue church. Which
example of Apostles or primitiue church
you neede not to passe vpon in this kynde
of matter. For if you be most surely persuaded,
by the very text of the scripture,
that companye to receiue with the priest,
is of the substance of the sacrament, allthough
example might be founde in the
primitiue church of sole receiuing, or receiuing
vnder one kynde, you would yet
condempne that example, by the playne
institution of Christ, as you would take
it: what good then should an example do
to you, which, although it were neuer so
playne, yet you would not be persuaded,

but that the cumpany at the communyon
is allwaies of necessitie?Note this point. But, of our examples,
we shall speake hereafter, in the
meane tyme, what bring you, to shewe
that the hauing of company, is of the necessitie
of the sacrament? And marke,
that we aske you not of companye, whether
it be laudable, conuenient, or honorable
at the celebration of euerie masse,
but whether it be necessarie. Of necessitie
our question is, and of expresse commaundement,
and you tell vs of the Paschall
lambe of the Iewes, and applye it
vnto our Sacrament, that lyke as cumpanye
was of necessitie to the eating of the
Paschall lambe, so that it should be as necessarie
to the receiuing of the sacrament.
After which argumēt, you triumphe without
victorie, and aske of vs:
VVyll you saie,Defence. that companye to eate vpp
the Paschall lambe was not of the substance
of the sacrament? &c.
If you meane by the worde (sacrament)
in this place,Reply. the Paschall lambe it selfe,
cumpanye (you know) was no more of
the substances of the lambe, thē you with

your bydden gestes, be of the substance of
your meate, when you haue prouided for
your selfe and them a fatt goose and a capon.
But, if you vnderstand by sacrament,
al the act and ceremonie of preparing and
eating the lambe, the calling of company
vnto it was in some case materyal. For if
the numbre be lesse, then shall be able to
eate vpp the lambe,Exo. 12. then (saieth God) he,
whosoeuer he be, shal take his next neighbor.
But you may say, although the calling
of company were conditionall,Cumpanie in eating of the Paschal lambe was not of absolute necessitie. yet the
hauing of companye was of the substance
of the sacrament, It was so of the substaunce,
as other things were which God
in that place commaunded, I meane gyrding
of their loynes, and hauing of shooes
on their feete, and holding of staffes in
their han
                     •
                  es. But if by reason of some
wounde or dysease, anye one of them had
not ben able to suffer hys shooe on hys
foote, although his feete would not beare
hym, yet if his stomache serued hym,
could he not haue eaten with his fellowes,
and eate as fast as the best, without
breaking of the matter? Lykewise if one

had ben borne without hādes, or had lost
his handes in fighting for his countrey, so
that he could not hold any staff in the
hand which he had not, was he to be excluded
from his parte in the lambe? Yf
these pointes then, which God so distinctlie
commaunded, haue their interpretations,
and are not so absolutely to be
obserued, but that, for considerations,
thei maye be omitted, I see no cawse,
whye the hauing of numbre in eating of
the lambe, should be so necessarye, that it
could not be omitted. But the matter
would be playner, if we were once agreed
how the terme of (substance) is to be takē,
when you speake of it. For if you meane,
that to be of the substance of a precept,
which
                     •
                  , without case of necessitie, and
without dispensatiō of the cheife gouernors,
can not be rashlye omitted, as euery
priuate man shall thinke good in hym
selfe, then I graunt, that all those poyntes,
which are comprehended within the
ceremonye of eating the paschall lambe,
were of the substance of it: But, if substance
shall signifye such partes of any sacrament,

as which no man for any respect
maye omitt or chainge (in which
sence we doe take it, in speaking of the
necessarye forme and matter of euerye
sacrament) then doe I denye vnto you,
that euerie point comprehended within
the ceremonye of eating the lambe, was
of the substance of that matter. Therefor
if your comparing of all Christendome
vnto all the Iewes, and our particuler
churches vnto their sundrye houses,
and the eating of our Sacrament vnto
their lambe, did neuer so well agree togeather,
yet, because it is not proued of
you, that euerie point commaunded of
God, about the eating of the lambe, is so
essentiallie of the sustance therof, that in
no case it maye be omitted or altered,
therfore you come nothing nigh to the
aunswer of our question, which is, whether
that of necessitie there must be cō
                  panye
allwaies, to receiue at the masse?
Then againe, it is to be noted, that in the
old law, God did not commaunde them
to haue companye at the eating of the
lambe, but, rather then anye parte shold

be lefte vneaten, he willeth them to call
more conpanye, presupposing that there
would be in euerie household companye
inough to eate a lambe, but yet geauing
no commaundement of companye
to be at it. For if one by hym selfe alone,
had eaten a whole lambe, his wife and
children rounde about hym, not louing
that kinde of meate, and yet delighting
in the histories which he would tell them
of Egipt and the redd sea, I see not that
you were able to burden hym with the
breache of Goddes institution. Besides
this, whereas the lambe of God which is
eaten of the Christians, is not more meate
vnto a thousande then vnto one alone,
and one alone receyueth the whole, that
he needeth not to send for his neighbor,
your proportion betwyxt the lambe of
the lewes, and our Sacrament was not
rightly deuised of you. Also, if I could finde
no faulte with your application, yet,
except you brought greater aucthoritie
for the defence of it then your owne, I
would lykewise of myne owne head, inuent
an other sence besides yours, and

saie that my vnderstanding of that place,
serueth better to the purpose then yours.
In which case, as both of vs, might vse
perchaunce probable interpretations, so
yet none of vs both should conclude any
thing of necessitie. And yet, I neede not
to runne vnto myne owne wytt for this
matter, because that, long sence, Sainct
Denyse the Carthusyan doth saie in his
Cōmentaries vpon Exodus,Dionisius Carth. in 12. ca. Exp. that the calling
of a neighbor to eate of the lambe,
if howsehold cumpanie were not sufficient,
doth signifie that euerie Christian,
which is neuer able by hymselfe to consider,
sufficientlie, the mercyes of God,
shewed vnto vs in the death and sacramēt
of his Sonn, should call his neighbor to
hym, and prouoke him to helpe forward
that all thankes and praises might be geauen
vnto the author of so excellent benefites.
Now, to speake somewhat more of
this lambe, (whilest you are of so good a
mynd and remembrance, to confesse that
ther is a proportion and lykenes betwyxt
our sacrament and it,) consider that the
lambe was offered vpp to God before it

was eaten,An allegoricall expositiō of the paschall lambe. which proueth that Christ offred
his bodie and bloode in his last supper,
before the Apostles did receiue hym.
The blood also of the lambe, was put vpon
both postes of the doores, which signifieth,
that good Christians do receiue
Christ in the mouth and in the hart. And
they which receyue vnworthely,
                  Euseb. Emi scenus in hom. feriae 2. post Pascha. 
                  or els in receyuing,
doe not beleiue it to be the blood of
Christ, these put the blood vpon one poste onlye.
You are commaunded also, to deuoure
the head with the feete, and the
appourtenāces, that you shold not be curious
and nyce in your feeding, but faithfullie
and humblie receiue his diuinitie,
his humanitie, and all other profond and
secrete mysteries. In which, if any thing
shall seeme absurde vnto your grosse vnderstanding,
you must referr all vnto the
working of the Holyeghost, and so you
shall fulfyll the law, which commaundeth
the residue of the lambe to be burned
with fier. It is sufficiēt to beleeue if it be not
graunted to vnderstand,
                  Eusebius ibid. 
                  for moe doe eate this
flesh, through beleeuing, then vnderstanding.
Wherefore, as the figure of the paschall

lambe doth nothing make against the order
which the church vseth, so it doth
most playnelie confound your suppositions
and imaginations, by which you take
Christes reall presence from vs, and
the offering of his body. And now, what
foloweth in your defence? You laye vnto
our charge, that
VVe take vpon vs to alter,Defence. fo. 45. chainge, and take
away, by our spiritual gouernors, all the partes
of the Lorde his supper, as you will declare
to vs in order, by the doctrine of our
defence of priuate Masse.
               
               Certainelie,Reply. this is a greate accusation,
and we are neuer to be trusted in anye
thing, if this be proued. Do we (saie you)
take vpon vs to alter, chainge, and take
awaye, all the partes of the Lorde his supper,
by defence of priuate masse? What
a wycked and shamefull lye is this? For
there was neuer yet any masse celebrated
emong vs,Note how freelie and sensiblie the M. of the defence belieth the Catholikes. so quycklie, so shortlie, so secretelie,
and so much without cumpany,
but it had in it, breade, wyne, and water,
blessing, breaking, remembring of Christ
his passion, togeather with all that, which

the Apostle speaketh of vnto Timothe,1. Timo. 2.
saying: Therefore I praye the, first of all,
that besechinges, prayers, requestes, and thankes
geuing be made for all men. &c. But why
should we make wondring at this lye, being
not the first in your defence, and hauing
many after folowers? Will you declare
this in order, which you haue taken
in hande to proue against vs? Your hart
is good euer, allthough your matter be
nought. For this you saye:
The Sacrament,Defence fol. 45. as it is in vse, hath two
partes, the matter and the forme.
What partes hath it then,Reply. before it come
to the vse of which you speake? And if
there should chaunce to be no such present
vse of the sacramēt, what matter and
forme hath it, as it is considered without
the vse? Can you define this sacrament,
which are so cunnyng in the numbring
of the partes of it, as it is in vse? And hath
not euerie sacrament matter and forme,The matter and for me of the sacrament.
of which two it is constituted? Is not the
sensible thing and element (as bread, wine,
oyle. &c.) called the matter of them:
and the wordes, which are added to those

elementes, are not thei called the formes?
The worde,
                  Aug. tract. 80. super loan. sayeth S. Augustyne, commeth
vnto the element, and there is made a sacrament.
Bread, is the matter of the sacrament
of the aultar, and the wordes This
is my bodye, are the forme of it: which
two, when thei are brought togeather by
the intention of such as are called rightlie
to the office, straitwaies there is a sacrament,
consisting of the visible signe,
and of the inuisible and naturall body of
our Sauyor. And whether it be receiued
or reserued, God doth not pull back his
worde at the departing, or not comming
of men. But goe to. what saye you of the
matter of the sacrament, as it is in vse?
               The matter,Defence. fo. 45. is bread and the bodye, wyne
and the blood of Christ.
               Yf the bodye of Christ be the matter,Reply.
as you separate the matter from the forme,
how commeth it to passe, I pray you,
that there is the bodye of Christ to hym
which will vse the bread? Do you thinke,
that where so euer any breade is, there is
allso the bodye of Christ, to hym which
will vse the bread? Yf this be false, (as it

is) then I saye that the body, with which
(and the bread) you make vpp the matter
of the sacrament, as it is in vse, doth
not come to the breade without some di
                  
                     •
                  ine
operation. Except you thinke, that
any power of creature is able to exhibite
the body of his creator and maker. What
operation then is that, by which this matter,
which you saye is bread and the body
of Christ, doth come to that perfection,
to be the bodye of our Sauior. For we
know, that breade may be had from the
bakers, or if (as your selfes now do mislyke
with bakers bread) you will haue cleane
and fyne cakes, to be made for the purpose,
thei are men or women which make
them, and their howses are not inuisible.
But how come you to haue that bodye,Let this be distinctlie and directlie answered.
with which (and the bread) you make vpp
the matter of the sacramēt as it is in vse?
               For you can not vse the wordes of the
Ghospell to bring that to passe, because
thei are the forme of the sacrament, and
you in this place do so speake of the matter,
as it is distincted from the proper forme.
Then agayne, how ignorantlie▪ and

vnreuerently is it deuised of you, to make
the bodye of Christ, the materiall parte
of the sacrament as it is in vse, to the exhibiting
of which bodye, all matter and
forme serueth which is requyred to the
sacramēt? But if this be the matter, what
is the forme?
The forme of ministration is,Defence fo. 45. that the minister
should take the matter, and with the
wordes of the ghospell geaue it to them present,
as Christ did.
God send you better memorie,Reply. or if memorie
faill not, God send you more honestie.
Did you not begynne to tell vs of
the matter and forme of the sacrament,
as it is in vse? make then an end of that
which you beganne. The matter you haue
defyned. what is the forme of the sacrament?
The forme (saye you) of ministration
is, &c. The forme of ministratiō?
Whoe requyred it of you? You must tell
vs of the forme of the sacrament as it is
in vse, and not the forme of ministration.
And whereas among all learned men, the
forme is the perfection of the matter, either
els you shold neuer haue made such

a diuision of the sacrament as it is in vse,Consider, by this one place, what proper scholemen the new ghospell hath created.
or els you should haue told vs of such a
forme, which doth geaue (as I may sai
                     •
                  )
a grace vnto the matter. Is the forme of
the sacrament and forme of ministration
all one with you? or the forme of the sacrament
as it is in vse, and the forme of
ministratiō, is it all one? what you might
make of the first you could not tell, and
therefor you turned out of your purpose
vnto the seconde. And although you
speake nothing of the matter of ministration,
you expounde yet the forme of ministration
vnto vs, and whereas you began
with the matter of the Sacrament,
you refuse to declare vnto vs the forme
of yt, which we looked for. Now, if your
iudgement serued you, to make all one
thing of the sacrament as it is in vse, and
of the ministration of yt, then must the
breade and bodye (as you lye) of Christ,
be the matter of ministration, lyke as it
is the matter of the sacrament as it is in
vse: which if it be true, I put the case, that
the minister would not delyuer that foresaid
matter vnto the people with his oune

handes, but bydd them take it themselfes,
and distribute it emong them? were
it not the bodye of Christ? It could be
no otherwise, because you saye, that the
matter of the sacrament, as it is in vse, and
as it is considered as a seperate parte from
the forme, is breade and the bodye. But
how can it be hys bodye before the wordes
of the ghospell do come vnto it? and
how are the wordes of the ghospell vsed
to that purpose, whereas you saie that the
minister taketh the matter in to his handes,
(which is by your interpretation the
breade and the bodye) and delyuereth it
with the wordes of the ghospell. So that
the wordes come after, and the bodie is
allreadie in his handes before. Also what
wordes of the ghospell are those, which
you meane, when you saye, that the matter
must be deliuered with the wordes of
the ghospell? Yf you meane the wordes
of consecration (this is my bodye, this is my
bloud &c.) Then is the English ministration
vnperfecte, which vsed not those
wordes in the delyuering of their, what
shall I call it. And except you meane those

wordes, what other in the ghospell
maye serue to that purpose, I can not deuise?
For as concernyng those wordes,
Take, eate, diuide yt emong you, doe this in
my remembrance, they neede no repetitiō
by mouth, but onlye expressing of them
in deede. And then, as concerning the
worde (diuide) when yt is spoken to eche
one of the cōmunicantes, to whom shall
eche one of them diuide any part
                     •
                   of that
the which he receyueth wholye hymselfe?
Yet if the worde (diuidite, diuide yt)
be an essentiall and formall parte, of the
sacrament as it is in vse, then must euery
one which shall rightlye vse it, make partes
and diuision of it, except you meane,
that the vse of the sacrament perteyneth
only vnto the minister, or that the people
must take and eate, as the Ghospell
commaundeth them, and that, to diuide
it, was not spoken to them, although that
worde doth also folowe in the ghospell.
But to what purpose haue you, so scholastically,
made such a distinctiō betweene
the matter and the forme of a thing?
T
                     •
                  ewly that you

declare it, that our spirituall gouernours
haue chainged all the partes of the Lord
supper, for they which take awaye both
matter and forme, leaue no substanciall
part or point of the thing: And you saie,
we haue done so. Ergo (yf this be proued)
the Catholikes be very traytors vnto
God. But how proue you, that we haue
chainged those principall partes belonging
to Christ his supper? saye first as
concerning the forme, and tell vs wherein
we haue altered it? mary

                     ••
                  nt
with all his partes, according vnto
your newlie deuised diuision? what if the

priest alone receyue the matter with his
owne handes, and vse the wordes of the
ghospell, doth he not fulfill all that which
is to be requyred? The priest, you know,
doth fyrst receyue hym selfe, before he
geaueth vnto other. And what doth he
receyue, I praye you? doth there lack either
matter or forme, or anye essentiall
parte, vnto that which he receyueth? Or
will you saye, that the sacrament which he
hath allready taken and eaten, hath not his
iust forme, before the people also haue
receyued? yf the case be so harde, then
were it necessarye, that when the matter
is taken into the handes of the communicantes,
a watchworde should be geauen,
when all they at once with the wordes
of the ghospell, should receyue that
matter. But if this be but a folysh toye,
meete for an idle brayne, to thinke that
eche one doth not receyue the sacramēt
with all the partes of yt, except his neighbor
eate with hym, how doe the Catholikes
take awaye that very forme which
you speake of, in vsing of sole receyuing?
for your forme (which you haue inuēted)

is, to delyuer the matter with the wordes
of the ghospell, but the matter maye
be delyuered vnto one alone, or receyued
of one alone, with the wordes of the
ghospell, ergo, the allowing of sole receiuing
doth not take awaye your forme.
And this I speake, as though it were true,
that which you bable of the forme of the
sacrament. For as concerning the verye
forme of the sacrament, the church hath
allwayes taught, and in all scholes it is openly
declared, that these wordes (This
is my bodye) are the forme of the Sacrament.
But (saye you) I talke of the forme of
the ministration of the sacrament. Why dyd
you not tell vs so much of your mynde at
the beginnyng? And if we did not keepe
the forme of ministratiō, how could you
proue thereby, that we altered the formall
parte of the Lorde his supper? For
(I trust) you be not so voyde of naturall
sense, but that you vnderstand, the matter
and forme of a good dyshe of meate,
and the seruing in of the same meate, to
be sundrye thinges and different? And, as
the man and the meate are different, so

is the matter and forme of either man or
meate seperately to be distincted and talked
of. Yet you, in so playne a matter, haue
so forgottē your selfe, that begynning
to speake of the matter and forme of the
sacrament as it is in vse, and hauing ended
the definyng of the matter, you skyp
straytwayes to an other thing, and tell vs
of the forme of the ministration. Much
lyke as if you would saye, I will tell you,
my masters, the matter and forme of a
marchepane, when it is come to be eatē:
the matter of it is, suger, rosewater, allmondes.
&c. The forme is, not that you
should fetch it out of the ouen your selfes,
but tarye vntyll one cleane fellow or
other, bring it to the table, and some other
diuyde vnto euery geste a conuenient
parte an portion of it. Which yet, is
no more the forme of a marchepane, thē
it is of a rosted pece of beefe, when it is
cleanely brought vnto the table, and diuided
emōg the gestes. But make an end of
your accusation, and declare how we doe
chainge the other substanciall parte of
the sacrament: which is the matter?
               
                  
The matter also▪ ye signifye,Defence fo. 45. maye be altered
at your pleasure.
               This is a most euident lye.Replye. For all our
scholes doe holde, that the necessarye
matter of the Sacrament,Note the lye of the M. defendour of the truthe. is, breade and
wyne, and the most due and conuenyent
matter, is, vnleauened bread and wyne
mixed with water. Yea we be so earnest
in the defence of this truth, that we be
angrye very much with a certayne kynde
of heretikes, which will vse no water in
the celebrating of the misteries. I meruail
therefore much, what reason you maye
alleage, to proue this fault by vs. Yet
you saye:
For to receyue the Sacrament of the bloud
is not of the substance of Christ his institution,Defence
for if it were, the churche could not alter
yt, as you doe comonly in the ministryng to
the people.
               
               Yf this be true,Replie. tell vs, what name that
hath, which the geaue to the people in
steed of the blood? Doe we geaue them
the sacrament of blood, either in ale, beere,
mylke, or any other liquor, besides wine?
yf we do not, how can you saye, that
we chainge the matter? no mary, (saye

you) you geaue them no sacrament of the
bloud at all. That which we doe, we haue
receyued from antiquitie and authoritie,
and the receyuer taketh no losse therein,
except he thinke that Christ his Sauior is
not perfectlie vnder the forme of bread.
And againe, if you consider, that the
people with vs, doe allwayes receyue vnconsecrated
wyne, after they haue eaten
the bodye of Christ in forme of bread,
and that the cupp which you geaue is vnconsecrated,
they did receyue in the forme
of wyne as much good as you minister
vnto then, and so by indifferent reckenyng,
you can not complayne that the
Catholikes take any thing from the people,
which geaue them as much as you
doe, that is to saye, cleane wyne and no
more. But, doe you call this an altering
of the matter of the sacrament, when we
vse none other matter at all besydes that
which Christ appointed, but only admitt
a good dispensation and order, in the vse
of it? yf there might be any faulte founde
with vs in this point, for ministring the
sacrament, at one tyme vnder the forme

of bread, at an other tyme vnder the forme
of wyne, yet it is not proued hereby,
that we chainge the matter of the sacrament.
For how so euer we doe it, yet we
minister in none other matter then bread
or wyne, how then do you proue that we
chainge not only the forme, but also the
matter? maye not euery reasonable man
then see, that you proue your selfe, what
you are? doe you make any regard, eyther
what you promyse, eyther what you performe?
here I challendge you, to make
good your worde, or els, if you be an honest
man, to reuoke your worde.Answer if you can. Where
is that matter of the sacrament, which the
Catholikes doe alter? Shew, if you can,
that we vse in our ministeries, anye other
thing then breade, wyne, and water, or any
thing more or lesse, for the matter of
the sacrament? But this can neuer be proued.
Yet you, as though it were proued,
so ye conclude most wyckedlye and slaū
                  derouslye,
that the sacramēt of the Lord
his supper, hath by our doctryne eyther
no parte that is of the substance, or els,
that we haue the aucthoritie to chaynge

euerye parte of it. Whiche conclusion of
yours, is not only so false, but so folysh also,
that if I would graunte all your premisses,
which you haue out of all fasshion
diuided, yet this your conclusion will
not follow. For all that which you vnderstande
by the termes, of (matter and forme
of the sacrament) perteyneth only to
the manner of ministryng the bread and
the bodie, wyne and the bloud, with the
wordes of the ghospell. In which pointes,
if I would (for spedines sake) graunt,
that we obserued nothing of that which
you requyer, yet you should not so absolutely
and boldely reporte of vs, that we
leaue eyther no part of substance, as cō
                  cerning
the sacrament, either chainge it,
at our pleasures, and take awaye Christe
his institution. For, (as I saye againe vnto
you) we holde the wordes of Christ,
This is my bodye, as the forme, and bread,
wyne, and water, as the matter, which can
not be altered. We beleiue also, after the
wordes are spoken by a lawfull priest, vpon
the breade, wyne, and water, that
Christ is really present, vnder eche of those

formes, to be vnto vs, a sacrifice for
synne, a foode for our hunger, a confort
in this miserie, a pledge of the euerlasting
glorie. And we beleiue his wordes to be
so true, that if none will receiue hym,
when he cometh before thē, yet that their
incredulitie, or their lack of charity, doth
not make his presence nothing. How
saie you then now, for shame? do we leaue
no parte that is of substance in the sacrament,
because we doe not agree with
you in such kynde of substanciall partes
as you haue inuented? Do we make our
gouernors omnipotent (as you saye) in
transposing and altering the sacramentes
instituted by Christ? or maye we defraude
the people of the whole sacrament?
I would you did no more harme to the
people, or take no more vpon you, then
the church hath done. They should not
be serued with signes and figures, in steede
of verities, and the wordes of Christ
should stand as he ment them, saying This
ys my bodye, which is geauen for you, and
This is my bloud of the newe testament. But
for this matter we shall haue an other tyme
and leysure.
            
            
               
               The seuenth Chapiter.
               
                  THE Catholike in his Apologie,
considering that our aduersaryes
doe so egerly stryue
for the hauing of companye
to receyue with the minister, because
thei would make vpp a communion, answereth
directly, and truly, that although
none doth visiblie receyue at the same
aultar with the priest, yet neuer the lesse,
that there is a communion. For lyke as in
prayer, when I am alone, I praye togeather
with all them which be of the same
body and fayth with me: so although
I receiue the Sacrament alone, yet in
deed I communicate with other. Against
which so playne reason, although nothing
can be directly spoken: yet the master
of the defence wil shew his cunning,
how many pretye florysshes he can deuise
besides the matter. And first he auaū
                  seth
him selfe with standing a typtoe, and
ouerlooking of other, with these wordes:
VVho seeth not,Defence▪ fo. 46. that prayer, and the Lorde
his supper in the vse of them, be nothing lyke?
               
               
                  
But whoe seeth not,Reply. that you can
                     •
                  not
tell your selfe how lyke they are? For as
prayer is made for other, so in lyke manner
is the bodye of Christ offred by him
for other. Offred (I saye) once vppon
the crosse immediatlye by hym selfe in a
bloudy and visible maner, to the redemption
of mankynde: and yet daylye styll
offred by hym, through the ministery of
his priestes, in mysticall and vnbloudy fasshion,
to the employing of that redemption.
But who goeth about to proue
that praying and receiuing should be both
in all pointes a lyke? Prayer (you saye)
is a common action,
                  Defence. 
                  which done of one maye
stretche to the benefyte of many, but the Lorde
his supper is no such common action.
               
               The cōmoditie of prayer is allwayes common:
but it the acte of praying is more
oft priuate then common. The receyuing
of the sacrament is a personall and
singular action: but the commoditye,
when it foloweth, is communicated with
the whole bodye.
               One maye praye without a guyde: one can not
baptize hymselfe without a minister. A mans
prayer also maye profyt hym which prayeth

not, but any ones baptisme may not profyt hym
that is not baptized. And what of all this?
Christ (saye you) taught vs to praye one for
an other, but he neuer said, receiue the communion,
or be baptized one for an other.
               O Syr,Replye. remembre your selfe. The Catholike,
against whom you write, doth
not medle with this question, of which
you speake. He saieth not, that one maye
be baptized or houseled for an other: but
he sayeth (if you will marke) that lyke as
in our praying alone,a perfect cōmuniō is in all thinges emong Catholikes. we communicate
with all Christendome, so in receiuing
alone, we communicate with the whole
body of Christ. And to make this his saying
playne vnto your runnyng wytt, he
alleageth the article of our Crede, which
is, that we beleiue the cōmunion of sainctes.
And to make the matter further yet
out of all doubt, he reciteth a testimonie
of S. Denyse the Areopagite, in which it
is proued vnto you, that the supper of our
Lorde is therefore called a communion,
because all the lyuelye membres of the
church are brought thereby to an vnitie
with Christ their head. And if all this be

not sufficient, then do you further vnderstand,
that, lyke as in our naturall bodye,
whē one parte reioyseth, all the rest is glad
of it, and if anye one be payned, all the
rest doth feele it: so, in the mysticall bodye
of Christe, there is a diuine, entiere,
and charytable communion, of all the
fructfull paynes, actiōs, and graces, which
any one of the singuler membres, either
receyueth, eyther practiseth. And this cō
                  munion
is not only in respect of the vniformitie
of the church in Sacramentes
and scriptures, (as you saye,) but also, as
concerning the communicating of benefytes,
vvhich are receyued by those sacramentes,
or deserued by good deedes,
and meritoryous. Of which fellowshipp,
it commeth to passe, that the obedience
of Abraham, and pacience of Iob, vvith
all their vertues vvhich lyued in the feare
and knowledge of God before the commyng
of Christ, and the humilitie of the
most blessed virgyn, labors of the Apostles,
constancie of martyrs, and holynes of
all good Sowles, sence the Ascention of
our Sauyor, goe forth without enuye, to

the bewtifying and comforting of euery
ioynt of the whole mysticall bodye. Of
which,Io. 1. Christ is the head, which is blessed
for euer, which is full of grace and truth;
of whose fullness euery membre receiueth
a portion,Psal. 48. whom the holy ghost hath annoynted
with the oyle of gladnes and reioysing,
which oyle from the head droppeth
downe into the berde,Psal. 132. and so continueth
in communicating his graces, vntyll
that the very skyrte of his vestimentes,
and the leste of all his church, receyue
of his influence. And this heades example,
all the membres doe folow, eche
of them gladly communicating with his
next felow, some parte and measure of
his merites and glorye, vnto whom againe
the inferiors do ascende with a sweete
sauor of thanke and prayses, so that in
the whole bodye, there is no one parte
for it selfe, but as God is for all, so all they
are for God, and are, both for their begynning
and ending, in most perfect socyetie.
Therefor in this bodye, how can
any parte doe anye thing for it selfe alone?
or how can there be but a communion

betwixt all the membres of so perfect
a dodye? And to this end only doth
the Catholikes argument come, not as
you grosely vnderstād hym, that he went
about to proue, that as one maye praye
for an other, so one might receyue for another.
Against which point, the more you
talke, the more you make some to laugh,
and some to be angrie, that you reason so
hardly without any occasiō. And yet, you
can not pretend ignorance herein, for at
length you espye your owne fault your
selfe, and you declare, that you see wel inough
what we might say against you, and
therefor you come in with these wordes:
You wyl saye perhappes you do not inferr
this vpon the argument of general communion.Defence fo. 49.
but onelye that they which are in diuers
places maye communicate.
Yea Syr, we saye so without perhappes,Reply.
and if you had ben a reasonable man, you
would neuer haue made such an earnest
battaill against your owne fancye▪ supposing
one to stand before you, which
should saye, that as one maye praye for
an other, so one myght receyue the Sacrament

for an other. Against which cō
                  clusion,
you myght haue some aduantage,
by gathering therof this absurditie,
that, so it wold folow, that our baptisme
here in England, myght benefite some
that are in Fraunce, yet oure only meaning
was, to shewe, how they which are
in diuers places, maye, that notwithstanding,
communicate togeather. Of which
thing what saye you now?
wel Syr,Defence. I grawnte yow that.
               
               Remembre,Replye. I praye you then, what
you graunt. you graunt vs this, that they
which be in diuers places maye cōmunicate.
wel Syr I graunt you that,Defence fol. 
                           •
                        od. but yet, ye should
haue inferred the other point, &c. That is:
to be lyke cōmunion in the Lorde his supper
of one alone receyued, as there is in
prayer, when one man in place alone, prayeth
for a multitude.
               
               That your selfe maye not seeme to haue
spoken much out of the purpose,Reply. therefore
you tell vs,See how the M. of defence wyll apoint the Catholi
                        •
                     ke what argumēt he should vse, that hymselfe might haue r
                        •
                     me and oportunitie to reason agai
                        •
                     st hym. what we should haue
inferred. But lett the Apologie be considered
agayne, and if it can be proued
that any such conclusion was intended

as you doe speake against, then shall you
haue the victorie. You vnderstand the
catholike in this fashion, that whereas he
sayd, there is a communion betweene all
faythfull Christians, as well in receyuing
the Sacrament as in prayer, you conclude,
that lyke as one alone maye praye for
a multitude: so, that we shold inferr, that
one alone may receyue the Sacramēt for
a multitude. As who should saye, when
a similitude or proportion is made betwyxt
two thinges, that they must in all
partes answer one an other, or els the
comparison is nothing worth. Yet we
reade in wyse mens workes this similitude,Cypr
                        •
                      ad 
                        •
                     ulianū.
                  Lyke as a munkey doth counterfait and
folow a mann, so doe the heretykes couet to
appeare lyke vnto the trew Catholykes:
                  It is not necessarye that .ij. thinges compared togeather, should be in al pointes one lyke the other. in
which so saying, no man (I trow) doth
meane that all heretikes haue tayles, but
only that in the acte of imitating perfect
and good Christians, they playe verye
munkyshe partes. which comparison, yf
you shall despyse, because it is made of
twoe thinges of nature very diuers, and
tell vs that a munkey hath an other maner

of heare and coat then a mā, or make
sporte, against the author of that similitude,
as though he would haue cōcluded,
that a reasonable man is no better then
a beast, I would not geaue ouer so, but
further continew in the similitude, and
saye, that lyke as munkeyes, when thei
haue spent all their other knackes, doe
make moppes and mowes cunninglie, to
delight thereby the lookers on: so some
men in the world, when they haue no
more to saye or do, least they should seeme
to be y
                     •
                  le, resorte vnto making of
newe constructions, as it were distorted
and madd faces. For in deed, it is of your
owne making, when you saie that the catholike
shold haue proued, if he had folowed
good order, that lyke as one may
praye for a multitude, so lykewise that one
may receyue for a greate number. For
it was not said vnto you, that receyuing
and praying were in all thinges lyke and
proportionable, but only, as concerning
the strength of communiō, which goeth
through the whole mistical bodye of
Christ not in praier only, or receiuing of

the sacramēt, but in fasting, almes deedes,
penāce, or anye other good acte or benefyte.
And therefor, concerning the proportion,
which is in this respect betwyxt
prayer and receyuing of the sacrament,
you haue to answer, why there is not a
communion to be graunted, when one
alone receiueth, as you can not denie, a
plaine cōmunion, when one alone prayeth.
We aske not o
                     •
                   you, why one maye
not be howseled for an infidell as well as
he maye praye for an infidell, but, whereas
in our most priuate and secrete prayers,
we saie, Our father which art in heauen,
and not my father, by which wordes, we
declare that we be not alone, but accompanyed
with a numbre of other so
                     •
                  nes
and brothers. by what reason then maye
you saie, that he which receiueth alone,
(to your sight) hath no communion with
other of the faith, hope, and charitie? It
is two thinges, to saye, I praye for other,
and I praie with other,Note, to receiue for other and with other or, I receiue for
other, and I receiue with other. To praie
for other, is not allwaies in owre intent,
because of priuate and peculyar cases

which doe so fully occupie vs, yet a faithfull
man doth allwaies praie with other,
because he is in that bodie, whose partes
are ioyned togeather and animated with
charitie. To receiue for other, is a question
of an other tyme, and in some sense
vnpossible, but to receiue with other, is
most consequent for all tymes, except a
man be out of that bodie, which copleth
and vniteth all Catholikes togeather.
               And now, what foloweth hereof? Truly
this, first of all, that you which make your
argumentes against receiuing for other,
doe verye much range out from the matter,
which is of receiuing with other. And
againe, seeing there is such a felowshipp
and communiō, betweene the membres
of one body, how can any priest, in his
sole receiuing to our sight, lack such as
receyue with hym, whereas he communicateth
with all other which receyue of
the same bodie, why then, (saie you) we inferr
this,
                  A sore obiection of the M. of the defēce. 
                  that he which saieth Masse in our ladye
chapple in Paules at sixe of the clock in the
mornyng, doth communicate with hym, that
doth the lyke in Iesus Church at Nyne of the
clock the next daye.
               
               
                  
But Syr, we did not speake of this daye
and the next daye, which times, although
they make greate difference in the iudgement
of folysh vnlearned men, yet before
God, vnto whom all thinges are present,
six of the clock this daye, and nyne
to morowe make no breach of communion,
except you thinke that whē all candles
be put out in the night, the worlde
is at an end, and with the next morning,
the worlde beginneth againe. For otherwise,
why might not he, which saieth
masse this daye, communicate with an
other which shall celebrate an hundred
yeares after hym, as well as we communicate
with the Apostles, which haue departed
this world fyfteene hundred yeare
before vs. Thē what neede you to encomber
your selfe, with this daye and to
morowe, whereas your cause is vtterly
lost, if for the daye which is present, there
be found at euerye sole receyuing of
the priest a communion? which is shortely
concluded in this maner. There is a
communion betweene them which being of
one religion and faith, receyue in sundrye

places. But (for example sake) Syr Thomas
celebrateth Masse and receyueth alone in
Parys, and Syr Ambrose doth the lyke in
Venyce: Ergo Thomas and Ambrose doe
communicate togeather.
               
               Syr I deny your argument,Defence fol. 50. and say, that neyther
thone, nor thother doth cōmunicate with
any Christian man, because neyther of both
receiueth according to Christ his institution.
               You be allwaies lyke your selfe,Replie. in forgetting
your selfe. For here you denye
the argument, and the cause of your denyall
is the fault which you fynde with the
maior and minor propositions of it.what new logi
                        ••
                     e is this? But
if the faulte be only in the propositions;
why denye you the argument? And if the
argument be faultie, how vncunnynglie
do you proue that, by the denying of the
propositions? But go to, let the first proposition
be interpreted as you would haue
it, and lett vs then repete the argumēt,
saying, Thei which receiue in diuers places,
according to the institution of Christ do communicate
togeather. But Syr Thomas. &c.
(as before) doe so: Ergo thei communicate
togeather. How saye you? doth this argumēt

please you? yea truly I thinke it doth:
why then dyd you deny the former argument,
which was altogeather of the same
forme and making with this? But such disputors
they be, with whom the church
hath to doe. Now againe, if you admitt
the argumēt as cōcerning the forme of it,
what saie you to any of the propositions?
Mary, you deny the second proposition,
and say, that none of those two priestes,
whom I named, do worke according to
the institution of Christ. And why so?
Forsoth (saie you) because thei receiue
alone by them selfes. Yea but herein you
say falsely, because the one of them at the
least, receiueth with the other, and so thei
haue a cōmunion, and obserue the institution
of Christ. Naie, saie you againe:
There should be a particular communion
(as I maye terme it) betwene the members
of one congregation.Defence fol. 50.
                  
You do wisely to mitigat the matter, and
as it were,Reply. to aske leaue that you may call
it a particular communion. But you must
haue none, your request is so vnprofitable.
For this particular cōmunion is nothing

worth, yea it is no communion at all, except
it be referred vnto the true and generall
communion in deede. And if the
communicating in the most perfect and
best maner,The needlesse and vpstart inuention of a particular cōmunion▪
                   be fulfilled, will you bring vs
so fair downevvarde, that we must haue
the particular, or els saie the whole is destroyed?
Maye I not, because of your
fancyes, rest in the end, when I am at it,
but come back againe to the beginning,
or myddle of the matter? The ende of
a Christians desier, is, to be vnited vnto
God, through Christ our head in the vnitie
of his body, and to this end I receiue
his body in the sacrament, which, because
he is both God an man, is therfor able to
ioyne vs togeather in vnitie with God &
man. And therefor when I receiue hym,
I cōmunicate both naturallie and mysticallie
with his bodie. Can I desyer any
more, and is any thing vnperfect herein?
               Yea mary (saye you) Christ would haue
vs make a particular communion also.
               But how proue you that by Christ? he
which was wysedome it selfe, would he
make such an accompt of a particular,

that although the whole some and perfection
might be obtayned without it,
yet he would haue a particular communion?
He which cōmunicateth with the
whole bodye, communicateth also with
particulars, and therefor what talke you
of a particular communion, as though
that coulde want, when the whole is obteyned?
If you would denye, that there
is a perfecte commonion betwene men
of one religion, notwithstanding thei be
not in one tyme and place togeather, although
you should speake vntrulie, yet
you should speake not most absurdelie:
but, when you graunt the generall communion,
and yet besydes requyre of necessitie
a particular, you speake so farr out
of all forme and fasshion, that no reason
or probabilitie, may be perceiued in your
saying. Yes (saye you) vnitie and concord is
lyuely represented, as well for the multitude,
which doe communicate, as for the apte signification
of the external elementes. But what
of this? for, euerie thing of which a good
meanyng may be gathered, is not, of necessitie,
to be obserued of vs. To communicate

with Christ our head and his
mysticall bodye, is a thing most necessarie,
if we thinke to receiue hym worthelie:
but to haue a particular communion,
(as you terme it) although it be very laudable,
yet is it not necessarie, and the institution
of Christ doth not requyre it of
vs. For if his blessed will had ben, as you
do seme to interprete it, that there should
be a visible company to receiue togeather
at his table, that the beholding of one
the other, might lyuelie represent the
vnitie, which Christ with them and thei
haue with Christ, and that, without this
particular cōmunion, there might be no
receiuing of the sacramēt, woe then vnto
poore blynde folkes, which can not see
how many receiue with them. Whom, if
the mercy of our Sauior hath not excluded
from commyng to his table, it must
folow then necessarilye, that it was not
Christ his institution and commaundement,
that without a visible cumpany of
communicantes, his sacramentes could
not be ministred. And as such a cōmaundement
dyd not become his wysedome

and his bountefullnes, so would it haue
ben a greate foyle and discōfort vnto his
church, if the neighbors slacknes should
haue letted the deuotion of the well willing
persons, or if no receiuyng at all,
might be suffred without a particular cō
                  munion,
whereas any one Christian receiuing
all alone, doth yet therein communicate
with Christ his whole mysticall
body. Now, because this generall cōmunion
of which we speake, doth greaue you
very sore, which loue to make partes and
separations, you complayne that excommunication
seemeth to be taken awaie,
by this our deuise (as you call it) of a cōmunion
betweene such as are absent and
distant. But, as you are allwaies very discrete
and wittye, so you geaue a reason
hereof, to excuse you from folye. And
what reason is that? Marye,
After your deuise, a priest, that is excommunicated
of the Byshopp,Defence. maye saye masse
in his chamber, and affirme that he wyll cō
                     municate
with hym, whether he will or no.
Yf you thinke as you say, you be very dull
of vnderstanding,Reply. or short of memorie,

because our opinion proueth the cleane
contrarie. For whereas we tell you, that
he which receiueth alone, doth communicate
yet, with the rest of the bodye of
which he is a parte, how farr and wyde so
euer the whole be dilated: so he which is
separated by excommunication from the
body, cōmunicateth with no parte of it,
whether he receiue alone, or receiue with
many. But, if your sentence were true, as
concerning particular, communion, then
would it straitwaies be very hard, to haue
any excommunication. For if England
would not receiue one, he might seeke after
the congregation of Scotland. If thei
would reiect hym, he might seeke many
corners of Germany and Hungary. If Lutherans
would defye hym, he might be intertayned
of the Zuinglians. If thei both
were to honest for hym, he might receiue
after the institution of Christ (as thei
would saie) with Anabaptistes, Arrians,
and such other. But with vs, how can it
come to passe by any deuise of yours, that
he, which is excommunicated by the Byshop,
and therefor quyte separated from

the communion of all Sainctes and Catholikes,
should communicate with the
Byshop, or any other, whether thei would
or no? Naye truly Syr, if Christ his institution
had specially commaunded a particular
communion, as you saye it doth,
so in deede if the Bishope should excommunicate
you, yet you might call halfe a
dozen of good fellowes vnto you, and in
chamber, orcharde, groue, denne, stable,
or vnder hedges, celebrate a memory of
Christ his passion, and challendge vnto
your selfes the folowing of his institutiō,
which institution whilest you vnderstand
so grossely as you doe, you must further
expounde vnto vs, in what quantitie of
numbre, tyme, and place, a communion
may be celebrated. And if for al your fancying
of particular communion, you haue
no ioye to speake of such particular cases,
albeit you may tell vs, that you haue
weightie matters in hand, and can not
therfore dallie, yet we see playnelie, that
you haue not what to answer vs, lest you
should be dryuen vnto many absurde folyes.
And therefor to shifte your handes

of those questions, in which your spirites
might be tryed, you tell vs, that you see in
the Euangelist and S. Paule, that Christ
tooke bread, brake it, gaue it. &c. and that
he did his thinges, in conuenient tyme
and place, and that he had cōpany, which
if we either did not know, either would
denie vnto you, then had you said somewhat.
But our principall question is, whether
such a company and numbre, as he
vsed, be necessarie, or no: as yourselfe haue
before confessed, that the obseruation
of place and tyme, which Christ vsed, is
not necessarie. And because you styffelie
holde, that cūpany is necessarie, we would
vnderstande your mynde further, within
how greate and how small numbre, that
necessarie company consisteth. For it is
written in the Englysh seruice, that without
three, no communion maye be celebrated,
except vpon the speciall request
of the syck person, and in tyme of plagues,
when one maye receiue with the priest alone.
But yet, (I trow) the institution of
Christ, doth permit well inough two alone
to receiue togeather at all tymes.

Now if you be to seeking, for your answeres
in such questions, which would declare
vnto us the full meaning of your opiniōs,
how dare you sett vpp a religion,Blynde guides. which
know not the partes of your owne religion,
and can not tell how fa
                     •
                  r you maie
graunt, or how much you maie denie. As
cōcerning accidences without their subiectes,
and other such true consequēcies,
which doe folow necessarylie vpon other
principles of the Catholike fayth, we are
able to proue them, if you were able to
vnderstand them. Of which thinges, we
are not ashamed, because thei haue ben
openlie declared and beleiued in all the
Vniuersities and diuinitie scholes of Christendome
(many faier yeares before your
diuinity was published;) and if the
                     •
                   might
be any offence taken of them, or else not
sufficient defence made for them, (if your
syde should be iudge,) yet the questions
are so subtile and curyous, that a good
Bysshop might with honesty saie, that he
needeth not to proue them. But you,
which are the fynders out and founders
of the ghospell▪ the controllers of Christendome,

the speciall vessells of God, and
reformers of the perfect and Apostolike
religion, in so plaine and sensible a matter,
as place, number, and tyme is, for thē
which will communicate, to runne into
corners,The false harte of the M. of the defence. and fayne that you haue weightie
matters in hande, and cōmaund your
aduersaries to silence, and not to trouble
your grauities with any particular questions,
it is much against your worship and
honestie, which would be accepted of priuie
counsell with God and Christ, as cō
                  cerning
the ordering of sacramentes. Also,
that accidences may be cōprised without
subiectes, and bodyes be without dimension,
it is openlie in scholes concluded,
to see who can proue the contrarie.
But how few, or how many may make o
                     •
                  
marr your communion, you dare not, or
can not aunswer vnto it, least you should
be reproued. Wherefor, seeing that you
make silence your defence, and will not
vtter the state of your religion, it is no
lytle confort vnto vs, that you be cōfounded
yet in your owne conscience. And as
we haue so faithfull myndes, that in God

his misteries we go no further, then he and
his holy church leadeth vs: so yet (thankes
be to God) our wittes are not so simple,
that in a plaine and sensible question
we can not tell what to answer, but saie
that either our aduersarie dallieth, or fayne,
that the question which is asked, conteyneth
a misterie.
            
            
               The aight Chapiter.
               
                  THE Catholike in his Apologie,
to proue that numbre of
communicātes is not necessarie
in the receiuing of the
Sacramēt, alleageth a saying of Erasmus,
which he sheweth to be agreable vnto the
testimonies of lerned and holie fathers,
Tertullian, S. Cyprian, S. Cirill, and S.
Ambrose. which if we should dilate so
farr forth as we might, our replie would
he very long and tediouse, and except we
doe declare in what sense they serue for
our purpose, it can not be but intricate
and comberous. Shortly therefor to make
a state of our question in this chapiter,
and to haue the more leysure to speake

of the testimonies brought in for v
                     •
                  :
Lett this be our argument, which I praie
the good reader to beare awaye, E
                        •
                     as
                        •
                     us
sayeth, that in olde tyme the bodye of our
Lorde was delyuered into folkes handes, that
they which had taken yt might receyue yt
at home, when they would, Ergo yt is not
necessarye to haue allwayes communicantes.
Now vnto this argument what doe you
answer with all your defence?
Syr it semeth very straunge to me,Defence fol. 52. that you,
which haue so much hated Erasmus, &c.
should now in your nede take helpe and succor
at his hande.
Syr,Reply. our store is so greate, that we neede
not Erasmus authoritie, but our behauior
is so reasonable, that we doe condescend
to you, in alleaging your owne doctors.
And it seemeth very strainge vnto
me, that Erasmus, whom you call a singular
instrumēt prouided of God to beginne
the reformatiō of his church,Eras▪ cōtra Euāgelicos Item, cōtra fratres inferioris Germaniae shold
yet be proued to haue written by name
against the false ghospellers and beginners
of this new reformation of Christianitie.
For is God diuided? or hath he

no better prouided, but that such as you
call the singular instrumētes of vttering
his pleasure and will, should be found so
contrarie emong them selfes and so farr
repugnant, one vnto an other? But as cō
                  cerning
this learned man, we take his cō
                  fession,
we vse not his testimonie. And
we tel you what he thought, if perchaū
                  se
that maye moue you, but we take him
not for a wytnes in our cause, as though
we might not well spare hym. And this
doth hereby wel appeare, that we bring
forth holie and blessed mens authorities
to proue that most true which Erasmus
hath confessed. Of whom, if you be now
werie, for all that God prouided him singularly
(as you saie) for you, what saie
you then to S. Cyprian, S. Cirill, S. Ambrose,
and Terrullian, by whom it is proued,
that in olde tyme, there was sole receiuing
emong Christiās? And here now
to declare pe
                     •
                  chaunse that you be well
scene in antiquities, you tell vs a sadd
tale of much trouble, vexation, and persecution
which was vsed in the primitiue
church, and that the Sacrament was

sent to such as were absent,Defence fol. 54. and that
Hereof it came, that diuers receyued alone
in theyr houses.
Now thankes be to God,Replye. that at length
yet, you can not but cōfesse that sole receiuing
was vsed in the primitiue church.
Where now are your lowde exprobrations,The M. of the defence confesseth sole receiuyng to haue ben vsed in the primitiue church.
that we haue not one worde or sillable
in all the Doctors, for the space of
six hundred yeares after Christ, to make
for vs? That we haue not so much as any
colour or similitude of truth, as concerning
sole receiuing▪ &c? That Christ his
institution is wholy against vs? That ther
must be necessarilie (as you do terme it)
a particular communion? You be not
farr from the kyngdome of heauen, you
be allmost wellcome home, or at least
waies, you be looking homeward a litle.
But this newes is to good (I feare) to be
trew, and allthough you can not denye
sole receiuing, yet you will not be quyet,
but continew styll in your stryuing. For
you saie this:
But you should bring such places,Defence. as might
proue, that the common minister in place of
the Lorde his supper, did celebrate and receyue

alone, other being present, and not
partakyng.
               
               No Syr, you must not rule vs in the maner
of our reasoning,Reply. and appoint vs to
proue that, which we take not vpon vs.
This is it, which I haue wysshed before to
be well remembred, that our question is
not, whether any priest then did receiue
alone, but whether he might doe it laufullie,
or no, that is our question. And as
the Catholike in his Apologie fol. 8. warned
you most playnelie, that there is an
open difference betweene these two sentences:
There was no priuate masse at that
tyme▪
                   and▪ 
                  There ought to be no priuate
masse at any tyme. So take a fayer warning
agayne, that we labor to proue, not
what thing was then commonlie doone,
but what maye now, and might then haue
ben laufullie doone. Mary, we can not
proue (saye you) that the common minister
dyd celebrate and receyue alone,
                  Note againe how the M. of the defence rūneth from the question. 
                  other
being present. Ver
                     ••
                  e what the priest did
we take not vpon vs to proue, but what
he might do, that we can shew vnto you.
Do not you allwaies appeale vnto Christ

his institution? Doe not you make your
selfes so cunnyng in it, that you can tell vs
of the indifferent partes, and of the substanciall
partes of it? Haue not you defined
it, that, to receiue with cumpany is a
substanciall parte of it? And do not you
cōclude herevpon, that the priest can not
receiue by hymselfe alone, without breach
of Christ his institutiō? These being your
principles, if we do disproue any of them,
then is your conclusion destroyed. But
how can we more playnelie do it, then by
reciting the examples of the primitiue
church, by which you are contented to
be tryed, in which age sole receiuing was
vsed, and yet Christ his institution not
thought to be violated? Can you denye
that sole receiuing was thē vsed? you can
not. But you make this limitation, that it
was vsed in case of necessitie, and of laye
men, not of priestes. Well, make the case
how harde so euer you will, we aske no
more, but that all men should know, that
sole receiuing was lawfullie then vsed.
Now therfor (saie you) let vs see, how aptly
vpon this graunt you conclude your purpose?
                  
More aptly (I trust) then you haue doone
it for vs, which behaue your selfe so vprightly,
that all is the worse for your handeling.
We therefore doe not straitwaies
looke for a priest at an aultar, but first, we
take your confessyon that sole receiuing
is lawfull, as being vsed in the primitiue
church: and then we inferr that Christ his
institution doth not requyre of necessitie
a numbre to receiue allwaies togeather:
Ergo then Christ his institution is not
broken, when a priest alone by hymself
                     •
                  
receiueth: Ergo you should amend your
needeles appealing vnto that institution
which you doe not vnderstand, and confesse
that there is no impedimēt wherfor
a priest maye not saie masse, and receiue
alone. For if it had ben a substāciall point
of Christ his institution, to haue cōmunicantes,
no necessitie might haue made for
sole receiuing, but in the primitiue church
ther was sole receiuing: Ergo that, which
you terme particular communion, is not
of the necessitie of Christ his commaundement.
For as concerning the persecutions
of those tymes, which caused that

the Christiās could not come togeather,
thei serued well, to delyuer mens cōsciencies
from the scruples, which thei might
haue had, for not receiuing, but thei doe
not licēce them, to receiue against Christ
his institution. As for example, at an Easter
tyme, when all Christians do receiue
of dutie, if through persecution, certaine
of them were dryuen vnto such extremytes,
that thei could haue neither wheaten
breade, nor wyne, nor priest to minister
the communion vnto them, this necessitie
doth not make it laufull, that thei celebrate
in oten cakes and whey, or that
with their laycall handes thei take, blesse,
and receiue, in the remembrance that
Christ dyed for them, and be thankefull:
but only it maketh for their quyetnes of
mynde and conscience, that thei thinke
not them selfes to haue transgressed the
law of the church, because of the present
necessitie, which hath none other remedye,
but pacience. And so lykewise, if th
                     •
                  
Bishopes which gouerned the church in
those persecutions, had thought it to be

                     •
                  f the substance of Christ his institution,

that without your particular cōmunion
the sacrament might not haue ben receiued,
thei would not haue sent it home to
Christians howses, there to be receiued
of them priuately, but thei would rather
haue exhorted them, not to be discomforted
for all the lack of the visible sacramēt,
and willed them to praye for a quyet
and good tyme, in which thei might cō
                  municate
after Christ his institution. But
for all the trobles of persecution, thei did
not so, Ergo it is plaine to perceiue, that
thei thought not as you do of Christ his
institution. And this being once confirmed,
that the institution of Christ doth
not requyre of necessitie, cōmunicantes,
we doe rightly inferr, that a priest maye
receiue alone, without any iniuire done
to the institution of our Sauyor. But,
(good Lord) how miserablie are you tormented
within your selfes, as it maye seeme?
You graunt sole receiuing in some
case, you confesse it to haue ben vsed in
the primitiue church, and yet you saye,
that Christ his institution doth allwaies
require company. To denie the authoritie

                     . of the defence. you dare not:
and reuoke your owne comment, made
vpon Christ his institution, you will not.
What will ye doe poore soules? you turne
and w
                     •
                  nde your selfes, loth to refuse
the aucthoritie of the primitiue church,
and sorye that you can not make it agree
with Christ his institution, as you expound
it. And therefore, not withstāding
your former graunt, that sole receyuing
was vsed in the primitiue church, yet now
you temper the matter, signifying, that
it was then, either tolerable, or pius error,
but, that now it shold be intolerable and
impia prophanatio. As who should saye, In
deede, it can not be denyed, but that in
the primitiue church sole receiuing was
vsed, vndoubtedly against the institution
of Christ and example of S. Paull in his
epistle to the Corynthians, but yet, we
must not saye so expreslie (for then we
shall marr all) but cōfesse the matter, making
the best that we can of it, and saying,
that it was tolerated and not alowed,
or a certaine good and harmeles error
in the people, and not a wycked prophanation

of Christ his cōmaundement.
But whether this be true or no, that in
the primitiue church a playne transgressing
of Christ his commaundement in
the substance of the sacrament, would
haue ben tolerated of the blessed clergi
                     •
                  
of that age, or that they would haue smyled
at the breach of Christ his institutiō,
and called that fault by no worse name
then pius error, it will easely appeare by
this, that sole receyuing at home was neuer
yet thought vntolerable and wicked.
Yes saye you:
Hyerome against Iouinian mencioneth,Defence fol. 55. that
in his tyme some vsed to receyue in their houses,
but he earnestly inueigheth against that
maner. Why (sayeth he) doe they not come
into the church? Is Christ sometyme abrode
in the common place, sometyme at home in
the howse?
               
               
                  Beleiue not euery spirit (sayeth the Apostle)
but trye them whether thei be of God.

But (alas) how shall he, vvhich knoweth
none other tongue then his English, trye
the truth of his sayinges, which speaketh
vnto hym out of Latyne authors? But if
the simple can not, or should not rather,

examyne these matters, let the indifferētlie
learned take an example by this one
place, with what cōscience and honestie
you alleage and abuse the doctors. Might
not a man thinke, which had neuer read
S. Hierome against Iouinian,Marke how shamefully S. Hierome ys belyed of the M. of the defence. that he expreslie
condemneth the receiuing at home,
out of the church? Yet he sayeth nothing
lesse, which to make more playne
vnto you, consider the occasion of Saint
Hierome his wordes in that place. Iouinian
the heretike, would haue no excellencie
to be in virginitie aboue mariage,
S. Hierome cōfuteth hym at large, vsing
emong other argumentes, that weddlock
is not so great a good thing, seeing that
prayer is hyndred by it, the Apostle saying:
Doe ye not defraude one the other,
                  1. Cor. 7. 
                  except
it be vpon consent for a tyme, that ye
maye entend to praye. He said also, what
maner of good thing call you that, which
letteth a man frō the receiuing of Christ
his bodye? For he presupposeth,Exod. 19. that if
the Israelites did abstaine from their wyues
three dayes before thei receiued the
law, and if Dauid the kyng with his cumpanye

were examined whether they had
layen with their wyues latelie before, whē
they desyred to haue some of the loeues
which are called propositionis panes:
                  1. Reg. 21. much
more a Christian should absteyne a certayne
tyme from his laufull wyfe, before
he did presume to receiue Christ his bodye.
Yet saieth S. Hierome,In Apologia aduersus louinianum. 
                  I know that
this custome is in Rome, that the faythfull
doe at all tymes receyue the bodye of Christ,
which thing I doe neither reproue, neither
allow, for euery man abundeth in his owne
sense. But I aske of theyr consciencies, which
doe communicate the same day, after they
haue had carnall knowledge of theyr wyues,
& i
                        •
                     xta Persium, noctem flumine purgant,
wherefore they dare not goe vnto the Martyrs?
wherefor they go not vnto the church?
ys Christ one abrode, and an other at home?
that which ys not lawfull in the church, ys
not lawfull at home. &c. How saye you
then? Doth S. Hierome in this place inueigh
against the maner of receiuing at
home? Is it not most playne and euident,
that he speaketh against such, as had no
feare to communicate at home after the

nightes pollution, and yet would not venter
to come vnto the places where Martyrs
bones rested, or into the church?
And why should any man feare to come
vnto the chappelles, or memoryes of Martyrs,
after the nightes, what shall I call it,
with his wyffe? Vndoubtedlie for reuerence
sake, and honor, which thei gaue
to Martyrs, as S. Hierome also testifieth
of hym selfe,Hieron. aduersus vigilantium. saying: I confesse vnto the my
feare, least perchance it come of superstition:
when I haue ben angrye, and haue thought
vpon some euyll thing in my mynde, and
when some fancy of the night hath deluded
me, I dare not goe into the churches of Martyrs,
I doe so thorowghly quake for feare, in
bodye and sowle. Therfor, wheras the Romanes,
after the vse of their wyues the
night before, would not come the next
daye into the presence of Martyrs memories,
and yet were not ashamed to receiue
the body of Christ at home, he asketh
of them earnestlie: VVherfore they
goe not vnto the church? not in this sense
which you haue inuented, as though he
should saie: Wherfore do you receiue at

home? why goe you not to the church?
why receiue you in corners? why come
you not to the open congregation? I lyke
not these communions at home, the
doores of the congregation be open to
the faithfull, it is a shame so to receiue by
your selues alone, the institutiō of Christ
is excedinglie broken, he instituted not
his sacrament, that they should haue it
brought home to thē, or that they might
cary it home with them, I know not what
place is better for that purpose then the
house of God, where all the people may
be present togeather, and edifie one the
other through beholding the felowship
and communion of themselues. S. Hierome
was not so full of the spirit, or so
emptie of wytt, but onlye he correcteth
their folye, which in some thinges made
a conscience, in other some of greater
force, made none at all. And he asketh,
why they doe not as well come in to the
church, and in to the chapples of Martyrs,
after they haue cōpanyed with their wyues,
as they dare to receiue the bodye of
Christ at home, for all the formar nightes

fancye and pleasure? Is Christe one abroad,
and an other at home? As who shold
saie, will it hurt you if you come to church
in the presence of Christ his Martyrs, and
make you no conscience of rec
                     ••
                  uing
Christ his body at home in your houses,
whose Martyrs thei were? Yet he doth
not reproue them for receiuing at home,
as by his owne wordes appeareth, saying:
That the faythfull receyue at all tymes the
bodye of Christ, I neyther reproue, neyther
allow. But to this conclusion he labored
to dryue the matter, that whilest they
should be sorye, that they had not communicated
some certayne daye, because
of their pleasure, taken the night before
with their wyues, they might therby abstayne
a lytle from them, that thei might
communicate with Christ. But goe you
furth. Haue you any other authoritie, to
proue that sole receiuing at home was
euer condemned?

this Eustathius, then must we beware of

Arrians vnto vs. And any other, besides
this catholike Eustathius, I can not fynde

historie. Therefore I turne me vnto the

Councelles, and there in deede, I fynde
that Synodus Gangrensis condempneth
one Eustachius (not Eustathius) for many
notable heresyes, but yet there is no
mencion, that he was condempned (as
you saie) for graunting of licence to receiue
at home.The M. of the defence doth dubly

I fynde in Gangrensis Synodus, which doth
not so much as seeme to found any thing
nigh vnto your purpose. Where then is,
that your Eustathius which was condemned
for graunting licence to communicate
at home? or how well haue you proued,
that the custome of the primitiue
church, which for that tyme was tolerated,
was at any tyme after forbydden as
prophane and wycked? Yf therefor these
testimonyes of S. Hierome and Gangrensis
Synodus, by which you would proue,
that to receiue at home, was greatlie inueighed
at and condempned, do no more
make for your purpose, than to saye that
a laye man should not lye with his wyfe
the night before he receiueth, or that
those heretikes are to be condemned,
which contempne Martirs chapples or
churches: how lytle at all could you proue,
that any myslyking was euer had, of
the sole receiuing at home, vsed in the
very primitiue church? The vse of which
tyme, you dare not openlye condemne,
but priuely you leaue to be gathered, that
it was pius error in them. Whereas contrary

wise, if sole receiuing be such a matter
as you make it, that it goeth most directlie
and playnlie against the substance
of Christ his institution, then I am sure,
that the contempt of this lyfe and world,
was so great in the Christians at those

otherwise, but confesse that the priest receiuing
alone is not to be pulled, by you,
from the aultar, not denying, but that in
the primitiue church the people most tymes
receiued with the priest, and that if
thei had not done so, thei were cōmaunded

of Tertullyan, S. Cyprian, and
S. Ambrose, proued, not only sole receyuing
to haue ben vsed at that tyme, but

when they cōsecrate, receyue vnder both

yet, we haue not barely affirmed our saying,
but we haue geauen good cause for
it, that to receyue vnder both kyndes
should not be of the necessarie substance
of the Sacrament, as concernyng the
people. Of which causes, you choose out
one, where we saye, that per concomitantiam,
the body of Christ is neuer without
his bloud, and his bloud is not seperated
from his body, so that no losse or hinderance
cometh vnto the receyuer, which
taketh as much vnder one kynde, as he
should haue doone vnder both. At which
cause, you peck with a skornefull exclamation,
and saye, O profounde and deepe

that is, whether vnder the forme
of bread there be his bodye accōpanyed

And you tell vs, that the communion of

saie, with olde heretikes, that the worde

                  ch spake by the Euangelist, was wise

In Christes naturall bodye,Defence. fol. eod. that ys in heauen,
I know, his flesh ys not without his bloud, but
in the sacrament, which is no naturall worke,
how will you assure me, that the flesh and
bloud ysioyntly signified and geauen vnto
me, vnder one parte onlye?
Yf the sacrament be no naturall worke,Reply.
                  
what is it then, Supernatural, or artificial?
Yf you make it a lesse worke then naturall,
then do you debate greatlye the glorye
of the new testament, whereas the
manna of the olde lawe,Exod. 16. & 17. and water which
issued out of a rock for the Israelites, were
more excellēt figures, then the verities
of them, which are emong true Christians.
But if you thinke, that they be not
naturall, to make vs thereby to conceyue
a greater estimation of them, then saie
I, so muche the more it is credible, that
the bloud should be ioyned vnto the body,
because that in very common nature
we see it so, and nothing wonder at it.
But yet (saye you)
Christ which knew as well as you the ioynt
condition of his flesh and bloud,Defence. fol. 
                           〈◊〉
                        . dyd not with
stāding, in two sundry external thinges, geaue
the communion of them to his Disciples.
               
               This letteth nothing our beleif, which
do know,Reply. as well as you, that Christ gaue
his body and bloud vnder two formes of
bread and wyne, and yet notwithstanding
one Christ was receiued vnder both formes
of bread and wyne. But therefor he

deliuered hymselfe vnder those two kyndes,
and not one, that we might the better
consider his passion, in which the
bloud was separated from the bodye.
               Therfore the fayth of the communicantes
in the one parte,Defence ibidem. receiueth the body, trusting
to Christ his promises: the same fayth in the
other parte, receyueth the bloud, beleiuing
also our Sauior his wordes therein.
               You haue not to proue, that in the one
part the body was receiued,Reply. but that the
bodye onlye without bloud is receiued.
And then further, where you say that the
faith of the communicantes receiueth the
bodie, doeth it receiue it as a dead carkas,
(shame to thinke it) or else as the bodye
of the soune of God? Christ our Sauior
saieth:Io. 6. 
                  The flesh profiteth nothing, it is the
spirite which quyckeneth.
                  That the cōmunicantes receiue not a bodie without bloud and liffe. How then, doth
the communicantes faith receiue such a
sole body, which hath neither bloud, neither
lyfe, neither diuinitie in it? The forgeauenes
of synnes commeth only from
the Deitie, but the cheif instrument, by
which God worketh, is Christes our Sauior
most dearlye beloued Humanitie.

Which, if a man conceiue, as separate
from his Diuinitie, then trulye as it is emong
all creatures most excellent, so yet
is it but a creature, and very lytle auayleable
vnto vs: mary, as it is the bodye and
bloud of hym, which was not only man,
but also God most glorious, his body and
bloud doth releiue vs through the presence
of his maiestie. You therfore which
do diuide Christ, and by your faith (which
no wyse man doth euer trust) make a receiuing
of a body without all bloud, lyfe,
or diuinitie, doe most playnelie take the
fructe of their redemption from the people,
and make them to hang vpon grosse
imaginations of a bodye without bloud,
and bloud without a bodye, to their exceading
losse and iniurie. But now, if all
other argumentes fayled vs, and if your
deuise were not so obscure and vyle, as it
is, yet the authoritie of the church, is no
small thing emong Christians, againste
which you speake so lyke a madd master,
as though you knew the voyce of Christ,
better then the church of Rome, which
yet doe not know whether there be any

Christ, or no, except it were for the authoritie
of the church of Rome. And whereas
you buyld all your institutions and
articles, vpon the textes of the scripture,
and your priuate interpretations, and cō
                  tempne
your mother Church, yet except
you folow the voyce of the church of Rome,
you can with no reason defende that
this which you holde, is scripture. And
here againe you call vpon vs to remembre
S. Cyprian, which in all that epistle
of his, vnto which you do referr vs, doth
so make against them which ministred
only in water, that he cōfuteth also them,
which minister onlye in wyne, prouing
both by the old and new law, that wyne
and water both should be mengled togeather
in the misteries. But as concerning

we haue to speake, what aunswer you vnto

argumentes taken out of them
are but coniectures, and the same very vncertayne,

and heathen rulers or gentlemen,
thēselues being Christians, emong which
this is a verye principall one, that in the
houses of paynyms they shall not well be
able to keep the orders of Christian people:
he sayeth, after other persuasions:
Shalt thou not be espied (cùm lectulum,

it to be bread, and not that which it is

said to be. Of these wordes you gather
that in the name of bread is vnderstanded
also wyne, and why so? Mary because
that some tymes emong the Doctors (of
which hereafter we shall speake more)
both kyndes are vnderstanded, when but
one is expressed: ergo Tertullian in this
place is in lyke maner to be construed.
But our collection is otherwise, that because
we reade but one kynde specifyed,
therefore without any necessitie we doe
not make coniectures that he meaneth
both. And we see, that Tertullian in this
booke, was not in such hast that he needed
to speake by figures vnto his wyfe, or
to number syx for the dozen. Then by
common reason, we see that wyne, in so
lyttle a quantitie as ones parte commeth
vnto in the distributing of the mysteries,
was not to be reserued of any person, because
of the quyck alteration of it. Allso
we beleiue, that vnder one kynde Christ
wholye is geauen, and therefor that the
gouernors of the church were not so folysh
or scrupulous, as to make a necessitie
of both. And whereas you perceyue

by this testimonye, that sole receyuing
was then vsed, (which by your sayeing
Christ his institution doth not permit)
we had no iust occasion to mystrust the
receyuing vnder one kynde, which we
know to be of no greater force then the
receyuing with company. And you also
(if you had good wyttes) might for good
cause feare, least you were deceyued in
the question of receiuing vnder both kindes,
whereas in the controuersie of sole
receyuing, you be so openly confounded,
which yet you doe as earnestile endeuor
to proue, as you doe shifte to vnderstand
both kyndes in Tertullian, whereas he
mencioneth but one.Note the chaingeablenes of heretikes. Note further, that
when Christ said, This is my bodye, you
will haue no bloud to appertaine vnto it,
and when any Doctor doth speake onlie
of bread, you will at your pleasure make
wyne to be vnderstanded. Iniurious in
the one, and superfluous in the other.
               Therefore let it be tryed, which of our
two sydes doth vse more vncertaine coniectures.
Now as concerning S. Cyprian,

feare least he should depart this lyfe without

                  g, that we can
not proue that the common vse, or the
ordinary vse of the sacrament in the primititiue
church, was to be receyued of
one alone, or vnder one kynde. And this
you wil enforce vs to proue against you,
vpon the which we stryue not with you,

but as we reade what the cōmon vse was,
so we reade that it was not such a necessarie
vse, as would admitt no dispensatiō,
For we bring you furth good examples,
by which you shold vnderstand, that euē
in the primitiue church, receyuing vnder
one kynd was vsed. We do not saye that
it was vsed commonlie, eyther ordinarilie,
or as a generall rule, (for you be so
full of playe, that it is best to keepe you
shorte) but we saye, that it was vsed, and
the vse of it was not reproued, and that
the presence of Christ vnder one kynde
was cōfirmed by miracle, al which pointes
doe appeare in this one historie of
Satyrus. Whom if you can proue not to
haue had the Sacrament about his neck,
vnder one kinde only, then shall you saye
somwhat to the purpose. If we can proue
by any one exāple, that reseruatiō, sole receiuing
or receiuing vnder one kind was
alowed, your buyldinges shal straitwaies
come into contempt and confusion, because
that you worke, (or els you lye,)
after the substanciall and liuelie paterne
of Christ his institution, which is neuer

to be altered (saie you) in the substantial
pointes,The storie of holy Satirus delyuered from the suspitions and lyes, which the M. of the defence wold brīg in to it, and proued to make for receyuing vnder one kynd. of which you speake. The better
willing therefore I am, to consider the
historye of Satyrus, which maketh (we
thinke) so directlie for vs. In answering
of which, you tell vs first that Satyrus was
a nouice in our fayth, wherein you saye verie
truly, and make the example the greater,
if he, which was not yet fully instructed
in our misteries, did thinke so diuinely
and excellentlie of them. Further
you alleage that it doth not appeare whether
they, of whom Satyrus receiued the Sacrament,
were ministers or other. Why Syr,
to what purpose would it serue, if you
could proue, that they had ben ministers?
Doe you thinke, that vpon the sodayne,
when the tempest was comming,
thei prepared them selues to a comm
                     •
                  
                  nion,
and had not the Sacrament prepared
before? And if thei had ben of your
order, would thei haue suffred a sage person,
to tye the Sacrament about his neck
for safegarde sake, and not rather to make
a cōmunion of it, after the right vse of
Christ his institutiō? Thē to put you out

of doubt, thei were no ministers. For the
historie saieth, that whē holy Satyrus had
escaped drouning him selfe, and him selfe
cōming first to lande had either holpē to
saue other, or sawe them all to be recouered,
then he straytwaies asked where the
church was, there to geaue thankes, and
receiue also those euerlasting misteries, aeterna
mysteria. Also, prouing so great defence
to haue come vnto him, by hauing the
heauenly misterie folded vpp in a cloth,
how much (thought he) shall I wyn, if I
doe receyue him in my mouth and with
all the botome of my hart? But although
he were desirous, yet he was not folish venterous.
Therfor he calling the Bishop vnto
him, asked whether he did agree with
the Catholike Bishopps, that is to saye,
with the church of Rome, for the church
of that countrey, as concerning that place,
was in a schisme. Which being well
considered of hym, and that allthough
they of those quarters had beleife in
God, yet they were not faythfull vnto
the churche, he departed from thens,
differring the payment of his thankes,

                  & the debt which he was in for receiuing
the Sacrament, and went forth vntyll he
came to such place where he might be
safely discharged. Now therefore, if thei
had ben ministers, which deliuerd the Sacrament
vnto S. Satyrus in the shipp, he
might haue receiued it at their handes
whē he was now come to lande, and neuer
haue sought further for the matter,
but whiles he was so desyrous to receyue
his Lorde and defendor (Praesulem suum
sayeth S. Ambrose,) and yet was not so
bolde as to receyue him in that coūtrey,
he declareth therebie, not only that he
had no priestes in his companie, but also
that we shold not cōmunicate with schysmatikes▪
and he interpreteth vnto vs what
a Catholike Bishopp is, saying that he is
such a one as agreeth with the church of
Rome.what a Catholike bisshope ys. But to make more doubtes, and
that in speaking much, it should appeare
that the historye of Satyrus is not cleane
and cleare against you,
There ys (say you) nothing to the contrarye,Defence fol. 61.
but that the same persons which had the
Sacrament of our Lord his bodye, had also
about them the Sacrament of the bloud.

Doth the history geaue you any occasiō
to thinke so,Reply. or els doe you speake it, but
vpon your owne head? For if some at
the beginning, when the church was persecuted
openlie by the princes of the
world, dyd carie the sacrament of Christ
his bloud about them, it doth not folow
that in Sainct Ambrose his tyme, whē the
church was more enlarged and better setteled,
the lyke manner was allwaies vsed.
You tell vs, that in taking of a long iorney

some caryed the sacrament of the blould with
them, and because they could not conuenietly
carye wyne with them, they soked the Sacrament
of the Lorde his bodye in the bloode.
               
               As whoe should saye, that thei might not
more cōuenient lie haue caryed the bloud
in some vessel for the purpose. Other (saie
you) moysted a lynnen cloth in the Sacramēt
of bloud, Some, either because they could
not by nature, or would not for religiō drinke
wyne, vsed only water. Some other vsed
mylke for wyne. But what of this? Can
you inferr, vpon these perticular cases,
that it is lykely that they which delyuered
the Sacrament vnto Satyrus, (as S.
Ambrose writeth) had the Sacrament of
bloud also about them as you doe suppose?
As well it will folow then, that thei
had the Sacrament of Christ his bloud,
eyther in forme of water only or of milke,
because that you haue readen that in
such formes it hath ben receyued. Consider
also, that in S. Ambrose his time the
church was not so much vnder feare of
princes as before, neyther was holy Satyrus
such a simple sowle, allthough a

nouice then in our faith, as to receiue the
Sacrament of such whom he knew not
to be perfectlie instructed in the Christian
religion. And he, being a man of
honor, it is not lykely that the Ini

                  Epist. 85. Againe, in his tenth
booke of epistles, speaking of the holye
relyques of Geruasius and Prothasius:
Quanta oraria iactitantur, quant a indumenta▪
supra reliquias sacratissimas, vt tactu ipso
medicabilia reposcantur? How many napkins
or kercheyes, how manye coates or clothes
are cast vpon the most holye relyques,
that being made medicinable through the verye
touching of them, they might be requyred
for, and had awaye agayne? Therefor,
if orarium shall not be englysshed a stole,
yet that you maye not thinke, that it was
a bottle to carye wyne in, I haue shewed
you two places out of Saint Ambrose, in
which it is taken for a lynnen cloth. And
now, if holy Satyrus dyd put that sacramēt
which he receiued, in a lynnen cloth,
and wrapped it about his neck, it is very
probable vnto vs, that it was in forme of
bread onlye, except you will yet styll contynew
in your imagination, and make a

gesse, that it was either a mylkesopp or a
wynesopp, or a lynnē cloth moysted with
wyne, which he folded vpp in a kerchey,
napkyn, or stole. And then lett any indifferent
man be iudge, which of vs two
speaketh most reasonably, you which thinke
that he had the sacrament of bloud togeather
with the sacrament of Christ his
bodye, or we, which can not deuyse how
wyne should be there inclosed, where we
reade no mencion of other thing, but only
of a lynen cloth. Now, as concernyng
that, where you saye, that lerned and holye
men did wynke and beare with many
thinges in the begynnyng, (as though the
reseruation of the blessed Sacrament, or
vsing of it in suchesorte as that holy Satyrus
dyd, were to be numbred in that
kynde of thinges) you make S. Ambrose
therein to lack a greate part of his fortitude
of mynde and wysedome. For he,
such a Bishop, would neuer haue suffred
any substanciall parte of our fayth to be
defaced within his knowledge, and especiallye
with his brother he might and
would haue ben so bolde, as to reforme

his simplicitie and superstitious zeale of
mynde towardes the sacrament. And if
you will ymagine, that he was loth to tell
his owne brother the perfect truth of thin
ges in his lyfe tyme, yet at least, after his
death he should neuer haue praysed hym,
(as he doeth in a most exquysite maner)
for that, which (according to your saying)
was to be tolerated onlye in the quyck,
and not praysed and commended in the
dead. Saint Ambrose therfore, in a most
sadd maner and tyme, praysing his good
brother, which then was departed this
world, for many and sundrye vertues, of
iustice, clemencie, temperancie, and chastitie,
and especiallie commending hym,
for his fayth and pietie, which shewed it
selfe in the shipwrack of which we haue
spoken, how can it be thought, that so
wise and constant a Bishop would alleage
that historie to proue the pietie of his
brother, which rather (after your interpretation)
was to be wynked at and kept
vnder silence, least he should seeme to betray
& vtter his superstitious behauiour
and folie? You myngle also mylke, wyne,

water, soppes, & moysted lynnē clothes altogeather,
as though there were no differēce,
whether one did celebrate in milke
alone, or wyne alone, or as though that,
if the soking of the sacrament of Christ
his bodye in his bloud was by Iulis decrees
reproued, therefore also receyuing
vnder one kynde, or sole receiuing should
be in lyke case myslyked. And yet, against
water alone, or mylke in steede of wyne,
you haue the expresse institution of
Christ, and the expresse canons of Bysshops
and Councelles, but you can bring
no such proufe against vs, that the sole
receiuing or receiuing vnder one kynde
is in no case lawful. One thing I must cō
                  fesse
vnto you, that in deed you haue taken
paynes to proue, that the common
maner of receiuing in the primitiue churche,
was vnder both kindes, and in this
part you alleage Gelasius, Tertullian, Iustine,
Cyprian, Ambrose, Gregorye Nazianzene,
Hierome, Hilary, and Chrisostome
learned men all, and the most of
them Sainctes. How well thei serue for
your purpose, what should I neede to examyne,

whereas you will cōclude no more
by them,The fallacie or folie that the M. of the defence vseth against so, le receiuing. but that which we graunt without
prouing. It was a common maner
to receiue in both kindes, and to receiue
with cumpanie, but what of that? Maye
you conclude thereby that it was also the
only maner? and except you proue that
it was the only maner, all your reasoning
make nothing against vs. Therefor Syr,
as you fought all this while out of the
fyelde and matter proposed, so haue you
triumphed, without any victory at all obtayned.
And although you laye allmost
desperate stubbernes vnto our charge,
and exhort your readers to beholde the
slendernes and feblenes of our reasons,
yet we will not be aferde to resist you in
those pointes, against which you can saie
nothing, and we shall counsell lykewise
the reader, not to walke vpon other mens
feete, but by his owne sense and disctetiō,
to consider whether that you haue not
halted out of the question of which onlye
we had to talke, prouing vnto vs, that

one kynde may and hath ben vsed without
any breach of Christ his institution.
               Thirdly now it foloweth, to speak of

alone, did well, it is inough for our purpose

You wyll not (you say) playnlie deny the
place,Defence fol. 70. because it is alleaged of diuers other.

Yet because this worke of S. Cyrill is not
extant, you haue good cause to suspect it.
Although the worke be not extant vnto
you,Reply. yet it maye be in some libraries of
the world: and the place being alleaged
of many, an honest plaine dealing man
would not suspect, without some good
and great cause, that it were falsely fathered
vpon S. Cirill. For if the Catholikes
could haue founde in their hartes, to haue
mysused the simplicitie of others, and
to attribute vnto holie fathers, such sentences
as were neuer thers, it had ben an
easie matter for the Bisshoppes of Christendome,
in that great consent and peace
of faith, which hath ben in the church
for eight or nine hundred yeares togeather
(vntill the dyuell raised vpp Luther)
to haue agreed vpō such a booke, which
should make expressely against new vpstart
heretikes, and haue the name of S.
Augustine, S. Ambrose, S. Hierome, or
some other. And againe, it had ben an
easye matter for some one Bisshop, Abbot,
or Doctor, to fayne that he had foū
                  de
such or such a booke of S. Augustine,

S. Ambrose, S. Hierome, or other,
if there had ben no more conscience in
Catholikes, then is proued to be now in
heretikes. It is sone said, this is not Saint
Cyrill his testimonie, and as the prouerbe
is in some scholes, Plus potest asinus negare,
quàm Aristoteles probare. And further
also, if the Catholikes should be perceiued
neuer to haue had emong them this
testimonie of S. Cyrill, before that late
heretikes of these dayes beganne to impugne
them openlye, as one might easely
alleage, at all aduenture, vpon some
priuate wylfulnes, that S. Cyrill sayeth
this vnto Calosyrius, so might he probably
be suspected of an other, lest perchaū
                  se
he inuented false testimonies. But you
can not proue it by vs, that we haue vsed
this defence out of S. Cyrill, only sence
we haue striued against you, but rather,
when all thinges were quyet, you shall
finde those testimonies which you suspect,
to haue ben recyted of Catholikes.
And especiallye that saying of his, which
maketh for the supremacie of the Bishop
of Rome, which some hundred yeares agoe,

S. Thomas Aquinas hath recyted
out of S. Cyrill Thesaurorum .xij. which
testimony if it be not in the Latyn now
extant, yet it maye be in the Greeke, and
what Greeke copyes are beyonde sea you
can not tell, and if it be not in print, yet
it may be in wryten bookes, whereas many
yeares, before any printing was in the
world, this testimonie is alleaged by approued
men and excellent, both for learning
and lyuing. Also, if you haue cause
to suspect the testimonie which hath not
the worke extant, out of which it was taken,
what cause moued you then, to make
so greate store of a fragment of Gelasius

because the worke is not extant, but because

doth appeare manifestlie, that Origine
did not entend to make a necessarie conclusion,
that the sacrament must not be
reserued, no more then he doth affirme
that the cause why the Gabaonites were
made bondemē vnto the Iewes, was; that
they brought old crustes of who
                     •
                  e bread
in their pouches and budgetes. But, as he
was an exceading subtyle diuine, and latbored
to drawe all thinges vnto a good
spirituall sense, so he sayeth, that Christ
gaue breade vnto his Disciples, and bad
them

vntyll the morow, to signifie that our preching
vnto the people, and our praysing
of God, should be allwaies new, that is
to saye, spirituall and harty. Vnto which
his argument and reason, if I would answer
and say, that neyther Christ did bydd
his Apostles to eate his body straitwaies,
and that graūting also so much vnto hym,
yet reseruation of the sacrament in the
church, might stande with Christ his fact
in his supper well inough, I see not what
might be replyed against me, or how he
should mayntayne his proposition. Yet
because his cōclusion is true (that in preching
of the Ghospell, and praysing of
God, we should bring furth a new and
spirituall sense,) I will not stryue with
him vpon the premisses, but rather be
glad of his wyt

that I see so much in the Sonne and Mone,

that a sounde testimonie may be

would haue you warned of, that after

as altogeather of no authoritie, which
your selfe do thinke vnworthie to be fathered

now, whereas S. Cyprian, or that other,

and is this an other of your sound

testimonies, which you make so to sound
as though the sacrament were not to be
inclosed within a pyxe, or shut vp within

Cyprian in that sermon, after many other
excellencies, which he founde to be in

this dweller, and the narrownes of our sely
poore house, doth not offende or bynde in the
greatnes of God, which is large and allmightye.
How saie you then? is not the sense
of those wordes, he is receyued, and not included,
referred onlie vnto the cōmendation

and setting furth of Christ in the sacrament,
which cōtinueth allwaies whole
and one, although he should be diuided
emong neuer so manye persons? and is
not included within them, which yet doe
receiue hym? Yet what a sense haue you
put vpon this place? as though this were
the meaning of it,thei which haue any vnderstanding, let them for truthe sake cōsider, how S. Cypriane, and the vnlerned lay people are abused. that Christ is receiued
and not included, that is to saie, we must
receiue the sacramēt and keepe no parte
of it vntyll the next daie, nor shut vp any
portion of it within pyx, boxe, or coffer,
but straitwaies make a perfect communion,
that there may be in any case no reseruation.
Yet in that place, there is nothing
lesse intended, which (as euery meane
learned maye perceiue) is wholy sett
furth and decked, with the coopling of
contraries togeather, as, To be distributed,
which importeth a making of partes, and
not to be dismembred, which signifieth no
parte to haue ben pulled from the whole.
To be incorporated, which should not seeme
to be done without some alteration,
and yet not to be iniuried, which declareth
agayne the thing to contine
                     ••
                   in his former

estate. To be receiued, by which worde
we seeme to haue it within vs, and not
to be included, which setteth agayne the
thing at libertie. Wherfore this place as
it maketh nothing for your purpose, so
yet it maye serue vs, and all other which
haue regarde of their soules, to beware
how thei go vpon other mens feete, or ryde
(if thei be gentlemen) vpon an others
bayard, except thei be sure before, that togeather
with his boldenes he hath also his
eyes. After this, you alleage out of Isichius
that the residue of the sacrament not receiued,
was in his tyme burned, and out
of S. Clement, (whom you contemptuouslie
doe call our Clement) you recite
that the ministers must with feare and reuerence,
eate vpp the remaynent of the
consecrated hostes, wherevpon you conclude
that reseruation was not generally
vsed, which being graunted vnto you, it
remayneth yet that S. Cyrill maye stande
well inough with S. Clemēt and Is
                     •
                  chius.
For as examples are brought for declaration
of both partes, so is reseruation a
thing indifferent to be vsed, or to be omitted.

And lyke as we should proue our
selues very ignorant, if we should denye
absolutelye that reseruation was at anye

                     •
                  yme omitted, so doth S. Cyrill saie wiselie
and trulie, that thei are madd men,
which make no price of the sacrament, if
it be once reserued. In the later end of
the chapiter, you presse vs with S. Clement
his authoritie, as though we had euer
graunted vnto you, that all is to be folowed
now of necessitie, which was once
obserued in the primitiue church, or as
though our answer had not euer ben, that
receiuing alone or with cumpany is in it
selfe a thing indifferent. But it seemeth,
you were well apaied, that you had shifted
away the article of reseruation, which
troubleth you verye

                  ore, to which your
aunswer is exceding symple and vnperfect,
yea rather it is no aunswer at all. Because
you confesse as much as we do requyre,
that reseruation was then sometymes
vsed. But you tell vs, that sometymes
it was not vsed, which maketh nothing
so the purpose. Now one thing
more will I saie, and so end this chapiter.

You protested to admit the Doctors, in
such degree as S. Augustyne teaceth you,
which is to saie, if they bring either scripture
or good reason. Therefor what saie
you to the reason, which S. Cyril maketh,
that the sacrament, if it be reserued, is
for all that of one state and strength, because
the vertue and power of consecration
continueth with it? It is not man
which blesseth or consecrateth the bread,
but it is Christ hym selfe, which doth sanctifie
and chainge the bread and wyne,
whose worde being permanent, and out
of the dainger and mutabilitie of tyme,
how can it be otherwise then his bodye,
that which is once cōsecrated, if it should
remayne vnreceiued a thousand yeares to
geather? vnto this reason and question,
you haue to aunswer with all your cunnyng
and learnyng.

haue company in receyuing, it is (you
saye) a substanciall part of the sacramēt,
without the which the sacrament hath
not his inward perfection. Wherein, if
you saie true, Syrapiō or any other shold
neuer haue ben suffred to receyue the sacrament
alone, and most playnly to goe
against Christs owne law and cōmaundement.
And if, in that case, he should haue

maxima and rule, that necessitie had no
law. As concernyng the Sabbate daye,
which the Iewes were commaunded so
expresselie to keepe, which yet in tyme
of necessitie thei did omit without breach
of the commaundement, it serueth nothing
to your purpose, because it is in some
respect ceremonyall. For the tables
of Moyses comprehend in them nothing
els, but the law of nature, vnto which we
are bound as well as the Iewes euer were,
but how doe we keepe it, whereas our
daye of rest is not the Sabbate of the Iewes,
but the next daye after, and that, for
the honor of Christ his resurrection?
               Christ hath not sett vs at libertie, to omit
the naturall law, but onlye the positiue
and ceremonyall law of the Iewes. But
now, we kepe not the Sabbate day as thei
did,How the sabbat daie is of necessitie to be kept and how it admitteth di spensation. ergo that commaundement as concerning
that daye, pertayneth vnto the
positiue law, which admitteth dispensation,
and not the law of nature, which for
no necessitie is to be broken. Yf then i

were a point of ceremonyall or positiue

law, to keepe the seuenth daye holye, the
Iewes, notwithstanding the charge which
God gaue vnto them, might in cases of
necessitie worke or fight vpon the Sabbate
daye. But as cōcerning the naturall
precept, which is, that we shall take our
selues at some tymes vnto quyetnes and
rest from all worldely busynes, to consider
therein the more earnestlie the benefites
and workes of God towardes vs,
ther is no such necessitie which may cause
it to be omitted. Marye the appointing
of the tyme for that purpose, and the namyng
of the firste, second, or thirde moneth
or daye of the yeare, or the weeke, in
the which we shall leaue of all wordlye
toyling, and entend only vpon God, this,
as it is ruled by positiue law, so in tyme
of vrgent necessitie it may be dispensed
withall, without breach of the law. Therfore
some commaundement of God may
be not fullfilled in tyme of necessitie, and
after the necessitie ouercommed, it may
returne vnto his formar strength. But if
God make, not politike orders, but immutable
sacramētes, and geaue vnto those

sacramentes forme and matter, such as
shall be of the substance of them,No necessity can serue to omitt or breake any commaūdemēt of God concerning the substātce of it. I saye,
that in this case no necessitie is able to
make it laufull, that the substantiall ordre
which he appointed, maye be omitted.
And so, no man can vse cheese or mylke
in consecrating of the sacrament. And if
receiuing with cumpanye, be (as you report)
a part of the substance of the sacrament,
it can not at all be omitted, what
so euer necessitie should be alleaged.
               Therefore, whereas reseruation, and sole
receiuing, is so playnly proued by the historie
of Syrapion, that you can not denye
it: it is not of necessitie to receiue
straitwaies the sacrament, as sone as it is
consecrated, or to receiue it with cumpanye.
Last of all, whether Syrapion receiued
in forme of bread onlie, or wyne,
because it were to no purpose to proue
any one of them both, whereas you are
prouided to vnderstand both formes vnder
that one, which I might shewe to be
agreable vnto that place, therefore I will
not labor to proue receiuing vnder one
kynde, by this historie of Syrapion, contenting

myselfe with this, that it proueth
most manifestlie the reseruation and sole
receiuing of the sacrament.
            
            
               The tenth Chapiter.
               
                  IN the .xiiij. canon of the Nycene
Councell, it is proued,
that Deacons haue no authoritie
and power to offre sacrifice.
In the same Councell and canon it
is decreed, that neyther Deacons should 
minister the sacramēt vnto Priestes, neyther
receiue it before Bishops. And further
it is graunted, that if the Bishops or 
Priestes be absent, the Deacōs may bring
furth the sacrament, and eate it. Vpon
which propositions, the Catholike maketh
this argumēt, to proue reseruation,
and saieth: Yf the Deacons, (as it appeareth
by this canon) which had no authoritie
to consecrate, and to offer the sacrifice
of Christ his body and bloud, might
in the Bishops and Priestes absence, fetch
furth the sacrament, and receiue it, can
you denye, but it was reserued? how saie
you to this argument?

                     
TheDefence fol. 76. .xiiij. Canon of Nicene Councell in no
sense doth proue sole receiuing, as you would
haue it seeme to doe.
You be foulye deceaued,Reply. and besides you
make a shamefull lye vpon the Catholike,The M. of the defence doth ouershote hymselfe wonderfullie.
because he concludeth only (by that
canon) reseruation, and not sole receyuing,
in so much that he vseth not the place
to proue receyuing vnder one kynde,
which, if he would folow your example
in cōmenting vpon a text, he might haue
doone right well inough. But as concerning
sole receyuing, he hath no one worde
by which you should or might gather
that he vsed the canon for that purpose.
He asketh you most expressely, whether
you can denye that, by the testimonye of
this Councell, the sacrament was reserued?
and you aunswer hym, that it doth
not proue sole receyuing, and therevpon
you make a great talke, and ye tryumph
in your owne folye, and saie, that you are
beholding vnto hym for putting you in
mynde of this canon, and you thinke that
he shall be lytle thanked for bringing in
this Councell, and, to be short, as though

all were wonne, you sing, as it were, Te
Deum, and you thanke God that we are
dryuē so much to our shiftes, that we can
not mayntayne falsehod, but that we are
constreyned to promote the truth. But,
o Lorde God, what hath ben sayed wherefore
this felow should have such a vantage
against vs? or what falshod is that,
which we would maynteyne by this canon?
or what truth is so singularly vttered,
by reason of this our testimonye?
               
                  This canon (saye you) doth not proue sole
receyuing. Mary, Syr, neyther we haue vsed
it for that purpose. It proueth, (saye
you) that in the primitiue church the maner
was to receyue with cumpanye. We knew
this before you tolde vs. Ergo (saye you)
all sole receyuing is by this testimonye confounded.
I deny your argument, for as we
confesse and know, that receyuing with
cumpany was ordinary in the church for
some tymes and places, so we beleiue and
haue proued it before, that sole receiuing
hath sometymes ben allowed. Wher now
then is your gaye victory? We resist not
your authorities, by which you may proue

many to haue receyued togeather, but
we myslyke with your discretion, which
conclude that sole receyuing is not therfore
allowable. And agayne, what talke
you in this place of sole receyuing? Answer
rather vnto our argument, which
proueth reseruacion. The Deacōs could
not consecrate, the Bishops and Priestes
being absent, in this case then (sayeth the
holy Councell) lett the Deacons themselues
bring furth the sacramēt, and eate
it. But how should they eate it, except
they had it? and how should they haue it,
except it were first consecrated? or how
could it be presentlye consecrated, when
both Bishops and Priestes were absent?
               Must it not folow necessarily, that it was
reserued, in that they are licensed to take
it furth them selues, and eate it? Yf you
can denye, reseruation to be proued by
this place, we must wonder at your ignorancie:
and if you cōfesse it playnlie, wher
is your proper answer vnto it? Oh (saye
you) in these Deacons, which receyued
in absence of the Bishop and Priestes,
There appeareth an extraordinary case.Defence fol. 77.
                  
               
               
                  
Such is your ordinary answer, but wherein
is the case extraordinary?Reply. In that the
Deacons receyue it in absence of the Bishop
and Priestes, or in that it was reserued?
It was ordinarye, that the Priestes
should geaue the sacrament to the Deacons,
but what if no Priest had ben present?
then, sayeth the Councell, the Deacons
may bring it furth, and serue themselues.
And in this respect, you saye truly,
that here is an extraordinary case. But as
concernyng the reseruation of the sacrament,
how can you deuise that it was extraordinarye?
Doe you thinke when the
Bisshops or Priestes were sure to tarye at
home vntyll the morow, that they then
did not make any store of the sacrament,The .xiiij. Canon of the Nicene Councell confirmed to make for reseruatiō.
but presently bestow it emong the communicantes,
and when they could not intend
the mysteries the next day folowing,
thinke you, that they consecrated more
hostes then needed for that tyme present,
and sayd vnto the Deacons: Syrs,
here is the sacrament for you in store vntyll
to morow? But what necessitie was
there for the Deacons to receyue on the

morow, that the breache of Christ his institution
might be somewhat thereby excused?
Truly the Deacons should tarye,
not only one daye, but one whole yeare,
rather then reseruation should be admitted,
if so greate fault (as you saye) be in
it. Now, if the sacrament were not reserued
vpon such a speciall case, how can
you saye, that the reseruation was extraordinarye?
And if the reseruation were
ordinary, (as vndoubtedlye it was,) make
the case then of the Deacons receyuing
as extraordinary as you will, and it letteth
our purpose nothing. For we consider,
not the acte of the Deacons in any other
sense or meanyng, then as it proueth reseruation.
And here you shall note further,
that the sacrament was reserued not
onlye for such which laye in their death
beddes, and were not recōcyled vnto the
churche,Fol. 73. (as you said in the chapiter before)
but also that it serued the vncorrupted
and faythfull Christians, whiles thei
were yet in good health, except you can
thinke that the Deacons, whom the Nycene
Councell permitteth to take furth

the sacrament, and eate it, were either excōmunicated
persons, either such as could
not go abrode for weakenes. Now, as cō
                  cerning
the receiuing vnder one kynd, as
it might be shewed out of this place, if
we would dally, as you do vse, and as concerning
your great inuectyue against vs,
(as though any of vs did make a tryfle of
Christ his institution, and not rather reproue
your interpretations, which make
that to be Christes which is not his,) as
also cōcerning S. Cyprian,Cypria. ad Cecil. ep. whom you full
madly alleage for your purpose, which all
togeather in that his epistle, proueth that
wyne and water shold be mingled togeather
in our sacrifice, I will not speak at
this present, because the first is not maynteyned
of vs, the secōde is not to be regarded,
and the third had ben spokē of before.
But as cōcerning reseruation, which we
say, and say againe, to be most manifestly
proued by the testimonye of the Nycene
coūcell, therein we haue you so fast bound
that all accustomed shiftes do fayll you: &
you w
                     •
                  ll not say (I trust) either that councell
to be of smal reputatiō, although the

Bishop of Romes legates were cheif men
there, either the case of reseruation to haue
ben extraordinary, or that the church
was dryuen vnto it by playne necessitie
for their syckmens sake, which laye at the
point of death, and were excommunicated
from other Christians.
            
            
               The eleuenth Chapiter.
               
                  SAint Cyprian in his fyfth sermon
de lapsis, declareth, how
an infant, which had receyued
before of bread and wyne
offred vpp to Idolles, had afterwardes
emong Christians the bloud of Christ
powred into her mouth by the Deacon
of the church. And straitwaies yexing
and vomiting foloweth, because that the
sacrament could not abyde in a body and
mouth defyled. Of this historye it is gathered,
that the babe receyued the sacrament
in forme of wyne only. For if the
body had ben receyued before, it would
no more haue taryed in a polluted mouth
then the bloud did, but she was wonderfully
vexed, or sore vexed, (for both these

phrases are vsed of the Catholike in his
Apology) not before the bloud was powred
into her mouth, but immediatlye after,
therefore it is very euident, that she
receyued onlye in forme of wyne. Naye
(saye you) the first trouble which the childe
had, was euen in the 
                        •
                     yme of prayer, before
the sacrament was distributed. It was so in
deede. For the child cryed out, and turned
her selfe hyther and thyther for anguyshe
of mynde and inwarde torment.
But who suspected anye harme thereof?
or who did collect thereby, that the childe
was defyled within, by reason of wyne
soppes, which were geauen to her, of the
offeringes to Idolls? But the sore and
greauous vexing of her, the yexing and
casting vpp of that which she had receyued,
appeared first when the bloud of
Christ was powred into her mouth. And
note the cause wherfore it appeared then
first, that the childe had ben before polluted.
Mary (sayeth Saint Cyprian) the
drinke which was sanctifyed in the bloud of
our Lorde, did burst vpp out of the polluted
bowelles. So great is the power of God,

so great is his maiestie. Yf therfore, the
presence, and maiestie of God, when it
came into the babe, dyd straytwaies reueale
that, which before was vnknowen,
his power and presence being no lesse vnder
the forme of bread, then it is of wyne,
out of all doubt the fact of the child
had ben bewrayed, before she had com to
the receyuing of wyne, if it had receyued
the sacramēt first of all in forme of bread.
Because the power and maiestie of God,The storie of the childe in S. Cyprian. Ser. 5. de lapsis, confirmed to make for receiuing vnder one kynd.
which is fully and perfectly vnder the forme
of bread, would not haue stayed in the
defyled mouth or bodye, but straytwayes
haue worked to the example of others.
And therfor, the argument of the Catholike
cōtinueth in all his strength and force,
allthough the child were vexed before
it receyued of the chalice. For it was not
vexed at the tyme of prayer, so sore that it
cast vpp anything, and the fault was not
espyed before the bloud was powred into
her, and then it was first of al opened, because
of the presence and maiesty of God,
whose presence being as certayne vnder
one kynde, as vnder the other, the sacrament

of the bodye would no more haue
taryed within her, then the sacrament of
the bloud, if the childe had receyued the
body before the bloud. well then, say you,
If it were so,Defence fol. 82. it ys not most euident, that yt
was either because the child was so yong that
it could not, or so trobled, that yt would not
take the sacrament of the bodye?
As concerning the formost of these causes,Reply.
it is very credible. for that it seemeth
by S. Cyprian, that it was a sucking childe
lefte vpon the handes of the nurse the
parentes being fled awaye. But the second
is very vnlyke, for as the resistence
on the childes part did not let the Deacon,
but that he powred the bloud into
her mouth, so although she would not
haue takē the sacrament of the body, yet
she might as well haue ben enforced therevnto,
as to receyue of the chalice. And
allso, if that opinyon which you holde
now, had then ben in the church, that it
is against Christ his institution, to receiue
vnder one kynde, they would neuer
haue profered the chalice vnto any such
as would not haue receyued first and for

most the bodye, as you are wont to recite
a fragment out of Gelasius, which you
vnderstand not, that the diuision of one
and the selfe same misterie, can not be
done without great sacrilege. But lett
both your reasons stande, is it not proued
then sufficiently, that to receyue in
both kindes is not of the necessitie of
Christ his institution? And where then
is your witt, to graunt us that, by which
our purpose is brought to passe? For allthough
you think, that you shall take no
foyle, to graunt that in necessitie one
kynde might be vsed, and that necessitie
which hath no law, maye cause a commaundemēt
of God to be omitted, and
allthough you maye be so easily entreated
to permit receiuyng in one kynde,
that because the childe, of whom we haue
spoken, would not or could not receiue
the sacramēt of Christ his bodye, you
think it to be a case of necessity, in which
the institution and law of Christ should
or might be omitted: yet if you cōsider,
that your selfe do take the receiuing vnder
both kyndes to be of the substance

of Christ his institution, and not of the
circumstance, and to be, not an ornamēt
only but an expresse commaundement,
certainly when you graunt vs, that in any
kinde of case, it maye be allowed to receyue
the Sacrament vnder one forme,
either of bread or wyne, you be straitwaies
conuicted, that Christ his institution

For such cōmaundemētes of God, as are

Wherefore you, which make the receyuing
vnder both kyndes to be of the necessary

substance of Christ his institutiō,
doe vtterly destroye this your strainge
conclusion, in graunting that sometymes
one kinde may be lawfully vsed, and you
speake allso in laboring for communion
in both kindes,Vide Hosiū in confessione Cathol. pa. 87 directly against your father

both kindes to be in it selfe indifferēt,Lutherus in libro de formula Missae. and
such as he, at his owne pleasure, in some
cases would either vse or refuse. Whereby
it maye well be gathered, how lytle ye
passe, either what ye affirme, either what

in Luthers bookes, maye right
well iudge, that it is not so, as we reporte
of hym.

                  FRō this place furth, although
the Catholike doth frame the
cōclusion of his treatyse, vnto
which when any one cometh,
he seemeth to be at the ende of his
labor, yet by reason of this conclusion,
such principal matters are moued, that if

they should be answered throughlye, we
had neede to make a new begynnyng.
For we haue to reason about the contynuāce
of the church, the authority of the
Fathers, and the reall presence of Christ
in the sacrament, which are so necessarye
and cheif pointes to be considered, that
I must not speake nothing of them, and
yet I haue ben so long here before in trying
the master of the defence, that I must
not saye all that I can, but with conuenient
spede dyspatch these worthye questions.
               First then as it hath ben proued against
you, that the syxe hundred yeares, which
immedyatly folowed the a
                     •
                  cension of our
Sauiour, are not wholye with you, for all
your great crakes, so we may wonder not
a lytle, why you make exception against
these last nyne hundred yeares, by the
practyse of which you refuse to be tryed?
Is this (thinke you) a small and weeke argument
to confirme and staye our consciences
vpon, that for .ix. hundred yeares
space, you, our aduersaries, can not deny
vnto vs, but that all Bishops, Vniuersities,

Realmes, and states of Christendome,
haue quyetlie continued in one kynde of
true Apostolike fayth, vntyll within these
few dayes, that all the olde catholike religion
hath in some places ben abolyshed
by publike authoritie? If a rennegat and
dissolute fryar, be thought worthy of estimation,
because he hath at these dayes
manye folowers, are not the religious in
deede, which continued in great numbre
and with much praise in ther orders, much
more to be regarded? If this be the tyme
of grace and light, in which we may see
and lament, vowes broken, monasteryes
ouerturned, the landes of Christ and his
church alyenated, virginitie, fasting, praying,
and all rules of good and perfect lyfe
cōtemned▪ what tyme was that, in which
the contraries of all these, were highlie
commended and practysed?Cōtinuance of tyme, doth not a litle make for the doctrine of the catholi
                     
                        •••
                      church. The continuance
onlye, of a religion .900. yeares▪
without interruption, is a very probable
argument not lightlie to passe away from
it. But when it is considered, how many
learned and godlie men, how great Vniuersities,
how mighty Princes lyued within

the compasse of those yeares, and that
of them all no one of the good and learned,
did anye thing write or preache against
it, and none of the Princes either
would either could resist it, who but vnsensible,
may thinke that it should not be
of God? Although that heresies do very
shamefully encreace, and that there be so
many sectes and diuisions emong them,
that no one parte can euer be greate, although
the whole world were ouerturned
vnto heresie, yet at this day moe Catholikes
are in Christendome, then Lutherans,
Zuinglians, Osiandrians, Caluinyans,
Anabaptistes, and all the rest, of
the lyke making, togeather. For these
heresies are yet (God make them narrower)
but here and there dispersed, and
Germanye the mother of them, is for a
great part of it full Catholike. Yet as litle
place as the new ghospell hath, in comparison
of Christendome, see how much
he, whom you take for no small fole,the author of the Apology of the Englysh church f
                        •
                     
                     lio. 8. doth
crake and bragg of that lytle. Be ye sure
(sayth he) so many free cityes, so many kynges,
so many Princes, as at this daye haue

abandoned the sea of Rome, and adioyned
themselues to the Ghospell of Christ, are not
become madd. Loe Syr, if this felow might
so trulye haue reported, that all Kynges,
all Princes, all free cityes of Christendome
were of his religion, as he doth falselye
make an accompt of so many free cityes,
so many kynges, so many princes, &c.
how great an argument would you thinke
that he dyd make for your side? And
againe, if he had ben able to proue, that
for .ix. hundred yeares togeather, Kynges,
and Princes, and free cityes had contynued
in his fayth without open contradiction,
how madd would he haue said
all such to be as resist a religion confirmed
by such authoritie and contynuance?
But this is your practise, to denye all
thinges, which make presentlye against
you, and to allow the same againe, when
hereafter they maye serue for you,As the world chāgeth, so doe the conclusions of heretikes. and so
long as you be in danger of law, No man
must be violentlye constrayned to receyue the
religion which his conscience can not allow.
And when the Prince and power is with
you, then saye you, Hanging is to good for

hym, which wyll not beleiue as you doe.
And so, in the Apologye of your Englysh
church, the argument was 
                     •
                  ound, and
comfortable, that because many Kynges
had abandoned the sea of Rome, therefore
they might seeme not to be madd,
which did folow them: and now in this
your defence of the truth, (as you call it)
when we alleage contynuance, and authoritie
of .ix. hundred yeares, you saye,
that multitude maketh not to the purpose,
and you thinke your selfe not a lytle
wise in reprouing of our argument.
But how wise you proue your selfe therein,
it is worthwhile to consider. First,
you say, that the prescription of .xv. hundred
yeares, the consent of the most part
of Christendome, the holynes and learning
of so many fathers as haue ben these
.ix. hundred yeares, the age and slender
learning of those which stande against
you, (all which thinges we doe bring
for our defence,) These thinges (saye
you)
               Doe nothing at all, eyther feare vs,Defence. or moue
vs, to suspect that doctrine, which by Christs

authoritie, and wytnes of the Apostels, we
know to be true.
               Stode you by the Apostles at their elbowes,Reply.
when they wrote their ghospells
or epistles? or were you then present with
Christ, when he walked visibly vpon the
earth, and by signes and myracles proued
hym selfe to be the soune of God? Trulye,
because your eye was not present at
 the wryting or working of our redemption,Faith cū
                     meth by heering.
you must therefor resort vnto such
as maye instruct you of all thinges by the
eare. And because credit is not lightly to
be geauen, to an historie which is tolde
 vs of thinges passing reason,Authoritie persuadeth therfor they
ought to be of good authoritie, whose
wordes we should beleiue in the articles
of euerlasting saluation. But there can
be no greater, then the testimonye of all
 Christendome: and they be few, obscure,No greater authoritie, then the testimonie of the whole world.
and vnknowen, whom you would haue
to be our masters: therefore no reasonable
and wyse man will suspect the authoritie
of the world, and falsely persuade
hym selfe, that he beleiueth Christ or his
Apostles, when he hath contemned the

voyce of Christendome, which caused him
to beleiue in Christ, and credit his Apostles.
For how know you what doctryne
Christ or his Apostles haue taught in the
world? Yf you know it by the scriptures,
what perswadeth you these scriptures to
be true? For when any new scripture and
vnherd of vs before, is alleaged or cōmended
vnto vs by a few, without any reason which
is able to confirme it,
                  Aug. de vtilitate credendi cap. 14. 
                  we beleiue not first the
scripture, but them rather which browght it
forth vnto vs. Therefore, who told you
that these be true scriptures? If you name
Luther, and such as he was, you haue
done very rashly to beleiue incredible articles
at the report of an vpstart rennegate,
which confirmed his authoritie by
no myracle. But on the other syde, if Luther
and you both haue ben content to
receiue the scriptures of the Catholikes,
lest you should be accompted ouer frantyke
or scrupulous, in doubting whether
al Christendome were not deceiued therein,
by what reason then can you suspect
the contynuance, pietye, learnyng, and
multitude of Catholikes in the church of

God, and referr your selfe vnto Christ,
and his Apostles, with contempt of the
mysticall bodye of our Sauiour? whereas
you could not by reason, without myracle,
beleiue in Christ and trust the Apostles,
except the authoritie of the Catholike
church, which you see to contynew
in the world, dyd moue you? I wold not
beleiue the Ghospell, (sayeth holye S. Augustine)
except the authoritie of the Catholike
church dyd moue me thervnto.

the contynuance of .ix. hundred yeares,
is and should be so worthelye regarded,
that euē the authoritie of the church,
which now is, shold by her selfe perswade
you to beleiue her. But, (say you) our possession
which we bragg of, hath not ben
quyet. For in the .600. next after Christ,
our doctrines were neuer heard of (which
is a very fowle lye, as it hath ben allready
here before proued) and as cōcerning the
900. folowing, they dyd not take place so
sone as we would have wyshed thē. Let vs

This shall be no lye at all,Reply. if you can name
the persons. And because we will not
trouble you much, we shal requyer of you
but the name of one for your side against
vs, for euery one of the last .900. yeares, in
which Christendome generally hath gone
against you. If you dare, and if you can,
shew now your cunnyng and learnyng,An honest profer. so
shall the world easyly perceiue, what maner
of predecessors you haue had in your
religion, and what maner of credit you
geaue to holy & blessed men, or els what
a greate and open lye you haue made in
this matter. For to make this more plaine
in one short example: In S. Bernardes tyme
we reade of certaine, which named thē
selues Apostolicos, as if you should saie, folowers
of the Apostles, and some of their
opinions were these: That maryage was
vnlawfull,
                  
                     D. Ber. Ser. 66. sup. Can. Cant. 
                  except it were betweene virgin &
virgin: that all meates which come of engendring
are vncleane: that chyldren are not to
be baptised: that the dead are not to be prayed
for: and that there is no fyer of purgatory
after death, but that straytwayes the sowles
goe vpp to heauen or downe to hell.
               
               
                  
How say you then by these felowes? shall
they be in the numbre of them, whom
God styrred vpp againste our doctrines
for that age, in which S. Bernard was?
Yf you saye, they were of God, then doe
you condempne Saint Bernard, which of
purpose wrote againste them in his .66.
sermon vpon Cant. Canticorum, and you
must also then forbyd mariage, flesh meates,
and baptizing of children. Yf you say,
they were not of God, then let vs haue
your testimony, that they were vile heretikes,
and so shall you holde with praying
to Sainctes, praying for the dead, purgatorye.
&c. And further, tell vs what they
were in S. Bernardes tyme▪ (except they
were these) which God styrred vpp to reproue
our doctrynes? Now, if you will or
can tell what they were in euery one of
these last .900. yeares, whom God sent to
testifye his truth against the doctryne of
our knowen Catholike church, it will folow,
I am assured, that you shall name either
playne heretikes, or els condempne
most holye and learned men, whom now
you will not seeme, but to receyue with

much fauor and reuerēce. But now agayn
what an vnlyke tale is this, that for these
.900. yeares God hath from tyme to tyme
labored, and at no tyme preuayled,
and that he, being allmightie, hath styrred
vp the hartes of diuers in all ages to reproue
our doctryne, and yet that no man
knoweth their writinges, or the only names
of those iolye prophetes? when the
holy Ghost was not yet geauen, because
IESVS was not yet glorified, and in the
night and shadowes of the olde law, yet
the longest captiuitie that euer the people
of God had, was much lesse then .400.
yeares in Egypt, and when it pleased God
to sende them delyuerance, cōsider with
what diuine force and power, he made
Moyses and Aarō to ouerturne the might
of Pharao. But we,Exo. 13. which are in the tyme
of grace, and are cōducted, not by Moyses,
and a pyller of fyer, or a cloude, but
by IESVS CHRIST, and his holye and
cōfortable spirite: yet (say you) we haue
ben in miserable and blind captiuitie these.Io. 14. & 16.
900. yeares togeather, and the prophetes,
whom God hath sent vnto vs, haue

lefte no signe of their doinges.
The spirituall powers (you saye,Defence. but you lye)
haue disgraced such men and abolyshed theire
bookes, and memoryes as much as might
be, flatterers also haue corrupted auncient
fathers, and forged new workes, &c.
It were pytty to troble your weake head
with the prouing of all these thinges at
large,Replye. therefore we will aske no more of
you at this tyme,slaūderous lyes of the M. of the defence. but that you tell vs the
names onlye, of those spirituall powers,
corrupters, and flatterers, with the place
where we shall finde it declared, that
there were such, as you report some to
be. Not because I denye that flatterers
and forgers are to be found emong the
Christiās, but because you can neuer proue,
that by such meanes our doctrine hath
ben maintayned, against the wil of God,
and labors of his seruantes. As for the
donation of Constantyne, (although it
appertayne to no article of our fayth,
who so euer gaue it, so that the church
lawfully haue it,) yet we haue to saye
further therein against you, when you
haue declared how Sainct Syluester came

by the possession of Rome with manye
Seignioryes belonging vnto it, or
what Constantyn the Emperor did with
the olde and auncient Rome, when he
buylded his palace at Byzant, and called
it Constantinople and new Rome? Then
for your recityng of places out of the
Decrees, such as are not found in the
Doctors vpon whom they are fathered,
except any place in all the Decrees, conteine
an vntrue and vngodly doctrine, it
is no matter of my faith, (I assure you,)
if the author be mistaken, and if the scribe
or the printer doe fayll in his memorie
or attention. And last of all, where you
saye, that the east church hath not allowed
our errors, I will make no other replie against
that your saying at this tyme, but
desyer you to consider quyetly, how well
they are rewarded for their labor. For
whilest thei, contentiously and wyckedly
endeuored to make them selues and their
Archebishopp as high as the Bishop and
churche of Rome,Pride will haue a fall. and to departe from
the vnitie thereof, they were brought
in to myserable and pytefull bondage,

and affecting the first place, whilest they
florished in the seconde, they are long agoe
fallen in to the lowest and worst of
all. And if you thinke it more sure, to beleiue
the Greeke then the Latyne church,
tell vs, I praye you, what you beleiue of
the holye ghost? And so, whereas the donation
of Constantyne, and quotations
of the decrees do make nothing for you,
so should the example of Grece geaue an
occasion to amende you. When you cō
                  sider
that the whole West church within
it selfe hath continued so many hundred
yeares in one state of doctrine, and that
her syster and fellow the East church in coueting
to be maestres, hath lost her perfect
libertie, of body, by reason of the Turkes,
of sowle, because of schisme and the
diuell. But, as you be alwaies good vnto
vs, when it is not worth thankes, (as you
do geaue it) so you suffre vs to take that,
as it were a gyft of your handes, which for
verie truth and euidencie of the matter,
we doe wring cleane out of your fingers
whether you will or no. And you saie:
But be it so,Defence fol. 87. that the most parte of Christendome

.ix. hundred yeares, hath taught as you
doe, is that a sufficient argument, to reiect a
doctrine euident by the worde of God?
Syr, if a doctrine be euident by the worde
of God,Reply. there is no cause lefte to reiect
it, but in this case, when one shall say, here
is Christ in Geneua, an other saie, here is
Christ in Wyttenberge, an other saie, behold
he is

                   the wooddes of Bohemye,
euery faction pulling the symple vnto it,
here loe, to trye such voyces whether they
come of God or no, the sure waye is, to
harken vnto the practyse and doctrine of
the most part of Christendome, as it hath
ben for hundreds of yeares togeather.
And continuance of tyme in one doctrine
with multitude of folowers, doth make
a very good persuasion to reiecte the
vpstart and vnaccompanyed religion.
Naye, (say you) if continuance of tyme,
and multitude of persons, might be rulers
to gouerne mens consciences, then
would that argument serue
For the Israëlites against the Iewes,Defence fo. 89. for the
priestes against the prophetes, for the Iewes
& Gentiles against Christ & his Apostles, for
the Turkes against vs Christians at this day.
               
               
                  
See,Reply. loe, how you be deceyued? For I
would saye, first, not that a multitude of
Turkes are better then a few Christians,
or that a long cōtynued Idolatrie, is better
then a new religion,In what sense, the multitude of folowers and the continuance of a religion, are to be considered. but in cōferring
Turke with Turke, Iew with Iew, Christian
with Christian, and so furth, I saye,
if the Mahometes law were good, and
that schismes and diuisions should aryse
emong the professors of it, that then, the
surest waye should be, so to vnderstand
and receiue that law, as it hath ben taken
of longest tyme before, and of the most
parte of all Turkes. And in lyke maner,
when so euer emong vs which professe
one Christ, diuisions and taking of partes
doe trouble mens consciences, the
best waye is, by all good reason, to folow
that syde which hath longest continued,
and which hath most voyces for it. And
so, it a Turke or panyme, would alleage
continuance of tyme to proue thereby
his religiō to be good, the next and wysest
waye to aunswer hym, is not to call
him vnreasonable and folysh for the bringing
of that argument, (for vndoubtedly

vnto our naturall and common reason it
is no tryfeling persuasion to see contynuance
and multitude of folowers to be
with vs,) but the right waye of cōuerting
or confounding them in that argument,
is, either to shew that naturall reason is 
against them, (as it was in their worshipping
of stockes and stones,) either by
myracle to persuade them, (as the Apostles 
in their dayes haue done, or as good
and religious persons doe in this our tyme
emong the Indians,) or else to shew,
that it is no wonder, if the religion of
which thei be, hath allreadie long contynued,
and shall from hense forward encreace
daylie, because it geaueth libertie
vnto the flesh, and vnto all bodely pleasures.
But the continuance and multitude
of folowers which commend the doctrine
of the church are so notable and
myraculouse, that except the finger of
God were here, it is vnpossible it should
be regarded. For prescript fastinges, watchinges,
prayers, preferring of virginitie
before wedlock, submitting of our owne
willes vnto the cōmaundemēt of others,

confessing of our secrete faultes, quiet suffring
of harde penance, these are verye
much against the nature and appetyte of
our flesh: on the other syde, that which
the church teacheth,the miracle of the contynuing of the Catholike fayth. of sainctes, of sowles
departed, of seuen sacramentes, and especiallye
of that one, in whiche allmightie
God is receyued, all this is so farr beyonde
the capacitie of carnall reason, that except
fayth be infunded, it is neuer rightly
beleiued. Yet this religion so repugnant
vnto naturall appetyte, so much surmounting
all reason, hath ben embraced of the
poore and ryche, the symple and the learned,
the stout and the tender, the beggers
and the Cesars, and in spite of the dyuell,
the world, the flesh, and heretikes, hath
contynued these .xv. hundred yeares, as
we beleiue, and as you be sorye for it, these
nyne hundred yeares togeather. It is no
wonder, if a Turkyshe religion be much
made of and cherisshed, for they are permitted
to haue here carnall pleasures, &
for the worlde to come, they are promysed
to haue their full of them. Againe, I
doe not maruayll, if many follow Luther

the Father, or anye of his euyll fauored
broode and children, for the flesshe doth
well allow it, to eate what it will at all tymes,
to be free from earely rysing, to haue
short seruice in the churche, to haue
matrymonye no sacrament, to be bounde
to no ceremonye, and to be subiect vnto
none other authoritie, then the expresse
scripture. But, that the Catholike religion,
which is so exacte, so deuout, and
so graue, that it maketh the carnall men
to wyssh that it were out of the worlde,
should haue cōtynuall folowers of it, and
before so long tyme preserued, it is not
for flessh and bloud to bring it to passe,
but it is the verye worke of God, whom
nothing can resyst and withstande. Consider
also their lyues and maners, which
haue ben emong other, the maynteyners
of it. And because none are more odious
vnto the world, then prelates, monkes,
and fryars, I wysh that some of them were
rightly considered. For if you can beleiue
historyes and monumētes, what fault do
you fynde in S. Francys, and S. Dominike,
if you will reade their bookes, what

can you saye against S. Bernard, S. Bonauenture,
S. Thomas of Aquyne, Rupertus,
Anselmus, Dionysius the Carthusian,
with a numbre of such holy and reuerende
fathers? whose writinges sufficiently
declare, how much they remembred
Christ, how diligently they did reade
the scriptures, how freely they reproued
faultes, and lamented the euill lyfe
of Christians, how much they were acquaynted
with the sweete spirite of God,
and practysed in fightyng for the sowle
against the dyuell. The doctrine therfor
of our church, hath not only contynued
meruaylouslye, but contynued in many,
and in those many no few haue ben excellent,
and in such sort excellent, that,
if not before, it might our religion haue
ben now alowed, because such godly and
graue heades did vse it. Whereas on your
syde, if your inuentions were tollerable,
yet those Apostles of yours, whō in these
latter dayes (you say) God hath styrred
to reproue our vice and irreligion, and to
reuyue his truth and testament, haue ben
so vyle themselues, that vndoubtedly God

dyd neuer sende them, and a reasonable
man should neuer folow them. What an
Apostle was Luther? who gaue hym leaue
to break his vow, which those holye
men, whom euen now I named, did keepe
vnto death? who moued hym to lye
with a noune? If he lyued chaste, being
yet within his ordre, what spirite (trow
you) was that, which could not afterwardes
keepe hym chaste, when he was selected
to preache a Ghospell? Then,Luther. if
he lyued abominably when he was kept
in Cloyster, was he a meete instrument
for God, to worke the redemption of his
church so long deceaued? And if God
had forgeauē his former great offences,
that he should be more humble in preaching
of grace and mercie, would he so
sone haue forsakē hym, that in the heate
of his preachementes, he could not but
take a noune to his bedfellow? And as
he was in his doinges, so is he in his writinges,
so shameles, so fylthy, so vncleane,
so slaunderous, so mutable, so presumptious,
and so desperate, that it is wonder
that he is accompted for a man, & much

lesse, for a man of God. I speake these
thinges, to declare, what difference ther
is betweene our holy Abbates, and your
rennegate fryars, the folowers of our religion,
and the founders of yours, to enforce
you hereby, to shew what you thinke
of S. Bernard, S. Bonauenture, S. Denyse,
and others, and to signifye hereby
vnto you, that as we staye vpon contynuance
and numbre, so yet we reioyce at
the vertues and graces, which haue and
do appeare playnly in many of this numbre.
wherefore, it is not without cause,
that we are confirmed in our fayth and
doctryne, because of such a contynuance
of it. Note, that I saye, such a contynuanbe.
For Turkes, Sarracenes, and Panymes
may alleage contynuance, but such a contynuance,
in which the doctrine taught,
is greauous vnto the carnall man, and yet
receyued, and the greatest professors of
it, are hated of all heretikes, and yet for
conscience and wordlye shame are not
cōdemned: such a one (I say) is much to
be regarded, and such a one is not found,
but onlye emong the Catholikes. whose

waies in doctrine, if they be not open &
secure, especially so great cumpany for so
long tyme going in them with prosperous
faring to their iourneyes end, then
will I neuer trust any waye, but be, as the
cumpany is, indifferent to go with euery
one, vntyll I am wery. But thankes be to
God, he hath better prouyded for vs, appointing
his catholike churche to be the
pyller and staye of true religion.1. Timo. 3. Which,
although it is quyckly to be founde out,
because it is in deede Catholike, yet you
thinke it necessarye to examyne what is
the church, and how it maye be knowen.
Goe to then, we will follow you to the
end of your defence, in euery conclusion
which you make against vs.

                     The Scripture (saye you) speaketh of the
church two waies,Defence fol. 90. &. 91. sometyme as it is in deede
before God, & not knowen allwaie to mans
iudgement. &c.
                     Sometyme the church is taken for the vniuersall
multitude of all those, which beyng
dispersed through the world, acknowledge
one Christ. &c.
                     Sometyme the church is taken for the multitude
of those that beare rule in the church.
                  
                  
You performe more then you promysed.Reply.
We looked but for two wayes, and you
haue declared three, in which the scripture
speaketh of the church, by which it
appeareth, that you haue pretye knowledge,
but you keepe lytle good ordre in
setting furth your diuisions. Yet goe to,
as concerning the first sense, which you
make of the church, what make you of
her? Can it err, or no? No (say you) this
church is the pyller of truth, that neuer continueth
in error. This church is neuer forsaken
of the spirite of God. In to this church
none be receyued but onlye the children of
grace and adoption. How might a man
then (I praye you) know this church?
Verely neither you, neither any other can
tell.Of the churche as it cōsis
                        •
                     eth of the chosen whom God only knoweth, litle profit is to be goten. For whereas it consisteth of such, as
be the elect and chosen, who can saye either
of hymselfe, that he is one of them,
or how can one say that of an other, whose
hart he seeth not, which he can not vnderstand
of his owne case, which is best
knowen vnto hymselfe? Therfore as cō
                  cerning
the profyt and cōmoditye which
they that would, might take of this churche,

which is the pyller of truth, we can
receyue very lytle of it, because she is inuisible
vnto man, and knowen onlye before
God. And if you dare saye, that this
churche may also be knowen vnto man,
I would you had showen one token or other
of her, that we might be sure where
to fynde the pyller of truthe.
               Now as concerning the church, which
is dispersed through the worlde, and acknowledgeth
one Christ, and is Through
baptisme admitted thervnto, and by the vse
of the Lordes supper, openlye professeth the
vnitie therof in doctryne and charitie: Is
this church (trow you) the pyller of truthe,
or what other opinion shall we haue
of her?
This church, (saye you) is resembled vnto
a nett,Defence fol. 91. which hath good and bad in it, it is
resembled vnto a field which hath pure corne
and cockle also in it.
               
               You saye herein trulye, and you agree
now very wel with the catholike church,Reply.
which teacheth vs, that in this world,
the good and euyll Christians are mengled
togeather. You make also much, against

certayne heretikes, which stand in
it stoutly, that onely the elect are of the
howsehold and familye of God, which
yet (as you haue clerkely defined it,) can
not be so, because the good and the badd
which acknowledge one Christ, and receyue
the sacramētes, are the true church
of Christ. Graunting therefor vnto you,
that the church hath good men and euill
in her, I aske now the cause of you, wherfore
you labor to proue that this church
maye goe out of the waye for some part
of her? you tell vs of Noe, of the .x. trybes
of Israell, of the Prophetes, of the
captiuitie of Babilon, and other such historyes.
But to what end and purpose?
yf you wil proue thereby, that thei which
beare the name of the people of God
haue often tymes forsaken his law, and
destroyed his Prophetes, you haue spoken
that, for proufe wherof I wold neuer
haue gone to the flood of Noe, hauing
so many examples at home, to make
this conclusion manifest. For all they
which be Christened, doe beare the name
of the people of God, and the promyses

are made only vnto them, yet this
world maye declare how many coniurars,
dissemblers, wycked lyuers, faithlesse
ministers, lecherous friars and desperate
peruerters of all law and honestie, doe
lyue in the churche. But if you would
proue, that, because a great numbre was
deceyued, therefore the whole churche
was subuerted, you speake alltogeather
without booke. For, (to consider one
example for all,) in the tyme of Elias the
Prophet, when he, good man, thought,
that all had forsaken God besydes hym
selfe, yet said God vnto hym, I haue lefte
my selfe seuen thousand in Israell,3. Reg. 19. which
haue not bowed their knees before Baal.
And before that, it is playne by the booke
of kynges, that Abdyas the stewarde of
kyng Achab his house,3. Reg. 18. dyd hyde a hundred
Prophetes of God from the sight
of Iezabell the quene, and fedd thē with
bread and water. Therefore, as it can not
be denyed, but that they which haue borne
the name of the people of God, haue
not allwayes and wholy folowed hym, so
yet it can neuer be proued, that the visible

church of God hath ben in all her partes
subuerted. And yet in the old law, the
church was not then so richely endowed
as it was afterward in the commyng of
Christ and his holie ghost, neither were
those wordes spokē then, which haue ben
spoken sence and now presently doe take
place, our Sauior faythfully promysing
vnto Sainct Peter,Matth. 16. that Thow art Peter
(which is to saye) a rock, and vpon this
rock I will buyld my church, and the gates
of hell shall not preuayll against it. So that
if nothing might be said to the contrary,
but that in the olde law the church of
God was not to be founde, (which is vnpossible
to be proued,Psal. 2.) yet in this tyme
of grace, when all nations of the world
are in the heritage of Christ, as only the
Israelites then were:Io. 1. and when for figures
we haue truthes: for Moyses the seruant
and his chayer,Hebr. 3. Iesus the soune of
God and his lieutenant: for the inspirations
which came at sondry tymes vpon
the Prophetes, a continuall presence of
the maiestie of the holie ghost:Io. 14. for promyses
vnder cōdition to tarye with them

if they would folow his cōmaundementes,
most absolute performāce of the spirite
of truth to be with vs vntyl the worldes
end: in this tyme of grace so gloriouse,
so much made of, so deere and welbe
loued, so defenced, so priuileaged, to make
so harde and pynching rekoning, that
the light of the world should be couered
vnder some busshell, and that cytie be vnperceauable,
which Christ him selfe planted
vpon the topp of a hyll,Math. 5. it is an ignominious
and Iewysh, and cruell dysgracing
of the church of Christ. But because
we maye have a better tyme and leysure,
to speake against you in this matter, if
this visible church, which hath contynued
so long in one maner of doctrine
and sacramentes, be not the true church
of God, because the visible church of the 
Iewes had not allwayes the truthe of doctryne,
And if it must follow, because the 
kynges of Iuda were some tymes Idolators,
that the clergie of those tymes agreed
vnto them,Vnreasonable consequencies and if some did so in
deede, that all therefore without exception
did it, or if, because the Prophetes

                   reproued the maners of the high Priestes,
therefore they condemned theyr doctryne
 and religyon, or if Christ, because he
was cōdemned of the high Priestes, sayed
not vnto the people concerning the doctors
of Moyses law: Doe that which they
saye vnto you,
                  Matth. 23. 
                  but doe not after theyr doinges.
And, (to be short) if all these unreasonable
consequēcies (which would please
you very well) should be graunted vnto
you, tell vs then, for conscience sake,
what church we shall follow? If the churche
of Rome, which hath ben and is so
well receyued, hath ben and may be vntrulye
perswaded, maye not that church,
which you perchanse, shall point out vnto
vs with your lytle fynger, be also with
good lykelyhood very fowlie deceyued?
And maye not one thirde person, commend
vnto vs an other church, which agreeth
with none of our two, and yet is
nothing the better? In this doubt, which
doth so necessarilye aryse, what is your
ghostly counsell vnto such as are fearefull
of conscience?
The right church therfore,Defence fol. 98. as the fold of

Christ, hath the true worde of God and vse
of his sacramentes, according vnto the same,
for the due markes therof.
After this maner, you shall haue some tymes
the symple idiotes of the countrey
to make answer vnto straingers asking
the right waye vnto this or that place,Reply.
which they would come vnto. For, (saye
they) you must goe by my grandsyres
close, and then keepe the straytwaye, and
you shall neuer mysse. Or else, lyke as a
man would sende his seruant to London
for a cupp of pure and cleane wyne,vncertaine markes to know the church by, alleaged by the M. of the defence and
tell hym that he shall be sure to haue it
there, where he seeth an Iuye garland to
hang at the dore, or the drawer of the
wyne to vse no deceptfull bruyng of it,
(wheras the Iuye garland is no certayne
tokē of good wine ready to be solde, and
euery tapster will easily saie for his owne
truth and honestye,) so you haue tolde
vs such markes to know the true church
by, that as the true church hath them in
deede, so yet euery mysbegotten congregatiō,
will chalendge them vnto herselfe.
Except you thinke, that Luther and Zuinglius,

with all their forked tayles of heresies,
doe not eche of them stande in yt,
that they haue the true worde of God,
and right vse of the sacramētes on eche
of their sydes, which yet are contrary the
one to the other. I had thought, you
would haue tolde of one such marke and
signe to come by the knowledge of the
true church, that in all the controuersies
of opinions, and all the euill conditions
of lyuing, we might haue ben directed
vnto one certayne and approued staye
of our consciences, and you, (to declare
your wysedome and vnderstanding) haue
named two such markes, as euery kynde
of religion will boldely chalendge vnto
her selfe. First, the true worde of God (saye
you) is one true marke of the church.
               
               what meane you then, by the worde of
God? for if you meane the volume of the
olde and new testament, and that wheresoeuer
we fynde the byble in any persons
handes, that we must thereby straitwayes
take this for a certayne tokē, that
he which hath the byble in his hande is
one of the right churche, so shal you haue

not only your selfe, but Arrians, Anabaptistes,
and all the rabell of myscreantes,
to be of the true churche, by good lykelyhod.
On the otherside, if you meane by
the worde of God, the two testamentes,
not as they are to be solde at bookebynders
shopps, but as they are expounded
of sincere and true preachers, what tokē
thē shall we haue of you, to know readily
who is a true preacher? And as I haue
said of this first marke which you geaue,
so maye I saye againe of your seconde,
which is, the right vse of the sacramētes.
Which as I will graunt vnto you, to be
rightlye practized onlye within the true
churche, so yet you haue to shewe vs further,
how I maye know such as doe minister
them accordinglye. You would
proue by S. Augustine, S. Cyprian, Saint
Chrisostome, and Origine, that the scripture
is the true tryall of the churche.
Yea Syr, in one sense that is true in deed,
as also that the church maketh the tryall
and declaration of the true scripture.
But, that euer any good and reasonable
man had this meanyng, that who so euer

would, might take the scriptures into his
handes, and sytt iudge ouer the church,
I denye it vtterly, and I am sure, you can
neuer proue it. For as the scripture declareth
which is the true church, so doeth
the churche shewe the authoritie of the
scripture, and the scripture and the churche,
are the better, the one for the other
of them. Do you thinke to make vs aferde
by the appealing vnto scripture? or
doe you labor to moue a suspition, that
you only haue the Ghospell for you? Verely
we are content to be tryed, not only
by the scriptures, but euen by those holy
fathers, which you depraue in this place
towardes your purpose. The cōtrouersie
now, betwene vs and you, is the same,Marke this place.
which was betwene S. Augustine and the
Donatistes. We seeke for the church, and
the place where she resteth. You say, that
it hath ben vnknowen, defaced, obscured,
and coarcted, you saye that it is now in
England, and before these last .lx. yeares,
you knew not where she was to be founde.
On the other syde, we beleiue that it
hath ben and shall be continually visible,

tholike, vpon the topp of the hill, not in
gardens or chambers, not in corners of
countreyes, but in the open sight of the
worlde. And here now at this point we
shal haue no other thing, but our yea and
our nay. Yes (saye you) lett the matter be
tryed by scripture. So lett it be, and because
you are so trymlye seene in them,
that you will make vs altogeather ignorant,
shewe vs your scriptures to proue
your pretie, narrow, and shamefast churche.
Yf you can shewe none, reade, for
the truthes sake, those places which we
shall name vnto you.Gen. 26. 
                  In thy seede all nations
shall be blessed. Aske of me, and I wyll
geaue the for thy heritage the Gentyles.

which was cutt out of the hyll without handes,
                  Psal. 71. 
                  fylled the whole worlde.
                  Da. 2. 
                  So it hath ben
wrytten, and so it behoued Christ to suffre,

                        •
                      4.
                  and repentance and remission of synnes to be
preached in his name, through all nations.
You shall be my wytnesses in Iury and Samaria,
                  Act. 1. 
                  and vnto the endes of the earthe.
                  
But what of all this? Marye Syr, that you
shold reade in these scriptures, how playnly
it was promysed, that the whole world
should be Christ his inheritage, and that
his churche should be sought for, not in
pelting corners of Africa, of Europa, or
Asia, not in wyttenberge, Geneua, or England,
but in all nations and in all countreyes
of the world. And if you myslyke
this our cōclusion gathered out of these
places of scripture, consider then, better
then you haue done, S. Augustins reasoning
against Petilian, and against all other
Donatistes, when so euer he wrote
against them, as in his. 162. 166. 170. 171.
and other of his epistles. In all which places,
he proueth, that it is vnpossible, that
Donate, which was an vpstart heretike
in Africa, should haue the truth on his
syde, because the scriptures do so playnlye
promyse vs, that the church of Christ
should be enlarged ouer the whole worlde,
and because it was so sensibly performed,
that euery one might see that churche,
which was extended through all nations.
Now, if you haue any scriptures, or

authorityes, or reasons, to proue that the
church should not be openly knowen for
900. yeares togeather, or that about the
yeare of our Lorde God .1500. the light
of the Ghospell should begynne to appeare,
or that the churche may be in one
countrey only, or that Christ shold leese
his inheritage, which was promysed hym
ouer the world, or that all the dryfte of
S. Augustyns reasoning against the Donatistes,
doth not expresly make against
you, then shall you speake somewhat
worth the answering. Against which tyme
prouyde also to tell vs, how S. Cyprian
(whom you alleage,S. Cyprian alleaged agaynst the M. of the defence hymselfe. to proue that
recourse should be had to the scriptures)
doth make any thing for you? Yea rather
he maketh cleane against you, and if
you had taken but small leysure to consider
hym, he teacheth you, that to come
vnto the truth, and to be sure of it, there
is an other and better waye then you haue
yet inuented. For after those wordes,
Hereof aryse schysmes,
                  Cyp. tract. 3. de simpl. praelat. 
                  because we seeke
not to the head, nor haue recourse vnto the
spring, nor keepe the cōmaundementes of the

heauenly master. After which wordes, you
make a full point, as though you had tolde
all his meanyng) he saieth further that
to proue this, there is no neede of long
talke or reasonyng. Our Lorde spake vnto
Peter, and sayed: I tell the, thow art. Peter,
                  Math. 16.
                  and vpon this rock I wyll buyld my church,
and the gates of hell shall not overcome it.
&c. And allthough he gaue lyke authoritie
vnto all his Apostles after his resurrection,
and said:
                  Io. 20, 
                  Euen as my father sent me, I also
sent you, receyue you the holyghost, yf you
remyt any man his synnes, they are forgeauen
hym, yf you reteyne them, they are reteyned,
yet that he might make playne, and
set furth an vnitie, he disposed by his owne
authoritie the head and spring of that vnitie
which beginneth of one. And a lytle after
he sayeth: Doeth he beleiue, that he holdeth
and keepeth his fayth, which keepth not this
vnitie of the church? How then could you
bring in S. Cyprian in the commendatyon
of anye of your two markes of the
church, which so expressely warneth you
to consider the vnitie thereof, and the authoritie
which was geauen vnto S. Peter,

in which vnitie who so euer is not found
hath lost all true fayth, crake he neuer so
much of his sacramentes and scriptures?
But now, because it is not inough, to declare
that your markes of the church are
vncertayne and controuersious, except
we geaue some better signes, which may
leade all men vnto the true church, therfore
it is to considered, what we professe
openlye in one of the articles of our
Crede. I beleiue (sayeth euery Christian)The true & certaine markes of the church
                  one, holye, Catholike, and Apostolike church:
and if he knoweth also what he speaketh,
then shall he neuer be to seeking of the
churche. For she must be fyrst of all, One 
church, that is to saye, she must haue one
profession of fayth, one ordre in sacramentes,
and one head for her gouernement:
by which one worde, thei be quicklye
tryed for no good Christians, which
can neuer agree vpon their fayth, or haue
no certayne head or gouernour. Secondlye,
the church is holye, in this sense,
either because none are holye which are
out of this church, either because she hath
ben bought with bloud, (a deare price,)

either because she is stable and inuiolable.
Which note doth warne vs to beware
of them which haue no contynuance
in their religion, but are quyckely altered
at euery new preachers inuention.
 Thirdly, the church must be Catholike,
                  Catholike.
which is to say, she must goe through the
whole world, not only in respect of place,
but also of persons and tyme, wherevpon
it foloweth, that all such religion
as lurketh only in particular countreyes,
or which hath no antiquitie and contynuance
at all, is to be reiected as a singuler
naught, and no Catholike or good
religion. And last of all, the true church
 must be Apostolike,
                  Apostolike by which worde I
meane, that if they of England now, or
those of Geneua, can by degrees ascende,
and frō one minister vnto an other go vpwardes
in a cōtynual ordre, vntyll they do
come vnto one of the Apostles, whō they
will proue to haue ben a father to their
religion, that then, they haue one good
signe to commende their doinges. But,
because this is vnpossible to be doone of
them, therfore they are not of the church

Apostolike, and for good cause they are
to be dyscredited. Loe Syr, if you be of a
good conscience, contynew in the fayth
which you haue professed, and for two
symple markes, which euery man will set
vpon his religion, take these fower notes
which al christendome aloweth, of which
fower there is no heretike, which (worke
he neuer so craftely) shall euer be able to
proue that any one may serue for hym.
            
            
               The .xiiij. Chapiter.
               
                  IF you had acquaynted your
selfe with faythfull Abraham
and Isaac, and dyd beleiue
that God is able to performe
what so euer he promiseth, you would
make no question of the reall presence of
Christ in the Sacrament, and that cheif
principle being once confessed, you shold
neuer make great quarreling about certayne
consequencies which folow therevpon.
As, whether Christ his bodye be
vpon a thousand aultars at one tyme, or
whether accidentes be without substance,
and bodye without place, or whether

reseruation may be alowed, with diuers
other questions. This is the fault which
the Catholike in this last Chapiter fyndeth
with you, in auoyting of which, you
saie, first
               We graunt as freely as you, with Abraham
and Isaac,Defence. fol. 102. that God is able to perfourme
what so euer he doeth promyse.
               Yf you thinke as you speake,Replye. why are
these bodging and souterly argumentes
so ofte repeted emong you, that Christ
his naturall bodye is in heauen, ergo yt can
not be on the earth. Item, a natural body occupyeth
onlye one place, but the sacrament is
in many places.
                  B
                        •
                     dging reasons & such as argue a faint & doubtfull faithe. Againe, accidences can not
be without substance, ergo the substance of
bread is not chainged into the substance of
Christ his bodye. Are not these your argumentes,
most manyfest tokens, that you
speake against the possibilitie to haue
Christ his naturall bodye in the Sacrament?
For otherwise, you should not aske,
how it might be, after the Iewysh fasshyons,
but rather proue, that it is not so,
after the maner of wyse heretikes. Well
yet, thankes be to God, that you be not

so folysh as your fellowes, and that you
graunt, that yt ys possible inough vnto
God, to bring all that vnto passe which
the church teaceth vs, as concerning the
sacrament, but, saye you
               How can you shew,Defence fol. 130. that it was God his holy
wyll to haue so many myracles wrought, as
you without necessitie, doe make in the Sacrament?
               Mary Syr,Reply. we shew it by his owne wordes
(This is my bodye, This is my bloud)
vpon which one myracle, all the rest of
our beleif therein, doeth follow by necessitie
of consequence. You aske allso for
an example in some place of all the scriptures
lyke vnto this merueylous worke
which is beleiued to be in the sacramēt.
Wherein I answer you, with the same
wordes, as S. Augustine answered Volusianus,
                  Augustin. epist. 3. ad Volusianū
                  
as concerning the incarnation of
God, Yf you aske for a reason, the thing shal
not be wonderfull, and if you requyre an example,
the thing shall not be singular. Also,
the myracles which the scriptures speake
of, are not therefore beleiued, because
they haue other myracles of lyke sute

with them, but because God is allmightie,
and because all scripture is true. We
doe not apoint, (as though all were of
our one making,) but we belieue, that
Christ his very body is truly in the sacramēt,
and that it is there, not in maner of
proportion, quantitie, or figure, also that
it maye be in a thousand places at once,
and yet in neuer a one of them all locallye,
which is to saye, as in a place of his
owne. Oh, saye you,
Is not this to take awaye the nature of a
bodye from his bodye,Defence. fol. 104 and in deede to affirme
it to be no bodye?
               
               See loe where you be now. Do not these
wordes importe,Replye. that it can not be, that
a naturall body shold contynue naturall
and be in a thousand places at once? in
which your saying what other thing doe
you, but priuelye conclude that it is impossyble.
In which, least you should seeme
to denye the power of God, of which
you spake reuerentlye a lytle before, you
amend the matter, and saye:
Yet we say not,Defence. fol. eod. but that God is able to worke
that also, if it be his pleasure.
                  
Verely verelye you be vncertayne in all
your conclusions,Replye. for if you graunt that
God is able to do that,Note the doubtfullnes of mind and vnderstanding in the M. of the defence. which we reporte
of hym, that he worketh in our Sacrament,
why talke you of the nature of a
bodye and taking awaye of the nature
of it, if Christ be really in the Sacramēt.
And if it be vnpossible to haue a bodye
without quantitie, and in a thousand places
at once, (as it is to make that one
selfe same thing should be a bodye and
no body,) why saie you, that God is able
t
                     •
                   worke this also, if it be his pleasure?
you offende in both sydes, doubting at
one tyme of God his allmightmes, by
which we beleiue his naturall bodye to
be in the sacrament, and at an other tyme
making hym so allmighty, as though
he could bring to passe, that such thinges
might agree togeather, as are in them, selues
plaine contradictorie, the one to the
other. But as in this later point, you goe
beyond all truth and possibility, so in the
other, I trust you wil hereafter be more
stedefast, and neuer argue against the
power of God which is able to performe

all those articles, which the Catholikes
haue gathered, vpō the sacramēt. Which
now you begynn to doe at length, and
saye, that it is not God his will to doe, as
we beleiue he hath done in the sacramēt.
But how proue you this?
For neither is there any necessitie that shold
once trayne hym to doe yt,Defence fol. 104 nor doeth his
word teach vs that euer he did the lyke.
These be your owne reasons,Reply. as it is easylye
to be perceyued by the weight of
them. which if you will follow in other
pointes of our fayth, you maye conclude
all our Crede,Feble reasons. to deserue no credit at all.
For, neyther anye necessitie cōstrayned
God first to make, and afterward to redeeme
mankynde, and the most of all his
workes are of such a peculyar excellency,
that we maye thinke right well of eche
of them, that they are in theyr kynde singular.
what necessitie constrayned our
Sauior, to take our death vpon hym, and
what example haue you in all the scriptures,
lyke vnto the myracle of the
death of God? Ergo, (according vnto
your diuine logike,) it is only an inuention

of the papistes, that God hym selfe
did suffre a most paineful death for man.
It is wysedome for vs, rather to beleiue
the church, then to allow such argumentes
by which we maye destroye all true
religion. And yet not only the church
teacheth, but the scripture also wytnesseth,
that this which the Christians receyue
in the Sacrament, is the bodye of
Christ hym selfe, as he said most playnly,
This is my bodye which is geuen for you.
Now whether the verbe substātiue Sum,
es, fui,
                  Luc. 22. might be interpreted by transsubstantiare,
tell me fyrst, I praye you, whether
Sum, es, fui, maye be taken emong
the grammaryans Assumere naturam, non
personam? which sense of the verbe substantiue,
Sum, es, fui, after you haue
not founde in any dictionary of the best
making, how will it sounde in your eares,
to say, Deus est homo, God is man? The
worde was made flesh,Io. 1. sayeth the blessed
Apostle and Euangelist, by which we
confesse and beleiue, that God the worde
was not changed into flessh, or mingled
and confounded with it, or in any

part altered, but that he tooke vnto his
person, the verye nature of man, and vnited
it vnto his Godhed. Which sense if
you repyne against, because the propriety
of the tongue can not beare it, that (factū
est,) might be interpreted by, vnita est diuina
persona humanae naturae, the person of
God was vnited vnto the nature of man:
trulye then, as your learning perchanse
is such that you maye be suffred to reade
an open lesson in some grammer schole,
so without all doubt you are to be amended
for the vnright construyng of our
Christian rules. But, (saye you) we must
search the scriptures as Christ and his Apostles
taught vs, and as the holye Fathers dyd
vse against the Arrians, and other heretikes.
As who should saye, that (This is my
bodye which shal be delyuered for you) were
not scripture playne inough, or as though
the Arrians had not in sight, more places
of scripture then the Catholike Fathers,
or else as though the most holy men of
these fyftene hundred yeares, whom we
folow in the fayth of the sacrament, had
written whole and large treatyses of it,

and vsed no scripture at all. Well Syr, if
we lack scripture, you, perchaunse, doe
abounde in it, and therefore what is your
opinion of the sacrament?
               when we interprete Christ his wordes, we
saye,Defence fol. 106. it is a figuratiue speache, and such as
the Holyghoste often vseth in the institution
of sacramentes and ceremonyes.
               It is most true that figurative speaches
are often vsed in the scripture,Reply. as when
Christ said: I am the vyne. &c. but can you
therfor cōclude,Io. 15. that they are allwayes vsed?
and if, I am the vyne, be figuratyue,
is, This is my body, lyke vnto it? When the
high Priestes of the Iewes asked Christ,
whether he were the soune of God, he
aunswered,Mare. 14. 
                  I am, he sayed againe vnto his
dysciples,Io. 14. 
                  I am the waye, the truth, and lyfe,
and yet he was not a figuratyue lyfe, but
reall lyfe in deede. And although that
Christ speaking of S. Iohn the Baptyst,
and sayeing, Yf you wyll receyue hym, he
is Helyas,
                  Math. 11. meaned not yet that he was
Helyas in deed, but that he represented
Helyas for some pointes, neuertheles saying
of hym selfe,Io. 8. 
                  I am the beginnyng which

speake vnto you, he willeth vs to vnderstand,
not that he representeth onlye or
signifyeth the begynnyng which is God,
but that in very nature and substance,Of particular premisses to conclude generallie it ys no good fasshion. he
is the author of all thinges. Whereby you
maye or should rather perceyue, that this
argument which you gather out of particular
phrases in the scriptures, doth helpe
nothing your purpose, except you could
proue them to be generall. Now as concerning
these wordes of S. Luke and S.
Paule,Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 11. 
                  This is the new testamēt in my bloud,
by which you vnderstande, that the Sacrament
is a testimony or pledge of his last
will and gyfte: concerning also the numbre
of testimonyes which you bring out
of the auncient Doctors, to proue that
Christ gaue a memorye, token, signe, figure,
and similitude of his bodye. I will
not speake against them, because they be
true sayinges & Catholike. But whē wyll
you leaue to proue that which we denye
not, and shewe directly vnto the purpose
that Christ gaue no body at all, but a figure
only vnto vs? The catholike fayth
is this, that the externall signes and formes

of bread and wyne are figures of the
naturall body and bloud of Christ which
are vnder them, (for as bread is the most
naturall and necessarie foode, so we vnderstand
the flesh of the soune of God,
to be vnto the faythfull,) Also, that the
very naturall body of Christ in the sacrament,
is a figure of the glorye to come,
and representeth that vnitie which shall
be betweene him and his elect in heauen,
(for he which communicateth hym selfe
so freely and fully in earth vnto synners,the catholikes confesse signes & figures in the Sa
                     
                        •
                     ramēt but not onlie them.
what wyll not he do to the holye ones in
heauen?) Furthermore, both the externall
visible sygnes of bread and wyne, and
the true body of our Sauyor which is vnder
the visible sacramentes, are a figure
and signe of the mutuall vnitie of Christ
with his churche, (for she is made one
bread, through Christ, as it were of many
graynes, and one body consisting of many
members.) Agayne, the breaking of
the visible sacrament, and the reall presence
of the body of Christ, are in signe
and memorie of his passion, (for if a man
should seeke a thousand wayes to styrremen

vp to thinke on Christ, this passeth
all other without cōparison, to bring the
selfe same bodye before them.) But with
all these figures and signes which are founded
in the sacramēt, we confesse also, that
there is a reall presence, not spirituall onlye,Lib. 8. de trinitate but corporall. For S. Hilarye proueth
at large, that Christ vnto thi
                        •
                      daye is in vs
not onlye through concord and agreement of
wyll,
                  E
                        •
                     thimius in su

                        •
                     
                     noph. pae. 2. 
                  but allso truth of nature. Allso Saint
Gregorye Nyssene hath this conclusion,
that lyke as the bread which our Sauior dyd
eate, whiles he lyued yet on earth, was conuerted
into his diuine nature,
                  Christ is reallie in the sacrament. 
                  because that
man, which dyd so eate it, was also God: euen
so, the breade of our mysteries, is conuerted
into the flesh of the worde. Furthermore S.
Hyerome wytnesseth, that the bloud and
flesshe of Christ,
                  In epist. ad Ephes. li. 1. cap. 1. 
                  is vnderstanded two wayes,
either for that spirituall and diuy
                        ••
                      flessh, of
which he hymselfe sayd,
                  Io. 6. 
                  My flessh is meate
in deede, and my bloud is drinke in deede▪ &c.
either for that flessh which was crucified,
and the bloud which was shedd with the speare
of the souldior. According vnto this diuision,
diuersitie of flessh and bloud is taken

to be also in his Sainctes, so that it is one
flessh which shall see the saluations of God,
and an other flessh and bloud, which can
not possesse the kyngdome of God. Of this
testimo
                     •
                  ye therefore we gather, that as
our flesh in heauen shall be true and reall
flesh, although it be made spiritual: so the
spirituall flessh which Christ promysed
vnto vs, is his very true and natural flesh.
Againe, S. Chrisostome testifyeth, that
we are turned into one flessh with hym,
                  Ho.45. in Io. 
                  not
onlye by charitie, but in very deede. And
in an other place, He hath made vs his bodye,
sayeth he,Ho. 60. ad po. An
                        •
                     . 
                  not only by fayth, but allso
in very deede. And it is so true, that Christ
his naturall flesh is geauen vnto vs in the
sacrament, that we should also see it with
our bodily eyes, except diuers causes were
to the contrary,Amb. lib. 4▪ 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     . 4. de sa. of which this is one, lest
some horror & lothsomenes might trouble
vs, if it were geauen in visible forme
of flesh and bloud vnto vs. And to conclude:
The sonne of God is vnited vnto vs
through the mysticall blessing,
                  Cyrill. lib. 11. ca. 26
                        •
                     . in Io. 
                  corporally as
man, spirituallye as God. Wherefore we
doe not destroye one truth by an other,

neyther so beleiue the presence of Christ
his bodye, that in no case we wyll admit
any significatiō or figure, neither againe
so magnifie signes and figures, that we take
awaye all reall presence,De consecrat. 2. cap. Vtrum. S. Augustine
teaching vs, That the body of Christ, is both
a veritie, and a figure: a veritie, whiles the
substance of bread and wyne is made his bodye
and bloud by the power of the holyghost:
and a figure, because of that which is outwardly
seene and perceyued. And so against
the next tyme, (if you can haue any answer,)
prouide to proue, not that Christ
gaue a figure, but that he gaue nothing
else but a figure. For if you will so graunt
a figure, that yet you will not denye the
reall presence, then will all our other cō
                  clusions,
which you despyse now, be deduced
out of the principle of Christ his
reall presence, that you neede to make no
further question about them. As for the
kynges brode seale, vnto which you resemble
the sacrament, it may be well and trulye
sayd, that in deede the sacrament is a
most sure confirmation of all the actes
which Christ dyd worke for vs, in the tyme

of his visible conuersation emong vs.
For how might we haue his verye true
bodye emong vs, except he receyued a
true nature of man vpon hym? or how
might we Christians doubt of it, whether
he be rysen from death to immortalitie,
whose flessh and bloud is daily geauen
to such as will, to saue them frō corruption?
But, if you make no more of it,
then that, as the king his brode seale doth
geaue a force to his letters patentes,Goodlie greate wordes emong the protestantes but small and simple sense. so
lykewyse the sacramentall bread should
confirme the testament and promyses of
Christ, and that in such a sense, that as
truly as our body is fedd with that bread,
so truly our sowle is norysshed with his
spirite: verely you haue taken a great
wonder at a common and easye matter.
For euery man, when he will, not only in
the church, but at home and else where,
and not only by bread or wyne, but also,
by euery thing that is true, maye vse the
lyke phrase, and saye: as truly as I stand,
as I sytt, as this fyer burneth, as the sonne
shineth, as I lyue, as I eate, &c. so trulie
God dyed once for vs to saue vs from

death euerlasting. And if you wil cōtend,
that although one maye so say of al thinges
which are true, yet that there is a speciall
regarde to be had vnto bread & wine
which Christ him selfe appointed for
that purpose, yet you haue no great cause
of wonder, no more then you shold maruell
in some weighty accompt which the
kyng himselfe would sett for some profitable
effect, that one such peece of golde
which right now stood but for a shilling,
should be sodainly remoued and made to
signifie. 1000000. Li. For if al the dignity
and price of the Sacrament consisteth
herein, that it representeth a most wonderfull
gyfte and benefyte, which the
soune of God bestowed vpon vs: then are
you very much to blame for defacing,
spoyling, breaking, and burning of crucifixes,
which did more lyuely represent
the death of Christ, then any externall
forme of bread and wyne can doe. Whereunto
if you will answer, that Christ appointed
the one and not the other, you
maye yet gather thereby, that (according
vnto your imagination) there is no such
great excellencye in the institution of

bread and wyne to represent and declare
vnto vs the veritie of Christ his promyses,
but that a paynter or caruer maye
as euidently expresse them by his arte and
colours, and more effectually also perchaunse,
for the playne, symple, deuout
and good men of the world. Wherefor
that the holye doctors and fathers of
Christ his church▪ should meane nothing
els by their termes of (transmutatiō, transelementation,
mutation, conuersion, alteration,
&c.) But the chainge of the externall
elementes into this meanyng, that
they doe showe the effecte of the Sacrament,
and seale vpp vnto vs the promyses
of Christ: it is a very abiect and vyle
mysconstruyng of them. For they declare
most expreslye, that in the externall
elementes there is no chainge at all, but
the chainge is onely in the substance of
the bread into Christ his bodye, which
at an other tyme is to be proued more
largelie,Serm. de coena Domini. but now S. Cyprian alone, maye
suffise, saying This bread, which our Lord
                        •
                     
dyd vnto his disciples delyuer, being chainged
not in outward shew, but in nature is

made flesh by the allmightynes of the worde,
&c. But as much as you can for shame
you extenuate and debase the greatnes
of Christ his benefytes towardes vs.The M. of the defence will not 
                        •
                     aue the benefites of God to be so great as thei are in deeds. For
Christ saying this is my body, you vnderstand
hym to meane a figure onely of his
body, and the holy doctors prouing vnto
vs, that it should not be vncredible, that
of simple bread he maketh vnto vs his
precious body, because he made all thinges
of no thing, and can doe more then
is ordynary by the cōmon course of nature,
yet, (saye you) they speake of no other
chainge, but that which is about the
external elementes. And one of them, hauing
this similitude, Lyke as wax being
sett vnto fyer, is lykened vnto it, no substance
remaineth, no ouerplus resteth: so doe thow
thinke, the misteries to be consumed by the
substance of Christ his bodie. No, (say you)
it is not so, or els it is to be vnderstanded
after this maner, that lyke as when the
king his broad seale is sett vnto his lettres
patētes, then haue those letters their
effect, so, (I trow) that the Sacrament
should be lyke a pece of wax to confirme

I can not tell what letters. For if you
meane the promysses of euerlasting lyfe,
before we come to receiue the Sacramēt,
we beleiue God and his church, & doubt
nothing of them, and therefor I confesse
my ignorance, that I can not tell, what
maner of leases or grauntes you conceyue
to be vnconfirmed, before the seale of
bread and wine be added vnto them. But
(as I began to tell you) you take all thinges
at the lowest and basest maner, and
this perchaunse is that, which you obiect
vnto vs, (when your delicate and deyntie
eloquence could not abyde to heare
the Catholike to speake of the pulling,
skaulding, drawing, and rosting of a capon,
before you dyd eate hym,) resembling
vs vnto the seruant, which being
commaunded to make the dyner readye,
would thinke vpon great prouysion, the
master hym selfe meaning to haue nothing
els but such colde meate set vpon
the table, as was in the house. As who
should saye,Cold ro
                        ••
                      emong heretikes. we shalbe saued and fare well
inough, if we do but imagine that Christ
dyed for us. As for the hauing of his naturall

bodye, because it is a matter of
greate prouision, and it keepeth a great
sturr within a mans hart, to conceyue
how it should be a naturall bodye, and
placed now in heauen, and yet present
and perfect on euery aultar in the whole
worlde, and because it were lytle inough
to thynke all nyght long and mornyng
before, how to come to such a feast with
contrition, confession, and satisfaction,
therefore it is but superfluous cost, and
a torment vnto the conscience. Colde
meate shall serve vs well inough, and we
shalbe as merye with bread and drink in
the remembrāce that Christ dyed for vs,
as with all the prouision which the papistes
saie Christ to haue made. In which
similitude, you haue as rightly expressed
your inward thoughtes, as maye be. And
we truly, if we make greate prouisiō, we
doe no other then we are commaunded,
because we be his seruantes which euery
daye geaueth the fatt calfe, for ioye of
his sounes which were lost and are returned
agayne, which was neuer a niggard
of his meate and drinke, in so much

that when he had none other, but seruantes
in his howse, yett he prouyded
so royally for them, that as euerye one of
them wysshed, so dyd his meate taste in
his mouth. For consider onlye the excellencye
of Manna of the olde law.
First of all it came from heauen without
any labor of the Israelites: it came dayly,
(except one daye in the weeke) that they
should haue it fressh and fressh:Exod. 16. it came
so plentyfullye, that yt couered all the
grounde about theyr tentes: and yet so
equallye, that he which gathered more
dyd not abounde, and he which gathered
lesse did not want it came so simply as if
it had ben the seedes of coryander:Num. 11. and it
tasted so wonderfully that it conteyned
all delycates and hartes desyre:S
                        •
                     p. 16. it continued
to them .xl.losue. 5. yeares togeather, and as
surely as their bodyes were noryshed with
that bread, so sure thei might be, that their
sowles & mindes were fed with the grace
of Christ. And all this yet, was bestowed
vpō the Iewes, before the incarnation of
the sou
                     •
                  e of God, before the comming
of the holyghost, in the law of bondage,

in the tyme of figures, and when God
(as I may saye) did not yet keepe open
householde in all cōtreyes of the world,
neither make so great cheare, as he mynded
to doe afterwarde. Therefor, if such
thinges were geauē vnto the Iewes,Christians are worse fed then the Iewes were, except they receiue the true bodie of Christ. what
was to be reserued for Christians? and if
we haue not in deede the reall body of
Christ emong vs, what lyke thing haue
we, vnto their Manna. Yf there were no
other argument but this one, which is
gathered upon the conferring of tyme
with tyme, state with state, figures with
truthes, Moyses with Christ, Iewes with
Christians, yet of very congruence and
conscience, we should looke to fare better
then the Israelites dyd in the barren
wyldernes. But, except our Sauior his
wordes, (this is my bodye, this is my bloud)
be vnderstanded literally and really, we
fare a thousand partes worse. For as in
our bread vnitie is represented, so might
it haue ben in 
                     〈◊〉
                   Manna: and as you
be as verely assured, that your sowle doth
participate Christ in spirite, as your bodye
doth receyue the externall bread, so

likewise they, which were spirituall emōg
the Israelites, did, in their Manna, conceyue
and receyue the bread of lyfe and
the Sauior of the world: and againe, as
your sacramentall bread is a token and
seale vnto you of the goodnes and promyses
of God, so was Manna vnto them;
and that with much more myracle and
cōfort. So that you haue nothing in this
your Sacrament of the new law, (which
should be most excellent,) which one
maye not fynde in the Manna of the olde
law, which yet was but a shadow and
figure of the bodye of Christ in the Sacrament,
but Manna of that tyme, had
many wonderful prerogaty
                     •
                  es, by which
it farr passeth in estimation, the Sacrament
of Christ his bodye and bloud, if
there be no more in it, then you doe conceyue
and vtter. Which because it is vnreasonable,
therefore we can not but vnderstand
Christ his wordes, (This is my
bodye, &c.) in that sense which we doe,
and we doe not feare least we shall offende
in making to great a price and value
of the Sacramēt, but rather we cōfesse

that we shall neuer be able to expresse
the maiestie, the miracles, and the dignitie
of it. As for you, if you be delighted
with cold rost, and would not, (if you
might) haue Christ really and naturally
God and man, bodye and sowle, to be
geauen vnto you, but can satisfye your
appetyte, with only figures, sygnes and
similitudes, you shal sytt by your selfe for
the Catholikes, vntyll God shall sende
you more charitie. Which if it were, (as
it should be in you) you could not fynde
fault with the reall presence of Christ in
his Sacrament,Defence fol. 118. and call it a torment vnto
your conscience, but rather you would
be werye of all scrappes and leauinges of
an yesterdayes feast, and contemne all
counterfait dyshes, which haue more apparance
then substance. When you were
a childe, if one had brought vnto you a
byrde or a fysh made in fyne and sweete
paste with a figg or such lyke thing within,
you would haue ben more delighted
in it, thē with the true meate of the byrde
or fysh, but after that you be come to
the state of a man, you should couet the

sounde and strong meates, and lett all
such creekes and knackes alone, to serue
for children. God graunt that you fynde
not hereafter, fault also with the Catholikes,
that they teache you to beleiue a
true and natural flesh and sowle in Christ
and that you reproue not the charges and
cost which God hath bestowed vpon the
redemption of mankynde, because the
only worde of his blessed will, was able
to saue vs, so that his incarnation needed
not, but only a similitude of a body.
               But for this tyme, let this be an end
of this Replye, and I would to God, here
might be an end of all cōtrouersie, which
because it is not verye credible, in such
confusion and vnrulynes of sectes and diuisions,
therfor some answer is to be looked
for, or rather some similitude of it.
For as concerning any true answer in the
defence of your part, you can neuer make
it in those pointes, which you are burdened
withall in this Replye, as, your mysconstruyng
of holye Fathers, and reasoning
out of the purpose with many absurde
and vnlearned conclusion. Yet no

doubt, but you will cōtinew styll in your
stoutnes, and by one meane or other,
mayntayne your Capitaynes against vs.
For if Goliath be stroken downe, yet you
sett vpp an Achilles, and by chainging
of the name you thinke to chainge the
cause. But if your bastard brauery, had
not ben sufficiently exemplified, by the
fact of the vncircumcided Goliath, yet
now by the crake, which you sett vpon
your prophane Achilles, you proue your
selfes more lyke that fell Gyant thē euer
you were before. For allthough Goliath
was bygg in stature and wordes, and contemned
the simple staffe and scripp with
which the loueable Dauyd came against
hym, yet after the stone once fastened in
his forehead, and the overthrow geuen
vnto hym, the Philistians hartes were in
their heeles, and they fledd awaye without
any further bragging. But he, whom
you nyckname Parys, allthough he hath
vtterlye kylled your Achilles, shooting (as
you saye) his arrowes out of a corner priuely,
but how so euer they were shott,
hitting (as we beleiue) the marke perfectlye,

yet you make your Achilles so invincible,
as though he could not be woū
                  ded
at all in this quarrell, and as though
he passed no more of any shott of ours
then if benettes or strawes should be cast
agayne hym. Which is so exceading and
vayne glorious a crake, that it maye rather
be thought that your Achilles would
be very gladd, if he might neuer hereafter
heare any more wordes, about his open
and loude challendge. For as concerning
the manifest obiections, which
are made against hym, they are to be read
in playne prent, which he hath not bē
yet in haste to answer (as far as we know)
because perchaunse he knoweth his owne
imbecillitie. And if this Apologye of
the priuate Masse had ben allso putt in
prent, that it might haue come vnto his
sight, he would (I thinke) haue dyssembled
the matter or despysed the argumē
                  tes,
to shifte awaye from hym all the labor
of answering. But how so euer your
Achilles be dysposed, you haue shewed
your selfe a frindlye Patroclus, which to
saue his worshipp, haue taken vpon you

to answer in his behalfe. Which although
you haue done, with much infelicitie, yet
you haue declared, your good hart and
fidelitie. You shall cause Achilles himselfe,
to take the matter into his owne hā
                  des,
partly for the chalenge sake, which
he fyrst of all pronunced, partly for you
his frendes sake, whom he wil be loth to
see vndefended. God sende you of his grace
abundantly, that you fyght not for an
Helena in deede, mainteyning the lustes
and appetytes of your carnall reason, striuing
for your owne inuentions, and following
your owne prayses. The church
and spouse of Christ is shamefast, chaste,
gentle, faythfull, obedient, without murmour
and spitefullnes, full of good vowes,
stedfast in her profession, allwayes
desyrous of vnitie, which vertues whiles
some haue neglected, they haue themselues
ben contemned of God, and permitted
to folow their owne frowardnes, to
the increasing of their iust dampnation.
Of this kynde was Luther and his folowers,
which as though they had nothing
els to study vpō, but only how thei might

inuent sectes and diuisyons, so they lefte
no one thing which the church taught
them, vncontrolled, or vncorrupted making,
at their will and pleasure, of thinges
necessarye, no matter at all, (as appeareth
in the seauen sacramentes, which
they haue brought to two only or three,
and them corrupted,) of vniuersall and
autentyke, so indifferent, that euerye one
might omitt them, (as prescript fastinges,
orders of praying, and ceremonies)
and of indifferent in the nature of them,
so necessary and absolute, that no dispensation
may serue for the altering of them,
(as in sole receyuing, receauing in one
kynde, and reseruation of the sacramēt.)
So that nothing pleased them, that the
churche, in which they toke their fayth,
delyuered vnto them, because they loued
them selues to much, and their owne deare
Cate and Helena. Whom, God shall at
length, destroye with the spyrite of his
mouth, and by sending of his feare into
their hartes which honor her, dryue away
that wycked one, which maynteyneth the
battayle, and make such peace and tranquillitie

in their conscience, that it maye
haue good space and mynde to consider
the securitie which is in the catholike
church, and learne emong many other,
this one point of charitie, that neither sole
receyuing vnder one kynde, neyther
receyuing vnder both kyndes with company,
doth commende vs vnto God, but
the keeping of his commaundementes,
and obeying of his ordynances, which
he hath or shal vtter, eyther by him
selfe immedyatly, or by the
Catholike church his
interpretour.
               Amen.
