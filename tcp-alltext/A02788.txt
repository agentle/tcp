            ☞ As I haue compyled this treatyse in the zele of God & my prince against the tyraūt of Rome & his secret maynteners. So ys yt my desyre that his grace maye haue yt as a frute of my Christen obedience. And I doubt yt not / but some godlye manne louynge his grace better then that wycked Pope / wyll faythfullye delyuer it vnto him / the slayghtes of theyr false generation consydered. Praye (gentyll reader) that yt maye fynde grace in his syght.
            ☞ Deale with Babylon as she hath deserued / for she hath set vp herselfe against the Lorde / & against the holye one of Israel.
