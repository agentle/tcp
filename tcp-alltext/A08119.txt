               RIght Worshipfull, and my beloued CountriemenNow more then twenty yeeres since. the Citizens of Norwich, when in the house of my friend, among other Bookes I found (vnlooked for) this Treatise written in Latine, by one Alexander Neuil an English man: The very Title of the Booke drew mee into a farther desire of looking into the matter: the rather because lying at that time, and in that place where these Furies were committed, I beheld something with my young eyes: and receiuing many strange things from the report of others, I desired, and was glad to see the thing in order▪ which when I entred vpon, the elegancie of the Phrase, together with the Argument, promised mee a double fruit, viz. not only to know the Storie in order, but also to reuiue, and sharpen my poore skill in that Tongue, now through disuse and tract of time declining: so as I made it from my other Studies, my recreation. In the pursuit whereof, I found (as the Queene of Sheba saith of the wisdome of Salomon) that the one halfe of the calamities, and miseries of this worshipfull Citie (my Mother) was neuer sufficiently

knowne vnto me: Neyther the miraculous deliuerance, sufficiently acknowledged by mee, for I finde it farre greater then I thought. Wherefore reading it ouer now once, and againe, and communing with diuers of my friends about the matters therein contained: I found a generall desire in them all to haue it in English. Whereupon, my selfe hauing found such pleasure mixt with profit in the reading heereof (if I should not bee enuious: hauing also certaine intelligence that it was not extant by any particular Treatise) thought good to satisfie their expectation, though of many the vnfittest: That so prayse might be giuen vnto God of many. And as the benefit increaseth in our eyes, so our thankesgiuing might grow, and abound. Wherefore vnto that godly order taken, alreadie for the yearely remembrance of this deliuerance, and solemnitie of Thankes giuing, as the Poet sayth in the like.

            ALEXANDER NEVILL OF THE FVRIES OF NORFOLKE, vnder Captaine Kette.
            
            
               I Would haue wished verily, that those popular sturres, and seditious stormes, wherewith our Country, in the dayes of King Edward the sixth, was smitten and afflicted, by the villany, and the treacherie of beastly men, had either neuer happened (or if it could be) the remembrance of them were vtterly rooted out of the minds of all men. But because things past cannot bee altered, or changed, and this staine of treason, branded in the forehead of our Countrey by pernicious Citizens, setteth deeper in the name of the people of Norfolke (to the perpetual remembrance of that wickednesse) then can be vtterly blotted out, or altogether taken away: I easily yeeld to the committing this Story to writing, that all men may perceiue from what beginning these so great tumults did arise; and by what meanes at the length they were suppressed, and may perfitly vnderstand those wounds, and seditious villanies, to haue been brought vpon our Country, not by good and valiant persons, but printed vpon her by the routs of most desperate, and vngratious men.
            This surely is euident to all, that an incredible gaine commeth to posteritie, by the knowledge of such things: and no doubt, great fruit shall good men reape, if they giue diligent heed to the instructious of these examples, and make vse of

them in their conuersation. On the otherside, vngodly and troublesome Citizens (if any such there be) as I hope there be none, or not many in this Kingdome, may lea
                  ••
               e to bee wiser from others miseries: Or at the least, if they cannot doe that, (for they cannot doe what they will not doe) yet they may tremble, beholding the fearefull end of these men.
            In the yeere of our Lord, 1549. when many grieuously complained vnto King Edward the sixt, that their Commons were taken from them, and inclosed by certaine priuate persons: The care thereof, by the authoritie of the King was committed vnto certaine most graue, and discreete persons: and a Commission appointed, they were commanded aboue all things, to inquire of such complaints, and to vnderstand, and consult of the whole matter, with as much expedition as mought bee. Which comming abroad, and made knowne to the common people, sundry rumours were spred hereof, and among other things done, the ditches in Kent were filled vp, and fields somtime common (now inclosed with ditches, and hedges) were laid open. Now because the like was not done in the Countrie of Norfolke, certaine light, and seditious persons of the common people began to murmur, and be grieued; and from thence-foorth they bound themselues with brutish rage and villany, that (against right, and without the commandement of the King) they would doe the like here, as they had heard done in Kent: Desiring (as the euent declared) not only to lay open the common Pastures, inclosed by the iniurie of some men, but to powre foorth their vngodly desires against the Commonwealth (hidden before in the wicked intention of their hearts) to the spoile, and ouerthrow of all things. Whence they procured mortall warres to their Countrie, and destruction to themselues. For when the report of this cursed Societie came abroade, they began euery where to enter secret counsels, and many base and vile persons in sundry places complained of their estate, and bitterly inueighed against the authoritie of Gentlemen, and of the Nobilitie. For, said they, the pride ofThe Rebels complaint. great men is now intollerable, but their condition miserable. These abound in delights, and compassed with the fulnesse of

all things, and consumed with vaine pleasures, thirst only after gaine, and are inflamed with the burning delights of their desires: but themselues almost killed with labour and watching, doe nothing all their life long but sweate, mourne, hunger and thirst. Which things, though they seeme miserable and base (as they are indeed most miserable) yet might be borne howsoeuer, if they which are drowned in the boyling seas of euill delights, did not pursue the calamitie, and miseries of other men with too much insolent hatred: but now both they, and their miserable condition, is a laughing stocke to most proud and insolent men, consuming with ease and idlenesse. Which thing (as it may) grieueth them so sore, and inflicteth such a staine of euill report: as nothing is more grieuous for them to remember, nor more vniust to suffer. But that condition of possessing land seemeth miserable, and slauish, they hold all at the pleasure of great men: not freely, but by prescription, and as it were at the will, and pleasure of the Lord. For as soone as any man offend any of these gorgious Gentlemen, he is put out, depriued, and thruft from all his goods. How long should we suffer so great oppression to goe vnreuenged! For so farre are they now gone in crueltie and couetousnesse, as they are not only content to take by violence all away, and by force and villany to get, which they consume in ryot, and effeminate delights: except they may also sucke, in a manner, our bloud and marrow, out of our veines and bones. The common Pastures left by our predecessors for the reliefe of vs, and our children, are taken away. The lands which in the memory of our fathers, were common, those are ditched and hedged in, and made seuerall; the Pastures are inclosed, and we shut out: whatsoeuer fowles of the aire, or fishes of the water, and increase of the earth, all these doe they deuoure, consume and swallow vp; yea, nature doth not suffice to satisfie their lufts, but they seeke out new deuices, and as it were, formes of pleasures, to imbalme and perfume themselues, to abound in pleasant smells, to powre in sweete things to sweete things: finally, they seeke from all places, all things for their desire, and prouocation of lust: while we in the meane time, eate hearbs

and roots, and languish with continuall labour, and yet enuie that we liue, breathe, and inioy common ayre. Shall they, as they haue brought hedges about common Pastures, inclose with their intolerable lusts also, al the commodities and pleasure of this life, which, Nature, the Parent of vs all, would haue common, and bringeth foorth euery day for vs, aswell as for them? We can no longer beare so much, so great, and so cruell iniurie, neither can wee with quiet minds behold so great couetousnesse, excesse, and pride of the Nobilitie; we will rather take Armes, and mixe Heauen and Earth together, then indure so great crueltie. Nature hath prouided for vs, aswell as for them; hath giuen vs a body, and a soule, and hath not enuiedAhellish paritie. vs other things. While we haue the same forme, and the same condition of birth together with them, why should they haue a life so vnlike vnto ours, and differ so farre from vs in calling? We see that now it is come to extremitie, wee will also prooue extremitie: rend downe hedges, fill vp ditches, make way for euery man into the common pasture: Finally, lay all euen with the ground, which they no lesse wickedly, then cruelly and couerously haue inclosed. Neither will we suffer our selues any more to bee pressed with such burthens against our willes, nor endure so great shame, as liuing out our dayes vnder such inconueniences, wee should leaue the Commonwealth vnto our postcritie, mourning, and miserable, and much worse then we receiued it of our fathers.

            Not long after it happened, there was a Play at Windham,Windham game. by an old custome, which lasted two daies, and two nights: whereunto, when a multitude of all degrees came, these wretched

conspirators hereunto onely bent their wits, to powre foorth the venome of their enuie against their Countrie, watching so fit an opportunitie of time and place. First therefore were secret meetings of men running hither and thither, then withdrawing themselues, secret conferences: but at length, they all began to deale tumultuously, and to rage openly. And when they heard, that Robert Ket, a Tanner, a man of stout, rude, of an impudent boldnesse, and vnbridled violence, hadRebels sute to Ket. inclosed a peece of Common, they ranne vnto him full of furie and madnesse, and signified vnto him, what aduice they had taken for the disturbance of the peace of their Countrie; and do earnestly intreat him, that whatsoeuer of the Common feede he had inclosed, the same he would presently (their Countrie and they requiring it) yeeld to common profit, the hedges and ditches being throwne downe, and made euen with the ground. Ket, as one burning with the same flames of furie, wherewith these were set on fire, easily suffering himselfe toKets answere. bee drawne into this cursed fellowship, answered, That hee was ready, and would be ready at all times to do whatsoeuer, not only to represse, but to subdue the power of Great men, and that he hoped to bring to passe, that as they of their painefull labour, so these of their pride should repent ere long. And further declareth many horrible things, which of late yeeres they haue indured many wrongs and miseries, wherewith they had been vexed and afflicted: and wi

present onely at all their consultations, but alwayes president.
            These wretched men, and vilest of all that euer liued, being set on fire with these words, when with thankfull clamors they had compassed him about, on the sodaine, as it were gathering an assembly of men, into a certaine field of Ketts, next adioyning to the towne of Windham, all the multitude flocked thither. And as they had decreed, there they threw downe the ditches, and made them euen with the ground: which when they had done, as vnbridled horses lusting after liberty, which in the errour of their conceite, they fained vnto themselues: partly through their owne boldnesse, and trusting to this vaine successe of things; partly through the incouragement and cryes of their Captaine, being set on fire as with burning lights, it is incredible to tell with what flames of fury, to the disturbance of our peace, and ouerthrow of our Common-wealth they burned.
            From thence they came to Hetherset (which is a villageThe Rebels came to Hetherset. not farre from Windham) and there they forced into the fields of one Flowerdew, filled vp the ditches, brake downe the hedges, and laid open the Inclosures. At these stirres a great contention, and altercation arose, when Flowerdew, with griefe and anger much moued, had rebuked Kett, and laid all the fault vpon him as the cause of that vnruly and rebellious rout, calling him often wretched man, the baine of his Countrey, and Captaine of Fugitiues. And by this meanes (as much as lay in him) their villainy was resisted, and their enterprises some what abated: who perswaded with all his skill, that they should dutifully lay downe their weapons, which vndutifully they had taken vp: with which words and deeds of Flowerdew they being more vehemently incensed; when compassing Kett about, they had filled the ayre with cryes, and complaints, and had incouraged one another, at length they implore and require of him, the true performance of that helpe, whereunto he bound himselfe of late. Hee, as one that put all confidence of the future villanie, in the euent of this present mischiefe, supposing also it were not good for him to prolong the time any longer, exhorteth them to be of good courage, and to follow

him the author and reuenger of their liberty: Affirming, hee had not forsaken that charge which the Common-wealth hadThe Cōmon wealth of Rogues. put vpon him; neither was any thing more deare vnto him then their welfare, which he preserred before all things else: for the which hee would spend cheerefully both goods and life, the dearest things in their account.
            The report of these most vile, and vngracious words, gathered together all lewd, and desperate persons from all parts, insomuch as on the sodaine, great routs of seruants, and Runnagates, came flocking into Ketts Campe. With which wicked instruments of mischiefe he being now garded: when hee had left at Hetherset and Windham, the markes of his lewdnesse, and had wasted in a manner all places wheresoeuer hee came, the tenth day of Iuly they came to a place neere Eton wood. Vnto this wood are neere adioyning Common pastures of the Citty of Norwich, called the Towne Close, in whichTowne Close▪
                place many needy, and poore mens Neat are pastured, and a common Heardsman appointed keeper of them, which by custome receiued of the owners an halfe-penny weekely for a beast. Vnto those pastures ditched, and hedged in (for the safer keeping, and lest the cattell should stray abroad) came certaine of the scumme of the City (the day after the Rebels came towards Norwich) with violent rage and fury, complaining that they were common pastures (as they were indeede) and that they would not suffer any longer common pasture to bee inclosed, and were carried with so blinderage from all iudgement and reason: as that which (by the prouidence and industry of their betters) was inclosed to common profit, they would pull downe with their owne hands. They had now scarce thrown downe the ditch in the vpper part of the Close, when many pestilent persons, into whose eares a rumour of this pernicious conspiracy came (escaping secretly out of the City) and ioyned with Ketts souldiers. Which men were led hereunto, the rather, because these wretched conspirators pretended alwayes the benefit of the Common-wealth, and care of common profit, to couer their wickednesse withall.
            When tidings of these things was brought into the City,

the Maior (who at that time was Thomas Codde) fearing at the
                  Maior Tho. Cod. strangenesse of the matter, thought good out of hand to prouide against this inconuenience, and to labour that these tumults (if by any meanes it could bee brought to passe) might be repressed in the beginning. Whereupon, calling the chiefe of the Citty together (namely the Aldermen, which alwayes are with the Maior in the counsell) to appease these tumults, he goeth with them into Ketts Campe. There he found them all wickedly occupied, giuing themselues to ryot and excesse. And first he allured them by money, and fairer promises to leaue off their enterprise, and euery man to depart quietly to his owne house. They notwithstanding continued still their purpose, throwing downe whatsoeuer was inclosed. The Maior when he had tryed all meanes in vaine, and perceiued that neither intreaty nor reward could preuaile any thing at all, to draw the mindes of the Conspirators from so great wickednesse, to the consideration of peace, presently returneth into the City.
            After whose departure, the Rebels conceiued (as it was indeede,A signe frō the Citizens to the Rebels. which also they beganne to perceiue by little bowes in the hands of certaine men, which fled vnto them out of the City) that if they tarried any longer scattered, and separated one from another, their enterprise presently, without any difficulty, would be disappointed, and they resisted. To preuent this, they thought it safest, that all their cursed companies should be drawen together into one place. Whereupon without delay they went to Eaton wood, which when they had viewed thorowout, and found no conuenient place to pitch their campe in; by publique consent it was agreed vpon, that from thence they should presently depart to Moushold. And chiefly they did chuse that place, wherein they might appoint seates for their wicked purposes, and dennes for their robberies. Therefore when this aduice liked them all, and night beforeRebels request to the Maior. they were aware came on, they sent messengers vnto the Maior to signifie vnto him, that they intended without iniury to any man, to passe thorow the City, because that way was more easie and readier, and therefore they request to doe it with his good leaue.
            
               Hereunto the Maior answered, that they were men of aThe Maiors Answere. lewd minde, and enemies to the weale publique, and therefore he would giue them no passe thorow the City. Moreouer, he rebuked them sharpely and with threatning words, as men seditious, and desirous to trouble and ouerturne all things, that so striking a feare into them, he might by all meanes possible terrifie them from so great mischiefe, and cruelty. Moreouer, he gaue them to vnderstand, that if they proceeded in their fury and rage, it would sho
                  •
               tly come to passe, such desperat attempts would come to a fearefull end. But this speech of the Maior was so farre from terrifying them, as they departed from him more obstinate, and confirmed in their resolution then when they came. Thus Ketts Company disappointed of their hope, and intention, lurked all that night in Eaton wood. In the meane season the Maior with his Brethren called a Councell,The Maior calleth a Councell. as it behoued them, for the Common-weale of their City; There it was longtime, and much debated: as of them whose mindes were carryed into doubtfull opinions. Some thought there is neede of expedition, and that without delay they are to be put to flight: For being desperately mad, and raging, if they be not in the beginning repressed, they would bring a plague and destruction to the whole City. Other thought otherwise, that it is a matter of great danger, deliberation, and aduice, and that this speede in resisting, comming as from courage, and magnanimity: so it may seeme vncertaine, and vnaduised, whose whole commendation is in the euent. Which course, as it bringeth alwayes a doubtfull, so for the most part a dolefull end. And therefore they perswade, to fortifie the City, and appoint watch and ward carefully, and to bestow the Citizens vpon the walles, and other conuenient places of the City. As for other things, because by the Law of raising Force, and Armes, it is prouided that no Bands bee mustered without the commandement of the King, therefore nothing to be attempted (as they aduise) but to expect his will and authority: All men easily inclined to this sentence, as held for the best, proceeding from the matter in question, and most safe against euery assault of Fortune. And forthwith messengers are sent post with letters vnto the King, wherein all things are

carefully reported, commanding that with as much speed as was possible, they should be deliuered to the Kings Councell.
            The next day after, that was the eleuenth of Iuly, when theyThe Rebels goe ouer at Hailsdon Bridge. could not obtaine liberty of the Maior to passe thorow the City, and all hope therof being taken away, it seemed best to them, and they all agreed, to goe ouer at Hailsdon Bridge, which because they could not easily doe, for the straightnesse of the Bridge, the way whereof was too narrow for the drift of the Cattell, and carriage, they threw great store of wood into the riuer, and so vpon the boughes, and bodies of the trees heaped vp together, men, horse, and cart, might passe ouer the Riuer. After this manner being gone ouer, the night following they lodged at Drayton. The next day they went towards Moushold, casting downe on euery side hedges and diches. Moreouer they pulled downe a Chappell of one Corbetts, and brought a desolation and miserable ruine vpon all places. Into this cursed rout of wretched men destroying, and wasting all things, and rushing into all places with headlong rage: wheresoeuer they came, Roger Woodhouse Knight, andRoger Woodhouse Knight taken. the brethren of the Appleyards, fell into their company, while vnwarily they went to see which way these Rebels came. These they tooke, and against their wills carried with them. Then they tooke the hill called Saint Leonards hill, right ouer against Norwich, in which place the Earle of Surry had built a faire and sumptuous house, which hath beneath it the maine Riuer running betwixt the City, and hath on the East, and South the wood, and a little village called Thorpe: but on the East, and North, Moushold Heath, which containeth in length and breadth, more then sixe miles. Heere they placed the Chambers (and as it were) tents of their furies, and lurking those thicke woods, as dogs in their kennels, they violated all Lawes of God and man. Moreouer, they entred that goodly house, & in all places thereof left the markes of their villanies.
            And now whatsoeuer of the vilest, and basest of the people were in any place, these came running thither; and all the dregges, and filth of the people of Norfolke ioyned themselues to this Campe: besides, a great number out of Suffolke; also

               me stocking thither. Moreouer, they adde one mischiefe to another: for this so horrible villany and desire (seldome heard of) of destroying all things, they couer with a certaine shew of counterfeit holinesse: for they got vnto them a certaine Minister of the City, whom theyTo Rebellion, they ioyne deuotion. appoint to say prayers Morning and Euening. Furthermore, they endeuour to ioyne to the societie of these outrages, men any way excellent for Religion and Doctrine, and for vertue and innocencie of life commendable: Among whom, was Robert Watson, Preacher; Thomas Cod, Maior of Norwich; Thomas Aldrich of Mangreene, a man while he liued, beloued of all men. These three because they refused to be bound to their wicked agreements, and trecherous Couenants, against their willes, they constrained to bee present at all their Consultations, and to take vpon them the administration of all things with Kett, the chiefe Rebell.
            Which thing fel out marueilous wel; for if it happened at anyGods prouidence. time (which happened often) that Kett, or any of the principal Conspirators (as they were prone, and headlong to all villany) stirred vp by the mad multitude, to goe about any wicked, and vngracious worke, which might tend in conclusion to the spoile, either of the Citie, the Fields or Townes neere the City, the wise and careful diligence of these men, often hindred such pestilent enterprises.
            Although Kett set on fire with mischiefe, and spurred forward by the rude furies of his companions, was wont sometimes to send foorth Commandement, as from authoritie of prescript formes, which were called Ketts writs, whereunto sometime this importunate beast abused the names of these honest men. The Coppie of which writs followeth.

            Then in order other followed: for the number of Delegates were many, for besides the chiefe of this wicked societie, they chose two out of euery hundred, and there were sixe and twenty2600. Rebels at this time. hundred: and with these, and the like Warrants, many worthy and Great persons, whom the furie and rage of the common people made guiltie, were arested. And many, as though they had been guiltie of great crimes, were led away to Moushold, and there shut vp in hold and prison.
            Moreouer, the ditches and hedges of common Pastures inclosed, by the authoritie of the same Commission were throwne downe, and in diuers places, many were charged to be assistant, and helpers in these tumults. And all these things were done, these three, the Maior Watson and Aldrich, not only holding their peace, and winking at the matter, but also in shew sometime consenting, being often compelled to serue the time, whereby they might relieue their Country tost to and fro, in the deepe seas of sedition and discord, lest, if not resisting at all▪ the aduersarie, and cruell common people, should haue perceiued it, and so they should haue brought present death to themselues, and destruction to their Countrie, which then without doubt (if they had openly resisted, or plainely denied (as farre as man could perceiue) such was their rage, and vnbridled madnesse) had vtterly perished, ouerthrowne with robberies, burning, and all kind of common calamitie.
            In the meane season, the Citie of Norwich, carefull of this estate of things, with an vncertaine hope, and continuall expectation for reliefe, remained doubtfull of these sturres: for hitherto no answere was brought vnto them from the King, neither vnderstood they what the Councell had decreed to be done; and the Citizens without commandement, durst attempt nothing, but remained in the Citie, still looking for the Kings authoritie.
            
               And it chanced at that time, many obscure and vile persons were in armes in sundry places, as bound by a common consent of villany: they had conspired to teare in sunder the bowels of the Common wealth: for although the fury of rude and beastly men, did much more, and cruelly rage in the Countie of Norfolke, then any where else: yet the same mortall plague of destroying all things, was spred abroad almost through all parts of the land. Not onely Norfolke, but Buckingham, Oxford, Surrey, Essex, Kent, Cambridge-shire, and many other places were troubled with the like sturres▪ Whereby it came to passe, that when all the counsels, care and studie was occupied in quenching the flames of so great seditions (lest, if they had not gone presently against the fire, all the Common-wealth had burned) they came somewhat later to represse these Norfolke Commotions then they wished.
            In the meane while sedition groweth, and loseth nothing, but daily increaseth, in so much, that of beastly men in Kets Campe, there were almost sixteene thousand; and these16000. Rebels in the Campe. went about to fortifie themselues with all meanes of defence, Kett being their Captaine; and they brought from diuers parts prouision for the warres, and al kind of weapons into the Campe.
            Moreouer, great store of Gun-powder, and Gunnes of all sorts a great number. To the obtaining whereof, they ran into all places, and entred the houses of Worshipfull persons and Gentlemen, robbing them; and whatsoeuer cattel they found in the field, money in the houses, or corne in the barnes, that vngodly, and wickedly they tooke away, (yea, the owners looking vpon them) and carried it into the Campe.
            And many, when after this sort they had wasted, powled,The Rebels rob one another. and emptied all places, and left miserable monuments euery where of their villanies, and made a discomfiture of all things, a great part of the prey was priuily turned another way, and thrust into holes and corners, and euery one heaped vp by stealth for himselfe, as much as their dennes could hold.
            
               This being knowne, and brought before Kett, and the other Gouernours (for so would they bee called) they being desirous aboue all to prouide against this inconuenience, by common consent they agreed, that some place should be chosen where they might sit to minister Iustice. Now there was an old Oke with great spred boughes, this they laid ouer with raftes and balkes acrosse, and made a roofe with boordes: where (for the most part) the people standing round about, they determine and decree of complaints, and quarrels, (if any were done to any) as the cause required, and sometime they binde with straighter bands, the insolent and ouer-much greedy couetousnesse of some, by violent taking all away. This Oke was called the Oke of Reformation, whereunto at the firstThe Oke of Reformation. none came, but Kett, and the Gouernours: of the which some, and among these the Maior of the City especially, Aldrich, and others (of whom we spake before, against their wils appointed in this number) contended vehemently by all meanes possible (as much as was in them) to restraine the needy, and hungry cōmon people, from this importune liberty of rifling, and robbing. To the which end they went often vpon the Oke, and with their graue speeches perswaded that there might be at the length, if not an end, yet they would prouide some meanes against such rapine, and so generall violence in all excesse. There were besides also other graue Persons, and good Diuines, who endeuoured by all meanes possible, study and diligence, to reduce the tumultuous people (hauing now cast off all feare of Law) and glutting themselues in all villany, from robbery, and burning, wherewith they had confounded all things, vnto the consideration of peace. And these in the day preaching, and in the night watching armed in the City, omitted nothing that belonged vnto them as they were faithfull Ministers, or lay vpon them as they were good Subiects. At this time, among the rest, the wisedome, faithfulnesse, and integrity of D. Matthew Parker was notable, a worthy man, and euery way adorned with vertue, then Professor of Diuinity, at this day in the time of our most renowned Queene Elizabeth, Archbishop of Canterbury. Hee minding to doe the

office and duty of a good Pastor, seeing all places inuironed with the flames of fury, and mischiefe; did that which became a prudent, and behoued a resolute man. For in rebuking of wickednesse, he shewed himselfe stout and valiant, and in wary auoiding of perils, witty and carefull: so as hee performed the faith that he ought to God and the King, and diligently prouiding for himselfe, hee shewed that prouidence that is principally in wise men. But it came to passe one day, what time hee went with his friends into Ketts Campe, hee found Kett and other his Companions of that fellowship, standingKetts request. vnder the Oke, communing of matters betweene themselues. At which time the notable courage of the Maior M. Codde
               The courage and fidelity of the Maior. appeared, and his worthy voice was plainely heard, beseeming a valiant man. For when Kett, the Captayne of this conspiracy, was earnest with him to deliuer the keyes of the City, and all his authority, and to resigne his gouernement into his hands, Codde stoutly answered, he would first giue his bloud, and life out of his body, before he would by villany trecherously leaue the City, or cast off wickedly through feare and cowardise, his allegeance to the King. The matter thus debated on both sides, and night drawing on, Matthew seeing the miserable cōmon people drowned in drinke, and excesse, thought that sober and wholsome cōmunication would little profit drunkards, ouer-charged with meat and drinke, and strooken with the heate of the weather and sunne, therefore thought good to say nothing vnto them that day. Wherefore leauing all things as he found them full of fury, and tumults, hee departeth into the Citie. The next day early, which was Friday, he returneth againe into the Campe with his brother Tho. Parker, (which was after Maior of Norwich) where (it is lamentable to tell) he found them all vnder the Oke, hearing prayers, and in the middest of them one Thomas the Vicar of S. Martins at the Palace, reading the Letanie. Matthew hauingMatthew Parkers Sermon. gotten this oportunity to teach, went vpon the Oke, and there made a Sermon full of wisedome, modestie, and grauitie. All his Sermon was chiefly diuided into three parts.
            In the first he wisely admonisheth them, that those things

which for their sustentation they had brought into the Campe being consumed, and spent, they would not spoyle wickedly the fruits of the earth, and the gifts of God.
            Next, that they should not defile their hands with bloud, following priuate, and secret displeasures, rashly carryed with a desire of reuenge, neither to punish them with imprisonment and bands, whom they held as Enemies: or take away any mans life wickedly, or cruelly.
            Lastly, in regard of common profit to surcease from these enterprises, and not distrust the Kings Herald, or Messenger: but to giue vnto the King due honour, euen in his yong and tender age; whereby they might vse him hereafter, when hee came to more ripe and flourishing estate, (the valour and prowesse of his Ancestors being confirmed in him, and, as it were deepe rooted) with incredible delight and pleasure.
            When in this place hee had inforced all the strength of his speech, and all the company had heard him attentiuely and willingly, standing round about him while hee preached: at the voyce of one wretch of the basest of the people, they began to cry out, one by one tumultuously; How long (saith he) shall
               A Tumultuous wretch. 
               we suffer this hireling Doctor, which (procured for his hire by the Gentlemen) is come hither bringing words of sale, and a tongue bound with rewards? but we will cast a bridle vpon their intolerable power, and will hold them bound with the cords of our Law, spite of their hearts.
            
            Then the common people began to murmur, and openly to rage, and many, stirred vp with the speech of this Varlet, vrged the matter with more bitter words and threats, yea, and fearefull speeches of some, were heard, and dangerous, which came also to his owne eares. Some of them cried out fiercely▪ 
               It were good that hee which hath spoken so well, and hath powdred his Sermon with such eloquent words and sentences, were compelled to come downe, being shot through with pikes and arrowes. Wherevpon a great feare came vpon this good man at that time, and vnto this feare was added the terrour of another euill suspected:Conceite is strong. for hee himselfe felt vnder his feet the points of the speares, and Iauelings, and was in great doubt, lest hee should

be thrust thorow of the raging multitude. Neuerthelesse, it was afterward perceiued, that there was no such cause of feare: for all that were vnder the tree (for the most part) had Matthew in great reputation, and imbraced him with all loue and kindnesse, and were greatly glad of his comming thither. For they hoped it would haue come to passe, that the people being strooken in conscience with his words, and made more tractable, or afraid of their wickednesse and villany, would repent of their doing, or at the least, remit somewhat of their wonted furie and crueltie; and by this meanes, all that were present against their willes, might obtaine more libertie. Howsoeuer it was, he was exceedingly afraid, and seemed to be in great danger.
            At what time on the sudden came Thomas, of whom wee spake before, Vicar of S. Martins, hauing gotten two or three Musicions vnto him, who began to sing, Te Deum, in English, with solemne Musicke, and distinct notes, elegantly set for the delight of the eare: by the sweetnesse of which Song, they being rauished (for they were vnwonted to Musicke) their cruell and raging minds (bewitched with these vnaccustomed delights) by little and little were appeased.
            
               Matthew hauing gotten this opportunitie, thought it not good to tarrie, while either these had made an end of their Song, or the other should begin a new to rage; therefore comming downe from the Oke with his brother (as hee could get out) he went from the Campe. And as they were going downe Saint Leonards Hill, toward Pockethorpe Gates, they came vpon him, and other ministers of that societie, following him with tumultuous clamours, which contended with him chiefelyRebels desirous of the great Scale. for the great seale, whereby he had licence to preach.
            
               Matthew therefore perceiuing, that all were infected with this villanie, as it were, running headlong with deadly furie and madnes, being wearied with such tumults, and lamenting the euils of his Countrie, escaping priuily what way hee could, leaueth his brother Thomas Parker behind him, to reason with them of the matters, and by this meanes, withdrew himselfe from their furie.
            
               The next day after, Matthew Parker going into Saint Clements Church, from one of the Lessons appointed to be read, taketh vp the cause againe, to speak some thing of these pernicious tumults; many of the Conspirators standing round about him, at what time they said nothing: but waiting his comming out of the Church, full of rage they stood round about him, and being come out, they followed him presently, saying; They vnderstood he had three or foure good and able Geldings, which might serue the King; therefore they willed him, that immediatly after dinner they should bee readie, for they were to vse them presently. Hereunto Matthew answered little or nothing, but called vnto him speedily a Smith, and taking the shooes off the feet of some of them, he caused them to be pared to the quicke. The other he willed to bee anointed with greene Coperasse all ouer, as though they had been tired with ouermuch trauell, and dressed with medicine. The Rebels supposing the matter to be euen so indeed (for anon after,The Rebels deceiued. as they were led to pasture, seeing some swadled about the feete, and other anointed with greene medicine) they left off their purpose. Mathew not long after going out at the gates, as it were, to walke about two miles from the Citie, had his horse brought him to Kringelford bridge, where hee tooke their barks, and began his iourney towards Cambridge. But in the way, what he saw, what he heard, what furies and villanies by the seditious (which met him in his iourney) hee beheld, to speake of all, were an infinite labour. Neuerthelesse, by the goodnesse of God (when hee had escaped all these garboyles, and popular hurliburlies) at the length, being free from so great dangers, he came safe to Cambridge.
            The speech therefore of this worthy man (as an Oracle from heauen) was after this manner wickedly neglected and despised of most vile and beastly persons, forsaken not onely of all health, but of all hope; which, although at that time, blind and headlong through fury and madnes (as deadly, and to so great meanes of recouering their libertie, an enemie and dangerous) they despised and refused, yet without all doubt, from the most dolefull chances which insued, the horrour

of Gods vengeance possessed all their soules. For (as we said before) hee was the minister of this heauenly voyce, that quenching as it were, so great a fire of mischiefe in their mindes, they would speedily repent: lest the impiety of Treason, spreading further, should at length become lamentable to their Countrey, and in the end sorrowfull, and deadly to themselues: for all things that were diuinely, and wittily spoken by him (as though they had beene fitted by destiny to the people of Norfolke) came to passe: And the Rebels falling from one villanie to another, receiued at the last condigne punishment for their so great furies.
            In the meane time, the Rebels (of whom we spake before) thirsting after the goods, and fortunes of Great men, had filled all places with robbery & theft. Being now satiate and glutted with the spoyles, they turned at length from the desire of the prey, to violence and cruelty; going through all the Country of Norfolke, threatning terrour and perill to all that would not stand on their part. And now the worshipfull, and Gentlemen (in all places whithersoeuer their rage carryed them) being taken and brought into the Castle, it caused such a generall feare vpon all men; that many forsaking house, and inheritance, and changing their apparel, lest being perceiued in their flight & iourney, they might be knowne, escaped by obscure & by-pathes: and fearing all extremity from the Enemy, hid themselues in Caues of the earth, and thicke woods.

And vnto these was commanded (that bestowing their labour and bearing their owne charges) they should carry corne and victuall to the Campe at Moushold. To whom, except they presently obeyed, was threatned the destruction of their houses and fields, and violence to their wiues and children. Moreouer what worshipfull persons and Gentlemen soeuer they tooke (and they tooke many) them they bound surely with cords, as though in all villanie they had exceeded themselues. Many were deliuered to be kept in Norwich, and some committed to the prison, commonly called the Guild Hall, others

to the Castle. Some shut vp in the Earle of Surryes house, as theeues and felons: Yea heereunto it came▪ that if at any time they wanted money (which they wanted often) they compelledThe City treasury forced to ayde the Rebels. the Maior of the City, out of the common treasure, alwayes to supply their necessity. Whose importune demands, if the Maior had denied, without all doubt, they had emptied the treasury, and set the house on fire, and brought a miserable plague and destruction vpon all mens goods. And surely they often entred wicked counsell for the rifling of the City; and the thing had beene done vndoubtedly, if by the industry and diligence of the Maior, they had not beene alwayes put by their hope, and indeuour. Notwithstanding many Gunnes, and much Artillery, and instruments of warre, whatsoeuer could bee found in the City, they tooke and carryed away (fearing lest any thing might happen heereafter at any time against them) and carryed them into the Campe, charging moreouer all the Citizens, they should bee ready atThe Rebels pretence. the first call to defend and helpe them, if neede require: Crying out, that they were the Kings friends, and being vniustly oppressed, had taken vpon them the defence of the Lawes, and of the Kings Maiesty. And not contented with this, they abused the Kings name to serue their villanie, and wretchednesse. Moreouer there were certaine Commissions sent from the Kings Maiesty, giuing authority vnto diuers worshipfull, and Gentlemen, whose names were inserted in the Commissions, with commandement carefully to preuent the dangers that might insue to the Common-wealth, and to prouide that these sturres and commotions might be repressed in the beginning. When they had gotten these letters, putting out the names of the men of Worship, they caused their owne names to be written in, and pulling off the Kings Seales, set them to fo

               gedA trecherous forgery. Commissions of their owne, and setting them vp in open places, abused the ignorant people that knew not this great deceite. And now they were come to such rage and madnesse, as the fury and force of so great tumults, could not be restrained neither by the gouernours, nor yet by Kett himselfe, the arch and chiefe Rebel.
            
               Moreouer, they held them for enemies (not onely) which refused to ioyne with them in their villanies, but many good Citizens (which to saue themselues fled out of the City, with their wiues and children) they accounted enemies: Who being driuen out of their houses, through the feare of so great danger (when they durst remaine no longer any where) wandered heere and there, separated and dispersed, by the meanes of this generall rage and violence: And with exceeding lamentation, and many teares bewayled the iniquity of those times, & the miserable condition of their Countrey. Moreouer, they threaten the City with fire and burning, insomuch as they which remained in it, looked for nothing else but the ouerthrow and ruine of all things. In the Campe was an horrible and lamentable fate of things; for when there met together a great multitude of theeues and bankrouts, from all parts of England, whome the hope of prey, and desire of ease calledIdlenesse the mother of mischief. from their daily labour, and tilling of the ground: such monsters of mischiefe were conceiued, and such vnlawfull lusts in all kinde of daliance, that my tongue abhorreth, and is ashamed to tell.
            This also is most euident, that as they had brought an vnspeakeable waste, and desolation vpon all fields and houses on euery side, so whatsoeuer was brought into the Campe, was quickly spent in most gluttonous manner, surfetting and reuelling: Insomuch as it seemeth almost incredible, how so much prouision could be deuoured in so short a time. For besides Swannes, Geese, Hennes, Ducks, and all kind of fowles3000. Bullocks and 20000. Sheep spent in few daies without number, about three thousand Bullocks, and twenty thousand Sheepe, were royotously spent in the Campe within few dayes. Besides paled parkes, and hedged (wherein Deere were kept) were pulled downe and laide open, and what Deere soeuer they could any way come by, them they violently tooke and carried away. Nothing was shut vp to their lust, no regard had of future times, no foresight of the euils that might ensue, no measure of wickednesse and wasting, but

euery where, as they sold openly a Wether for a groat, the head and purtenance, as contemptible and vile meat, were cast away, because there was none in the aboundance of more dainties that would eate them. What should I remember the spoyling of Groues and Woods, which were almost vtterly rooted vp, and cut downe by the ground? all which, as much as could be cut, they burned, or which is more vile, they consumed in building their dennes and lodgings. Moreouer, there is added to this so terrible licenciousnesse (the companion for the mostWretched cruelty. part of such practices) cruelty. For these filthy beasts, and of all people, the vilest, laide chaines vpon the most honest and harmelesse men, and manicles and fetters vpon many, wherewith they coupled them, two and two together, and made them indure long the most bitter torture, and butchery of the Gaole.
            Moreouer, they appoint to euery of the gates, and entrance into the City, Porters, that none should issue out, and command the Constables of the Wards, to see that none went out of the City. And a great company of rude Countrymen were gathered together; who were appointed to watch and ward in certaine places: these men were prouided for by the Constables, to the satisfying of their desire, insomuch as many honest men, consuming their stocks in so great and wastfull expences, became vtterly impouerished for euer. And the hatred conceiued against all in generall, that, most cruelly they vttered vpon those that they could come by.
            There was at that time one Wharton (a man of great courage,Wharton hardly carried aliue to prison. but not fauoured of the people) he being led towards the City to the Castle, bound with cords as a thiefe, a great companie of Rebels went round about him to defend him, lest hee should haue beene slaine in the way by the vnruly multitude. But neither his good behauiour towards them, nor honest promise, neither the diligent care of the Rebels appointed to guarde him, were sufficient to defend him, who escaped hardly that he was not murthered: for many attempted his death and spoile, his body also in many places was stabbed in with the points of their Speares, and Pikes.
            
               Moreouer, it hapned about the time that this was done, that the Rebels were going towards the City, & haling one of Molton as prisoner, against whom they burned with most cruell hatred; because he was alwayes a subtill fellow, and a man set to sale for mony (for he was a Lawyer) and as men thought of a reuenging minde, and one that vsed to raise vp Spirits, with fearefull signes, & superstitious wonders. While therefore (as is said before) this man of Molton was drawne out of a wood (by the bewraying of a certaine woman) where he had hid himselfe a little before among thornes and b

               yers, for lack of better prouision, him they haled with them with all reproch and contumely, the heauens thundering horribly (notA horrible thunder, rayne with hayle. without the great astonishment of them that heard it) also mighty showres fell, mixt with haile, which couered the earth, and was very deepe, not farre from the Oke, called the Oke of Reformation. But this fearfull Tempest, as a signe from heauen, was so farre from appalling, or terrifying them, that, as if they had beene stirred vp by a heauenly voice, they are more fierce to all kinde of villanie, and more incensed then before. AndThe Gentlemen in great danger. with no lesse Tempest were the mindes of the worshipfull Gentlemen, whom the Clownes (with notable cruelty, and detestable fury, raging, vniustly held in bands) afflicted.
            All which either feared death euery day (whereof some surely are reported to haue felt) most vndeserued; or else more grieuous torture then death it selfe: and whatsoeuer else might be deuised by these filthy Robbers. For certaine of them (as if they had committed some notable villanie) were summoned before the company of these desperate Persons, as vnto iudgement; and being set before the Oke, as at the Barre, were compelledKetts triall of prisoners. to pleade their cause out of chaines: and when the ignorant and rude multitude were asked what they would haue done with them; all as with one mouth cryed out: Let them be hanged, Let them be hanged. And when the Gentlemen inquired againe of them, why they should vse such cruell speeches, especially against them whom they knew not, and were guilty of no crime: they fiercely answered; Such wordes of othersA Rebels reason. were vsed towards them, and therefore they would vse

the same againe to them; and had nothing else to obiect. Though there were others that gaue this a reason of their cruel sentence, that they were Gentlemen, and therefore to be taken out of the way: for they knew well, if once they might get the Victorie, they should indure at their hands all kinde of torment, and cruelty. And therefore it were better their liues should bee taken away, whom now they had in bands (so should they enioy their ease, and security) then to giue vnto them the vse thereof, (if it were but one houre) of whom anon after they might be slaine as sheepe. So enuyed, at this time,Hatred of the Gentry. and hated, was the name of a man of Worship, or Gentleman, as the basest of the people, burning with more then hostile hatred, desired to extinguish, and vtterly cut off, not only the Gentry themselues, but if it were possible, all the off-spring and hope of them.
            In this sort, when all the Countrey of Norfolke in a māner was shaken and beaten with the bloudy tempests of these dangerous tumults, and now almost twenty dayes had passed from the beginning, and nothing in the meane season any where done, but wasting, burning▪ robbing, and all things not only miserable to behold, but horrible and fearefull to heare: so great griefe had now possessed all good men, and especially the Citizens of Norwich: as at the sight of this lamentable fate of their Countrey, they were almost, with continuall sorrow, and teares, consumed. To resist so great an inconuenience they could not, by reason of so great multitude of desperate persons which now were gathered together from all parts, into the Campe. And that which is more, to take vp Armes without the commandement of the King, was forbidden by Law, as is aforesaid. And because nothing as yet was heard from the Kings Councell, fearing daily the destructions, and fireing of the City, all hope of safety for the most part being taken away, and being destitute of all counsell, they remaine within the walles of the City.
            There was at that time by chance at London, one Leonard
               Sutterton at London. 
               Sutterton, a Citizen of Norwich, which fled thither for the safety of his life, as out of the common flame, and burning.

The Kings Councell sent for him, to enquire and finde out all the purposes and intents of the Rebels. Sutterton declareth that which he knoweth: namely, that a great multitude of vngodly persons were gathered together, as mighty waters, that these brought calamity and a lamentable plague vpon all places where they came. That the number increaseth euery day, that no villanie can be thought of, which they haue not determined, that the best men are laid hold off, and led away bound with chaines, houses rifled, fields wasted, Woods burnt and cut downe, all kind of beasts killed, through rage and fury, nothing left any where vntouched, but by a popular frenzie all things consumed. Also destruction and ruine hang ouer the City, except it bee very speedily preuented. Notwithstanding he hoped, yea, and he heard some secretly say, that there were many in the Campe, and in those dennes of wretched men, which if they had any hope of the Kings fauour, and that they might escape without punishment, would willingly cast off their weapons, and imbrace the Kings pardon. Therefore he besought, and earnestly, and most humbly intreated, that by publike proclamation, he would of his clemency grant pardon, and impunity to as many as would depart from that assembly, for so he supposeth those meetings will easily bee dissolued.
            His aduice and counsell being approued, by the authority and iudgement of the King, they appoint and decree; that it pleaseth the Kings Maiesty, to prouide a remedy in time for the distressed, and troubled Common-wealth: whereby shee may recouer her health againe, being once eased of those dangerous sturres, and hurts of sedition, whereinto the plague of disloyaltie had now brought her. Notwithstanding, hee would try all meanes, before hee would cut off that which is corrupt, and contagious (lest he should bring a maine vpon the rest of the body.) Therefore hee decreed, that the punishment long due vnto there obstinacy, vnthriftinesse, vngratiousnesse, and sensuality, should bee deferred for a time, and hope of safety should be offered, if they would abstain

seueritie taken away; so as by clemencie and gentlenesse, they may be brought to peace, and a better mind.
            These things, after this manner, being consulted vpon, and decreed, this only remained; that this clemencie and fauour of the Kings Maiestie, might be made knowne without delay to the common people.
            To this end an Herald of Armes is sent post to Norwich,An Herald sent to Norwich. and for the more expedition, Leonard Sutturton is ioyned fellow with him. When he came to Norwich, from thence they goe presently into the Campe; where the Herald standing with his coate of Armes before the Oke with a loud voice, so as all that were round about him might heare, he said:

Although the manner of our Ancestors, and the dignitie of this Empire, and the Maiestie of the name of a King, seeme to require, that you which haue wickedly taken vpon you Armes against your Countrie, and haue cast your selues into open Conspiracie and Rebellion, being put to flight by sword and fire, should receiue due punishment for the wickednesse which ye haue committed: yet notwithstanding, so great is the kindnesse and clemencie of the Kings Maiestie; that those, whose heinous offence craueth for conding punishment, of his singular, and incredible fauour, hee will haue preserued with safetie. And therefore commandeth▪ that forthwith euery man cast off his armour; that they forsake the Campe, and this Denne of theeues; and euery one to depart to his owne house. And if you haue done this thing being deceiued, ye haue your pardon, and warrant of impunitie, of all the euils yee haue done: but if yee shall remaine in your former mind, and purpose of wickednesse, he will surely reuenge all the hurts and villanies that you haue done, as is meet, and with all seueritie of punishment. Neither will he suffer any longer remaine, to the ouerthrow of the whole kingdome, the things that are to be cut off, and cannot be healed.
                     
                  
               
            
            When he had thus proclaimed with a loud voice (as is said before) almost all the multitude cried, God saue the Kings Maiestie.
               
Which crie, when they renewed againe, many kneeled downe on their knees, commending with teares this kindnes and clemency of the King, seldome heard of, which no doubt, al would haue imbraced, as those, whose minds began by little and little, with shame and feare, to be ouercome and mollified, had not the most wretched speeches of some, and the most perfidious perswasions of Ket himselfe, turned them from the studie of peace, and drawne them backe againe to consent to their wickednesse. For Kett very fiercely and stoutly answered: Kings are wont to pardon wicked persons, not innocent and

               iust men; they, for their part, had deserued nothing, and were guiltie to themselues of no crime; and therefore despised such speeches as idle, and vnprofitable to their businesse. And so turning to his company, he desired them not to leaue him, nor to bee fainthearted, but remember with what conditions they boundVnholy League. themselues, either to other; and that he, for his part, was ready to bestow his life (if need were) for their safetie.
            When he had, in rage and furie, spoken these words, theKett pronounced Traytor.

Moreouer, cōmandeth Ioh. Petibone, the Maiors Sword-bearer, to arrest this cursed Caitife of an actiō of treason, against the King: but then they began a stur on euery side, this way, & that way striuing with no lesse stout, then dangerous contention. The Herald seeing the minds of the people so soone to fall away againe (whom before, through the denouncing of peace, he had somewhat mollified) and with Ketts words, as with spurres of furie, to bee stirred vp againe; and from the hope of health, which before they seemed to imbrace, to be intangled againe, in their former wickednesse and villany, departed from theMany forsake the Campe. Campe. Yet many, notwithstanding, followed him, and forsaking their former purpose, and casting off their weapons, betooke themselues to the Kings mercie. All these, with the Maior, and Thomas Aldrich, went into the Citie, and forthwith the Maior commanded the gates to be shut, especially Bishops Gates, because from thence directly (except speedily,

by this aduice they had beene preuented) the Rebels might breake into the City. Moreouer, all the Gentlemen, of whomGentlemen set at liberty, admitted to Counsell. we spake before, that were throwne into the Castle by Ketts company, were loosened from their bonds and imprisonment, and set at liberty, and were admitted into Counsell with the Maior, and his Brethren, and their aduice required which way best, the assault of the Enemie might be let and hindred. Againe, they deuised for the defence of the City, lest by the breaking in of the Rebels, and licentiousnesse of the Souldiers, all should goe to hauock. It was thought best in conclusion, that the City should be defended on euery side, the Gates & walles kept, watch and ward to be had, all enterance to be shut vp: whereby the meanes of transporting victuals, being cut off, and taken away on euery side, the mindes of the Rebels being strooken through want of victuall, and weary of the Warres, might faint at length.
            Of these things which they long time debated betweeneDelay breedeth danger. themselues, deliberating, and consulting, without Iudges, there came messengers vnto them from the Gates trembling, and bringing fearefull tidings: that many of the Citizens had bound themselues to the fellowship of this villany, and that some of them had let in many of Ketts Campe into the City. When this great and sudden danger, vnlooked for, came to passe, and the Rebels were now entred the City, all things immediately seemed to goe to ruine, & feare possessed the minds of all. Request was made therefore, (and it was easily obtaynedThe Gē

                  lemen shut vp in prison againe. of the Magistrates of the City) that the Gentlemen should bee shut vp in the Castle as before, lest peraduenture while they might be seen at liberty in the City, and free from bonds, wherewith of late they had beene holden, the mindes of the Rebels full of fury and rage, should by that occasion be stirred vp to murther, and bloudshed. Therefore they were all called for, and againe committed to close prison. Notwithstanding it was afterward vnderstood, that the enemies were gone againe out of the City into the Camp the same way they came. When this danger was ouer, the Maior and his Brethren, perceiuing the Conspirators to plot on euery side the death and

destruction of men and goods, they gaue themselues wholy to study for the preseruation of the Citie. Wherefore ten of the greatest peeces of Ordinance were planted against the enemiesOrdinance in the Castle ditch. in the ditch (called the Castle ditch) and well placed for the defence of the Citie, if any force and assault should bee made. Moreouer, they appoint watch and ward, especially in those places, where through tract of time, the walles were weake and decayed: Who were commanded forthwith to remayne in those places; that if any danger should happen from the enemy in the night, they might presently with stones▪ Pikes, and other prouision, bee driuen from the walles, and Gates of the City. The rest of the multitude were commanded, that all of them armed, should bee ready in the Market place, and crosse streets of the City, for euery occasion.
            And because it seemed that the Ordinance (whereof wee spake) placed in the Castle ditch, and ruines of the walles, did not much annoy the enemy, not bring any defence vnto the City: At the cōmandement of the Maior they were all brought into the plaine, & speedily bestowed in the Meddowes which lye to the lowest part of the City, and all the night followingA fearefull night. (for the most part) was spent in fearefull shot on both sides.
            The next day, the Rebels (perceiuing of all that tumult in the night, more feare then hurt to the Citie: because the bullets from their Ordinance, mounting ouer the City, had done no harme) brought all the Ordinance they had, from the Hill, into the Plaine, and planting them at the bottome of the Hill, beganne to assault the City afresh: but because soone after, the Campe beganne to be distressed for victuall, that they might more commodiously being prouision from the places neere adioyning, they agree to make truce with the Citizens for a time. Therefore they ordayne to this office as Ambassadours, one Iames Williams, and Rafe Sutton, beastly men, and of the common people of the City of Norwich the basest. These came presently from the Camp to the City Gates, with a Banner of Truce in their hands, and by the permission of the Citizens, were brought to the Maior and his Brethren, and are said to speake after this manner:

Therefore he would yeeld nothing vnto their uniust demands, neither was it lawfull for him, if he would, especially vnto them the vilest men that euer were borne. That they had committed so many, and such intolerable villanies, whereby they deserued, not only to be shut out of the Citie, but also (if it could be) raced out of the nature of mankinde. That they despised the Kings Maiestie, wasted the Countrey, destroyed the City of Norwich, almost on euery side had branded an euerlasting note of reproch for villany and treason vpon themselues and their posteritie, all places through force and cruelty polluted, troubled, vexed, and destroyed. Notwithstanding doe they intreat to be admitted into the Citie? to be Citizens? to be partakers of the benefits thereof, and diuine exercises? And doe they intreat at the last that their want might be supplyed? What? doe they not repent of the wickednesse whereto they haue vowed themselues? What? not so much as are ashamed? Verily I know not whether are more wicked they that haue done these things; or more shamelesse they that make request for them. Doe they hope of the Maior? And of the same Maior, whom of late they made to suffer the shame of imprisonment? Of this City which they wish ouerthrowne by the foundation? Of the people of Norwich, vpon whom they haue brought violence, and the danger of Warre on euery side? Corne and victuall, to be ministred vnto them (as meate to the furies?) What madnesse were this at length to see? Let them be packing therefore let them be packing, and tell Kett, that wicked Captaine of these outragious villanies, these things: The Citizens of Norwich will obey the Kings Maiesty, not Traytors to their Countrey, and most cruell beasts: And that hee esteemeth little of the dangers and feares, they intend against the

Citie. Let them breake in, destroy, cast downe, cut off, lay euen with the ground, and make spoile of all things: but let them know, that God is the rewarder, and the reuenger. And let them tremble at length in the conscience of so great wickednesse: for they shall, no doubt, ere long, be seuerely punished, which they haue iustly drawne vpon themselues by their furie and madnesse.
                     
                  
               
            
            These things with speed returned to Kett, and his companions in the Campe, being much mooued hereat; with a brainsicke rage (as wild furies) they came running downe the hill with a cruell and despitefull noise, crying out. And when they came neere the Gates, they practized with all their forces to breake into the Citie, but being driuen backe with pikes and arrowes, they left that enterprise. At that time all the Ordinance (as was said before) being placed in the meddowes beneath the Citie, was spent vpon the enemie: but for lacke of powder, and want of skill in the Gunners, to small or little purpose. Yet many being shot with arrowes were wounded; which when they fell thicke vpon the ground, the beardlesse boyes of the Countrie (whereof there were a great number) and others of the dregges of the people, men most filthy, gathered them vp, and carried them to the enemie: And the minds of them all were so inflamed, as the very naked, and vnarmed boyes (as though a certaine frenzie had bereaued them of the sense of vnderstanding) running about, prouoked our men with all reprochfull speeches. There was added also to their importune cursed words, an odious, & inhumane villany:A beastly villany. for (with reuerence to the Readers) one of these cursed boyes, putting downe his hose, and in derision, turning his bare buttocks to our men, with an horrible noise and out-cry, filling the aire (all men beholding him) did that, which a chast tongue shameth to speake, much more a sober man to write: but being shot thorow the buttocks, one gaue him, as was meete, the punishment he deserued. It is reported also, that some hauing the arrowes sticking fast in their bodies (a thing fearefull toA fearefull and desperate crueltie. tell) drawing them out of the greene wounds, with their owne hands, gaue them (as they were dropping with bloud) to the

Rebels that were about them, whereby yet at the least, they might bee turned vpon vs againe: so great a desire was there almost in all ages of spoiling, and so great a thirst of shedding bloud.
            In the meane season, when on the other side of the Citie, a fearefull crie began; To your weapon, To your weapon; Citizens,
               The enemies policy. 
               if ye be men, to your weapon, the enemies are entred the Citie: and all men on the sudden ran thither, as is the manner of men in feare, where especially the greatest tumult and noise is heard. The Rebels beholding these things from the hill, and perceiuing the Citizens thinne vpon the walles, and before the Gates of the Citie, resolued presently to enter the Citie where it was void of defence. There the boyes (of whom wee spake before) and a great company of Country Clownes, did hazard a thing not only marueilous to see, but incredible to heare. For the vnarmed multitude, and others, part with Clubbes and Swords, others with Speares, Staues and Iauelins, (as chance could arme euery man on the sudden) cast themselues headlong into the Riuer that cōpasseth the Citie, at the Bridge, called Bishops Gates Bridge. Who, without feare, swimming ouer, and flying to the Gates with out-cries, and most tumultuous noise, strooke such a terrour in the minds of all men, as there was none almost, which thought not that day, the day of doome, both to their Citie, and to themselues. Therefore all for the most part (being afraid and discomfited) fled, and as euery man could find the way to his house, and the secret places thereof, they creepe in, leauing the Citie vndefended. But the Rebels, pulling off the barres of the Gates; whatsoeuer Ordinance, or instruments of warre they found in the Citie, they carried with them into the Campe. There when some of our friends among them vpon the miserable sight of these things, were strooken with sorrow and compassion, and with lamentable voice, and waterie eyes, prayed God to turne these calamities from the Citie: The Boyes and Country Clownes, which stood round about, mocked them, calling them traitors, and in most vile maner they were vexed, and grieued, with cursings and reuilings. But the Gates after this sort set open (as

was said before) when all things were disordered through the boldnesse, and violence of the Rebels (for they came to and fro out of the Campe into the City.) The Herald (for as yet he was in the City, neither was the last day appointed by the King (for the multitude to lay downe their weapons) yet past) came with the Maior into the market place, accompanied with a great number of Citizens.
            There againe in the Kings name, hee commandeth them toPardon offered again. put off their armour, to leaue the Campe, euery one to depart home to his owne house, and to vse reuerently and humbly the Kings mercy and clemency. If they would so doe; then they should be safe, and free from all punishment. Otherwise, there is nothing to be looked for; but grieuous torments, bitter death, and all extremity. When hee had made an end of speaking, the Rebels cryed out very arrogantly and fiercely,Pardon refused. saying; Let him depart with a pestilence, and on the deuils name, with his idle promises: He was mad, that infusing such flattering speeches into their eares, did beleeue that they being bewitched with such intising words, would bee oppressed, and circumuented in the end. They detested such mercy, and vtterly defied it; as which in apparant offering a slender and vaine hope of impunity, would cut off treacherously all safety.
            The Herald perceiuing now all of them giuen ouer, and (as it were) bondslaues to fury and villanie; and that they could neither by the feare of punishment, nor hope of impunity be brought from their intended wickednesse: without anything done presently, leaueth the City, and returneth to the Court. Soone after whose departure, the Rebels commanded Leonard
               Leonard Sutterton sought. 
               Sutterton to bee brought before them, that so they might lay him in chaines: because hee had beene companion with the Herald in his iourney. But Sutterton vnderstanding the matter: fearing also lest the mad, and turbulent people, burning towards him with malice (as they did towards all good men) might deale cruelly with him, hid himselfe priuily in the City amongst his friends and kindred.The Maior put in prison.
            
            Then Kett tooke the Maior, Robert Watson, William Rogers,
               
               Iohn Homersone, William Brampton, and many others, and commanded them to bee brought out of the City into the Campe, and so to prison, where chaines were put vpon them all, and they were shut vp in Mount Surrey, and there remained prisoners, and in irons, vntill the last day of this conspiracy; at the length some of them were set at liberty, others cruelly slaine.
            While these and the like were tumultuously done in theKett distressed maketh the worst choise Campe; Kett perceiuing the matter was come to this passe, that he must of necessity, either haue a bloudy victory against his Countrey, or else shortly receiue an end worthy his deseruing, thought it best for his affaires, if hee could draw a huge multitude together, for the increase of his Army. Wherefore he allured by rewards, and faire promises, all fugitiues on euery side, as many as could be gathered together, and men that had nothing to take to, and were without hope of any thing, to ioyne themselues to the fellowship of this cursed company. Whereupon, it is incredible to tell, how great, and almost innumerable multitudes of gracelesse persons, on the sodaine were assembled.
            But the Citizens tooke it grieuously, that their Maior, aThe Citizens carefull of their Maior. worthy and vpright man, should bee holden bound of wretched murtherers, and as it now seemed, thirsty of bloud: moreouer in bonds should sustaine the contumely, and shame of the prison: fearing also lest in the end hee might bee slaine by violence: because some of them threatned him many grieuous things: others scurrilously and scoffing, iested at the good mans name, and that dangerously, as pretending death vnto him after a sort. For being called Codde, by name, and there is a fish of the Sea called after the same manner (in Latine called Capite) in contempt of the worthy Maiors name, and to his no little danger, one varlet ministring occasionThe Maior in great danger. vnto another of laughter and scoffing, they made an O, yes; and cryed, As many as would come to the Campe to morrow, should buy a Cods head for a penny. Herevpon the Citizens fearing lest the seditious should determine any thing grieuously against him: and being marueilously troubled in

minde, and carefull of the Maiors danger, hauing deserued so well of them; they came vnto Thomas Aldrich, complaining one by one, of this importunate boldnesse, and vnbridled violence. This Aldrich (as wee said before) was a man beloued of all men; and ruled with such wisedome, grauity▪ and modesty (for he was a man of a fine and sharpe wit) that euen his name was fearefull to the most barbarous enemie. For, when al men loued him exceedingly, maruailing at his singular courtesie and modesty, in as much as among the chiefe of the Rebels, he had that command in short time, as neither his aduice, nor enterprises were at any time in vaine. Therefore, much of the goods that were taken away of the Rebels by violence, through his industry were restored again to the owners, & many pestilent attempts of the seditious, by his prouidence & diligence were restrained. When therfore he vnderstood in howAldrichs speech to Kett, for the Maiors liberty. great danger the safety of the life of the Maior was: being moued with the indignity of the thing, hee went to Kett into the Campe, and willeth him to set at liberty, and out of bonds, the Maior of the City. Hereunto, when Kett, as it were perplexed in minde, said nothing, Aldrich cryed with a loud voyce, Art thou not ashamed, wretched Traytour, to hold in prison and irons, I say, not alone an harmelesse man, but a Maior, which is the Kings Maiesties most faithfull Lieutenant? Art thou so fierce and cruell, that when through ryot and excesse, thou hast wasted the goods and commodities of all men, thou canst now not bee satisfied, nor filled, except thou mayest drinke vp at last also the bloud of innocent persons? Therefore thou the wretchedst man the earth beareth, command him forthwith to bee brought out of prison.
            
            These words, as flashes of lightning, sharpely bent against Kett (whether it were for the reuerence of the man that spake, or which is most like, of a conscience of his wickednesse) strooke such a feare and terrour in him, as the thing which others could not obtaine with intreaty and all perswasion, he brought to passe with threats and grauity of speech. By whose wisdome, the Maior hauing obtained his liberty, although he could not altogether auoid al the storms of that turbulēt time:

yet he escaped happily both the grieuousnes of imprisonment, and danger of his life. Wherefore, hauing liberty to goe all about in the City, his care and diligence was a great comfort to many of the Citizens afterward, against those euils which at that time oppressed the City. And for as much as he could not sit continually in the gouernment of the City, because (for the most part) hee was constrained to abide in the enemies Campe, he deputed one Augustine Steward in his roome, to take the charge of desending, and gouerning the City in his absence. Who taking vnto him, Henry Bacon, and Iohn Atkinson, then Sheriues of Norwich: ruled the City carefully, and kept all the Citizens easily in order (except the vnruly) whō no good order could command. But here must needs be remembred, what seuere, and sowre Iudges, the seditious were vpon them; whom hauing in prison and bonds, they afflicted with all opprobry, and shame: whose cruelty and wickednesse was so great, as those, whom they had first oppressed with vnspeakeable villany, and seldome heard of, them (at the length vexed, and afflicted with extreme miseries) they deliuered to the mad multitude to be slaine. For a day was appointed, when they that were in hold, should be brought forth openly as malefactours,The order of trying innocent men. that (after a preposterous manner of Iudgement) a quest might passe on them. Then Kett openly, all men beholding him, went vpon the Oake (which they called the Oake of Reformation) and there fate downe: euery one of the prisoners in order were called by their names: then his manner was to inquire of his fauorites, and companions in that villanie, what they thought of them. The furious varlets being made Inquisitors, and Iudges of the liues of innocent men; if they found nothing of the man in question, cryed out, A good man, bee is a good man; and therefore ought to bee set at liberty. But if by the least suspicion of any small crime, his fame that was named, was but once touched; or if any thing (though the least) were found wherein perhaps he had offended any one of them: some one (of the people) answered; whose voyce the other of the common sort followed, as it were stirred vp of the furies; Let him bee hanged, Let him bee
               
               hanged: although they were vtterly ignorant of the man in question, whether white or black, old or yong (as one whose name was neuer heard of before) yet after this manner they were alwayes wont to cry out.
            And in this manner these pestilent Traytors, not led by iudgement or reason (lest they should be vnlike themselues) but led by a certayne blinde and headlong rage of the minde, (as by a mighty Tempest) oftentimes with a word, and as it were with a madde nod of their furies, they inflicted most cruell punishment vpon innocent and iust men. And surely so great was the strength of the disease, and as it were corruption that possessed the mindes of them all: as being almost without sense, and through the crueltie of so great villany hardened; they violated all Lawes of God and Man, with their great fury and boldnesse.
            Not many dayes after, by the commandement of the King, authority was giuen vnto William Pari Marquesse of Northhampton, to leuy an Armie of men, with commandement to goe in all haste to the City of Norwich, and there to doe his indeuour: that because these so great furies could not by clemency and lenity be appeased, to pursue with fire and sword, Kett and his Confederates, as Traytors and most cruell Enemies to his Maiestie. Northampton, all things prepared andNorthamptons Army. 1500. made ready to his liking, with fifteene hundred Souldiers (as was commanded) goeth shortly after towards Norwich. There were with him in his Armie two Lords, Sheffield andLords. Knights. 
               Wentworth▪
                besides, Anthony Denny, Richard Southwel, Ralph Sadler, Iohn Gates, Thomas Paston, Henry Beding field, Iohn Suliard, William Wilgraue, Iohn Cuttze, Thomas Cornwallies, all Knights: to these of Esquires & Gentlemen aswell of EnglandGētlemen. as of Italy a worthy traine. When they were now but a mile from the City, the Marquesse of Northampton sent presently an Herald, which (as the manner is) should denounce Warre to the City, except they would presently obey. By whom al things which are accustomed to be done (being proclaymed and performed in the City) Augustine Steward the Maiors Deputy sendeth speedily Messengers, to signifie vnto

               Codde the Maior (who was, as we said before, most against his will detayned in the Campe) what commandements were imposed vpon the City in the Kings name by the Marquesse of Northampton. Hereunto speedily answere from the MaiorThe Maiors answere. was returned to the Herald: That neuer any thing happened more grieuous vnto him al his life time, then these euils, which brought in of most seditious persons, haue almost ouer-turned with an implacable villany his Country and City of Norwich, flourishing before. That (asmuch as by mans reason could be foreseene) hee had vsed all diligence that these tumults might haue been restrayned at the beginning: yet could he not bring to that passe, by reason of the rage of the mischiefes, wherewith the mindes of all were holden intangled. That he had indured the terror of imprisonment, the perill of death, finally all extremity at their hands, and at this time was holden in theThe Maior kept by a guard in the Campe. Campe, with a guard of Souldiers round about him. Otherwise he would come himselfe without delay (as was meet) to the Marquesse of Northampton. Neuerthelesse, that the City might be kept the better in order, he had giuen his authority of gouernement to Augustine Steward, a very carefull and wise man: lest, in his absence, the people through ignorance might fall away from their duty. That the City should be at his commandement, and himselfe (if Kett would permit) would willingly come out of the Campe and receiue him, and commit his owne, and the state of the City to his protection. This answere of the Maior was carryed with speede by the Herald to the Earle of Northampton. The Maiors Deputy, with the Sherifes, and a great multitude of Citizens following, went presently into the Armie of Northampton, vnto whom he deliuered the Sword (which is a signe of the Kings Maiesties presence, and of his Authority, and in the chiefe Cities of England is wont alwayes to bee carryed before the Maior) declaring as the Maior had done before, that hee could not come himselfe (which he most desired) but that he and the chiefe of the City were come to deliuer the City themselues, and all that they had, vnto the faith, and authority of the King: they confesse there are many of the Citizens which could not be terrified:

but that they would needes consent to the Rebels: but yet the greatest part of the best Citizens doe remayne still in their faith, and allegeance, and haue not ioyned themselues with the others, nor in any respect haue conspired against the Kings Maiestie: and that this part is ready, and willing to doe that which shall be inioyned them and most willing to receiue him and his Armie into the City. Northampton againe incouraged the hearts of the Citizens with good words, and promised he would haue care of the City, and had good hope▪ that ere long these great furies, wherewith now almost all things were set on fire, should be suppressed. When he had made an end of speaking, he deliuered the Sword to M. Southwel, who carryed the same bare-headed before the Marquesse into the City. This honor by an old and soiemne custome, is giuen alwayes to the Kings Lieutenants. And comming in at Saint Stephens Gate, he gaue commandement that all the Citizens should come vnto him into the Market place. There they long consulted, and many things of many were deuised, aswell for the defence of the City, as for restrayning the assault of the Enemie.
            Then were appointed Watch and Ward vpon the Walles and Citie Gates. And in all places, if any were thought too weake, were appointed armed men that might be ready vpon euery occasion.
            These things thus appointed and performed, Northampton went at night vnto the house of the Maiors Deputie, and supped there with his company of Nobles and Gentlemen: when supper was ended, although through the tediousnesse of the iourney, and heat of the weather, all in the house were weary, yet they rested that night in their Armour, lest they might be taken vnawares.
            And here it came to passe, whether by chance, or of set purpose, I cannot yet tell, that certaine Italians skirmished with a great company of the Rebels; and many wounds were giuen on both sides: but one of the Spaniards, while he went very boldly into the middest of the Rebels, being a valiant man, first, the multitude beset him round, at the length they tooke

him, and put him to a shamefull death: for taking away all his garments and furniture which were vpon him (very costly and cunningly wrought) they stripped him naked, and so hung him vpon an Oke in Mount Surry house, not without many reuilings, and shamefull contumelies before his death. All men surely tooke great griefe from so cruell, and miserable a death of such a worthy, and most noble Souldier; and would with a great summe of money willingly haue ransomed him (if it had been possible) from so cruell ignominie and shame. But from this mans calamitie now in the very beginning was easily perceiued, how great and detestable cruelty raigned in those, that had wickedly taken vp Armes against their Country: although not long after by the prouidence of God (for hee suffereth not the wicked to indure long, nor the shedding of innocent bloud alwaies to go vnreuenged) Cayme himselfe the AuthorCayme the author of this murther. of this dreadfull villany, with the same manner of death (though somewhat too late) receiued conding punishment of this so great crueltie.
            But the Earle of Northampton fearing the breaking in of the enemie in the night, commanded that the Porters and Watchmen (which before wee said were bestowed vpon the Walles and Gates of the Citie) should now more painefully and diligently (then commonly they were wont) walke round about the Citie. Whereby both their eyes and minds prepared, and attending vpon the enterprises of the enemie, if peraduenture any tumultuous rage should be raised in the night, might easily with their helpe, and without any great adoe be met withall, and resisted. Which surely was faithfully performed by the Captaines ouer hundreds. And all the other souldiers watched in the Market place, where gathering great heapes of wood together, they set them on fire, lest if any thing should happen on the sudden, our men being hindred, by reason of the darkenesse of the night, and ignorance of the place, might be inclosed vnawares, by the practices of the enemies.
            
               Edward Warner (one of the company of the Gentlemen) and at that time Gouernour ouer the souldiers (commonly called Marshall) gaue the Watchword. And vnto Thomas Paston, Iohn
               
               Clere, William Walgraue, Thomas Cornwallis, Henry Bedingfield: men of approoued valour and wisdome, diuers parts of the Citie were disposed for the defence thereof, which tooke their charge, and with all their indouour performed their parts valiantly, continually coursing from place to place, incouraging and animating our m

               n: sometime with their words, sometime with their countenance, sometime with their owne trauell and labour. And thus by their wise counsels they preuented the pestilent enterprises of the Rebels.
            All things now done to their liking, the Earle and all his company (they onely excepted, as was said before, to whom the care and defence of the Citie was committed) being wearied with three daies trauell, purposed now to take their rest. But when our men were in their sweete sleepe, and in the dead of the night, the Rebels, as if they should presently breake into the Citie, with a terrible peale of Ordinance, and most fearefull with out-cries, filled all places: Although by Gods prouidence it came to passe in this businesse, as the iron bullets discharged from the great Ordinance against the Citie, flying continually ouer our heads, did no great harme, whether it were by reason of the violent force of the powder mounting them, or the vnfaithfull hands of the Gunners, of set purpose leuelingSome think Ketts Gunners corrupted. somewhat higher then was requisite (for there bee some that thinke the Gunners were corrupted with money) for the nonst. Which things verily while they were done after this manner (though alwaies without hurt) yet they were very often done of these vile and importune robbers, which with their continuall rushings▪ and horrible ecchoes, brought such a terrour, as our watchmen on the Walles, and keepers of the Gates cried often, To your weapons; which while they did many times (for the enemie neuer left raging) the Earle (which gaue charge, that if the Rebels should tumultuously in the night attempt any thing against the Citie, he should haue knowledge, being awaked by one of the Captaines) came presently into the Market place, garded with his Nobles & Gentlemen that were with him. Afterward, the better to prouide for the fewnesse, and seldome returne of the souldiers, and that the Citie

might be the easier defended, they tooke this Counsell, that all the Gates that were on the other side of the City from the enemy, and the breaches of the walles should be blocked vp, supposing that so, neither the souldiers should be wanting to desend the Walles, if the Forces were drawne to a neerer straite, and the Enemy (without danger) might be driuen from enterance into the City.
            While matters began thus to bee ordered, and were almost brought to an end: The Rebels all at once, as a violent streame, came running from their dens with confused cries, and beastly howlings, and ran into the Citie. There some goe about to setA fearefull fight in the night. the Gates on fire, and to hew them downe: others clime vp vpon the Walles, some swim through the Riuer; many conuey themselues into the Citie by the lower places, and breaches of the old Walles. On the other side, our men begin to practise all meanes against them, and to resist with all violence, and repulsed valiantly the enemy on euery side, being already entred into the Citie, and manfully driue them backe (now comming, and flocking thither) and with Pikes, Arrowes, Swords, and other instruments of warre put them to flight, and brought the matter to that passe, as the force of their incursions by little and little being broken, and cut off, they began somewhat to wauer and doubt of the matter. But the fight was on both sides, with most inflamed minds (cruell, fierce and bloudie) while these by force (if by any other way) goe about to conuey themselues into the Citie, and our men indeuour to put them from all entrance. Therefore by the space almost of three howers, they fought with most deadly hatred betweene themselues, and the battell was performed more fiercely in diuers parts of the Citie, then a man would beleeue or thinke; euen with so dangerous, and dolefull an euent, as except the exceeding desire of our men to fight, and the worthy valour of Paston, Walgraue, and the rest of the Gentlemen, had remained inuincible; that night without doubt, had been vnto vs all the most miserable night that euer was. For the minds of the RebelsDesperate rage. were so set on fire, and incensed, and the desire to fight so exceeding, as, although they were fallen downe deadly wounded,

yet would they not giue ouer, but halfe dead, drowned in their owne, and other mens bloud, euen to the last gaspe, furiously withstood our men. Yea, many also strooken thorow the brests with swords, and the synewes of their thighes and hammes cut asunder (I tremble to rehearse it) yet creeping on their knees, were mooued with such hellish furie, as they wounded the buttocks and thighes of our souldiers, lying amongst the slaine almost without life. But our men perceiuing at the length the force of the enemie to abate and weaken, rushed vpon them with such violence, as they could no longer abide the fight, nor stand to resist: but their forces being ouerthrowne, and beaten downe on euery side, with a mightie slaughter, they were chaced, and driuen out of the Citie, (for three hundred fell in that fight) and betooke themselues againe300. Rebels slaine in fight. to their filthy dens and caues. The battell ended, few of our men were found dead, but many wounded. And now at the last, being secure from all practices of the enemy, the rest of that night that remained (and there remained but little) they gaue vnto their rest.
            In the Morning, assoone as it was day, certaine of the Citizens signified vnto the Earle of Northampton, that there were many of the Rebels in Ketts Campe, whose furie was greatly abated, and the heate of their rage quenched; these easily, and without any great adoe, might bee perswaded, that forsaking that cursed fellowship of desperate persons, they would suffer themselues to be drawne to the remembrance of their duties, and more wholsome counsell; for they were wearie of the wickednesse they had long committed: and there were now abiding at Pockthorpe Gates, foure or fiue thousand men, which waite for nothing else, and desire nothing more then peace and pardon. Which if now at the last might be offered vnto them by him, they hoped that forth with they would cast off their weapons, and commit themselues to the Kings fauor and mercie.
            The Earle from this message conceiued singular ioy and gladnesse, as one that had rather obtaine an easie and vnbloudie victorie, then (although they were Rebels, and

guiltie) a wofull, and imbrued with Ciuill bloud. Therefore he sendeth the Herald presently with a Trumpetter, commanding him to promise vpon the faith of the Kings Maiestie, that all shall escape without punishment that wil forsake their Armes. These comming speedily to Pockethorpe Gates, found none there notwithstanding: yet the Herald gaue a signe by a Trumpet. Whereat, when they came flocking (from the Campe) downe the hill: Hee be holding one Flotman, a fierce and cruell fellow (for hee as principall came downe the hill) with a loud voice, commanded him to stand. Who demanding what the matter was, and why they drew them to parlie by the sound of a Trumpet. The Herald answered:

            This most vile Traytor of all men liuing, had scarce made an ende of his fuiious speech, when on the sudden vnlooked for, a fearefull crie went through the Citie, and horrible speeches were heard of men afraid, crying, To your VVeapons, To your VVeapons, which filled euery mans eares in all places. For at this instant, while these things were thus in doing at Pockethorpe Gates, the Rebels stirred vp with a most desperate rage, and impudent boldnesse, were broken in at the Hospitall Meddowes; destroying, and wasting with Sword and Fire, as they went: But they were met withall speedily140. Rebels slaine. of our men, in the Plaine against the Bishop of Norwich

his Palace; and there was a long and hot skirmish, in which place about one hundred and fortie of the enemies were slaine, and some of our Souldiers, and many on both sides grieuously wounded.
            But the miserable death of the Lord Sheffield was lamented and pittyed of all men. Who (as it came to passe) while he was more mindfull of his birth and dignitie, then of his safetie, swift, and fierce, and desirous of performing the worke he had in hand, setting vpon the thickest of the Enemies, and fighting too boldly and carelesly, by chance in his swift course, fell from his horse headlong into a ditch, where this Noble man was most cruelly slaine of a villainous murderer.L. Sheffield slaine. And when hee besought him and his company (by all meanes possible, as by promising great rewards, by signifying his Nobilitie, and the account of his name) to spare his life: yet was it far off, that either the man, or his name, could moue any compassion, as they grew the more cruell. And after, theyTraytors without naturall affection. contended among themselues for the glorie and commendation of this villany (seldome heard of) as of a most noble act. So all of them boyled in minde, as it came almost to blowes, while on both sides the desire of commendation and vaineglorie carryed them, which seemed to bee due vnto him, that gaue that fatall and deadly wound vnto this worthy Noble man; but by the opinion of them all, Fulke carryed away the praise, which openly protested (calling God to witnesse) that he gaue him his deadly wound with his Clubbe. And Fulke himselfe not long after (by the iust iudgement of God) was payed home: a iust recompence for so great villany. But surely it cannot be told how much alwaies it auaileth on either side to the victorie, the death and ouerthrow of excellent Personages: for the enemy taking knowledge of this so lamentable chance, beganne to be more hostile and ready to make warre. But on the other side, the hearts of our men discouraged, beganne to languish. Insomuch as the Rebels puffed vp with exceeding ioy, making a mighty Alarme on euery side, as hauing alreadie gotten the victorie, rushed into the City (by what way they could get in) following vpon our men, and as

But the Citizens loden and ouer-whelmed with so many euils, when all places were now filled with Enemies, fearing violence and murther, and all hostilitie, which is accustomed to be done of EnemiesThe City in a miserable case. to Cities ouer-come, and all hope of redresse being taken away, fled out of the Citie. All mens hearts, for the most part, were smitten with so great feare, as many (through sorrow and anguish) hauing their minds alienated from the regard of their goods, left their wiues and children, and all their possessions, in the power of the Enemie. But many, when all mens conditions were lamentable, followed euery man his owne hope and aduice: for whatsoeuer gold, siluer, plate, or good household stuffe they possessed; that they hid in Priuies, Welles, and Pits digged in the ground. Sorrow and lamentation occupied the Citie on euery side. And the crying of Women and Children, mixed with the shouting of the Enemies, cracking of the fire, and fall of the houses, filled all places with an horrible noyse. For the Rebels, after the departure of the Earle ofRebels fire the City. Northampton, threw fire vpon the tops of the houses, which did flye from house to house with fearefull flame, and from one street to another, which in small time consumed a great part of the Citie. For all the houses in Holme-street were consumedHolmstreet & Hospital with diuers Gates burnt. with fire on both sides thereof. Also the Hospitall dedicated to the reliefe and maintenance of the poore diseased. Moreouer, Bish

Whereby the fire being speedily quenched, did not so generally preuaile as the Enemie wished. Moreouer, the Rebels entred the houses of the rich men in the Citie, and rifled them, and after

they had emptied them, set some of them on fire, and committed so great and sundry examples of cursed cruelty: as euery where it seemed at this time, not men indued with reason, were entred the City: but wilde beasts vnder the shape of men. Whence manifestly appeareth, how lamentable and miserable the state of the City was at thi

            The City therefore taken after this sort, by the conspirators, set on fire, spoyled and wasted, when desolation occupied all places euery where (except the enemies) for they that remained in the City, shutting their gates and doores hid themselues in the most secret places of their houses. The Maiors Deputy alone, as it were reserued to behold the miserable spectacle of his Counties downefall, void of all aduice and helpe, when he beheld, from the vpper part of his house, all things consumed with fire, and ruinated: supposing the enemies, as they had brought destruction vpon the houses, would not long after offer violence, and death vnto men, shutting his doores, kept himselfe within his house. But the power of the enemies, in the meane time waxing great, and gathering a band of men together: they broke into the City, at Saint Augustines gates, andAugustine Stewards house abused. all of them being armed with clubs, and such weapons as euery mans lotte could afford him: they came running vnto the house of the Maiors Deputie, and assayed to breake vp the doores: at length when they began to set them on fire, hee being greatly afraide (for all his seruants were fled from him) himselfe alone vnshut the gates: whom presently they tooke, and plucked off his gowne (which hee vsed at that time) calling

him Rebel; and threatning him a most shameful death, except he would tel them in what place the Earle of Northampton was hidden: when he answered, They were all departed.
            All of them tooke that answer, with great indignation and outcryes, most tumultuously rushing with all violence into his house, they searched furiously all the corners thereof. Afterward turning to the prey, they depart loaden with the spoyle. But many (being restrained partly by reason of money, and other things which they receiued of the Deputy: and partly by the speech of a certaine person, which said vnto them, such doings were intolerable: yea, theft and villanie; by all kind of punishment to be reuenged and repressed) brought againe their packes and burthens, which they had carryed away before, and laide them in the shops and warehouses. Neuerthelesse many of the Citizens, into whose houses the Rebels had entred, onely vnder pretence of seeking the Earle of Northampton, were vtterly robbed of all that euer they had. Chiefly they spoyled their houses, which were gone out of the City, proclaiming them Rebels, and open enemies to the Kings Maiesty; and therefore their goods to bee confiscate. Notwithstanding, some of the Citizens tooke order, there should be deliuered to the furious multitude, bread & drinke, and all kinde of victuall, whereby it came to passe, that the miserable and hungry people being pacified, they were somewhat stayed from the rage of spoyling. Neuerthelesse, very many (vpon this sodaine calamity) sustained great losse and iniury; and were so ouercharged with such great expenses, that euer after while they liued (and many liue at this day) in their houshold affaires, fared the worse. In the meane season, the remembrance of future times (as it seemed) came into the mindes of the Rebels. Wherefore being now turned from violence, they beginne to thinke of their owne safety: therefore they commanded the Maiors Deputy, and the chiefe of the City: that watch and ward should be kept from house to house, by the Citizens euery day at all the gates of the City, which if they shall refuse to doe, they threaten death and grieuous torments.
            
               Moreouer in the Temple (which is fearefull to tell) in theChrists Church abused of Rebels. Temple of the great God, the Rebels (as oft as it rained) placed the tents of their furies. And so farre grew their malapertnesse, boldnesse, and desire of ouerturning of things: as neither the speeches of the wise, nor the feare of Gods vengeance, nor the teares and lamentations of women, could remoue them from their villanies. For the women (when they saw theThe women intreate. slaughter of harmelesse naked men) oft times offered themselues in the streets; intreating them to haue compassion, vpon their Countrey, vpon them, their husbands and children, and remember that they were men themselues, begotten of men, and that they had reuenged themselues sufficiently vpon those, for whose cause they took vp Armes: that they would at last cast a bridle vpon their rage; so should they obtaine without doubt peace and pardon, and all good things else of the Kings Maiesty: but (as wee saide before) neither threatnings,Rebels inexorable. nor the counsell of the wise, nor flattering prayers, nor any thing else could restraine them from so great rage of villanie, vntill they had brought a miserable destruction vpon the Country, and drawne vpon themselues at last, an ende worthy such wickednesse. For the King, after hee vnderstood that his Maiesty was daily more and more despised, the company of lewd persons to increase, all things confounded with this execrable and raging tumult, the clemency of the King set at nought, and now no place left for mercy, soft medicines to auaile nothing at all, their mindes to be without cu

               e, and infected with deadly pestilence: Finally, all hope of recouery taken vtterly away: but onely that which consisted in force, and seuerity of punishment, hee thought good to put this first in execution.
            Wherfore in the Country of Lyncolne, & other shires of the Kings Kingdome, he commandeth, and appointeth a muster, and presse of Souldiers. Also a great number of Swyssers to be sent for, supposing (as the thing required) that this wicked rout, and their followers, ought to be vtterly taken away by the sword. Otherwise, if it should spread further, and infect the neighbour Countrey people, with the contagion of this villanie,

it could very hardly be stayed, when the heat of that infection had spred further, and fallen as it were, into the veynes and bowels of the Kingdome, and had inclosed all the parts thereof, with that deadly flame of disloyalty.
            Vnto this army was Iohn Dudley, Earle of Warwick, aEarle of Warwick appointed Lieutenant man of great Nobility, and marueilous courage, appointed Lieutenant, and vnto him the chiefe soueraignety is committed, by Letters and Commandements from the King. At that time the opinion (by the report of all men for the most part) was receiued among our Countreymen of him: that this Noble man was of such Magnanimity, and experience in Martiall affaires: as it was thought the Rebels should be suppressed by him, or else surely put to flight by none.
            Therefore these speeches of the Kings preparation and power being disperst abroade, and entring the eares of the common people, came at the length vnto the hearing of the Campe. And when they vnderstood of a surety that they were mustered, and a Captayne, Armour, Bands of men, and all instruments for the terror of Warre, prouided against them to bee readie, and at hand: they beganne euery day to fortifieThe Rebels fortifie. themselues, and to looke about for all things necessary, and to trayne themselues, that they might bee the more able to make resistance. So farre was it from them, that either reason could mitigate their crueltie and boldnesse, or terror breake their stout mindes.
            To this end, when some of the Citizens obserued that many things were done euery day more tumultuously, fearing all violence, slaughter, robberie, burning, and a lamentable ouer-throwing of all things: At the length (lest if they should abide in the Citie, they might be constrayned to be on the Rebels side) gathering all their goods together in heaps, asmuch as they could conueniently, and hiding them in the ground, orCitizens flye the City else by Masons helpe, couering them with lime and stone, they fled priuily in the night out of the Citie.
            The Earle of Warwick, after he had furnished himselfe with Souldiers at home, and from beyond the Seas, with Money, Weapons, and all things necessary for the Warres, departeth

from London, accompanyed with all his forces.
            There were in that Armie the Marquesse of Northampton, (who of late had the Gouernement of the Warres against theWarwicks Army 14000. Campe) Ambrose and Robert Dudley, Warwicks sonnes, Willoughby Poijsi, Bray, and many other noble and famous Captaynes, besides of Knights, Esquires, and Gentlemen: of the Switsers, and of all kinde of common Souldiers, about foureteene thousand. When they came to Cambridge, some of the Aldermen of the Citie of Norwich, and other of the Citizens met with Warwick at the Townes end. Which Citizens (as we said before) being afraid and astonished at the fearefull and mad boldnesse of the Conspirators, had fled the City. These pale and forlorne, and falling vpon their knees, cast themselues euery one at his feet, and with weeping, & lamentable voice, beganne earnestly to intreat him, that he would lay no grieuous thing to their charge; for they were innocent persons, and guiltie of no crime. Yet they besought the mercy and fauourCitizens suit to Warwick. of the Prince: For they had verily conceiued an incredible griefe of this miserable destruction, and spoile of their Countrey, and had further indured all extremitie at the Rebels hands. In the end to prouide for their liues, they were constrayned to flye the City, and with sword and fire were cast out, not only from the City, but from their wiues and children, and all their friends. In so great misery where with they were pressed on euery side; they craue nothing else, but if in this common and exceeding feare, through ignorance and folly, vnwittingly they haue wrapped themselues in any offence, the same might not be imputed vnto them, but vpon their repentance and humble petition it might be pardoned.
            Hereunto Warwick answered that he perceiued how greatHis answer. perill they were in, and that without doubt the strength of those desperat men was great, which had driuen them from all these things as de

In that they had left the Citie in so great feare and danger, it was but the infirmitie of man, and to be borne withall. Notwithstanding in one thing they were somewhat ouer▪ seene, that they withstood

not these euils in the very beginning: for a few valiant and wise men might haue dispatched those companies in a moment, if while the matter was in the beginning, they had opposed themselues for the health of their Countrey. Notwithstanding he granted pardon at their request, and offered the Kings fauour to them all, willing them, when they haue furnished themselues with weapons, and with the furniture of Souldiers, to be in a readinesse to follow the Host, hauing LacesLaces fur distinction. about their necks, to bee discerned from the rest. These things done after this manner, he departeth from Cambridge: And the tenth of the Kalends of September hee came with all his Armie to Intwood. Intwood is distant from NorwichThe 23. of August. about two miles. There Thomas Gresham Knight had a faire and large house, where Warwick abode that day and the night following with his companie. All the men notwithstanding were armed and ready to the battell, if peraduenture the Enemie should rayse vp any tumult on the sudden; which surely beheld from the holes in the Walles and Towers what should be done. Warwick in the meane season, while (as is said before) hee made his abode with all his Armie at Intwood, sendeth his Herald, which in the name of the King (as the manneris) proclaymeth warre against the City and Citizens, except forth with they set open the Gates, and admit the Kings power into the Citie.
            
               Kett, when he vnderstood that the Herald was come to the Gates, willed Augustine Steward the Maiors Deputie, and Robert Rugge, chiefe men of the Citie to goe vnto him, and inquire what hee demanded. These being let out at a backBras

Notwithstanding, they hoped well of the Kings Maiestie, as those which had no wayes bound themselues in any consent of these villanies, but had restrayned (as much as was in them) the rest of the Citizens, with great losse of their goods, and euer with an incredible danger of their liues. Moreouer, they most humbly besought this one thing of the Earle, that because there were in the City an innumerable company of Ketts Campe, vnarmed, poore, and naked, (who besides that through feare and conscience of their owne wickednesse were holden guilty: Moreouer, were weary of this cursed society, as which had filled the very desire of working mischiefe with the sacietie of their furies) it would please him once againe, to trie that which hath been often prooued in vaine: signifying, that they greatly hoped (if at this time might be offered vnto them againe the hope of impunitie) it would come to passe, that forthwith they would lay downe their weapons, without slaughter and bloudshed. Which thing (if it mightA glory exceeding all Victory. come to passe) would be an eternall memorie vnto posteritie, and a glory exceeding all victorie, if they might carry home peace, and their weapons vnstained with the bloud of ciuill dissention.
            The Herald presently departeth from the Maiors speech into Warwicks Campe, declaring all things as hee had receiued. The Earle, vnto whom nothing was more precious (if by any meanes it could bee brought to passe) then that this flame so dangerous and dreadfull, might be quenched without slaughter and bloudshed, decreed himselfe also the aduice in this matter, that it should not be measured according to the villanies they had committed, but according to the dignitie of the King, and the vtilitie of the Kingdome.
            He feared moreouer lest the Gentlemen that were holden bound in the Castle, and other Prisons, euery day tossed, and turmoiled with the great waues of feare, at the length mightRoger Woodhouse vsed cruelly. be cruelly slaine of them. For many were threatned death euery houre; and many, chiefly Roger Woodhouse, Knight, was

continually reuiled with contumelious speeches, vpon whom, without all doubt, they exercised the vnsatiable crueltie of their minds, vexing and abusing him. For these causes therefore, it pleased him to prooue, whether now at the length, by the hope of pardon and impunity, they might be drawne from the errour of their mischiefe.
            To this end, the Herald was presently sent, with a Trumpeter, who entring into the Citie, were met with fortie of the Rebels, marching two and two together (for they were Horsemen) with great ioy and loud cries, from Saint Stephens Gates to the Bishops Palace. From thence the Trumpeter sounding his Trumpet, gaue a signe: whereat, when great routs of Rebels came flocking by heapes vnto them from the hill: The Horsemen with a swift course ranne vnto them, commanding, that diuiding themselues, the one halfe should stand in ranke right ouer against the other in order. Which when they had presently done, the Herald with his Trumpeter, and two other of the principall of the Citie, going in the midst betweene the rankes of the Rebels, were receiued on euery side with great shouts and outcries. For euery one vncouering their heads, as it were with one mouth and consent all at once (for the most part) cried, God saue King Edward▪ God saue King Edward: becommended therefore of the Herald, and chiefe of the Citie, and willed to keepe their order awhile, as they were appointed of late. The Herald, when in this sort hee had passed betweene them two hundred and fiftie paces, at the length came vnto the top of the hill, hauing on his rich Coate of Armes, as solemne ensignes of his Office. There he staied awhile (for Kett was not yet come) at the last hee spake after this manner.

regard of their owne safetie; and had sent vnto them messengers and Proclaimers of Peace, not once, but often, againe and againe. Notwithstanding, they regarded not, but euer despised; and by all meanes misused them, through their de

                           estable madnesse and disloyaltie. But (now in the sight of God) whither would they rush? whither would they throw both themselues headlong, and their goods with deadly furie? what measure would they put to their most trecherous madnesse? or what ende of their most filthie counsels? How long being stirred vp through pestilent lusts, which false and idle confidence of liuing better, had once suffered to enter into their minds, would they pursue alwaies with deadly folly? How long would they adorne with counterfeit titles the most foule impietie of mischieuous treason? How long would they wrappe in the garments of vertue, horrible filthinesse, and deceiueable villanies? Finally, how long would they be holden bound with the mortall desire of those things, which, if it were lawfull for them to obtaine, the destruction of the Common-wealth would insue presently, much more intolerable and lamentable? but rather now at the last, they should looke about them awhile, and apply both their minds and vnderstanding, and mark thorowly with more intentiue eyes, their Common-wealth, of which in all their talke, no lesse foolishly, then wickedly and vngodly they are wont to boast of. Surely then may easily be seene, whether they be faithful subiects, and worthy the name of good Citizens, which haue taken vp hostile Armes against the Kings Maiestie, which haue gathered together routs of wicked men, despised and vile, which haue brought vpon their Countrie (the common Parent of vs all) vngodly, and sacrilegious hands: which haue let in the scumme of the people, and the vilest of all mortall men (cast out, for the most part, of all English Societies) into the Common-wealth, to the destruction of the good, and ouerthrow of the Kingdome; which haue defaced, with mercilesse fire, the greatest part of this most worthie Citie; which hath laid in most filthie Prison and Bands, many worthy and excellent persons, and haue slaine some with most extreme torture; which haue vtterly emptied the best furnished houses, and polled, and shauen the neighbour Uillages; which haue alienated to their owne vse, the goods of many (of late rich men, but now through their crueltie▪ miserable

and needie) and carried them into their wretched Campe by most cruell robberies: which haue forged fained Lawes, false Letters and Commissions in the Kings name: which haue prophaned the Temple of the great and mighty God; ouerthrowne the houses of priuate men; wasted, and spoiled the fields on euery side: which haue conuerted all their thought, studies, and enterprises to destruction, slaughter, wasting, burning and stealing? Finally, which knew nothing remaining, whither the rage and madnesse of their furie could further carrie them: but either their riotous lusts vtterly deuoured, or their filthie importunitie scattered abroad. When they see themselues bound by these so many, so great, and so horrible pollutions of wickednesse, to God, the King, and the Common-wealth, and when now they see all their goods and substance to be brought into that place, and so confiscate and lost, that to bee in a worse condition then now they are in (for they are in the worst) they cannot be, if they would, then let them thinke with themselues, into how large a Sea of euils they haue throwne themselues headlong, and let them thinke what they may feare, ouer whose heads alwaies hangeth the iust wrath of God (which surely by no meanes can be auoided) and the ineuitable power of the King offended and displeased. For his Maiestie had decreed, not to suffer any longer these so great euils to abide in the bowels of his Kingdome, neither to leaue any longer vnpunished▪ and vnreuenged, this so brutish crueltie, and intolerable boldnesse. And therfore hath chosen the Earle of Warwicke, (a man of renowned Honour, and of great name, and vnto this worke appointed Generall from his Maiestie) who must pursue them with fire and sword: and hath further inioyned him neuer to leaue off, vntill hee hath vtterly rooted out that cursed and horrible company. Notwithstanding, such is his great bountie and clemencie, that whom he hath appointed a reuenger of this desperate & wickee rout (if they perseuere) the same also he would haue, to be (if they shall doe otherwise) a messenger and minister of his mercie: The which, except they would imbrace at this time, refusing al sinister aduice, Warwicke hath most solemnely sworne, shall neuer hereafter be offered vnto any of them again: but (as he was commanded of the King) he would pursue with fire and sword all the companions of that most pernitious conspiracy, the officers, ministers and abetters thereof, as the most pestilēt enemies to the Kings Maiesty; neither would he make an end of pursuing them, vntil they (which had defiled all places with their new, vnheard of, and vnpardonable treason, and had drowned themselues in such furious waues of wickednes) had receiued condigne punishment of God and the King.

Others said, that pardon in appearance seemed good and liberall, but in truth would proue in the ende lamentable and deadly, as that which would be nothing else; but Barrels filled with Ropes and Halters. And that painted coate distinct, and beautified with gold; not to bee Ensignes of an Herald: but some peeces of Popish Coapes sewed together. Many things besides (in their pestilent madnesse, turbulent and headlong) raging, and furiously they laid vpon him, while euery one round about powred forth the bitternesse of their venome, in most cruell speeches, sauoring of death it selfe. Notwithstanding, the Herald goeth from thence with Kett, into another place, where hee proclaimeth the same thing to the rest of the people (for before, all could not heare for presse.)
            It happened before he had made an end of his speech, that an vngracious boy, putting downe his breeches, shewed his bare buttockes, and did a filthy act: adding therunto more filthy words. AtA boyly tricke iustly punished. the indignity wherof, a certaine man being moued (for some of our men were on the riuer, which came to be hold) with a bullet from a Pistoll, gaue the boy such a blowe vpon the loines, that sodainly strooke him dead. Which when the Traitours perceiued, there came twelue of the horsemen most furiously coursing out of the Wood, & crying: O my companions, we are betrayed. Do you not see our fellow Souldiers cruelly slaine before our eyes, and shot thorow? what shall wee hope for, being dispersed, and vnarmed, when yet being in armes, violence is offered? For surely this Herald intendeth nothing else, but we being inclosed, all of vs on euery side with traynes, and weakned, may most cruelly be slaine of the Gentlemen.
            
            When he had spoken these words, they were all scattered (and as it were stirred vp with a certaine rage) they fled asunder. Notwithstanding,

               Kett ioyned himselfe with the Herald, and minded to haueKett would haue spoken with Warwicke. spoken with Warwicke, face to face: but now when they were almost come to the bottome of Sturt hill, a mighty rout of Rebels followed him with cries, inquiring all at once whither hee went, saying, they were willing to vndergoe with him what fortune soeuer (though neuer so sharpe) and if he would needs goe any further, he should haue them his companions and partners, both in life and death. The Herald, when hee looked behinde him, and saw such a company of men following, willed Kett to goe backe againe, and and stay this concourse, and tumult: who being returned to his Company, they were presently quiet, and went backe all of them againe into the Campe.
            But the Earle of Warwicke, when hee perceiued that they were all carried headlong (with a certaine frenzy, and as it were, a blinde rage of the minde) to destruction: and that neither by intreaty or faire promises; nor yet by the feare of punishment, they could bee wonne to cease from their filthy enterprize: It seemed best vnto him, to leaue off for euer the hope of peace: a thing aswell by himselfe, as by others often proued in vaine, and now at the length to deale by open warre. Therefore, he leadeth his army to Saint Stephens gates, which the enemies had shut vp, letting downe the Portcullis, and he commanded the Kings master Gunner, to place the Ordinance before the gates, that being throwne downe and battered, way might be made for the souldiers to enter the City. Which while they were about to doe, the Earle had knowledge from Augustine Steward, the Maiors Deputy: that there was a gate not farre off, which the common people call Brazen doore. This the enemy had made fast with great beames, and peeces of timber, and rampired vp with stones and earth; notwithstanding, with no labour might easily be shaken, and broken downe. The Pyoners are sought for; & Commandement giuen to breake vp the gates, which broke open, there they first entred the City, and killing many, they easily remoue the enemy from that place. And now the Master Gunner had shottred and broken the Port-cullis at Saint Stephens gates, and ouerthrowne the one halfe of the gates, being shaken with the often shot. Where the Earle of Northampton, & one Drury (a man of excellent valour) with their Bands hasting into the City, driue the Campers from thence, many being wounded, and many slaine.
            
               Also on the other sides of the City, the Maiors Deputy broughtS. Bennets. to passe, that the gates, called Westwicke gates, were opened, which being vnlocked and set open, Warwicke with all his Host were let in (almost none resisting) and came into the market place. There60. Rebels hanged. they found almost threescore of the Rebels, whom in warlike manner they punished. For without hearing the cause, all of them were presently (as the manner of warres is) manifestly conuict of their wickednesse, and receiued their last punishment. Not long after, all Carts and carriages, which could not come in, both by reason of the hardnesse of the draft; as also the often, and sodaine incursiōs of the enemies, are brought into the City at these gates also. But it came to passe (as it chanced) by the rashnesse and folly of the keepers of the carriage (while our men were occupied about their weighty businesse) that they went out of the City thorow Bishops gates, towards Moushold; which certaine of the Rebels perceiuing, they sent some of their company to set vpon the carelesse keepersThe K. carriage taken by Rebels. thereof, and bereaued our men of the whole carriage. Whereat greatly reioycing (for before they were vtterly vnprouided of such things) they carryed into the Campe, Carts loaden with Gunnes, Gunpowder, and all kinde of instruments of warre.
            But in very good season, Captaine Drury came vpon themCaptaine Drury. with his Band, which recouered part of the carriage from the enemy: yet not without some losse of his Souldiers. Then the Traytours tooke this counsell to lay waite in the Lanes, and crosse Streets by Companies, supposing to stay our men quickly and vnwares, being ignorant of the wayes, not accustomed thereto, and by reason of the greatnesse of the City. Wherefore, they diuided themselues by Parishes. Some of them stood at Saint Michaels of Mospoole, part at Saint Simons, others at Saint Peters of Hungate, and others in East Wymer Warde; all ready to battell. There, setting vpon some of our men on the sodaine: they most cruelly slew three or foure Gentlemen, before any helpe could come. The matter3. or 4. Gē

When they came thorow the Street (called Saint Iohns Street, and were now come to Saint Andrewes Church, the enemy (vnlooked for) with his Bowmen discharged vpon vs a mighty force of Arrowes, as flakes of snow in a tempest.
            
               But while they were yet shooting, intending to mixe heauen and earth together: On the sudden came Captayne Drury the second time with his charge of Harquebusiers, yong men, and of an excellent courage and skill, who payed them home againe with such a terrible volly of shot (as if it had beene a storme of hayle) and putThree hundred and thirty, Rebels slaine at S. Andrew, alia Editio 130
                them all to flight as in a moment, trembling. There were slaine at this skirmish about three hundred & thirty. And many being found creeping in the Church-yard, and vnder the Walles, were taken and put to grieuous punishment. All the rest of that filthy company flowed againe to the Campe at Moushold, as into a sinke. Which being auoyded, the Citizens seemed at the length to be greatly releeued and comforted, because they had vomited vp and cast out so grieuous a plague. The Rebels after this sort chased out, and driuen from the City: Warwick, the better to fortifie the same, furnished the walles with Souldiers, and other prouision, fit for the repulsing of the Enemie, and gaue commandement, that armed men (out of hand) should be placed in euery street, and that all the passages into the City and Gates (one or two excepted) should bee blocked vp. For by those Gates our men carryed out great store of Ordinance, which stood there ready charged to bee conueyed the next day to Moushold. But Ketts company supposing our men to bee greatly distressed for powder, & all other necessary furniture for Ordinance, perceiuing also some few to stand straggling with our Carryage and Carts, & not carefull for any sudden euent of warre (whom through the rage of the swelling pride of their heart, being mad) they greatly despised (both because of their small company, as also being negligent, and fearing no such danger, they supposed they might easily ouer-come) they thought there was offered vnto them great oportunity of doing some notable exploit.
            Therefore, while Warwicks Souldiers (what for the defence of the City, and the number of other waighty businesse) were hindred with greater cares: One Myles, a man (as it seemeth) most bold,Myles killed the Kings Gunner. and skilfull in discharging of Ordinance, watching the time and oportunity of this villany, shot thorow the Kings Master Gunner with a bullet. Whom, when they perceiued to bee fallen downe dead; some of them naked and vnarmed, some armed with staues, b

force of the enemie vnlooked for) but astonished and terrified with the disordered cries, and horrible noise of their feete, as they came running downe the hill, leauing all the Baggage and Carts, ranne away on all sides, with great out-cries, and a swift course. A few therefore after this sort put to flight by many, the Rebels tooke, and carried away into the Campe, certaine Ordinance which they found there, and Carts loaden with all things necessarie for the warres, beforeThe Rebels tooke the Kings prouision the second time any helpe of our men could come. Which thing was very hurtfull vnto vs, and much out of our way. For besides that, afterward we wanted those instruments and weapons, wherewith the enemie had furnished himselfe, Ketts Gunners discharged often vpon vs, and most cruelly those iron bullets from the Ordinance and Gunnes which they tooke from vs, and battered the Citie grieuously. And many being slaine, torne and rent in sunder with the rage of the shot, this villany and wickednesse they adde to the rest; that they beate downe most furiously a great part of the Wall, and the Tower vpon Bishops Gates; though surely (through the goodnesse of God) such was the lot of the people of Norwich at that time, as the bullets flying euery where, whether by chance, or of set purpose; or which rather I suppose, by the rashnesse and ignorance of the Gunners, which sometime happeneth, leuelling somewhat too high, mounted ouer the toppes of the houses, without doing any great harme: which, except it had so come to passe, with the continuall force of shot from those vile and wretched Rebels; the houses being shattered and shaken, the greatest part of the Citie had beene beaten downe, and made euen with the ground in short time: And without doubt, in the opinion of all men, a greater losse that day had come vnto all common affaires, except Drury with his valour, and slaughter of hisDrury satisfieth the former inconuenience souldiers, not to bee despised (making satisfaction for this inconuenience, by putting the enemies to flight, and chasing them,) had recouered the greatest part of the prouision they droue away.
            Warwicke, (these things done after this manner, some ofWarwicke fortifies the Citie. the Gates of the Citie being broken and fallen downe, and now ramperd vp againe) placed vpon the Bridges, and winding Streetes of the Parishes and Lanes, diuers of his Garisons, and appointed a great companie of Armed men at Bishops Gates, and committed the charge thereof to my Lord

               Willoughby, and so compassed and fortifyed all places, as the same night hee cut off from the Enemy all entrance into the Citie.
            Notwithstanding, the next day the Rebels came ouer the Riuer, called Contsford, and confounded all things with a terrible fire,Rebels come ouer at Cōtsford and fire the City. and lamentable to behold. For all the houses in two Parishes being burnt downe; the fire so spred abroad, as it got hold with an horrible flame vpon many of the Neighbour Parishes. There was a certayne house wherein the Marchants of Norwich did vsually bestow their marchandize, which they receiued daily from Yarmouth (called the common Stathe.) Hereunto the Rebels set fire,Common Stath burnt whereby within a moment the house it selfe, and great store of Corne, and much other commodities of many honest Marchants, were vtterly burnt with fire and consumed. The report goeth (and it is not vnlikely) that they intended to haue destroyed the whole City with fire, and to that end threw fire vpon the roofes of many houses, whereby they might bring to passe, that while all men should runne to saue the fired houses, the Rebels at the same instant,Rebels policy. casting downe the Rampires, and opening all the Gates, might distresse our men (being scattered, and helping one another) hauing the fire on the one side, and the sword on the other. Which thing being wisely obserued, both disappointed the deuice of the Rebels, and brought our men in the minde, to suffer the fire (spreading euery where vpon the tops of the houses) with a speedy wasting, and consuming of all things, neither would they so much as quench it in the very beginning.
            But when in this sort vnhappily these things (for the most part)Better a mischiefe, then an incōuenience. befell the Citizens; God bringing alwayes one calamity on the neck of another, great astonishment and sorrow strooke many mens mindes, in somuch as languishing through despaire and feare, they almost faynted, now deuoide of all counsell. These came vnto Warwick, declaring vnto him, that the City is great, and all the Gates either broke open, or burnt downe; the number of men for the warre but few, the power of the Enemie to be great, and cannot be resisted. They humbly besought him, in regard of their safetie,The coward linesse of the Citizēs. he would leaue the Citie, & not suffer the matter to be brought to vtter extremity. Warwick (as hee was a man alwayes of a great and inuincible courage, valiant, and mighty in Armes, and thought scorne of the least infamie) said, What, are ye so

soone dismaid? and is so great a mist on the sudden come ouer your mindes, which hath taken away the edge of your courage, that you would either desire this thing, or thinke it can come to passe while I am aliue, that I should forsake the City? I will first suffer fire, sword; finally, all extremity, before I will bring such a stayne of infamy and shame, either vpon my selfe, or you. With these words hee drew his sword; so did the rest of the Nobles (for they were all there gathered together) and hee commanded after a warlike manner (and as is vsually done in greatest danger) that they should kisse one anothers sword, making the signe of the holy Crosse, andSouldiers kisse one anothers swords. by an Oath, and solemne promise by word of mouth, euery man to binde himselfe to other, not to depart from the City, before they had vtterly banished the Enemie, or else fighting manfully, had bestowed their liues cheerfully for the Kings Maiestie.
            While these things were in doing, the Rebels broke in at another side of the City, where our men little thought they could enter: but when they were almost come to the Bridges, they were speedily incountred by our men, and with a mighty slaughter and many wounds were driuen back againe, and retyred headlong the way they came.
            But Warwick, the better to take vtterly away from the Rebels all ability of entrance into the City, commanded all the Bridges on euery side to bee cut on sunder, yet after, for certayne causes it was commanded otherwise; and only that which is commonly called white Fryers bridge, was broken downe. All the rest were defendedWhite Friers bridge broken. with good Souldiers. And al places else, and especially the gates (because for the most part they were all, either broken downe, or else fired) were deliuered in charge to men of courage, and experienced in warlike affaires, to bee defended vpon euery sudden occasion, whereby it came to passe, that al the desperate and night incursions of the Enemie, were voide and of none effect.
            The next day after, which was the seuenth of the Kalends of September,The 26. of August. 1040. Switsers sent to Norwich. one thousand and forty Switsers, valiant and notable Souldiers (as the report goeth commonly) came from London to Norwich. These were ioyfully receiued of our men▪ who testified their gladnesse and cheerfulnesse by many vollies of shot. At the length being diuided by Parishes and houses, and liberally & courteously intertayned, and inuited of the Citizens, as it reuiued the hearts of our men, and stirred them vp vnto a sure hope, with confidence of

performing the businesse well: So it danted the hearts of the Enemies being now confounded with a new feare and astonishment, at this doubtfull knowledge of their future ouerthrow.
            In the meane season, the seditious, coueting nothing more then to sucke out the bloud of all good men (whereof they had now drunke in their most greedy mindes some hope) thought all the waight of the matter to consist in this, if Warwicks Army might be put to flight at the first assault. And surely as they forsooke the good and mighty God: so againe, being despised and reiected of him, they gaue ouer themselues bond-slaues to the Deuill: Who bewitching their mindes with an old wifes superstition, brought to passe, that being once intangled with the blinde illusions of Southsayers, they chose a certayne Vally, not farre off, as appointed to this warre by destinie: Although surely (as is recorded) there wanted not strange and euident tokens of Gods heauy displeasure against them.

Which, when surely they portended, the anger and vengeance of God (as it seemed) yet swelling with raging cruelty and obstinacy, they all neglected. So great a mist of darknesse vndoubtedly is Satan wont to bring vpon the mindes of men, as oft as he findeth them drowned in mischiefe. For while there were many doting Prophecies among the People, out of which they sucked I know not what hope of victorie; yet they imbraced certayne vnsauo

For example there was a toy neuer heard of before, which exceeded all credit, as at the mention whereof how their furious senses were stir

               The Verses were these,

            While these Verses were sung continually euery where, the Deuill infused such poyson into the mindes of these most wretched men, as they decreed to commit their hope of good successe to a doubtfull euent of a false place. Therefore all their Dennes and lurking places euery where, which they had made on Moushold of tymber, and other prouision, being now set on fire (insomuch as the smoke rising from so many places distant one from another) seemed to bring night almost vpon the whole skeyes, and couered the Plaines with thick darkenesse.
            From thence they went to the Valley called Dussyns Dale, withThe Rebels were twenty ancients. twenty ancients, and ensignes of Warre. So great was the Rebels hope of prey, and the multitude allured through impu

Insomuch as they intrenched then themselues as in a moment, and made Bulwarks, and other defences. Moreouer, they brought a ditch ouer the high wayes, and cut off all passage, pitching their Iauelins and stakes in the ground before them.
            When Warwick had intelligence hereof, he also purposed to trye the euent of warre, that whom by lenity and patience, he could not perswade, those he might by force of Armes subdue. Therefore theAug. 27. day following, that was the sixt of the Kalends of September, setting his Armie in order, hee marched against the Enemy throughS. Martins. Cosleny Gates.

            Which answere returned to Warwicke, he without any long exhortation, perswaded his souldiers (alreadie burning with a feruent desire of the battell) that they should valiantly inuade the enemie, and cast no doubts, but repute and take the company of Rebel

They answered againe, that they would willingly leaue their weapons, if they were perswaded, that promise of impunity would proue for their safety: But, they haue had already experience, of their cruelty vpon their companions in all places; and therfore the same to bee such an vndoubted signe vnto them: as they suppose this mention of pardon, deceitfully offered by the Nobles; to be nothing else, but whereby, being circumuented and ouercome; by a false and vaine hope of fauour (as by

            This answere being returned, Warwicke is reported to lament the multitude▪ euen now ready to perish. And▪ being led with compassion towards them, sent againe to inquire: whether if hee came himselfe, and gaue his faith, and bound themselues before their faces, they would then lay downe their weapons. They all answered, if that were done, they would beleeue, and resigne themselues to theWarwicke goeth himselfe and they inbrace Pardon. will, and authority of the King.
            Whereupon without delay, Warwicke goeth presently vnto them, commandeth the Herald openly to reade the Kings Commission, which being read (because therein vndoubtedly, pardon was

promised to all) trusting to it, they laid downe their weapons euery man, and all of them as with one mouth, thankefully cryed: God save King Edward, God save King Edward. And thus many men (as it were taken out of the iawes of death) were saued by the Wisdome and Compassion of Warwicke.
            The battell being ended, all the prey the same day was giuen to the Souldiers, and openly sold in Norwich market. Moreouer, this thing is in Record, that many Gentlemen, and some of the chiefe of the City, were slaine in this tumult, and heat of the fight: although they gaue money, and great rewards to the Souldiers, to spare their liues.
            The next day, tidings was brought by certaine messengers toKett taken. Warwicke, that Kett while his Horse tyred, and fell downe in his iourney (as it came to passe by Gods prouidence) being weary of his flight; hid himselfe in a Barne, & was found by two seruants of one Riches of Swannington, & taken and carried home to his house, and kept safe. Presently there were sent twenty horsemen for him, who finding him there in his filthinesse all forlorne, lying lamenting and howling; pale for feare, doubting and despairing of life: they tooke him, and brought him bound to Norwich.

Afterward, nine which were the Ringleaders, and principalls were hanged on the Oke: Called the Oke of Reformiation, and many companions with them in these villanies, were hanged, and then presently cut downe, and falling vpon the earth (these are the Iudgements of Traytors in our Countrey) first their priu

But these wilde and rude heads, after this sort being taken away, many of the Gentlemen carryed with displeasure and desire of reuenge, laboured to stirre vp the minde of Warwick to cruelty. Who not contented with the punishment of a few, would haue rooted out vtterly the off-spring and wicked race of them, and were so earnest and eger in it, as they constrayned Warwick to vse this speech vnto them openly.

But how farre would they goe? would they euer shew: himselues discontented, and neuer pleased? VVould they leaue no place for humble petition;

            These speeches appeased greatly the desire of reuenge, and brought to passe, that many which before burned wholly with cruetly, afterward not withstanding were farre more courteous towards the miserable Common people. The same night the bodies of the slaine were buried, le

            The day after (that was the day before the fourth of the Kalends of September) the most worthy Earle of Warwicke, and famous for wisdome and courage, with all his Nobles, and a great company, not only men, but women of all degrees and ages, and an AssemblyWarwicke after praising God, departeth the Citie. of all Estates, went to Saint Peters Church, and there made prayers, and gaue thanks to Almightie God, for the thing so worthily performed: which being ended, he departed the Citie with all his Armie.
            But the Citizens being filled with ioy and gladnesse, all with one consent extolled Warwicke, with commendations to the heauens, and spake all manner good of him, with clapping of hands, ioy and thankfulnesse, filled, and confounded all things, and renowned with most excellent speeches, the fame of so worthy a Captaine, and the memorie of so great courage; and attributed to his wisdome and good successe, the preseruation of their liues, their wiues and children: Finally, all their goods and possessions: And morcouer decreed (for the eternall note and ignominie of those times) that vponA Law made for the continuall remem brance. the same day, wherein the enemies were discomfited, and put to flight, all men should repaire to their Churches, and make Prayers vnto Almightie God, with the Ministers of the Congregations euery yeere by a solemne custome established. Which being receiued for a Law, they decreed moreouer, that a Sermon should be made at the common place, to the which al the Citizens should resort; which ordinance, from such beginning, hath continued vntill this day. But

            After certaine daies, although they were manifestly conuict of treason against the Kings Maiestie, and by the iudgement and reproches of all men, together with the gilt of conscience for their villanies condemned; yet were they drawne to open iudgement after the common manner, and a quest passed vpon them for their triall: and being condemned, they were led away, the one to Norwich▪ the other to Windham, where a deserued punishment passed vpon them both. For Robert Kett (at the Castle in Norwich) had chaines putExecuted. vpon him, and with a rope about his necke, was drawne aliue from the ground vp to the Gibbet, placed vpon the top of the Castle, and there hanged for a continuall memorie of so great villanie, vntil that vnhappy and heauy body (through pu

            But VVilliam Kett ended his life with the same kinde of death at Windham, whence all these Furies flowed as from the Fountayne, for there they both dwelt. But after this sort, the City and all the Countrey of Norfolke (when this vile and deadly plague of treason, to the destruction of many, had continued a most three scoreCampe lasted 60. daies. dayes, and had shaken all things with most lamentable ruine) at the length, through the goodnesse of God, and wonderfull valour of Warwick (that excellent noble man) these so bloudy and wofull tumults ended, and the Countrey had rest.
