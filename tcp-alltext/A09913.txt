                  ture. Euery creature of God is good to the faithfull ād none is to be refused being taken with thanks geuinge / for it is sanctified by the word off God and praier.
            This maior or ground we haue

haue of Saint Paule / whereunto I add this minor or meane proposition. But mariadge is a creature of god / that I am suer yow can not denye / onles you will say mariadge is a creature of the deuell as the old heretiques Saturninus Basilides and there folowers did.The heretiques Saturninus and Basilides wer enemies of mariadge read / Theod. lib 1. de Haereticis fab▪
                  
                Wherupon must folow this conclusion / Ergo mariadge is good and not to be refused being takē with thanks geuinge for it is sanctified by the word of God and praier. This sound Sylogismus proueth plainly that the mariadge of a prest is not only a mariadge / but also a good mariadge / and a  good thinge for it is sanctified by the word of God and praier. Wherby Martins assertion (that it is no mariadge) is fully ouerthrowen.2. Tim. 3. Tit. 1. Yea and Saint Paule calleth the bushop / priest / and deacon / by the name of huszband / and there iokefellowes  by the name of wyues / and saith the bushop must be the huszband of one wife / and like wise the deacon.1. Corinh. 7. And further he saieth for the avoydinge of fornieacion let euery man haue his wife etc.  In which generall sentence / priests must be comprehendid / if they be men. Yea and there mariadge not only a mariadge but also an honorable mariadge or els cā not

mariadge be honorable in all estates / as Saint Paule wryteth to the hebrues the 13. Chap.
                  Heb. 13▪
                And I pray you what neded you to make more adoe / if priests mariadge were no mariadge? what neded an act of Parliament / in the first yere of the Queēs reigne to repeale the statute made for priests mariadges? And why doth that act name it the mariadge of priests / ād not a pretēsed mariadge / as yow doereuokynge the mariadges by the name of mariadges / and not of pretensed mariadges? And last of all / yf prests mariadge be no mariadge as you say: what cause I pray you had the Queen and the bushopes to depriue the maried bushopes and priests of England from there benefices? They were not depriued for ignoraunce in Gods worde / neyther for not doing there dewtie / nor for glut

               mon faultes amōgst all your priests now a daies / And a benefice and any of them / or all of thē be so compatible / and may so well be enioyed together / that any popish priest may quietly haue those faults an
                  •
                there benefice together wthout depriuation. Other fault there is none knowen / 

but only that they were maried / The maried priests of England were depriued without a cause. thoughe for the lawfulnes of there mariadge besyds Gods plaine word and godly Cannons and Doctours / etc. They had the consent of the kinge the supreame head vnder Christ of the churche and of the parlament and realme / an d that oyned with the consent of the congregacions assembled where they were maried / and for the testimony of the kings consent and others both of the nobles and commons / The maried priests had the consent of the Kinge the Parliament / and the Realme. for lawfulnes therof / many of them receauid benefices after they were maried / at the kings and other nobles hands. All this lawfulnes notwithstandinge I say other cause haue ye none wherfore ye depryued the priests of England from there benefices but only that they were maried.
            Now cum you forth and say that the pretentid mariadge of priests is no mariadge. wherfore it must folow that the pretendid cause in England of priests diuorsement is no cause / ād that the priests be put from there liuings without a cause / euen by your own supposall / if the maadge of priests be but pretensid (as you put it) how much more then without a cause / being very mariadge in deed? as is prouid / and without controuersy amongst

            That Iouinian the monke was the firste heritique that preached in Rome.
            
               Another lie of Martin.For yf it be trewe that Peter was at Rome and disputed there with Simon Magus as Eusebius, Epiphanius, Irenaeus, and other do witnesse.
            And also that Simon Magus (docuit) taught there / as Iraeneus witnesseth / and further that he hadde so perswaded the Romains

wyth hys doctrine that they reysed vp a piller in his honoure / with this writing vpon it:
                  Irenaeus lib. 2. cap. 20. 
               Simoni Deo sancto / To Simon the holly God / as Eusebius / Theodoret / ād other do also testifie / And moreouer yf it be trew that Martiō the heritique preached at Rome in the time of Policarpus Busshop of Smirna 160. yeare after Christe as Ieraenus witnesseth / 
                  Irenaeus li. 3. cap. 3. And also that Cerdo the heritique came to Rome in the tyme of Higinius 144 yeare after Christe as Eusebius witnesseth libro quarto Cap. 8Eusebius lib. iiij. cap. vlij.
            
            Item that Nouatus the Anabaptiste taught in Rome in the time of Pope Fabianus 255. yeare after Christe.
            Item that Pope Liberius was an Arian in the tyme of Constantyne and preached in Rome as Platina witnesseth / Pope Liberius was an heretique. Platina. Yf (I saye) all these thynges bee trewe (as they be of these olde and credible authoures reported) then must this be Another of Martins lies / for Iouiniā
                was 400 years after Christe & lōge after these heritiques whome I haue aleaged as by the yeares doeth plainely appeare. All these were before Iouinian / & heritiques / and at Rome / & preached or taught ther. Ergo Io

            Martin yet can not thus be contentid but procedeth from one lye to annother.

               ber more / all agree with the Papists in this point (that the vse of matrimony is vncleanes) and therfor wold they not receaue the communion with such as were maried. But all this holy pretense / Was but an outward shew / wherwith to blynde the eyes of the peple / as S. Austen speaketh of the Manicheis saying.

Thus mayst thow see good reader / that not only the very definitiō of an heretique hath disclosid the papists to be heretiques / but also the defense of the self same opinions wherof the old heretiques were comdempned / doth confirm my discourse apō the definition to be soūd good and trew.

serue not only his necessitie / but also his lust: Wheather of these twayn / iudge you as touchīg meat & drink / to lyue in more abstinence?

The Papists teach the lawfulnes herof and the necessitie also of the obseruation of it when it is don / in sondry places of there deuelish cannon law. The preface of this counsell also sayth of these Heretiques.

               Ye may see by the Latin what antiquitie and learning these bushops were of sprang first of a certein priest / not naming where he dwelt / neither whether he were maried or vnmaried / But apon this place ye note vpon the margent of your bok / 
The first maried priest in Fraūce was an heretique.where all men may see of that place / it may aswell be gathered that it was an vnmaried priest.
The place serueth aswell for the one as the other. Yea & it is to be thought that Heresis presbyterorum, not to be of the mariadge of priests of Fraunce / but some other heresy begon by certein priests.

Yt is the propertie of some lyers / when they haue told a lye ones or twyse or oftner / that by often telling of there lyes to other / at last they think them true themselues / ād so it may be that Martin by often telling this vaine fable / doth now think it is a most true story.

            But Martin fearing lest all his brabling will not serue his turn / hath pyked out a pece of Saint Hierom / where he semeth to note certain properties and qualities

/ which he sayth be commonly in heretiques / and stryueth to aply the same to such as had professed Christs gospell in England. The words be these / as he doth alledge them.Notes pikid out of S. Hierom by Martin wher by to know an heretique.

Hierom brought in by Martin be dyrectly against himself. nor alow mariadge in other but pretendid such a holynes with a shew of virginitie / and hatered of mariadge / that with there holy looks & sweet words they deceauid the peple.
            Wherby thow maist well perceaue that this place of Saint Hierō maketh fully against such priests as say they haue the gyft of Chastitie / and haue it not / that lyue in whoredom and marry not / that pretend holynes in the sight of the peple but lead a filthy lyfe in corners / ād in secret. And for example he nameth a nomber of heretiks that were vnmaried priests / as the popish preests be / and thought mariadge to be to vnclean a thing / to be in a minister / as all the Papists doe / let Martin himself denye yf he can that these were vnmaried / so that ther is nothinge here / that agreeth not fully with the Papists.

But note his impudency / In his translation out of the latin into the English / Words addid by Martin in Englishing the latin wich be not in the latin of S.

            Yf I should bring in the first Counsell holden at Constantinople against Eunomius for denieng the proceszion of the holy gost from the father and the sone what can Martin say? Against this Eunomius / Basill and other hath writtē plentifulli.
            Thus ye see concerning the begin̄ing of this heresie against the holi gost / Martin is foūd a falsyfier of histories / not only by the suputation of yeres / but also by the very testimony of the pope hīself his God. Now concerning the cause of the dissention between the Greeks / and the Latins wher with Martin charged the Emperor Michael Palaeologus.
            
            
               
               Martin prouid a foule lyer by Bessarion a Cardinall in oratione dogmatica pro unione Ecclesiae Graecae & Latinae, cap. 2.The learned man Cardinall Bessarion patriarch of Constantinople and Archebushop of Nicea wryteth a whole Chapter for declaration of the cause of this schisme and dissention: shewing that the bushhop of Rome was the causer therof for that he. Sua unius authoritate fretus aduocata synodo generali particulam illam communi symbolo fidei, non cum communi assensu ascripsit. (that is) when he had callid a generall Counsell / he tooke apon him of his own priuat authoritie / to adde this parcell (.i. of the proceding of the holy gost from the father and the sun to the commō Creed / with out the consent of the rest of the other bushops there assembled. Behold good reader a plain prof / that it was the rashe / and termerose boldnes of the bushop of Rome that causid this dissention / who of his oune authoritie wold doe that tumultuosly / The pope was the cause of the dissension between the greek and the latin churche contra

            But Martin will say the thing that he did was Good:
            
               Yea but the maner of the doīg was suche as I thīk Martin / if he thorowly knew it / as he wold seme to do / he himself (for all his foly) will not yet defend it / And the inconueniences that folowed the popes brainles and beastly audacitie / declare that the meanes which he vsid in compassing his doings / were wicked and deuelish. So that wher as Martin imputeth the breche and contention between the Greek and latin church and the ouer throw / both of the Grecians church and kingdom / to the lecherose lyfe of the vnkle to the Emperour Michaell Palaeologus: it is prouid / that the Pope / the author of al mischefe in the church of God / was the only matche that kindled this fier. A worthi matter doutles to depryue the Pope for euer after bearing any rule though

Now to make an end of answer to that few lynes which remayne in Martins first Chapter / I need not to take further paines / because they be nothing ells but lyes & raylings / grounded apon false grounds as I haue before declarid / only to this ēd / that king Henthe eight the Queens father might appere to the world both a lechor an heretique and a mā full of all other wickednes / out of whose naughty lyfe Martī wold haue al the preachīg in King Edwards dayes which he calleth heresie / to haue his first Originall.

These be Saint Paules words by thee alegid. To this Maior / or grownd I adde this Minor or mean proposition. But you Papists cause dissentions and offenses against the doctrine that S. Paule taught in thesame Epistle to the Romains (of which doctrin he there speaketh) in that ye hold a man is made righteous by his works / The Papistes dissent from S. Paules doctrine. and that a man of himself

Paule teacheth al men to beware fo the Papists / by the place by martin alledged. biddeth all men vnder the name of the Romaines to beware of you Papists / and such like rank heretiks as you be / because ye be not the ministers and seruants of Christ (as you pretend) but ye make Christ your seruāt and instrument wherby to feed your fat belyes as Saint Paule there saith /
