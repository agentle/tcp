LAMENTATION
OF THE MISERABLE
ESTATE OF THE
CHVRCHE
of Christ in Englande, in the time of the late
reuolt from the gospel, wherin is conteyned a
learned comparison betwene the comfortable
doctrine of the gospell, & the traditions of the
popish religion: with an instruction how the
true Christian ought to behaue himself in
the tyme of tryall. Wrytten by

                  A Lamentacion of the
Churche.
                  
                     
                        ALAS, what mysery is
thy churche broughte
vnto (O Lord) at this
daye? Whereof late ye
word of the Lord was
truely preached, was
redde and hearde in euery towne, in
euery churche, in euery vyllage, yea
almoste in euery honest mans house:
alas nowe is it exiled & banished out
of the whole Realme. Of late whoo
was not glad to be taken for a louer
of Goddes worde, for a reader, for a
redy hearer, and for a learner of the
same: & now (alas) who dare beare
any open coūtenance toward it, but
such as are content in Christes cause
& for his wordes sake to stand to the
daunger & losse of all that they haue?
                  Of late there was to be founde of
euery age, of euery degree and kynd
of people, that gaue their dilygence
to learne as they coulde out of gods
woorde, the articles of the christian
fayth, the commaundmentes of god

and the lords prayer. The babes and
younge chyldren were taughte these
things of their parents, of their masters,
& wekely of their curates in euery
churche: & the aged folke whyche
had ben brought vp in blindenes
and in ignoraunce of those thynges
whyche euery christian is bounde to
knowe, when otherwyse they coulde
not, yet they lerned the same by often
hearyng their chyldren and seruants
repeating the same: But now, alas,
and alas again, the false prophets of
Antechrist which are past all shame,
do openly preach in pulpets vnto the
people of God that the cat
                        •
                     chisme is
to be counted heresy: whereby theyr
olde blindenesse is broughte home agayne:
for the aged are afrayd of the
higher powers, and the youthe is abashed
& ashamed euen of that which
they haue lerned, though it be Gods
worde and dare no more meddle.
                  Of late in euerye congregation
throughout all England was made
prayer & peticion vnto God to be deliuered
from the tyrannye of the byshop

of Rome and all his detestable
enormities: from all false doctryne
and heresie: And now alas, Sathā
hath perswaded Englād by his falshed
and crafte to reuoke her old godly
prayer, to recant the same, & prouoke
the fearefull wrath and indygnation
of god vpon her owne pate.
                  Of late by straite lawes and ordinaunces,
with the consent of the nobles
and commonaltie, and ful agrement
and counsaile of the prelates &
clergie, was banished hence the beast
of Babylon, with lawes, I say, and
with othes and al meanes that then
coulde be deuysed for so godly a purpose:
But now alas, all these lawes
are troden vnder foote: the nobles,
the commonaltie, the prelates & clargie
are quite chaunged and all those
othes though they were herein made
in iudgement, iustice and truth, and
the matter neuer so good, dothe no
more holde then a bond of rushes, or
of a barley strawe, nor publyke periurie
no more fearethe them then a
shadowe vppon the wall.
                  
                     
Of late it was agreed in England
of all handes, accordinge to Paules
doctrine and Chrystes commaundement,
as Paule saythe playne, that
nothinge oughte to be doone in the
church in the publike congregation,
but in that tongue which the congregation
coulde vnderstande, that all
might be edified therby, wheather it
were common praier, administratiō
of the sacramēts, or any other thinge
belonging to the publike mynisterie
of gods holy and wholsome woorde:
but alas all is turned vpsidedowne.
Paules doctrine is put aparte: Christes
commaundemente is not regarded:
for nothing is hearde commonly
in the Churche but in a straunge
tongue that the people doth nothing
vnderstande.
                  Of late all men and women were
taught after Christs doctrine to pray
in that tongue which they could vnderstand,
that they might pray with
harte, that whiche they shuld speake
with their tongue: Nowe, alas, the
vnlearned people is brought in that

blyndenesse agayne, to thyncke that
they praye, when they speake wyth
their tongue, they can not tel what,
nor wherof: their harte is nothynge
myndefull at all, for that it can vnderstande
neuer a whyt therof.
                  Of late the lordes supper was duely
ministred and taughte to be made
common to all that were true Chrystians,
with thankes geuing and settinge
forthe of the Lordes death and
passion, vntil his returninge agayne
to iudge bothe quicke and deadde:
But nowe alas, the Lordes table is
quyte ouerthrowen, and that whych
ought to be common to all godly, is
made priuate to a few vngodly, with
out any kinde of thankesgeuinge, or
any settinge forth of the lords death
at all, that the people is able to vnderstande.
                  Of late all that were endued with
the light and grace of vnderstanding
of goddes holye mysteries, did blesse
god which had broughte them out of
that horrible blyndenesse and ignoraunce,
whereby in tymes paste beinge

seduced by Satans subteltyes,
they beleued that the sacrament was
not the sacrament, but the thynge it
selfe, whereof it is a sacramente:
that the creature was the creatour,
and that the thynge whiche hathe
neyther lyfe nor sense (alas suche
was the horryble blyndenes) was
the Lorde hym selfe, whiche made
the eye to see, and hath gyuen al senses
and vnderstandynge vnto man.
But nowe alas, Englande is returned
agayn lyke a dogge to her owne
vomyt and spuynge, and is in worse
case then euer she was: for it had ben
better neuer to haue knowen the truthe
then to forsake the truth once receyued
and knowen. And nowe, not
onely that light is turned into darknes,
and goddes grace is receyued in
vayne, but also lawes of deathe are
made by hyghe court of parliamente
masterfully to maineteine by sworde
fyer and al kind of violence that heinouse
Idolatry wherin that adoration
is geuē vnto the lyueles and dum
creature, whiche is onely dew vnto

the euerlyuynge God: yea they faye
they can and do make of bread bothe
man and god by theyr transubstantiation.
O wicked inuention, and Sathans
owne broode.
                  Of late was the Lordes cuppe at
his table distributed according to his
owne comaundement by his expresse
wordes in his gospell as well to the
laytie as to the clergie, which order
Christes churche obserued soo manye
hundreth yeres after (as al the auncient
ecclesiasticall wryters do testyfie)
without contradictiō of any one
of them that can be shewid vnto this
day. But nowe, alas, not onely the
lordes commaundemente is broken,
his cuppe is denied to his seruantes,
to whom he commaunded it shuld be
distributed, but also with the same is
set vppe a new blasphemous kynd of
sacrifyce, to satisfye & paie the pryce
of synnes, bothe of the deade and of
the quicke, to the great and intolerable
contumely of Christ our sauyour
his death & passion, whiche was
and is the one onely sufficient and euerlastinge

auaylable sacrifice satisfactorie
for al the electes of god, from
Adam the fyrst, to the laste that shal
be borne in the ende of the worlde.
                  Of late that commaundemente of
god, thou shalt not make to thy selfe
any grauen ymage, nor any similytude
or lykenes of any thyng in heauen
aboue, or in earth beneath, or in
the water vnder the earth, thou shalt
not bowe down to them nor worship
them: this comaundment of God (I
say) was grauen almost euery where
in churches, was learned of euery body
bothe younge and olde: whervppon
Images that prouoked the symple
and ignorant people vnto idolatry
(as the wise man saith) were taken
out of the churches, and straytly
forbidden that none should any wher
eyther bowe downe to them or worshippe
them: But now alas goddes
holy woorde is blotted and rased out
of churches, and stockes and stones
are set vppe in the place therof. God
commaunded his woorde so to be ordered
that it mighte be had in contynuall

remembrance at all times and
in euery place: and on the otherside
he forbad ymages and idoles so to be
eyther made or set in any place wher
any shoulde bowe or worshyp them:
But now alas, that which god commanded
is not passed vpon, and that
whiche he forbyddeth is masterfully
mainteined by falshed and craft, and
wickedly vpholden.
                  Of late al ministers that were admitted
to the publike office and mynistery
of goddes holy word, in their
admission made a solempne professyon
before the congregation that they
shoulde teach the people nothinge as
doctrine necessarie to attaine eternal
saluation, but that which is goddes
owne holy woorde or may be thereof
grounded without any doubt: wherby
vanished and melted away of thē
                     selues
many vaine yea wicked traditions
of man, as waxe before the fyer:
but nowe at one brunte they are
reuiued and are in ful hope all to returne
againe in as great strength as
euer they haue bene. And howe can

any man looke for any other thyng,
but whē you haue receiued the head,
you muste also receiue the whole body
withal, orelles how can the head
abyde? The head vnder Satan of al
mischiefe is Antichrist & his broode,
and the same is he which is the baby
lonical beast. The beast is he whervppon
the whore sytteth, the whore
is that Citie saithe Iohn in playne
wordes,Apoc. 17. which hath the empire ouer
the kinges of the earth. This whore
hath a golden cuppe of abhominations
in her hand, wherof she maketh
to drinke the kinges of the earthe, &
of the wine of this harlot hath al nations
dronke, yea and kynges of the
earth haue lyen by this whoore, and
marchauntes of the earthe by vertue
of her pleasaunte marchandise haue
ben made ryche.
                  Nowe what citie is there in al the
whole world that whē Iohn wrote,
ruled ouer the kynges of the earthe?
or what Citie can be redde of in any
tyme, that of the citie it selfe, chalē
                     ged
the empire ouer the kings of the

earth, but onely the citie of Rome, &
that sence the vsurpation of that see
hath growen to her full strenghe?
And is it not red that old and auncient
writers vnderstande Peters former
Epistle to be written at Rome,
and it to be called of him in the same
Epistle, in plaine termes, Babylō?
by the abhominations thereof I vnderstande
all the whole trade of the
Romishe relygion vnder the name &
title of Christe, which is contrary to
the only rule of al true religion, that
is goddes worde. What woorde of
god hath that dy
                        •
                     elishe drab for the
mayntenaunce of her manyfolde abhominations,
and to set to sel souche
marchaundise wherewith (alas the
madnes of man) the wycked harlott
hath bewitched almooste the whole
worlde? Dyd not Peter the true Apostell
of Christe, of whom this stinking
strumpette beareth her selfe so
high (but falsely and without al iust
cause) dyd not he I say, geue all the
worlde warnynge of her pelfe and
trashe, of her false doctours and apostles

(for this whoore and beast wyll
be called Dominus Apostolicus, who so
euer say nay) after this maner in his
later epistle? There was among the
people in tymes past false prophetes
as there shall be also amonge you in
time to come false teachers, whiche
shall priuily bringe in pestylent sectes,
euen denyinge the lorde whiche
hath bought them and redemed thē,
procuring to them selus swift damp
nation, and many shall followe their
dampnable waies, by whō the waye
of trueth shall be rayled vppon, and
through couetousnes by counterfaite
tales or sermons they shal (saith Peter)
make marchandise vpon you. &c.
And dothe not Iohn likewise in his
reuelation, after he hath reconed vp
a greate rablemente of this whoores
mystical marchandise, at the laste (as
though he wold knit vp al in playne
wordes, wythout any myst at al, settyng
out the whoores marchandyse)
recken vp amonge the rest, & concludeth
sayinge, Et animas hominū, yt is to
say, & the soules of men too? Wher,

vpon I pray you elles rose this true
prouerbe in latin, Omnia Rome venalia,
al things for money are set to sale at
Rome? Was not that a worthy cō
                     mendation
of Christes vicar in earth
that was written of our holy father,
one of the Alexanders a byshoppe of
Rome, thus I wene, in latine?

                        Vendit Alexander cruces: altaria Christum,
                        Vendere iuri potest emerat ille prius.
                     
These twoo verses in laten, I haue
red thus of one translated into englishe
rime.
                  Alexander our holy father the pope of Rome
                  selleth for money bothe ryght and dome
                  And al kind of holines ye holy father doth not stick
                  to set to sel, redy money for to get.
                  And eke Christ him selfe he dare be bolde,
                  to chop and chaunge for siluer and golde.
                  And why should any thinke this to be sore,
                  for what doth he sell but yt he bought before?
                  I graunte these verses to be lyght
gere, and the verse is but rude, but
alas such conditions were more wicked
and leude then any wytte coulde
expresse. If these had ben but the faltes
of one or a fewe in number, they

had ben lesse pernicious, and mighte
haue ben taken for personal crimes,
not to be imputed vnto that see, but
now alas the matter is more thē euident
to al that hath godly vnderstā
                     ding,
that these crimes be grounded
vpon lawes, be stablished by costom,
and set forthe by all kinde of wycked
doctrine, falshed, & craft, and therefore
are not now to be estemed for any
one mannes or of a fewe mennes
personal crimes, but are now by lawes,
costome, and doctrine incorporated
into that wicked see, & maketh
in dede the body of the beast whervpō
the abhominable whore doth sit.
                  But you wolde knowe whiche be
those marchandise which I said this
whoore setteth forthe to sell, for the
which al her false prophetes with al
theyr iuggelyngs & crafty gloses can
not bryng one 
                        •
                     ote of goddes worde.
Surely surely, they be not onely all
these abhominatiōs which are come
into the churche of England alredy,
wherof I haue spoken somwhat before,
but also an innumerable rablement

of abhominatious and wicked
abuses which now must nedes folow
As popishe pardons, pi
                        •
                     grymages,
Romishe purgatory, Romishe masses,
Placebo & dirige, with trentalles &
Scala coeli, dispensations & immunities
from all godly discipline, lawes and
good order, pluralities, vnions, and

                        •
                     ot quottes, with a thousande moo.
Nowe shall come in the flatterynge
fryers, and the false pardoners and
play their olde pranckes and knauery
as they were wonte to do. Nowe
you shall haue (but of the see of rome
onely, and that for money) canonysing
of suche saynctes as hath stoode
stoute in the popes cause, shrinynge
of relicques and from anye kynde of
wickednes (if you wyll pay well for
it) cleere absolution, a pena et cupla, wt 
thousandes of yeres, yea at euerye
poore byshops hande and suffragan
ye shall haue halowing of churches,
chapelles, altares, superalteres, chaleces,
and of al the whole household
stuffe and adornament, which shall
be vsed in the churche after the Romishe

guise, for al these things must
be estemed of suche hyghe pry
                        •
                     e that
they may not be done but by a consecrate
byshop only. O Lorde, all these
thinges are suche as thy apostles neuer
knewe. As for coniuringe (they
call it ha
                        •
                     owing, but it is coniuryng
in dede) of water and salt, of chrysteninge
of belles and suche like lyghte
thinges, what nede I to speake? for
euery priest that can but reade, hath
power (they say) not only to do yt but
also hath suche power ouer Chrystes
bodi as to make both god & man once
at ye least euery daye of a water cake.
After the rehersall of the saide abhominations,
and remembraunce of a
number of many mo, which (the lord
knoweth) yrketh me to thinke vpon,
and were to long to describe: when I
consider on the other side the eternal
worde of god that abydeth for euer,
and the vndefiled lawe of the Lorde,
which turneth the soule frō all wyekednesse,
and geueth wisedome vnto
the innocente Babes, I meane that
mylke that is without all gu
                        •
                     le, as

Peter doth call it, that good word of
god, that worde of truth, which must
be grauen within the harte, and thē
is able to saue mennes soules, that
wholesome sede, not mortall but immortal
of the eternal and euerliuing
God, whereby the manne is borne a
newe and made the chylde of God,
that seede of God whereby the man
of god so being borne can not sinne,
as Iohn saythe (he meaneth so longe
as that seede doth abide in him) that
holy scrypture whych hath not bene
deuysed by the wytte of manne, but
taught from heauen by the inspyration
of the holy ghost, whych is profitable
to teach, to reproue, to correct
to instruct and geue order in al righteousnesse,
that the man of god maye
be whole & sound, ready to performe
euery good woorke: when (I saye) I
consyder thys holye and wholesome
true woorde that teacheth vs truely
our bounden dewty towardes oure
lorde god in euery poynte, what hys
blessed wil and pleasure is, what his
infinyte greate goodnesse and mercy

is, what he hath done for vs, how he
hath geuen his owne only dere beloued
to death for our saluation, & by
him hath sent vs the reuelatiō of his
blessed wyll & pleasure, what his eternal
word willeth vs both to beleue &
also to do, and hath for the same purpose
inspyred the holy apostles wyth
the holy ghost, and sent them abrode
into all the worlde, and also made
them and other dysciples of Chryste,
inspyred by the same spyrit, to write
and leaue behynde theym the same
thynges that they taught, which as
they dyd procede of ye spyrit of truth,
so by the confessyon of all them that
euer were endued wyth the spirite of
God, were sufficiente to the obteyning
of eternal saluation: and lykewyse
when I consyder that all that
man doth professe in his regeneratiō
when he is receued into the holy catholyke
church of Christ, and is now
to be accounted for one of the liuely
members of Christes owne body, all
that is grounded vpon Goddes holy
worde, and standeth in the profession

of that fayth, and obedyence of those
cōmaundementes which are all contayned
and comprysed in Gods holy
woorde: and furthermore when I
consider whom our sauyoure Chryst
pronounceth in his gospel to be blessed,
and to whō Moyses geueth hys
benedictions in the law, what waies
the Lawe, the Prophetes, the Psalmes,
and all holy Scryptures bothe
newe and olde doth declare to be the
wayes of the Lord, what is good for
man to obtayne and abyde in Gods
fauour, which is that sayth that iustifieth
before God, and what is that
charity that doeth passe and excel al,
which be the properties of heauenly
wisedome, and whyche is that vndefiled
religion that is allowed of god,
whych thynges Chryst himselfe calleth
the weighti matters of the law,
what thing is that which is only auaylable
in Chryst, and what knowledge
is that that Paule esteemed so
much that he counted him selfe only
to knowe, what shall be the maner
of the extream iudgemēt of the later

day, who shal iudge, and by what he
shal iudge, and what shall be requyred
at our hands at that fearful day,
howe all thynges muste be tryed by
the fier, and that that only shal stand
for euer whych Christes wordes shal
allowe, which shal be the iudge of al
fleshe to geue sentence vpon al flesh,
and euery liuynge soule, eyther of eternall
damnation or of euerlastyng
saluation, from whyche sentence
there shall be no place to appeale,
no wytte shall serue to delude, nor
no power to wythstande or reuoke:
when (I saye) I consyder all these
thynges and conferre the same agayne
and agayne, all those wayes
wherin standeth the substance of the
Romishe relygion, (wherof I spake
before) it may be euydente and easye
to perceaue, that these two wayes,
these two relygions, the one of christ
the other of the Romishe see in these
latter dayes, be as farre dystaunte
the one from the other as lighte and
darkenesse, good and euyll, ryghteousnes
and vnrighteousnes, chryst

& Belial. He that is harde of beliefe,
let him note and way well with him
selfe the places of holye Scryptures
which be appointed in the margent,
wherevpon this talke is grounded,
and by Gods grace he maye receyue
some lyght. And vnto the contemner
I haue nothynge nowe to saye,
but to rehearse the saying of the prophet
Esaye, whyche Paule spake to
the Iewes in the ende of the actes of
the apostles. After he had expounded
vnto them the truth of Gods worde,
and declared vnto them Chryste out
of the lawe of Moyses and the Prophetes
from mornynge to nyghte all
the day long, he said vnto them that
woulde not beleue, well (sayde he)
spake the holi ghost vnto our fathers
sayinge, go vnto this people and tel
them ye shall heare with your eares
and not vnderstande, and seinge you
shall beholde, and not se the thynge,
for the harte of this people is waxed
grosse or, dull, and wyth theyr eares
they are harde of hearynge, and they
haue shutte together theyr eyes that

they shoulde not see, nor heare wyth
theyr eares, nor vnderstande wyth
their harts, that they might return,
and I shoulde heale theym, sayth the
lorde God. Alas England alas that
thys heauy plague of god should fall
vpon thee, alas my dere beloued coū
                     trey,
what thing is it now that may
do the good? Vndoutedly thy plague
is so great that it is vtterly vncurable,
but by the bottomles mercy and
infinite power of almightye Godde.
Alas my deare countrey what haste
thou done that thus thou hast prouoked
the wrathe of God to poure oute
hys vengeaunce vpon thee for thyne
owne deserts? Canst thou be contēt
to heare thy faultes tolde thee? Alas
thou haste hearde ofte, and wouldest
neuer amende. England, thy faults
of all degrees and sortes of men, of
the magestrates, of the mynisters, &
of the common people, were neuer
more plainly tolde, sence thou barest
that name, then thou diddeste beare
theym of late euen before the magestrates
in kynge Edwardes dayes,

but thou hardest them only and didst
amend neuer a whit. For euen of thy
greatest magestrats some (the kings
hyghnesse then, that innocente, that
godly harted, & pereles yong christian
prince excepted) euermore vnkindly
& vngētly against those that went
aboute most husely & most holesomly
to cure their sore backs, spurned priuely,
and woulde not spare to speake
euyl of them euē vnto the prince him
selfe, & yet would they towardes the
same preacher outwardelye beare a
ioly countenaunce and a fayre face.
I haue hearde that Cranmer and an
other whom I wyll not name,He meaneth hym selfe. were
both in high displeasure, the one for
shewinge his conscience secretly but
plainly and fully in the duke of Somersets
cause, and bothe of late, but
specially Cranmer for repugning as
they might against the late spoile of
the church goodes, taken away only
by cōmaundement of the hygher powers
wythoute any lawe or order of
iustice, and withoute any requeste of
consente of them to whome they dyd

belonge. As for Latymer, Leuer,
Bradford, and knoxe, theyre tonges
were so sharp, they rypped in so depe
in theyr galled backes, to haue purged
thē, no dout, of the filthy matter
that was festered in theyr hartes, of
insaciable couetousnes, of filthy carnality
and voluptuousnesse, of intollerable
ambitiō and pride, of vngodly
lothsomnes to heare pore mennes
causes, and to heare gods word, that
these men of all other, these magestrates
thē could neuer abide. Other
there were very godly men & wel lerned
yt went about by the wholesome
plaisters of gods word, how be it after
a more soft maner of handling of
the matter, but alas all sped in lyke.
For all that could be done of al handes,
their disease dydde not minishe,
but dayly didde encrease, whyche no
doubt is no smal occasiō in ye state, of
the heauy plague of god that is poured
vpō England at this day. As for
the cōmon sort of other inferior magestrates,
as iudges of the lawe: iustices
of peace, sergeantes, common

lawyers, it may be truly sayde of thē
as of the most parte of the Clergy, of
curates, vicars, persons, prebendaryes,
doctors of the law, archdeacōs,
deanes, yea, & I may saye of bishops
also I feare me, for the more part (althoughe
I dout not but god had and
hathe euer whome he in euery state
knew and knoweth to be his) but for
the most part I say, they were neuer
perswaded in their hartes but from
the tethe forward, and for the kings
sake in the truth of gods worde, and
yet all these dyd dissemble and bare
a copye of a countenaunce as if they
had bene 
                        •
                     ound within.
                  And thys dyssimulation Sathan
knewe wel enough, and therfore desyred
and hath euer gone about that
the hygh magestrates by any maner
of meanes might be deceued in matters
of relygion, for then he beinge
of counsell with the dissimulation in
the wordly, knewe wel enough that
he should bryng to passe and rule all
euen after his owne wyll.
                  Hypocrisy and dissimulation S▪
                     
Hierome doth cal well a double wickednes,
for neither it loueth ye truth,
(whiche is one greate euill) and also
falsely it pretendeth to deceyue the
simple for an other thing. This hipocrisy
and dissimulation with God in
matters of religion, no doubte, hath
wholy also prouoked ye anger of god.
And as for the common people, although
there were many good wher
they were wel and diligētly taught,
yet god knoweth a great number receaued
Gods true woorde and hyghe
benefites wyth vnthankful heartes.
For it was greate pitie & a lamentable
thinge to haue sene in many places
the people so lothsomly & so vnreligiously
to come to the holy cōmunion
& to receaue it accordingly, and to
the cōmon prayers and other diuine
seruice, which were according to the
true veyne of gods holy worde, in al
poyntes so godly and holesomely set
forthe, in comparison of that blynde
zeale and vndiscrete deuotion which
they had afore times to those things
whereof they vnderstode neuer one

whyt nor could be edifyed by thē any
thing at all. And again as for almes
dedes which ar taught in gods word
(wherby we are certayne that god is
pleased with them, and doth and wil
require such at our hands, which are
a parte of true religion as S. Iames
sayth, and suche as he sayth himselfe
he setteth more by then by sacryfice,
as to prouyde for the fatherlesse infants
and orphanes, for the lame, aged,
and impotent poore nedy folke,
and to make publyke prouision that
the pouertye that myghte laboure,
should haue wherwith to labour vppon,
and so be kepte from shamefull
beggery and stealing) in these works
I say, how wayward were many, in
comparison (I meane) of that greate
prodigalitie, whereby in times paste
they spared not to spende vpon flatteryng
fryers, false pardoners, painting
and gilding of stockes & stones,
to be set vp and honored in churches
plainly against gods worde. And yet
bicause no place is to be defrauded of
their iust commendacion, London I

must confesse that such godly works
in sir Dobs knight then lord Maior
his yere, began maruelious wel, the
Lorde graunt the same maye so likewise
perseuer, continue, yea and encrease
to the comforte & reliefe of the
nedy and helplesse, that was so godli
begon. Amen.
                  All these thynges doe mynyster
matter of more mournynge and bewaling
the miserable state that now
is, for by this it maye be perceayued
howe well Englande hath deserued
this iust plague of God.
                  And also it is greatly to be feared,
that those good thynges whatsoeuer
they were that had their beginnynge
in the time when Goddes word was
frely preached, nowe with the exyle
and banishmēt of the same, they wil
departe agayne.
                  But to returne agayne to the consideration
of thys myserable state of
Christes church in Englande, and to
leaue farder and more exquisite searching
of the causes therof vnto gods
secret and vnserchable iudgements,

lette vs see what is beste nowe to be
done for Chrystes lyttle selye flocke.
This is one Maxime and princyple
in Christes law: he that denieth me
before men, him shall Christ deny afore
his father and al his aungels of
heauen. And therfore euery one that
loketh to haue by Christ our sauiour
euerlasting life, let him prepare him
selfe so, that he denye not his master
Christ, or els he is but a caste away
and a wretch, howesoeuer he be coū
                     ted
or taken here in the worlde.
                  Nowe then seinge the doctrine of
antechriste is retourned agayne into
this realme, and the higher powers
(alas) are so deceaued and bewitched
yt they are perswaded it to be truth,
and Christes true doctrin to be error
and heresie, and the old lawes of antechrist
are allowed to returne wyth
the power of their Father agayne,
what can be hereafter loked for by
reason to the man of God and trewe
christian abiding in this realme, but
extreame violence of deathe or els to
deny his master. I graunt the harte

of prynces are in Gods handes, and
whether soeuer he will he can make
them to bowe, and also that christiā
princes in old time vsed a more gentell
kinde of punishment, euen to thē
which were heritikes in dede, as degradation
and depositiō out of theyr
rowmes and offices, exile and banishmente
out of their dominions & coū
                     treyes,
and also (as it is red) the true
bishops of christes church were somtimes
intercessours for the heretikes
vnto princes that they would not kil
them, as is red of S. Augustine. But
as yet Antechristes kyngedome was
not so erected at that time, nor is now
accustomed to order theym that wyll
not fal downe and worship the beast
and hys image, but (euen as all the
worlde knoweth) after the same maner
that both Iohn and Daniel hath
prophesied before, that is by violence
of death, and Daniell declareth farder
the kynde of death accustomably
should be by sworde, fier, and imprysonment.
Therefore if thou O man
of God, doe purpose to abide in thys

realme, prepare and arme thy self to
die, for, bothe by antechristes accustomable
lawes, and these prophecies,
ther is no apparance or likelyhode of
any other thinge, excepte thou wylte
deny thy master Christ, which is the
losse at the laste both of body & soule
vnto euerlastinge death. Therefore
my good brother or syster in Chryste
whatsoeuer thou be, to thee that cāst
and mayest so do, that counsel that I
thinke is the best sauegarde for thee,
both for thy bodi, and most suerty for
thy soules helth, is that which I shal
shew thee herafter. But first I warn
thee to vnderstande me to speake to
him or her which be not in captiuity
or called already for to confesse christ,
but is at liberty abrode. My counsell
I say therfore is this, to flie from the
plague and to get thee hense. I consider
not only the subtelties of sathā,
and howe he is able to deceiue by his
false perswasions, if it were possible,
euen the chosen of God, and also the
greate frailty whiche is often tymes
more in a man then he doth know in

himselfe, which in the time of temptation
then wyll vtter it selfe: I doe
not only consider these thyngs I say,
but that our master christ whose life
was and is a perfect rule of the christian
mannes life, that he himselfe auoyded
oftentimes the fury and madnes
of the Iewes by departing from
the countrye or place.
                  Paule like wise when he was sought
in Damasco, and the gates of the citie
were layde in wayte for hym, he
was conueyed by night, let down in
a basket oute at a windowe ouer the
wall, and Helias the prophet fledde
the persecution of wycked Iesabell.
And Christ our Sauiour saith in the
Gospell, when they persecute you in
one citie flie vnto another: and so did
many good greate learned and verteouse
men of god, which were great
& stoute chāpions neuerthelesse, and
stoute confessors and mainteyners of
Christ and his truth in due time and
place. Of such was the greate clarke
Athanasius. But this is so playne to be
lawfull by gods word & examples of

holy men, that I nede not to stand in
it. Hauing this for my groūd, I saye
to thee O man of god this semeth to
me to be the most sure waye for thy
sauegard, to depart and flie far from
the plague, & that swiftly also: for truly
before god, I thinck that the abhomination
that Daniel prophecied of
so long before, is now set vp in ye holy
place. For al antechrists doctrine,
lawes, rytes & religion, contrary to
Christe and to the true seruynge and
worshypping of god, I vnderstande
to be that abhomination: therefore
now is the time in Englād for those
words of Christ: Tūc, inquit, qui
                           •
                        n 
                           •
                        udaea
runt fugiant ad montes. Then, saith he,
marke this christes (then) for truly I
am perswaded and I trust by the spirit
of god, that this then, is cōmaunded:
Then, saith Chryst, they that be
in Iewry let them flie into the moū
                     taynes,
& he that is on the house top
let him not come down to take away
any thynge out of his house, and he
that is abrode in the fielde, let hym
not returne to take his clothes. Wo

be to the great bellied women and to
them that geue sucke, but pray saith
Christ, that your flight be not in winter
nor on the sabboth daye. These
wordes of Christ are mistical, & there
fore haue nede of interpretatiō. I vnderstand
all those to be in Iewryspiritually,
which truly cōfesse one true
liuinge god, and the whole trueth of
hys worde after the doctryne of the
gospel of Christ. Such are they whō
here chryst biddeth in the time of the
reygne of Antechrystes abhominations
to flie vnto the moūtains, which
signifieth places of safegarde, and all
such thinges whych are able to defēd
frō the plague. That he biddeth him
that is on the house top not to come
downe, nor him that is in the fyelde
not to returne to take with him hys
clothes, he meaneth that they should
spede them to get thē awaye betime,
least in their tarying & trifling about
worldly prouision, thei be trapped in
the snare, or euer they be aware and
caughte by the backe, and for gayne
of small worldly thinges endaunger

and cast them selues in to greate perilles
of more weighty matter. And
where he sayth wo to the greate bellyed
women, and to theim that geue
sucke: women great with childe, and
nigh to their lying downe, and to be
brought to bedde are not able to trauel,
nor also those women which are
brought to bedde, & now geueth their
babes sucke: by these therefore christ
spiritually vnderstādeth al such to be
in extreme danger (which this word
wo signifieth) all suche I saye, as are
soo letted by any maner of meanes,
that they no wayes be able to fly frō
the plague. That which christ saith,
praye that your flight be not in winter
nor on the sabboth day: In wynter
the common course of the yeare
teacheth vs that the wayes be foule,
and therefore it is a harde thing then
to take a far iourney for manye incō
                     modities
and daungers of the wayes
in that time of the yeare: and on the
sabboth daye it was not lawefull to
iorney but a little way. Now Christ
therefore meaninge that we shoulde

haue nede both to spede our iourney
quicklye, whiche can not be doone in
winter for the incommodities of the
wayes, and also to go far, which can
not be done on the Sabboth daye: he
biddeth vs therefore praye that oure
flight be not in winter nor on the sabboth
daye, that is, to praye that we
may flie in time, and also far enough
frō the daunger of the plague. Now
the causes why we shoulde flie, foloweth
in ye same place of s. Mathewes
gospel,Math. 24. which I now passe ouer: thou
maiest reade them there.
                  And in the 18. chapter of the Reuelation,
the aungell is sayde to haue
cryed myghtely wyth a loude voyce,
flye my people out of Babylon leaste
you be infected with her faultes and
so be made partners of her plagues:
for her offences and synnes are growen
so great that they swell and are
come vnto the heauen: certainly the
time doth approch and the lordes day
is at hande. Heare, I besech you, also
holye Paule, that blessed apostle: he
plainly forbiddeth vs ducere iugum cum

incredulis that is, to ioyne or couple
our selues wyth the vnfaithfull, for
what felowship can ther be (saith he)
of righteousnes wyth vnrighteousenes,2. Cor. 6.
what company hath light with
darknes, or what agremēt hath christ
with Beliall, or what parte can the
faithful haue with the vnfaithful, or
how doth the tēple of god agre with
images or idols, for you are the tēple
of the liuing god: as god hath said, I
will walke and dwell in them. I wil
be their god, and they shalbe my people,
wherfore depart from amongest
them and gette you from them, saith
the lorde, & touch no vncleane thinge
and I wyl receaue you and be to you
in the stede of your father & you shall
be vnto me as my sonnes and daughters,
sayth the almighty Lorde.
                  This counsel to depart the realme,
I doe not maruell if it do seme to dyuers
(euen of theim I meane ye beare
fauoure to godwarde) dyuersly. Many
(I trust) that he lerned shal thinke
the counsel good. Other there be per
aduenture that will thynke it rather

a thing to be more tollerable and yt it
may be in dede by gods worde lawefully
done, rather then to be coūsayled
to be done, for they wil (peraduē
                     ture)
saye, we shoulde counsell a man
alwayes to doe that which is beste of
all, and of most parfectiō, but boldly
in Christes cause to spend a mannes
life, is beste of all, and of most perfection,
and to flie it may seme to smell
of cowardnes. In many things, that
which is best for one at some times,
is not best for all at all times, and it
is not most perfection nor meete for a
child to couet to runne before he can
go. I wyll not make here a discourse
in thys matter what myghte here be
obiected, and what might be aunswered
againe: I leaue that to the witty
and eloquent men of the worlde.
                  This is my minde whych I would
thou shouldest knowe, o man of god,
as I would wishe and I doe praye to
almighty God it may be, that euery
true christian eyther brother or syster
(after they be called and broughte in
to the wrestlynge place, to stryue in

Christes cause for the best game, that
is to confesse the truth of the gospell
and of the Christian fayth in hope of
euerlasting lyfe) shoulde not shrynke
nor relente one ynche, or gyue backe
what soeuer shall befall, but stande
to their tackle, and styrke by it euen
vnto death, as they will Christ shall
sticke by them at the latter daye. So
likewise I dare not wishe nor coūsel
any, either brother or sister of their
own swinge to start vp into ye stage,
or to cast themselues eyther before or
farder in danger then tyme and nede
shall requyre: for vndoubtedly when
God seeth his time, and his pleasure
is that his glory shalbe set forth, and
his church edefyed by thy deathe and
confession, meanes shal be founde by
hys fatherly vniuersall prouydence,
that thou wythoute thine owne presumptuouse
prouocatiō, shalt be law
fully called to do thy feate & to playe
thy parte. The miserable ende that
one Quintus came vnto, may be a warninge
and a fearefull example for all
men to beware of presumption and

rashnes in suche thinges (as Eusebius
writeth in Ecclesiastica historia) for euermore.Lib. 4. Cap. 15.
                  
                  But a thirde sorte of men there be
which also wil be counted fauourers
of gods word & are, I feare, in nūber
farre mo and worse to be perswaded
to that which is the godly meane. I
meane of such as w
                        •
                     ll peraduenture
saye or thynke that my former counsel
which was, to

                     on of
the antechristian doctrine by departure
oute of the realme, is more then
nedeth, and other waies and meanes
may be found both to abide and also
to be cleare out of danger of the foresaide
plague. If that could be founde
in dede truly agreable to gods word
I woulde be as glad to heare it (god
is my witnesse) as who is the other.
                  Yes peraduenture wyll some saye,
thus it may be. Thou maist kepe thy
selfe, thy fayth, and thy religiō close
to thy self, and inwardly and priuatly
worship god in spirit & in truthe,
and outwardlye see thou be no open
medler, nor talker, nor transgressour

of common order: so mayeste thou be
suffred in the common wealth, & yet
vse thy relygion witho
                        •
                     te offence of
thy conscience. In other countre

And also howe can it be, but eyther

I say, thou muste eyther be a
breaker of these rites, lawes, and
costomes, and so bewray thy selfe, or
els if thou be in dede a man of God,
thou shalt offende thy conscience, for
in obseruinge of them thou shalte be
compelled to breake gods law which
is the rule of cōscyence to the man of
god. For how canst thou resort euery
holye day to the church and beare
a face to worship the creature for the
creatour (as thou must do) and peraduenture
cōfesse it to with thy mouth

and to sprynckle thy selfe with theyr
coniured water? Thou must be cōtributor
also to ye charges of al their popery,
as of bokes for antechristes seruice,
of lyghtes of the roode lofte, of
the sepulchre, for setting vp and painting
of images (nay in dede of idols)
and thou muste beare a face to worshyp
theym also, or els thou muste be
had by the back. Thou must serue the
turne to geue the holy loues, as they
call it, whiche is nothynge els but a
very mockery of the lords holy table.
Thou must be a cōtributor to ye charges
of al ye disgised apparel yt the popish
sacrificing priest, like vnto Aarō,
must play his part in. Yea when the
pardoner commeth about, or the flatteringe
frier to begge for the mayntenaunce
of supersticion, except thou
doe as thy neighboures doe, loke not
longe for to liue in rest. If any of thy
housholde dye, if thou wilte not paye
money for ringinge and singing, for
requiem masses, dirige, & commendations,
and suche like trumpery of the antechristian
religion, thinkest thou that

thou shalt be reckned for a catholyke
man or for Amicus Caesaris? A hundred
thynges mo may be reckned, & many
of more weyght and of more euident
superstitiō and Idolatrie, then some
of these which I haue now rehersed,
whiche god knoweth be ill enough:
but these are enough to declare and
to set before thine eies the thing that
I intende, that is if thou abyde and
wylt dwell in Englande, thou must
eyther do these and manye other mo
contrarye to gods worde, whiche forbiddeth
not onely the thynge whyche
is euyll, but also sayth, Ab omni specie
mali abstinete vos, absteine frō al things
that hathe any apparance of euyll: or
els if thou wilte not doe theim, howe
thou canst lyue in Englande in reste
and safe from the stake, trulye I can
not tel. But peraduenture (as a man
is redy to finde and inuente some coloure
to clooke his conscyence, to doe
that thynge that hys harte desyreth)
thou wilte say, thoughe at any tyme
I shall be forced to doe anye of these
thyngs and such lyke, yet wil I haue

no confidence in them, but outwardly
with my body: I wil kepe my hart
vnto god, & wil not doe that of mine
owne mynde willingly neyther, but
to auoyde an other inconuenyence: I
trust therfore God wyl holde me excu

                     t, thou saiest, god shal haue,
and yet wilte thou suffer thy body to
do the thing that god doeth abhorre.
Beware O mā, take hede what thou
saiest. Man may be deceaued, but no
man may deceaue God, for he is called
and is trewely 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      that
is to saye, the searcher of the harte.
Now to geue god thy hart is to geue
him thy whole harte, to loue him, to
dread him, and to trust in hym aboue
al other things. He that hath my cō
                     maūdement
sayth Christ, and obserueth

and kepeth them, it is he that loueth
me, and to dreade god aboue all
other, is rather willingly to incurre
the danger and peryll of all fearefull
thinges, then wyttinglye to doe that
thynge which is contrary to his blessed
wyll and commaundemente: and
to truste in him aboue all thinges, is
assuredly to truste to hys promyse of
his reward, and of hys tuition and of
his goodnesse and mercy, and to prefer
that aboue al thinges in ye world,
seme they neuer so strong, so wyse, or
so good. Now howe canste thou saye
truly, that God hathe thy harte after
this maner of sorte (which is to haue
thy harte in dede) when thy dedes do
declare far an other thinge? Thy body,
o man, is gods, and al the partes
thereof euen as thy soule is: he made
them both and Christ with his bloud
hath redemed them both, and is lorde
of both, for he hath boughte thē both
deare, & darest thou suffer any parte
of eyther of them to do seruice to Satan?
Surely in so doinge, thou committest
sacriledge and doest rob God,

thou de
                        •
                     ilest the liuely temple of the
liuing god if thou suffer thy body to
do sathan seruice. Do you not know
saith S. Paule, that your body is a
liuely temple of god? and may a man
then take and vse anye parte thereof
but in the seruice of God? No surely
it is not lawful so to doe so yt man of
god, neither with hand, tongue, nor
fote, nor any part of the whole body.
                  Doth not Paule commaund to the
Romaines, which pertaineth to euery
Chrystian soule: As you haue in
times past (saith he) geuen your members
to doe seruice vnto vncleanesse
and wickednes, from one wickednes
to another, so nowe geue your members
to do seruice vnto righteousnes
that you may be sāctified. And I prai
thee good brother, what doest thou
thinke is, to beare the marcke of the
beaste in the forhead and in the hand
that s. Iohn speaketh of? I know we
ought warely to speake of gods misteries
which he shewed by the spirit
of prophecying to his seruant Iohn,
yet to reade theym wyth reuerence,

and to praye for the vnderstandynge
of the same so much as god knoweth
is necessary for our time to knowe, I
thinke it necessary and good. Wherfore
what I suppose is to beare the
beastes marke, I wyll tell thee, and
commit the iudgement of mine interpretation,
as in all other thinges, to
the spirituall man. I suppose he beareth
the beast of Babilons marke in
his forhead, which is not ashamed of
the beastes waies, but wyll professe
them openly to set forthe hys master
the beaste Abaddon,
                     Apo. 9. And likewyse be
beareth his marke in his hands that
wil and doeth practise the workes of
the beaste with his power and hand.
And likewyse I will not lette to tell
thee, what I thincke to be sygned in
the forhead for the seruants of God,
whereof Iohn also speaketh, reckening
vp many thousandes so to haue
bene sygned of euery tribe. I suppose
he is signed in the forhead for the seruant
of god, whom god hath appointed
of his infinite goodnes, and hath
geuen him gra
                        •
                     e and strength▪ stoutly

to confesse him and his trueth before
the worlde. And to haue grace &
strength to confesse christ and the doctrine
of the crosse, and to lament and
mourne for the abhominatiōs of antechryste,
I suppose is to be sygned
wyth Tau whereof Ezechiell the prophet
doeth speake. Thus I suppose
these prophecies are spiritually to be
vnderstanded, and to looke for other
corporall markes to be sene in mens
forheads or in their handes, is nothing
els but to loke that ther should
come some brute beaste out of Babilon,
or some Elephante, Leoparde,
Lion, or Camell or some other suche
mōstrous beast with ten hornes, that
shoulde do all the wonderful things
spoken in Iohn: & yet of a beast speaketh
Iohn, but I vnderstande him so
to be called not for that he shalbe ani
such brute beaste, but for that he is &
shalbe the childe of perdicion, whych
for his cruelty and beastly maners is
well called a beaste.
                  The carnal Iewes knewe ther was
a promise made that Helias shoulde

come before christ Messias the anointed
of god, to prepare his waies: thei
knewe also there was a promyse of
Messias, that he shoulde come and be
a kinge & raigne in the house of Dauid
for euermore, but thei vnderstode
all so grosely & so carnally, that they
neyther knewe Helias nor Messias
whē they came, for they loked for Helias
to come downe from heauen in
his own persō, & for Messias to come
& raygne in worldly pompe, power,
riches & glorye, when as the prophecies
of both were spiritually to haue
bene vnderstanded: of Helias that he
should come not in person but in spirit,
that is, one which should be indued
with the spirit and giftes of grace
of Helias, which was in deede Iohn
Baptist, as christ himself dyd declare
to his apostles: & of Messias raygne,
all the prophets were to be vnderstā
                     ded
of ye raigne of his spiritual kingdome
ouer the house of Iacob, & the
true Israelites for euermore. And so
by that theyr grosse and carnall vnderstandinge
they mystake both Helias

and the true Messias, and when
they came, knewe neyther of theym
both. So likewise I feare me (nay it
is certain) ye world that wanteth the
light of the spirit of god, (for ye world
is not able to receaue hym, sayeth
Iohn) neyther doth, nor shall knowe
the beast nor his markes, though he
rage cruelly & liue neuer so beastly, &
thoughe his marked men be in number
like the sand of the sea. The lord
therfore vouchsafe to open the eies of
the blinde wyth the lyghte of grace,
that thei may see & perceaue, and vnderstand
the wordes of god after the
minde of his spirite. Amen.

                      of the
whole realme into a straunge lande:
but what of all these and a thousand
mo of the like sort? I wil set vnto thē
one sayinge of our Sauioure Christe
which vnto the faithful childe of god
and to the true Christyan, is able to
counteruaile al these, yea and to way
thē downe. Christ our sauiour saithe
in Luke: if any come to me and doe
not hate his father & mother (he meaneth

and wil not in his cause forsake
his father and mother) his wife, children,
and brethren, yea and hys lyfe
to, he cannot be my disciple: and who
soeuer doeth not beare hys crosse and
come after me he cannot be my discyple.
And in ye same place he declareth
by two parables, one of a buylder, &
the other of a king that is a warrier,
that euery man that wyl not in christes
cause forsake all yt euer he hath,
he can not be hys dysciple. Loke the
place who wil, the matter is so plainly
sette forthe, that no gloses nor cloking
of conscience to the man of god,
can serue to the contrary. Many plac
                        •
                     s
there be for the same purpose, for
the imbracing of christes crosse, whē
Christ and hys cause layeth it vppon
our backe, but thys is so playne that
I nede here to rehearse no more.
                  The latter reason & obiection wherof
I spake before, is of more force, and
includeth a necessitie which after the
common sayinge hathe no lawe, and
therfore it is more harde to shape for
it a good aunswere.
                  
                     
This may be obiected of some. Alas
sir I graūt all these thinges do greue
me, and because I vnderstande they
do not agre with gods worde whych
is the rule of my consciēce, I loth either
to loke on them or to heare thē.
But sir, alas, I am an impotēt man,
an aged man, a sycke manne, a lame
man, or I haue so many smal infants
and a lame wife, which all lyueth by
my labour and by my prouision, if I
leaue them, they shall sterue, & I am
not able to cary them with me, suche
is my state. Alas sir what shall I do?
And these causes may chaūce to some
men of god, whereby either it shalbe
for them vtterly impossible to depart
the coūtrey, or els in departing, they
shal be inforced to forsake such in extreame
necessities of whom both god
and nature hath commytted vnto thē
the care. Alas what counsell is here
to be geuen? O lamentable state, O
sorowefull harte that neither can departe,
and without extreame danger
and peryll is not able to tarye styll.
And these are they whom our sauior

Christ sawe before should be, and called
them in his prophecy of the latter
time, great bellied or trauelinge women,
and women that geueth after
they be broughte to bed, their small
babes sucke. The state of such as are
not able to fly the infection of the pestiferous
plague of antechrists abhominations,
Chryst lamentinge & not
cursing, sayth: wo be vnto the greate
bellyed and trauelynge women, and
women yt geueth suck in those daies.
For these alas my hart mourneth the
more, the lesse I am able to geue any
comfortable counsayle but this, that
alwaies, as they loke for euerlasting
life, they abide stil in the cōfession of
his truth whatsoeuer shal befall, and
for the rest to putte their trust nowe
wholy in God, whych is able to saue

plucked out of the mouth of the lion,

was brought in such trouble yt he loked
for no other thing but for present
death, & yet he that rayseth the deade

all other that he in troubles for christes
cause not to trust to thēselus but
in almighty God. Of gods gracious
aid in extreme perils toward them ye
put their trust in him, all scripture is
ful both olde & newe. What daūgers
were the patriarks often brought vnto,
as Abrahā, Isaac and Iacob, but
of all other Ioseph, & how mercifully
were thei deliuered againe: In what
perylles was Moyses: when he was
faine to flie for ye safegard of his life?
& whē was he sent againe: to delyuer
the Israelytes from the ser
                        •
                     yle bondage?
not before they were broughte
into extreame misery. And when dyd
the lord mightely deliuer his people

from Pharao his sworde? not before
they were brought in such straytes yt
they were so compassed en euery side
(the mayne sea on the one syde, & the
mayne hoste on ye other) yt they could
looke for none other; yea what didde
they▪ els in dede loke for then, but eyther
to haue bene drowned in ye sea,
or els to haue fallē on ye edge of Pharao
his sword. These iudges, which
wrought most wonderful thynges in
the deliuery of the people, were euer
geuen when the people was brought
to most miserye before: as Othoniel,
Aioth, Sangar, Gedeon, 
                           •
                        ephthe, Samson, And
so was Saul indued with strength and
boldnes from aboue, against the Ammonites,
Philistines, & Amalechites
for the defence of the people of God.
Dauid likewyse felt gods helpe most
sensibly euer in his extreme persecutions.
What shall I speake of the
prophetes of god whom god suffered
so oft to be brought into extreme perils
and so mightely deliuered theim
againe? As Helias, Hieremy, Daniel, Micheas,
and Ionas, and manye other whom

it were but to longe to rehearse, and
set out at large. And did the lorde vse
his seruantes otherwise in the newe
law after christes incarnation? Read
the actes of the apostles and you shal
see no. Were not thapostels cast into
prison and brought out by the mighty
hande of god? Did not the aungell
deliuer Peter out of ye stronge prison
& brynge hym oute by the yron gates
of the citie and set him free? And whē
I praye you? euen the same night before
Herod apointed to haue brought
him in iudgement for to haue slayne
hym, as he had a lyttle before kylled
Iames the brother of Iohn. Paule
and Silas, when after they had bene
sore scourged and were put into the
inner prison and there were layd fast
in the stockes, I praye you what apparāce
was ther that the magestrats
should be glad to come the next daye
themselues to thē, to desyer theym to
be contente and to departe in peace?
who prouyded for Paule, yt he should
be safely conducted oute of all danger
and brought to Felix ye Emperours

deputy? whē as both the high priests
the Pharisyes and rulers of ye Iewes
had conspired to requier iudgemente
of death against him, he being fast in
prison, and also more thē fourty men
hadde sworne eche one to other that
they would neuer eate nor drinke vntill
they had slaine Paule. A thynge
wōderful, that no reason could haue
inuented, or man could haue looked
for, god prouided Paule his owne sisters
sonne a younge man, that disaponited
that conspiracy and all their
former coniuratiō. The maner how
the thiuge cam to passe, thou maiest
reade in the .23. of the actes. I will
not be tedyous vnto thee here wyth
the rehersall therof.
                  Nowe to descende from the apostles
to the martyrs that folowed next in
christes church, & in them likewise to
declare howe gracious our good god
euer hath bene to work wonderfully
we them, which in his cause haue ben
in extreme perilles, it were a matter
enough to write a longe boke. I wil
here name but one man and one woman

that is Athanasius the great clerke
& godly man stoutly standing in christes
cause against the Arrians, & that
holy woman Blandina, standing so constantly
in all extreme paynes, in the
simple cōfession of christ. If thou wilt
haue examples of mo, loke and thou
shalt haue both these & a hundred mo
in Ecclesiastica historia of Eusebius, & in
Tripartita historia.
                  
                  But for all these examples both of
holy scripture and of other histories,
I feare mee the weake man of God
incombred with the frailty and infirmity
of the fleshe, wil haue now and
then suche thoughtes and guawmes
(as they cal thē) to run ouer his hart,
and to thynke thus: all theis thinges
which are rehersed oute of the scrypture,
I beleue to be true, & of the rest
truly I do thinke wel, and can beleue
them also to be true, but all these we
must nedes graūt were special miracles
of god, whych now in our dayes
are ceased we se, & to require them at
gods handes, were it not to tēpt god?
                  Welbeloued brother, I graūt such

were great wonderful works of god,
and we haue not sene many of suche
miracles in our time, eyther for that
our sight is not cleare (for truly God
worketh wt his, his part in all times)
orels bicause we haue not ye like faith
of thē for whose cause God wrought
such thinges: or bicause after that he
had set forth the truth of his doctrine
by suche miracles then sufficientlye,
the tyme of so manye myracles to be
done was expired withall. Which of
theis is the moste speciall cause of all
others, or whether there be anye othere,
God knoweth: I leaue that to
God. But knowe thou this my wel-beloued
in God, that Gods hande is
as strong as euer it was, he maye do
what his gracyous plesure is, and he
is as good and gracious as euer he
was. Man chaūgeth as the garment
doth, but god our heauenly father is
euen the same now that he was, and
shalbe for euermore.
                  The world without doubt (this I
do beleue, & therfore I saye) draweth
towardes an end, and in al ages god

hath had his owne maner, after hys
secrete and vnsearchable wisdome to
vse his elect, somtimes to deliuer thē
and to kepe them safe, and somtimes
to suffer theym to drinke of Christes
cup, that is to fele the smarte, and to
fele of the whyp.
                  And though the fleshe smarteth at
the one, and feeleth ease in the other:
is glad of the one, and sore vexed in ye
other: yet the lord is al one, towards
them in both, and loueth theym nolesse
when he sufferethe theym to be
beaten, yea and to be put to bodelye
death, then when he woorketh wonderes
for their maruelous deliuery.
                  Nay rather he doth more for them
when in anguish of the torments he
standeth by them & strenghneth them
iu their faith, to suffer in the confession
of the truethe and his faithe, the
bitter panges of death, then when he
openeth the prison doore and letteth
them go lose: for here he doth but respit
thē to an other time, and leaueth
them in daunger to fall in like peryl
agayne: and there be maketh theym

Perfect, to be without daūger, payne,
or peril after that for euer more. But
this his loue towardes theym, howe
soeuer the world doth iudge of it, is
all one, both when he deliuereth and
when he suffereth theym to be put to
death. He loued as wel Peter & Paul
when, after thei had (according to his
blessed wil, pleasure and prouidence)
finished their courses, and done their
seruices appointed them by him here
in preaching of his Gospell, the one
was beheaded, and thother was banged
or crucified of the cruell tyraunte
Nero, as the Ecclesiasticall historye
saythe: as when he sent the Aungell
to bring Peter out of prison, and for
Paules deliuery, he made all ye dores
of the prison to flie wide open, and ye
foundation of the same like an earthquake
to tremble and shake.
                  Thinkest thou O thou man of god,
that Christ our Sauiour had lesse affection
to the fyrste martyr Stephen,
bicause he suffered his enemies euen
at the firste conflicte to stone him to
death? No suerlye, nor Iames Iohns

brother, whiche was one of the three
that Paul calleth Primates or Principals
amongst ye Apostles of Christe.
He loued him neuer a whit ye worse
then he did the other, although he suffered
Herod the tyrants sword to cut
of his head, Nay doth not Daniel say
speaking of the cruelty of Antechrist
his time:Daniel. 11.

and of the lerned ther be, whiche shal
fal or be ouerthrowen ye they maye be
knowen, tried, chosen, & made white:
he meaneth, be furnyshed and scou

a new, picked and chosen; & made
freshe and lustre. Yf that then was

foresene for to be done to the godlye
lerned, and for so gracious causes, let
euery one to whome any such thinge
by the wyll of God doeth chaunce, be
mery in God, and reioyce, for it is to
Gods glory and to hys owne euerlastinge
wealth. Wherefore well is he
yt euer he was borne; for whome thus
graciouslye God hath prouided, hauinge
grace of God and strenghe of
the holy ghoste to stande stedfastly in
the height of the storme. Happy is he
that euer he was borne, whom God
his heauenly father hath vouchsafed
to appointe to glorify him, & to edifie
his church by ye effusion of his bloud.
To die in Christes cause is an hyghe
honour, to the which no man certainlye
shall or can espire, but to whome
god vouthsafeth that dignitie: for no
man is alowed to presume for to take
vnto himselfe any offyce of honoure,
but he whiche is there vnto called of
god. Therfore Iohn sayth wel, speaking
of them whiche haue obteyned
the victory by the bloud of the lambe
and by the worde of hys testimonye,Apoc. 12.
                     
that they loued not their lyues, euen
vnto death. And our sauiour Chryste
sayeth, he that shall lose hys lyfe for
my cause shall finde it. And this maner
of speache pertayneth not to one
kind of christians, as the worldly do
wyckedly dreame, but to all that doe
truly pertain vnto Christ. For when
christ had called vnto him the multitude
together wyth hys dysciples, he
saide vnto them (marke yt he said not
this to ye disciples and apostles only,
but he said it to al) whosoeuer wil so
low me let him forsake or deny hīself
& take vp his crosse and folow me: for
whosoeuer wil saue his life shal lose
it (he meaneth whosoeuer wil to saue
his lyfe, bothe forsake or leaue him &
his trueth) and whosoeuer shall lose
his life for my cause and the gospels
sake, shal saue it: for what shal it profit
a man if he shal winne the whole
worlde and lese his owne soule? hys
owne life? or what shall a man geue
to recompence that losse of his owne
life and of his owne soule? Whosoeuer
shall be ashamed of me and my

words (that is to confesse me and my
gospell) before this adulterous & sinful
generation, of him shal the son of
man be ashamed when he cōmeth in
the glory of his father, with the holy
aungels. Know thou O man of god,
that all thinges are ordeyned for thy
behofe and to the furtherāce of thee,
towardes thy saluation. All thinges
(saith Paule) worketh with the good
to goodnes, euen the enemies of god.
and such kind of punishments wherby
they go about to destroye theym,
shall be forced by Goddes power,
might, and fatherly prouidence, for
to do them seruyce.
                  It is not as the wycked thinketh,
that pouertie, aduersity, sycknes, tribulation,
yea paynefull death of the
godly, be tokens that God doeth not
loue theym: but euen cleane the contrary,
as al the whole course of scripture
doth euedently declare: for then
he wold neuer haue suffred his most
deare beloued ye Patriarches to haue
had such troubles, his prophetes, his
Apostles, his Martyrs and chiefe chā
                     pions

and maintainers of his trueth
and gospel

they were slain with the sword, they
wandered vppe and downe in sheepe
skins and Gotes skinnes, being forsaken,
afflicted and tormented, suche
men as the worlde was not worthye
to haue, wandringe in wildernesses,
in mountaines, in dennes and caues
of earth. All these were approued by
the testimony of fayth, and receiued
not the promise, bicause god did prouide

they shuld not be consūmated. They
tary now for vs vndoubtedly lōging
for the day. But they are commaunded
to haue patience yet, sayeth the
lord, a littel while, vntil the number

of their fellowe seruauntes be fulfilled,
and or, theyr brethren whych are
yet to be slaine, as they were.
                  Now thou O man of God, for our
Lords sake, let vs not for the loue of
this life, tary them to longe, and be
occasion of delay of that glorious cō
                     summation,
in hope and expectation
wherof thei departed in the lord, and
the which also ye liuing end
                        •
                     ed with
Gods spirit, ought so earnestly to desire
and to grone for with al the creatures
of God. Let vs all with Iohn
the seruant of God, cry in our harts
vnto our sauiour Christ: Veni domme
Iesu, come Lorde Iesu come. For then
when christ which is our life, shalbe
made manifest and apeare with him
in glory, thē shal the children of god
appeare what thei be, euen like vnto
Christ: for this our weake body shall
be transfygurated and made lyke vnto
Christes glorious body, & that by
the power wherby he is able to subdue
vnto himself all thinges. Then,
that which is now corruptible, shall
be made incorruptible: that is nowe

vyle, shal thē be made glorious, that
is nowe weake, shal rise then mighty
and strong, that is grosse and carnal,
shalbe made fine and spirituall,
for thē we shal see & haue ye vnspeakable
ioy and fruition of the glorious
maiesty of our lorde euen as he is.
                  Who or what then shall let vs to
ieopard, to leopard? yea to spend this
life which we haue here in Christes
cause? in our lorde God his cause? O
thou therefore man of god, thou that
arte loden and so letted lyke vnto a
great bellied woman▪ that thou canst
not fly the plague, yet if thou lust after
such things as I haue spoken of,
stand fast what soeuer shall befall in
thy maysters cause: and take thys
thy letting to fly, for a calling of god
to feighte in thy maister Christe hys
cause. Of this be thou certaine, they
can do nothing vnto thee, which thy
father is not aware of, or hathe not
foresene before: they can do no more
then it shal please him to suffer them
to do for the furtheraunce of his glory,
edifyinge of his church and thyne

owne saluation. Lette them then doe
what they shal, seing to thee O man
of God, all thinges shall be forced to
serue, and to worcke with thee vnto
the best before God. O be not afraide
and remember the ende.
                  All thys whiche I haue spoken for
the comfort of the lamentable case of
the man whō christ calleth the great
bellied woman: I meane to be spokē
likewise to the captiue and prisoner
in Gods cause: for suche I count to
be as it were already summoned and
prested to fight vnder the banner of
the crosse of Chryste, and as it were
souldiours allowed and taken vp for
the Lords warres, to do to their lord
and maister good and honorable seruice,
and to stycke to him as men of
trustie seruice in his cause euen vnto
death, and to thinke their life lost in
his cause, is to winne it in eternall
glory for euermore.
                  Therefore now to conclude and to
make an ende of this treatise, I saye
vnto all that loue God our heauenly
father, that loue Christe Iesus oure

redemer and Sauioure: that loue to
folowethe wayes of the holy ghoste,
which is our comforter and sanct

of all: vnto all that loue Christes
spouse and body, the true catholicke
churche of Christe, yea that loue life
& ther owne soules health: I say vnto
all theis, harken my deare brethrē
and sisters, all you that be of God, of
all sortes, ages, dignities, or degre:
harken to the worde of our sauioure
Iesus Christe spoken to his Apostels
and ment to all his in Saincte Mathewes
Gospell:Math. 10. Feare not theym
whiche kyll the bodye, for they can
not kil the soule: but feare him more
whiche maie destroye and caste both
bodye and soule into 
                        •
                     ell fyer. Are
not twoo small-sparrowes 
                        •
                     old for a
mite and one of them shal not fal or
light vpon the ground without your
father? All the hears of your head be
numbred. Feare them not, you are
much more worth then are the littel
sparrowes. Euery one then that confesseth
me before mē, him shal I likwise
confesse before my father, which

is in heauen. But whosoeuer shal denye
me before men, I shall denye him
likewyse before my father whyche is
in heauen.
                  The lord graunt vs therfore of his
heauenly grace & strength, that here
we may so confesse him in this world
amongest this adulterous and sinfull
generation, that he maye confesse vs
again at the latter day, before his father
which is in heauen, to his glory
and our euerlasting comforte, ioy and
saluation.
                  To our heauēly father, to our sauiour
& redemer Iesus Christ,
and to the holy ghost, be al
glory and honor now
and for euer
Amen.

                  Thomas Pirry to the Christian reader,
in commendacion of that worthy
man of god Iohn Careles.
                  
                     MUch care did carefull Careles bide,
                     in time of Romishe rage:
                     Whē flesh & bloud with fier was tried,
                     to make mennes faith to swage.
                  
                  
                     But god be thanked for his grace,
                     who did him so defende:
                     that in the truth he ran his race,
                     and made a godly ende.
                  
                  
                     No man more carefull for the crosse,
                     of Christe his sauinge health:
                     no man more careles for the losse,
                     of frendes and worldly wealth.
                  
                  
                     When he was hated and abhorde,
                     of Cayphas and his sede:
                     he cast his care vpon the Lorde,
                     and Careles was in dede.
                  
                  
                     For why? he knewe that worldly power,
                     no farther coulde procede:
                     then god, whose worde doth still endure,
                     already had decrede.
                  
                  
                     And that the Lorde would in the ende,
                     worke all things for the best:
                     when of great mercy he shoulde sende,
                     his soule to ioyfull rest,
                  
                  
                     
                        
In hope wherof he careles was,
                     and ready to the stake:
                     if god so woulde, he did not passe:
                     such ende on earth to make.
                  
                  
                     But gods will was he should not die,
                     such death in open sighte:
                     wherefore in prison ioyfully,
                     to Christ he yelde his sprite.

                  ¶The grace and free mercy of God in Iesus
Chryst, the swete consolations of the holy
ghost, the guide of all Gods dere children
be with you, strengthen and
comforte you my derely beloued
swete sister K. E.
nowe & euer. Amen.
                  
                     AL be it, my derly beloued
syster in Chryste, that as
yet we dyd neuer see one
an other personally to any
knowledge, yet by the
vertuous reporte, that I haue heard
of you, and also by the large louynge
token that I haue receaued frō you,
my thinke that I doe euen presently
see you, & beholde your person, faithfully
walkinge in the feare and loue
of god, ioying and reioycing with you
in ye spirite as though we were swetly
talkynge together of Christes veritie.
The lorde god do I humbly besech
in the bowels and bloude of our
lorde and sauyour Iesus Christ, that
he will strengthen vs both, wyth hys
holy and mighty spirit, that we may
constantly continue in the confession

of his truth vnto the ende: that lyke
as we nowe see one another presently
in spirite, we may also see one another
personally in the glorious presence
of God, and his holye aungels.
where vndoutedly, we shal know one
an others personage, to oure greate
ioy, felicity, and endles comfort. And
now therfore deare sister K. be strong
in the Lord our god, for doubtles the
time of trial is at hande: a great persecution
with cruell murtherynge of
gods deare sainctes is like to be very
shortly in this wofull wicked realme
of England. Therfore dere sister, for
the loue of God, prepare you to the
crosse with all diligence, and make
your selfe ready to die with Chryste,
that you may also liue with hym for
euer. There is no remedy, if you wil
be Christes disciple, you muste nedes
take vp your crosse, and follow him,
for the disciple must not loke to be aboue
his master, nor the seruaunt to
be better intreated, then his lord. Yf
we were of the world (good sister) no
doubt the worlde would loue vs.
                  
                     
But for as much as Christ hath chosen
vs out of the world to serue God
in spirite and veritye, let vs be well
assured the worlde will hate vs & persecute
vs, as it hath done our lorde &
master Chryste. But yet let vs be of
good chere, for Christ hath ouercome
the worlde. The payne is but shorte
that we can fele here, but the plesure
is perpetuall that we shall feele els
where. Let vs set before vs the exā
                     ple
of Christe, which abode the crosse
and despised the shame, in respect of
the ioy that was set before him: Euē
so let vs consider, for whose sake wee
suffer, whose cause we defend, & what
glorious reward we shal haue at the
day of our victory, and then doubtles
the consolation of these thinges will
make sweete all our sufferinges, and
sone swallow vp al the sorowes that
we are sowsed in for Goddes sake. I
could recite diuers texts of the scripture
to confirme this poynt. But I
nede not, for I am well assured that
you do know them most perfectly all
ready. The lorde geue you strength &

assiste you with his holy spirite, that
you maye continuallye walcke in all
points accordīg to your godly knowledge:
And then shall you not doe as
the moste parte of our Gospellers doe
nowe a dayes, the more is the pitie.
There are a greate manye in Englande,
that doe perfectly knowe, that
the idolatrous masse is abhominable,
diuelyshe and detestable in the sighte
of God. And yet, alas they be not afrayde
to pollute and defyle theyr bodies,
whych ought to be the tēples of
the holy ghost, with being present at
it, so synning agaynst God and their
owne conscience. But dere syster K.
doe you flie from it, both in body and
soule, as you would flie from the very
diuell himselfe. Drinke not of the
whore of Babylons cup by no meanes,
for it will infecte the body & poyson
the soule. Be not partakers of her
sinnes (saith the aungell) least you be
partakers of the plagues, that shortly
shalbe powred vpon her. O what
an araye is this? that so manye that
knowe gods truth, will nowe tourne

agayne and defyle them selues in the
filthy puddle of antichristes stinking
religiō. They go about to saue theyr
liues with their double dissimulatiō,
but doubtles, they shall lose euerlasting
life by it, if they do not repente
in time and turne vnto the lord. But
deare sister, my truste is, that you doe
vtterly abhorre the comminge to any
such thinge. I hope that you wil not
by anye meanes turne backe into Egypte
nowe, but that you wil boldly
venter through the wildernes of troble
& persecution, that you may come
into the lande that floweth wyth all
kinde of heauenly pleasures & ioyfull
delectatiōs, and possesse the same for
euer. Let vs cōsider, howe that euery
one of vs doth owe vnto god a death
by nature, and howe sone the Lorde
will require it of vs, we knowe not.
O howe happy are we then, if god of
his goodnesse appoint vs to paye natures
det with suffringe for his truth
and Gospelles sake, and so makynge
vs his faythfull wytnesses wyth the
prophetes, apostles, martyres, & confessours,

yea with his dearly beloued
sonne Iesus Christ, to whom he doth
here begin to facion vs lyke in sufferynge,
that we might be like him also
in glory. Thus my derely beloued
sister, I haue ben bold to trouble you
a littel with my rude and simple letter,
beinge made in haste as it doeth
apeare. Yet I desier you to take it in
good woorthe, as a token of my pore
zeale vnto you, & to accepte my good
will. And if it please god to spare me
life and libertye. I truste hereafter to
write vnto you more largelye. Fare
ye well deare sister K. E. the Lorde
blesse you and all youres, and powre
vpon you the heauenlye dewe of hys
grace. The lord endue you with plentifull
knowledge of his veritye, and
fill you with his holye and mightye
spirite, that you may continually reioyce
in the cōfortes of the same now
and euer. Amen. Praye, pray, praye,
with stedfast fayth.
                  
                     Your daily Orator Ihon Careles prisoner
of the Lorde at al times abydinge hys most
merciful wil and pleasure.

Careles sent to the same party.

so largely extended vnto me: euen so
am I not able to declare, how much,

bound to geue god most hūble praise
and continuall thankes for you, and
on your behalfe. Before God I speak

whose humble hart and lowly spirit
doth to me presētly appeare in youre
most godly and louing letter, blessed
are you, and all such meke handmaides
of ye lord. For doubtles you shall
be eralted in that day, when ye proud
persones of the world, and hygh minded
Pharaseys shall be cast downe.
God for euermore bee blessed, who
hath geuen you (contrary to nature)
such a meke & humble hart. For vpō
al such (he saith himself) his holy spirit
shal rest, which promis is ful wel
verified on you: which holy spirite of
his, is the good guide and leader, yea
the only teacher and instructer of all
the lordes deare electe children. And
as it hath trulye taught you to caste
your selfe down (as it is most conuenient)

euen so will it rayse you vp agayne
(as I doubt not but it hath already
done, and set you vppon a high
rocke of stone, wheron you shal stand
sure, and dwell safe for euer: I meane
vppon Iesus Christe, on whom your
fayth is fyrmely built, so that the gates
of death or hell, shall not finallye
preuaile against the same. Selah. But
as I do righte well on your parte admit
the similytude of ye faythful wife
of Cana, which came to Christ for to
haue her daughters helth, wyth whō
you may be well compared, bothe for
fayth, and humble mekenes: euen so
I wyll in no wyse allowe, that you
should so much exalt me (a moste vyle
wretched sinner, yea slime, earth, and
asshes, and a verye lumpe of Adams
dunge) as though
                        •
                      there were some
thinge in me, in respecte wherof you
should thinke your selfe vnworthy to
call me brother, Alas, what am I (in
respecte of my selfe) but a depe and a
damnable sinner, yea suche a one, as
daily doth deserue not only this long
enprisonment, and death which now

knocketh at my dore, but also Gehenna
and hell fier, if God for his sonne
Christe his sake did not forgeue the
same, I meane my sin, which partlye
hath prouoked God to plage all thys
Realme. Therfore my deare sister, if
you thinke your self vnworthy to cal
me brother, let it be only in respecte
that I am moste vnworthye of that
name. Otherwise you must consider,
that you maye (and I trust dailye do)
boldly call Iesus Chryst the eternall
sonne of God your most deare and louing
brother, who by his death hath
brought you life, and hath made you
the childe of God, and felowe heyre
with him, of the kingdome of heauē,
whither he is also ascended for your
possession takinge, and hath thereto
left with you in pledge his pure and
holy spirit, as a sure earnest penye of
the same, wherwith I am right suer
we are bothe sealed vnto the daye of
redemption. That spirite certifyeth
our spirit, that we are the true adopted
sonnes of God, and therefore we
maye boldlye call him deare father:

then must I nedes be youre brother,
and so I pray you cal mee: god make
me worthy of that name. And where
as you deare hart, do desier to be refreshed
wyth the fruitfull water of
life, which floweth forth of the holye
ghost, the fountain of al grace: I say
with Christ that blessed is your hungry
soule, for it shall be wel satisfied
with that heauenly manna, which
                        •
                     
maketh the eaters thereof to liue for
euermore. For God hath geuen you
his spirite, which hath taught, and
doth still teach you, what you ought
to beleue, and how to lyue according
to the same, as hitherto you haue
done, youre light so shininge before
men, that god hath ben and is greatlye
glorified by the same. Therefore
be you certaine & suer, that God will
likewise glorify you with him self in
euerlasting glory. For as ye lord did
know and elect you for his before the
foundation of the worlde was laydi
                        •
                     :
so hath he called you by the syncere
preaching of his holy gospel. And as
he hath truly called you, so doeth he

moste mercyfullye iustifye you of his
free grace and fauor. And as he doeth
iustifye you, or repute you righteous
in his syghte: so wyll he glorify you
with a crowne of immortality in his
kingdome for euer. Read the eight to
the Romaines for your consolation:
and put your truste in God, who careth
for you, and will kepe you in his
safe custody, free from all the assaultes
of your cruel aduersarie: thoughe
in hys myscheuous members he doe
transforme himself into an aungel of
light, moste craftelye to deceaue, yea

                        •
                     uen the very elect, if it were possible
for him so to do. I perceaue dear sister

                        •
                     k. that you haue met wt some of the
greuous wolues, whych are fearslye
entred in amongest the sely sheepe of
Christ to scatter them. I knowe well
that you haue bene sore assaulted of
the Papistes. But I am sure they
shall not preuayle agaynst you. For
their cruel tyranny and all the rest of
their diuelyshe doinges, is so directly
against the word of God in all poyntes,
that they can not beguyle you

thoughe they woulde neuer so fayne.
Perchaunce you haue also bene troubled
with oure spronge vp heretykes
the Arrians and Anabaptistes. God
keepe you and all hys deare chyldren
forth of theyr wycked companye: for
verily they are a crafty kinde of men,
and many a gentle harte and symple
soule, they do full sore abuse, & depely
deceyue, bryngyng them far from the
sincere fayth of Christe, and from the
pure vnderstanding of his holy word,
though in their outward appearance
they would seme as holy as any flatteryng
frier. If any such come about
you to perswade you from that euerlasting
truth, which was taught you
in the dayes of oure late good kynge
Edwarde, by those worthy witnesses
whych haue sealed ye same wyth their
bloud: let thē not come wythin your
dores, neither bid thē once god spede,
If I were sure that any suche blynde
prophetes did go about to lead you in
to the dike of darknes, I wold take a
litle more paine for your sake. I haue
sente vnto my good brother Henry

Iones of Witney, a true and christiā
confession of my faith, the whiche I
would wishe you to reade, and in all
points to be ruled thereby. My good
brother Richard Brice will help you
to it well inough: I haue spoken to
him and to my brother Henrye also.
Ah deare sister, these be the daungerous
dayes, in which Christ did prophecye,
and Paule, and Peter also,
that manye false Prophetes shoulde
appeare, & bring in damnable sectes,
euen deniyng the lorde that boughte
them, as these diuelishe Arrians do,
in denying Iesus Christ to be the ternall
son of God, of one substance and
equal with the father. But my deare
hart in the lord be of good chere. For
though this tyme of darkenes, be neuer
so daungerous to the cage of vncleane
and hatefull birdes, that can not
abide the light, that is to say, the
congregation of Sathan whiche had
no lust to beleue the truth, and therfore
God hath sent them stronge delusion
to beleue lyes: yet the sure
grounde of Ged, remayneth still, and

hath his seale, which is the spirite of
trueth: The lord knoweth them that
are his, and hath committed them vnto
Christe his keping, who will lose
nothinge of that whiche his father
hath geuen hym, but will raise it vp
at the last day. yea for his chosē sake,
the Lorde hath saide, these sorowful
dayes shalbe shortned, of which most
happy number, whose names are registred
in the booke of life, my firme
faith is, that you are one, as by your
stedfast faith, and fruits of the same,
it doth appeare. And wheras you say
that my simple letters haue bene a
stay and comfort to you, I am moste
glad therof, & do most hartely prayse
God therfore: that God of his greate
mercy will vse me poore miser of the
worlde, as his instrument or meane
to doe good to anye one of hys deare
saincts. And I do moste hartely desier
you to forgeue mee my great neglygence
towardes you, in that I haue
not more oftner written letters to
you, seing that you do so well esteme
them as you do. But if god spare me

life, I wyll be a littell more diligent
to write vnto you, then heretofore I
haue bene. And as for my pore prayer,
as you haue bene, so shal you continually
be sure of it. I truste you doe
also remember me in youres, as your
large and louing dedes do declare no
lesse. Ah good syster what doe you
meane to sende me fo rich a token. Alas
you make me sory to se how carefull
you are for me, and what greate
cost you haue bestowed vppon me a
most vnprofitable member in Christes
church. But verily I do perceiue
whereaboute you go. You are minded
to bring God a great deale into your
debt, and to put your money vnto a
godly vsury, according to the sainge
of the wise man: He that hath pitye
vpon the pore (saith he) lendeth vnto
the lord, and loke what he laieth out,
it shalbe paid him againe. The lorde
recompence your pitiful hert, which
is so careful for the children of God
in the time of their captiuity. God be
blessed who hath made you so chereful
in geuinge, and diligent in well

                     
                        ••
                     ing, for verely the time is at hand,
that you shal reap without ceasing,
the fruit of eternall life. Therfore be
of good chere, for they that now sow
their good sede with teares, shal thē
reap their full sheues with gladnes,
and god shal wipe al teares frō their
eyes for euer. Cast all your care vpon
the lord, and commit your soule and
body vnto him as vnto a faithful creator:
for doubtles deare sister, he cō
                     tinuallye
kepeth you, and careth for
you. The moste and principall thing
that God requireth of you, is, that
you be fullye perswaded, that he careth
for you, and that he is your god
and most deare louinge father, and
wilbe so for euer. Without this faith
and true perswasion, you can not
please him, you can not commit and
betake your selfe wholye vnto hym,
you can not truly feare him, or loue
him in dede, you can not call vppon
him, or hartely pray vnto him. Therfore
let this be your alone and continuall
endeuor, to be confirmed more
and more of this, that God is youre

most beare louinge faher, throughe▪
Iesus Christ, that he hath a most tē
                     der
care ouer you and for you, as
alwaies he hath had, and alwais wil
haue, both in soule and body, for this
lyfe and for eternall lyfe, howsoeuer
thinges appeare and seme vnto you.
According as you beleue, so shal it be
vnto you, and as you think God wil
bee vnto you, so shall you fele hym:
Think therfore swetelye of the lorde
and his goodnes, and pray for the encrease
of faith, whiche God graunte
vnto vs both for his mercies sake. Amen.
Thus, most deare and faithfull
sister, for this time I make an ende,

felinges of his eternal mercies, be most effectuously
wrought in your hart, and grauen in

                     AS the dailye occasions
whyche happen to me,
deare sister in the lord,
puttinge me in remembraunce
of my mooste
happy departure and final
deliuerāce to be at hand, do moue

my pore hart to much spiritual mirth
and gladnes in the lord, euen so doth
the daily remembrance of you, and other
the deare sainctes of God (whom
I shall leaue behynde mee) engender
much sorow and sadnes, euen to my
very soule, to se in what a miserable
worlde you must remaine, subiect to
our deserued plages bothe spirituall
and tēporal. In respect wherof, as I
daily make mention of you in my cotinual
prayers, that God wil protect
you vnder the wynges of hys mercy,
from al things that may be hurtfull
eyther to soule or bodye: so haue I
thought it good, yea, & my very bounden
duty, to write these few lines vnto
you, as well to comfort you, what
soeuer crosse it shal please the Lorde
to lay vpō you, as also to warne you
to walke circumspectly, as the chylde
of light, least at any time the darkenes
should ouertake you, as it is like
to doe those foolishe virgins, whiche
haue let their lampes go out alredy,
ye bridegromes cōming being so nigh
at hand, as suerly it is not far hence,

as it appeareth both by ye prophecies
of the holy scriptures, & also by daily
exāples, wherof we haue experience.
God for his Christes sake geue vs al
grace diligently to watch and pray,
that we maye be readye prepared for
that longe desired daye. Amen. My
deare sister K. cal to your remēbrance
always the great loue and mercifull
kindnes that God your most deare louing
father hathe from time to time
extended vnto you, speciallye in that
he would vouchesafe to geue for you
his owne only & dearly beloued son,
in whome was and is all his whole
pleasure and delighte, vnto the verye
death of the crosse, yea and that whē
you were his very enemy, the chylde
of wrath, the bonde seruaunt of Sathan,
and a very fierbrand of hel, and
should haue so remained for euer. Cō
                     sider
also, howe he hathe geuen you
with his swete sonne, al thinges necessary
either for bodye or soule, yea
all that euer is in heauen and earth,
and hath made you by him, heire vnto
himselfe, and owner and possessor

of al that euer he hath. In consideratiō
wherof, you ought so to loue him
againe, that nothinge should be able
to seperate you from him: yea of very
loue only you ought to serue him
in such holines and righteousnes, as
is accept before him, all the dayes of
youre life: and also to abstaine moste
willinglye, from all thinges that be
detestable in his sighte, what daunger
so euer shoulde ensue to you for
the same. But in dede, my dear hart,
to be plaine with you, I doe heare to
my great grief that the due consideration
of this greate loue and infinite
mercy of god, hath not yet effectuously
wrought al these aforesaid things
in you, according to my lōng expectacion:
but it is enformed me by credible
persons▪ that you, notwithstanding
the great loue of God towards
you, and the excellent knowledge he
hath so graciouslye geuen you before
many other, doe yet manye times defile
your faith, or mariage garment,
with comming into the companye of
filthy idolaters, at the time of theyr

Antechristian seruice. Trulye if it be
so, it is a token that the great abundant
bottomles loue & mercy of God
towardes you, hath not yet in suche
sorte ben considered of you, that it
hath (as it ought to haue done) swalowed
vp all the vaine loue of the
worlde. Ah, where is true faith become,
and liuely seling of Gods mercy,
that were wont to make the children
of god diligent to kepe Goddes
commaundementes, and merilye to
beare his crosse? But perchaunce you
do not thinke it a breaking of Gods
commaundementes, to goe to the Idols
temple, and to bee present with
the papistes at their supersticious seruice.
&c. But god forbid you should be
so ignorāt, after so many instructiōs,
in so great & weightye a matter. For
surely the vnknowen sicknes is most
daungerous euermore, as experience
teacheth. But I verily thinke, at the
least wise I hope, that youre knoweledge
is so great in these things, that
the daunger in being partaker with
the wicked, is not hid frō your eyes.

Therfore your fault is so muche the
greater, & the sorer punishmēt is due
for the same. But my vndoubted
trust is, that almighty God our most
deare louinge father, wyll not leaue
you in your weaknesse, but wil rayse
you vp agayne, by true and earnest
repentance, and geue you such grace
and strength of his spirit, that henceforth
you shalbe so far from cominge
to anye of theyr abhominable superstition,
that you shall be able well to
persuade this bearer, and many other
the sainctes of God from the same. I
knowe deare harte that thys thinge
which I requier of you, wil bryng a
great crosse vnto you, as well at the
handes of your husband, as of many
other your worldly frendes and foes.
But let not that discourage you any
thing at all, syth you are one of the
chosen children of God, to whom hys
crosse doth specially belonge. Let not
tribulation for righteousnesse sake,
seme a straunge thing vnto you: but
rather reioyce and be glad, that God
will vouche you worthye of so great

dignity. For trulye it is the greatest
honor, that God can bringe his elect
vnto in this mortall life: I meane to
make them his witnesses to ye world,
and to make them worthye to suffer
for his sake, which thinge is not permitted
to the highest Angell in heauen:
albeit I beleue they wolde more
reioyce thereof, then in all the glorye
they haue. Oh whye are we then so
loth to come to this great promotiō,
seing it is the verye ordinance of god
vppon all his deare chyldren, as
S. Paule affirmeth, saying: To you
it is geuen not only that you should
beleue in Iesus Christ, but also that
you should suffer for his sake. Again
he saith: all that will liue godlye in
Christ Iesu, must suffer persecution.
Oh what cause haue we to reioice, if
it please God, by suffringes to make
vs some thing cōformable to the passions
of our swete Christ, who fyrste
suffred for vs, and afterward entred
into his glorye? Wee haue in thys
world nothing so much to reioice in,
as that we are made meete to be vnder

the crosse with Chryst. For therby
are we assured, not onlye that the
glorious spirite of god resteth vpon
vs, but also that we shall reign with
Christe, and bee glorifyed together
with him, who hathe testified with
his owne mouth, that they be blessed
which suffer persecution for righteousnes
sake, for theirs (saieth he) is
the kingedome of heauen: into the
which we must also enter by manye
tribulatiōs. Happy is he (saith christ)
that endureth to thend.Apoc. 2. Be faithfull
vnto death (saith the holy ghoste) & I
will geue thee a crowne of life. &c.
But what mean I to make so long a
circūstance vnto you, my deare hart,
who knoweth al these things as wel
or better then I? Oh that you hadde
the grace and strēgth to do al things
accordinge to youre knowledge: I
meane, concerning the fleing frō Idolatry,
and suffering for the truth.
As for al other things, I know you
are vnspotted, praised be god for you.
Oh that you durste pledge me of the
same cup, (if need do requier) wherof

the lord of our glory hath not refused
himself to drinke before vs, and hath
left vs an example to folow his fotesteps,
that he might crowne vs wyth
his owne glorye, and most precious
giftes. Oh lord helpe thy deare children
that wold faine come vnto the,
and loke not narowly vpō our sins,
which are the cause of oure long absence
from thee, but couer theym for
thy Christes sake, with the mantell
of thy manifold mercies, whyche far
surmounteth al thy workes, that we
may not be ashamed, but reioyce at
thy most glorious comming, ye which
do thou hasten according to thy promise,
for thy chosens sake. We haue
deare sister, bene of longe season acquainted
with this earthlye old man
of ours to much, which is ful of sin,
and presseth downe sore our vnderstāding,
that it is needful for vs to be
tried throughe manye trybulations,
that the rust therof myght be worne
awaye, that we might be made mete
vessels for the lordes owne vse, and
be sanctifyed to honour. Happy is he

that endureth chasticinge. Whyche
blessing (my good sister) God offereth
vnto vs at this present, yea, and him
selfe also as our moste deare louinge
father. Let vs willingly embrace him
therfore, and geue thankes vnto his
name, that hath triumphantly gottē
victorye ouer al our ennemies, and is
now pleading our cause on the right
hand of God his father, in the kyngdome
of heauen, where he kepeth possession
for vs. To whom if we direct
oure eyes wyth a stedfast fayth, wee
shal not nede to feare, neither death,
synne, nor hell, for theyr whole power
is taken awaye, and Christes
righteousnes maketh aūswer for vs.
Yea he is wholy ours with al his merites,
mercies and moste swete sufferinges,
and we are his for euermore:
so that we may boldly say, the lord is
our helpe, and therfore we wyll not
feare what man maye do vnto vs, for
he is but fleshe, and his breath is in
hys nostrels: but the strengthe of the
lord, and the power of his word endureth
for euer: vnto the whyche let vs

stedfastly trust, & then shal we not be
confounded. My deare frend & faithful
sister K. thynke no vnkyndnes in
me, that I write thus boldlye vnto
you: for verily it is of pure loue and
a true hart that I beare vnto you, as
I am most depely bound, yea double
and treble. I haue plentifully reaped
your temporal things, god recōpence
you for it. And ought not I thē much
more to sow vnto you some of those
spyritual thinges, wherewyth God
hath blessed me? yes truly: and euerlastynge
woe and damnation were
most due and suer vnto me, if I did it
not. God for his christes sake, forgeue
me my great neglygence in thys behalfe
towardes you, and al the rest of
hys deare children, whome I loue
in the lord, as mine owne soule, and
thanke God most hartelye, that you
do me likewyse, whych am most vnworthy
of the same. God geue me the
spirite of prayer, that I maye therewith
supply some part of my duty towardes
you: for verily I am farre in
your debt, and so am like to die. But

my suer trust is, that my good God,
for whose sake I lose lyfe and goods,
and al earthly commodityes, wyl abundantly
recompence you wyth his
blessyng, both spirituall and temporal,
and in the ende bringe you vnto
me, in the place of perpetual ioy and
quietnes, where we shal rest from al
our labors, and remaine together for
euermore. There shall we most perfectly
know one another personally:
thoughe in thys lyfe we are not like
to doe so, for I am alredy proclaimed
heretike at Paules crosse, I prayse
god most hartily for it. For nowe I
know I shal shortly be with him, for
whose sake I am so called: and shalbe
yet more solēnely ye sūday after Trinity
sunday, doctor Harpesfield saith▪
I thanke him for his paines. For he
hath geuen me good warning to prepare
my selfe ready against the daye
of slaughter: whiche time is not yet
in their handes, for all their bragges
and proud bostinges, but in the good
wil & determinatiō of my most deare
God, and louinge father. And right

suer I am, that they (I meane my enemies)
and if al the diuels in hell do
helpe theym, can not shorten my life
one minute of an howre, otherwyse
then GOD hath appoynted, for his
glory and my eternal profit. Therefore
vpon him wil I cast all my care,
& be careles, according to my name,
in spite of theym all, and tell them I
will, when I come before them, that
God doth laughe al their doinges to
scorne, and shortlye wyll bringe all
their counselles to naught, to their
owne vtter confusion, if they be not
conuerted. For whiche thing let vs
praye to him, whiche onelye is able
to doe it, and wyl, when he seeth hys
good time and pleasure. In ye meane
space, the same LORDE geue
vs hys peace and pacience, with plentiful
consolation and ioye in the holy
ghost: who gouerne, guyds, lead and
conduct vs vnto the very end. Thus
yet once agayne I commit you vnto
Goddes moste mercyfull defence,
who euer haue you, and all youres,
in hys blessed keping. The blessinge

of God be wyth you euermore. Amen.
