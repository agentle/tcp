            A true report of certaine wonderfull ouerflowings of Waters, now lately in Summerſet-ſhire, Norfolke, and other places of England: deſtroying many thouſands of men, women, and children, ouerthrowing and bearing downe whole townes and villages, and d

            To the Reader.
            
               REader I haue to theſe late accidents (whereby ſome parts of this our kingdom haue bin punniſhed) added ſome other, that hapned in the yeare 1570. to the intent that by comparing the one with the other, Gods Iuſtice and mercy may both be ſeene: If thoſe Waters of his wrathe (powred downe then,) we are more cruell then theſe. It is a ſigne (and a comfort let it bee vnto vs) that he doth but ſtil threaten & ſhake the rod, for no doubt but our faults at this time are as great as in thoſe daies: If this affliction laide vppon our Countrey now, bee ſharper than that before, make vſe of it: tremble, before warned, Amend▪ leaſt a more feareful puniſhment, and a longer whip of correction draw blood of vs. Farewell.

                  ALbeit that theſe ſwelings vp and ouerflowings of waters proceed from natural cauſes, yet are they the very diſeaſes and monſtrous byrthes of nature, ſent into the world to terrifie it, and to put it in mind, yt the great God, (who holdeth ſtormes in the priſon of the Cloudes at his pleaſure, and can enlarge them to breed diſorder on the Earth when he growes angry) can aſwell now drowne all mankind as he did at the firſt: But yt by theſe gentle warnings, he would rather haue vs come vnto him, and flye from the points of more deadly Arrowes of vengeance, than vtterly to periſh. Hee fils out the meaſures of his chaſticement according to the quality and proportion of our offences: for as the Waters tranſgreſſe and break their bounds, to the deſtruction of the fruites of the earth and to the taking away of the liues of man and beaſt.
               
                  So haue we that ſhould bee ſubiects to the Almighty King, and (by our oath of Chriſtianity) ought and are bound to paye fea
                     •
                  ty & allegiance to our Lord and Maſter, gone beyond the bankes and limits of all obedience, to ye taking away of his loue, without which we cannot liue, and to the vnrecouerable vndoing of our owne ſelues.
               Sinne ouerflowes our ſoules: the Seas of all ſtrange impieties haue ruſht in vppon vs: we are couered with the waues of abhomination and vncleannes: we are drowned in the black puddles of helliſh iniquity: wee ſwim vp to the throates, nay euen aboue the chins in Couetouſnes, in extortion, in ſenſuality, in enuy one againſt ye other, in contempt of our Maieſtrates, in neglect of our lawes, and in violation of thoſe divine ſtatutes, the breach of which is a condemnation to death and that Death, and euerlaſting liuing in Hels fire.
               Many a time haue we bin ſummoned to an account for theſe riotous abuſes & miſſeſpending the talents put into our hands, we haue ſhifted it off with counterfet ſorrow for what wee haue done, and with promiſes to become faithfull ſeruants, and new men; yet grow we worſe at noone, than we were at ye ſuns riſing, and at his going down he bluſheth to behold vs in our nautines. To a ſtrict & ſtrange audite therfore doth God not only cal ſome of our countrymen now on ye ſoden) but alſo to afright vs the more to make vs

look about, doth he ſtrike our Cattle with diſeaſes: he takes away the liues of our beaſts fit for labor: he deſtroies the Corne-fields, & threatens vs with famine: he vndermines our houſes with tempeſts, to make vs feare a deſolation. Read therefore, and reade with trembling theſe his late dreadful iudgmēts, mocke not our ſelues with vaine hopes, but know that if earthly fathers may be drawne away to forget their owne children, our heauenly father may by the vilenes of our ſouls be drawne to ſhake off his own people. Liſten then how he menaceth, and ſtand amazed at the wonders of his wrath.
               In Ianuary laſt (towards the end of the moneth,) the ſea at a flowing water meeting with Land-floudes, ſtroue ſo violently toge

                  her, that bearing downe all thinges yt vvere builded to vvithſtand and hinder the force of them, the bankes were eaten through and a rupture made into Somerſet-ſhire. No ſooner was this furious inuader entred, but he got vp hie into the Land, and encountring vvith the riuer Seuern, they both boild in ſuch pride that many Miles, (to the quantity of xx. in length, and 4. or 5. at leaſt in bredth) were in a ſhort time ſwalowd vp in this torrent. This Inundation began in the morning, & vvithin few houres after, couered the face of ye earth thereabouts (that lay within the diſtance before named) to the deapth of xi. or xii. foot in ſome places, in others more. The daunger yt this terible tempeſt brought wt it▪ wrought

much feat in the harts of all that ſtood within the reach of it, but ye ſoden and ſtrange cruelty of it, bred the greater terror and amazement. Men that were going to their labours were compelled (ſeeing ſo dreadfull an enemy approching) to flye backe to their houſes, yet before they could enter, death ſtood at the dores ready to receiue them. In a ſhort tyme did whole villages ſtand like Iſlands (compaſſed rounde with Waters) and in a more ſhort time were thoſe Iſlands vndiſcouerable, and no where to be found. The tops of trees and houſes onely appeared (eſpecially there where the Countrey lay lowe,) as if at the beginning of the world townes had been builte in the bottome of the Sea, and that people had plaide the huſbandmen vnder the Waters.
               Who would not haue thought this had bin a ſecond Deluge! for (at one time theſe inhabited places were ſunke cleane out of ſight. Hunsfielde (a Market Towne in the ſayde Shire) was quite drowned. Grantham a village vtterly ouer-flowne. Kenhouſe another village couered all ouer. Kingſon a thyrd village likewiſe lies buried in ſalt Water. So (beſides other ſmall cottages ſtanding in valies) is Brian Downe a Village quite conſumed. Adde vnto theſe peopled places, the loſſe of Marſhes, Corne-fieldes, Paſtures, Meddowes, and ſo forth, more then can hee numbred: the miſery of it no man can Expreſſe.
               
                  In this ciuill Warres betweene the Land and the Sea, many Men, women, and Children, loſt their liues: to ſaue which, ſome climbed vppe to the tops of the houſes, but the rage of the merciles tide grew ſo ſtrong, yt in many, yea moſt of the Villages aforenamed, the Foundations of the buildlngs being waſhed away, the whole frame fell down, and they dyed in the waters: Others got vp into trees, but the trees had their rootes vnfaſtened by the ſelfe-ſame deſtroyer, that diſioynted barnes and houſes, and their laſt refuge was patiently to die.
               A lamentable ſpectacle was it, to beholde whole heards of Cattle, ſtruggling for life with the flouds, Oxen in great numbers were earyed away with the ſtreame, and looked like ſo many Whales in ye Sea: their bellowing made a noiſe in the water as if it had bin a tempeſt, and that ye Sea had roared. The flocks of Sheep that are vtterly deſtroied by this Land-wracke are innumerable, none knowes the loſſe for the preſent but the owners of them: But the whole land wil I feare feele the ſmart.
               A number of moſt ſtrange ſhapes of daunger did this monſtrous byrth of waters bring forth: of which (for the rarenes) I will ſet downe ſome, and none but thoſe that are true. There was a poore Man (a Houſholder) dwelling in one of the Villages aforenamed, heaing ſeauen Children: who (in this generall perill) not knowing howe to beſtirre himſelfe, was deſirous to ſaue ſo much of his goods as poſſibly hee could: But the violence of the ſtreame multiplying more and more

vpon him: It came into his minde to prouide rather for his Children: his goodes therefore hee left to the mercy of that which hath no mercy, and louing one of his Children aboue all the reſt, hys feare draue him to run about for the ſafety of that onely. At laſt the danger that had rounde about (and within doores) ſet vpon him and his family, was ſo great, that hee could neither defend that his deereſt Childe, nor the reſt, but hauing much ado to get life for himſelfe, hee left them and hys whole houſhold periſhing in the torrent, he getting vp to the top of the houſe, and ſo eſcaping. An infant likewiſe was found ſwimming in a Cradle, ſome mile or two frō ye place where it was knowen to be kept, and ſo was preſerued, for the Cradle was not of wicker as ours are here, but of ſtrong thicke bordes, cloſely ioynted together, & that ſaued the infants life. The ricks of peaſe in diuers places being vndermined at the bottomes, were lifted vp mainely from the ground, and ſwum vp & downe in the whole bulke, amongſt which a cō
                  pany of Hogs, and Pigs, being feeding vpon one of the ricks, and perceiuing it to go away more & more frō thē, they got vp to ye top, and there maintained thē in eating. Nay which is more ſtrange, conies in great numbers being driuen out of their borroughes by the tyde, were ſeene to ſit for ſafety on the backs of ſheepe, as they ſwom vp & down and at laſt were drowned with them.
               A poore ſhepheard likewiſe being in the fielde, ſome of his ſheepe were ſtrayed from the reſt, when the waters began to come in vpon the Countrey, which he perceiuing, ran with all ſpeede to fetche

them in, hoping to ſaue al: but before he had done, hauing much ado to ſaue himſelfe, he was fayne to leaue them, and with his bag & bolte, to climb vp into a tree: there hee ſaw the confuſion of hys whole flock: they ſwom too and fro bleating for helpe, he ſatte tearing his hayre and beating his breſts; crying mainly out but could not ſaue thē: when they were all ſlaine before his eies, he wept then more bitterly to thinke vpon his owne tragedy which he ſaw was now to be acted: he feared drowning, yet hee feared ſtaruing more then drowning: he had ſome victuals with him in the tree: but he knew not how long this ſiege of waters woulde keepe him in that rotten bulwarke. At length (when he was almoſt pincht to Death with cold) hee eſpyed a boat which the Country had ſent out to ſaue others, to that he called, and in that recouered life.
            
            
               Briſtow.
               
                  NOw bend your eies vpon the Citty of Briſtowe, and there beholde as much cauſe of lamentation as in any place of this realme, that hath taſted of the like miſery. In the ſelfe ſame Moneth of Ianuary, and much about ye very day, did an arm of the North ſeas break in (at a ſpring tide) which ouerflowed not onely the banckes, but almoſt all the whole Country round about.
               All Brent-Marſh is couered ouer: betweene

                  Barſtable and Briſtow the Sea ſwelled vp as hye as Bridgewater. Al the low grounds are not onely hidden wt this ſtrange deluge, but in danger (by the opinion of men) to be vtterly laſt. Whole houſes were remoued from the grounde where they ſtood, and ſloat vp and downe like ſhippes (halfe ſunke.)
               Their Corne-mowes and hay-mowes are caryed away with the ſtreame and can neuer be recouered. All theyr fat Oxen that could not ſwim are drowned: with ſuch a forcible aſſault did the Waters ſet vpon the inhabitants, that they who were in theyr houſes, and thought themſelues ſafeſt, could hardly make way for theyr owns liues: by which meanes a number both of men, women, and children periſhed: theyr deade bodies floate hourely aboue-water, and are continuallys taken vppe: It cannot yet be knowne, howe manye haue fell in this Tempeſt of Gods fearful iudgement.
               Moſt of the goodes both of Cittizens heere in London that were ſent thither, and of the inhabitants dwelling there, as alſo the Rugs & ſuch other commodity which came from Irelande, to the fayre of Saint Paule, which was now to bee kepte there, are (to an infinite value, and to the daunger of many a mans vndoing) vtterly ſpoiled and caſt away. Goods in dry-fats, and whole packes of Wares are daily taken vp, but paſt all recouery euer to bee good againe. This deluge hath couered this part of the country by the ſpace of ten miles ouer in length, at leaſt vppe towards Bridgewater, Many thouſands of pounds cannot

make good the loſſe which the Countrey onely hath heereby receiued. God graunt there enſue no ſecond miſery vpon this, worſe to our kingdome, than this Plague of Waters.
               
                  The miraculous deliuery of a Gentleman from death when it had round beſet him in the midſt of the waters.
                  
                     A Gentleman dwelling within foure miles of the ſea (betwixt Barſtable & Briſtow) walking foorth one morning to view his groundes, caſt vppe his eyes toward the Sea-coaſt, and on the ſudden was ſtruck into a ſtrange amazemēt, for he beheld an extraordinary ſwallowing vppe of all the earth, that had wont to lye viſible and leuell to his ſight: he coulde ſcarce tell certainely whether he ſtood vpon the ground which he was ſure the day before was his owne: Hils, and valies, Woods, and Meddowes ſeemed al to be either remoued, or to be buried in the Sea: for the Waters a farre off ſtood to his iudgement many yards aboue the earth: he tooke them at firſt for Mountaines and heapes of clouds, but feare being driuen baeke (with a courage and deſire in him to ſaue himſelfe from this iminent daunger) home comes hee with all ſpeede that he coulde to his owne dwelling: relates to his wife what hee had ſeene, and the aſſured perill that was preparing to ſet vppon them, and (with all) Counſels her and his whole Family to beſtirre themſelues, and to gette (with ſuch prouiſion and Goodes as they coulde eaſily conuay away) higher vppe into

the Country, to ſome one of his friendes. All hands preſently layd about them, (as if that enymies had bin marching to beſeidge the Towne) to truſſe vp whai they could and be gone.
                  And beholde, how ſwift is miſchiefe when God driues it before him to the puniſhment of the World? All were laboring to beare away ſome of the goods, but before their burdens could bee taken vp, they were compeld to leaue them, and to look about for their liues. The fardels which they had bound vp to ſaue from drowning, ſome of them were glad to leap vppon to eſcape drowning themſelues.
                  The Gentleman with his Wife and Children got vp to the higheſt building of the houſe: there ſat hee and they vppon two rafters, comforting one another in this miſery, when their heartes within them were euen dead to themſelues from all comfort: they now cared not for their wealth, ſo they might but go away with their liues: and yet euen that very deſire of life, put him in mynde to preſerue ſomething, by which afterward they might liue, and that was a Boxe of Writinges, wherein were certaine bonds, and all the euidences of his Landes: this Boxe he got, with the hard aduenture of much daunger: he tyed it with cordes faſt to

                        •
                     after, hoping what wracke ſoeuer ſhould ouer browe the reſt of his ſubſtance, his mayne eſtate ſhould bee found ſafe, and come to ſhore in that hauen.
                  But alas in the midſt of this ſorrofull gladneſſe, the Sea fell with ſuch violence vpon the houſe,

it bore avvay the vvhole building, rent it in the middle from top to bottom, they that could not get vp to the higheſt roomes, vvere put to a double death, drovvning and brayning. In this ſtorme the Huſband and Wife loſt one another: the Children and Parents were parted: the Gentleman in this whirle-wind of Waues, being forced from his hold, got to a beame, ſat vpon that, and againſt his will rode poſt ſome thrée or foure Miles, till at length encountring with the ſide of a hill, (of which lighting place hee was ioyfull) there he crept vp, and holding notwithſtanding his ſafety ſtill in his hand: there ſat he inuirond with death, miſerably powring out teares to increaſe ye waters, which were already too aboundant: and to make him diſperate in his ſorrowes, the tirranous ſtreame preſented vnto him the Tragedy of his deere Wife, and deereſt children, She, they, and his Seruants were whorried to their deaths by the torrent before his face, & drowned doubly, in his teares, and in the waues. Yet becauſe he ſhould not be altogether the onely ſlaue of miſfortune in this Sea-fight, nor be more tryumphed-ouer then others that fell in the battaile. At length (a little to fetch life into him which was vpon departing) he ſpyed his Boxe of writinges (bound as they were to the rafter) come floating towardes him: that he ventured once againe to ſaue, and did ſo, and in the end moſt myraculouſly came off likewiſe with his owne life.
               
               
                  
                  Of another Gentleman, that hauing a voyage to make on horſe-backe, ended it riding after a ſtrange manner.
                  THere was another Gentlemanne in the ſame Countrey likewiſe, who being newlie married, determined one morning to take his Gelding, and to ride forth to a Towne not many miles diſtāt from his owne dwelling, there to bee merrie: his horſſe for that purpoſe ſtood readie ſadled and brideled, he himſelfe had drawne on one of his Boats, but before he could fit his Legge to the other, the winde came about, the point of his compaſſe was changed, his voyage by Lande was to bee made by Water, or elſe not at al. For the Sea had ſo béegyrt the houſe, broken in, lifted of the doores from their hynges, ran vppe into all the Chambers, and with ſo dreadful a noyſe tooke poſſeſſion of euerie Roome, that he yt was al this while but half a horſeman, truſted more to his owne legges than to the ſwiftnes of his Gelding.
                  Vppe therefore he mounts to the very top of all the houſe, the waters purſued him thither, which he perceiuing, got aſtride ouer the Ridge and there reſolued to ſaue his life, but Neptune belike purpoſing to try how wel he could ride, cut of the maine building by the middle, leauing the vpper part ſwimming like a Flemmiſh Hoy in fowle weather.
                  The Gentleman beeing driuen to goe what pace that would carry him which hee ſate vppon, helde

faſt by the Tiles, and ſuch things as he could beſt lay hold on, and in this foule weather, came he at length (neither on Horſe-backe, nor on foote, nor in a Veſſell fit for the Water) to the very Towne, where in the morning hee meant to take vp his Inne.
                  A number of theſe ſtrange Tragi-comicall Scaenes haue been acted vpon this large Stage of waters: It would ſwell into a Maſſie Volume to Chronicle them all: let theſe therefore which I haue deliuered vnto you, bee ſufficient, as a caſt of Gods Iudgements: theſe are ynough to make you know hee is angry, let them likewiſe be inough to make vs ſtudie how to allay his anger.
                  Adde vnto theſe, the ouerflowings in Herefordſhire, Gloceſter Shire, and in diuers Shires in Wales, bordering vppon the Sea, where many liues haue beene loſt, both of Man and Beaſt: of all which when the particulars are truely knowne, they ſhall bee truely publiſhed to our Countrey: till then make vſe of theſe.
               
            
            
               Norfolke.
               NOr let other Countreys inſult ouer this: as if their robes of ſeeming puritie (inuented by the Diuell and his Iourney-men) were a defence or Armour of proofe againſt the Iudgements of Heauen: they ſtand all within diſtance, this late and fearefull Inundation of water makes it apparant.
               
                  For iuſt the ſame month of the yeare, weeke of the month, and almoſt day of the ſame weeke, In the Countrey of Norfolke, not farre from Kings Lyn, in a place called March-land, happened accidents, though not altogether ſo violent and mortall as thoſe in Summerſetſhire, yet accompanied with much damage, and no little danger. About the xx. of this preſent month of Ianuarie Anno. Dom. 1607. The cheefe violence of winter, being (as they by many rurall obſeruations had quoted) almoſt ſpent: The Mariſhes, & Fens, by reaſon of the yeeres temperature, ſomewhat drye, and more forward than in other yeares, euerie man to his abilitie, layd out what money hee could ſpare vppon Heiffors, and ſuch other young ware, emptying their purſes of Crownes to cram the Fens with Cattell, little thinking the water would haue made one, and like a new Broome haue ſweeped all cleane, as ſhortly it did.
               The Fens thus ſtored with Cattell, Horſe, and Bullocks, for it is not vnknowne what hanocke the rot had made with ſheepe in the beginning of Winter, which dyed in ſuch aboundaunce, that euen Dogges grewe wearie of them.
               The rot hauing begun, and in a manner made an end of Sheep, in comes the water as a ſecond and more violent inuader, and ſweepes away what the rot had left behinde.
               It happened vpon a night, for when is danger more wakefull than when preuention ſleepes, and

not ſo much as dreames of his Furie, A couple of Horſ-courſers, or to attyre them in a courſer litter, Horſe-ſtealers, knowing the night, a gowne to cloake their villanie, came ſneaking into the marriſh with an intent to make a Market of what was none of their owne. And draue ſo many of the Cattell as they thoght ſit vp into the higher grounds: but in the meane time they were hotly purſued with a fearefull Hu and cry, not of Conſtables, but ſwifter followers (Viz:) the water, which hauing broken out at an old breach, in a quarter of an houre, or a very little portion of time, ouerflowed the Marſh, and that with ſuch vnreſiſted violence, yt they were enforced to leaue their praye (which ſuch fellowes ſeldome vſe to doe) fal to prayer, and to take them to their heels, and of all the Cattell in that Marriſh, (being very many in number) fewe or none were preſerued, but thoſe which they had fetched vp with an intent to ſteale: for being ouertaken, or rather ouerrunne by the ſwiftneſſe of the Water, they were dryuen ſome into Creekes, ſome into Buſhes, and ſome vpon little Hillocks, and ſo eitheir loſt, dryuen away with the Water, or in concluſion drowned.
               Theiwoo good fellowes (againſt their willes made good) Seeing what preſent daunger, the water brought in with it, poaſted to the Towne whether the Water (had they not made the more haſt) had brought the men before them: Rayſed the Sexton, got the Keyes of the Church doore,

and (as the cuſtome in ſuch daungers) Iangled the Belles, and with a fearefull outcry, rayſed the ſecure Inhabitantes: who imagining ſome Houſe to be on fire, roſe vppe diſtractedly in their Shirtes, crying out Water, Water: of which Element (they were no ſooner vp,) but they perceiued they had too much: Yet were they ſtill various in their opinions, all fearing, yet none knowing truely what to feare: ſome got vp to the ſteeple, many thinking their had been theeus got into the vpper roomes of their Houſes, ſhutting their ſafeties out, by locking themſelues in. Some thinking it had bin but a ſlight ouerflowing of a ſpring tyde, laught at the reſt.
               The truth once knowne, it was no need to byd them make haſt: to expreſſe how amazedly Men ran vp and downe, betwixt ſleepe and wake, aſking what newes, and receiuing no other anſwer but what newes, was ſtrange. In a word, in this danger, euery man layed firſt hands of what he loued beſt, ſome made away with his Wife, ſome his Children, ſome careles both of Wife and Children, hurried away his goods. Hee that had ſeen this troubleſome nights worke, would haue thought vpon the miſerable night of Troy. Here waded one vp to the middle loaded with wealth, when noting how the water increaſed, and calling to mind his helpleſſe Children, with a ſigh as loath to part from what hee ſo deerely had loued, hee throwes it downe, runs to Bedde, wakens his Wife, and from her ſides ſnatches the ſleeping infants.

Here comes a Huſband with his wife on his backe, and vnder either arme an Infant. The Sonne carries the Father, the Brother the Siſter, the Daughter the Mother, whileſt the vnmercifull conqueror breakes downe the Walles of the Houſes, taking pittie neither of aged nor Sexe, findes ſome at playe, ſome a ſleepe in Chayers, many in their beddes, that neuer dreamed of miſfortune till the Water waked them.
               Not to ſtand long, the Water gaue them but uery ſhort warning, yet like a mercifull Conquerour, hauing taken the towne, it gaue them their liues, at leaſt all ſuch as were willing to leaue their goods. Some couetous to haue all, loſt all, for ſtriuing to ſaue their goodes, they loſt their liues.
               In this night-maſſacre ſome few were drownd but their true names and certaine number, is not yet directly knowne. Vp to a hill ſome halfe myle from the Towne they haſted, where that night, or rather peece of a morning, they repoſed themſelues.
               The next day they might behold their houſes wading vp to the middles in Water, ſome calling for Boates out at Windowes, and from the ſteeples toppe, ſome ſwimming vppon plankes, ſome vppon Fetherheds, whom as they poſſibly could, they releeued. Horſes that were tyed to the Mangers, at the Mangers were all drowned, ſuch as were looſe ſwimming vp and downe, ſome

recouered the land, ſome drowned in ſtriuing to recouer it, whole Barnes of Corne, which the couetous owners horded vp in hope of a dearth, the Water diſcouered and brought foorth, Houſhold-ſtuffe which the night before they packt out of the Houſes in hope to haue ſaued, ſwamme vp and downe, with drowned people ſo confuſedly mingled, as men could ſcarſe diſtinguiſh their goods, nor know their friends.
               Nor did the Water thus confine his tyrranie, but ioyning with land Waters that fell from the high groundes, It inuaded two Villages more, but they hauing warning of the Aproch, though not power to withſtand it, had time to preuent it, by conuaying all or moſt part of their goods and Cattell, to the vpland Villages, leauing onelye the emptie houſes to the mercy of (that which is ſayd to haue no mercy) the water.
               Three Townes thus ouerflowed with water, could not but bring much loſſe to the poore inhabitants, yet to increaſe it, their corne fields (and not onely theſe) but all alongſt the coaſt and lowe Marſhes of that country, to the number of many thouſand Acars in ſeuerall places and fields are toombd and buried in the huge graue of waters, that like a deuouring gulfe is neuer ſatiſfied.
               To this there is for the ſpace of ten or twelue miles compaſſe Mariſhes and fens cleane vnder water. The Cattell fed in thoſe Marſhes ſo ſodainely taken, that had they not fled to an Hill, ſome halfe mile in compaſſe called Thruehill, few

or none of them could haue ſcaped with life: yet being there, their ſafety is very daungerous: for this hill being very high and narrowe in the top, is like a Rocke in the Sea, girdled about with Water, ſo deepe, that on foote neither Man nor Beaſt canne paſſe it, and yet not deepe enough to beare a Boat, by reaſon of muddy and old ſhrubs yt grow in it: by reaſon whereof the poore beaſts haue fedde the Hill ſo bare, as it affordes neither graſſe nor wood, and ſo do their hunger encreaſe, and ſuſtenance decreaſe, as they do eate the tops of Molehils, and the very earth it ſelfe, and with lamentable bellowing complaine, and as it were make moane to their owners, who beeing willing canne by no meanes releeue them. Hee that ſhould ſee this pittifull famine of Beaſts, coulde not (except hee were too leaſiall himſelfe) but pitty it.
               At laſt they made ſhift by cutting away through the Shrubs & Buſhes, to bring abroad a Ferry Boat to the hill, to which the cattell would ſwim ſo thick, yt they had much a do to keepe it from ſinking, others ſeeing their fellowes in the Boate, would throw themſelues into the water, and like people at a ſhipwracke, ſwarme ſo thicke about them, and offer ſuch mournefull noyſes, that pittied ye fellowes to heare, the Boat being full, other ſtriuing to ſwim after them, being weak, for want of ſuſtenance, were drowned at the Boats ſide.
               In pitty whereof, they concluded to fetch noe more of, but in thoſe Boats conuay Hay, and ſuch like fodder, to the Hill, and there feed them: ſuch

are not too farre ſpent and gone, by this meanes they hope to recouer, (notwithſtanding the beſt helpe they can apply) they die in great numbers: the fight is to be pittied, the loſſe greeued at, and the Iudgement to be trembled at. For with it, it brings this fearefull expect of a hard and ſharpe dearth. For Corne and Cattell, the two cheefe hopes of bounty taken away, what elſe can we expect, but a fearefull Ruine, and an ineuitable deſolation, which God for his mercies ſake auert.
               YOu haue all this while been Spectators of others ſad and tragicall euents which now (euen by our friends, kinſfolkes, and Countreymen) haue ben preſented on the Theater of the world: It ſhall not be amiſſe to turne your faces, and to looke backe vpon the head of time that is gone from vs: weigh therefore thoſe miſeries that were meaſured out in the laſt Queens raigne in the yeare 1570. with theſe in 1607. and you ſhall ſee our puniſhment greater, becauſe our treaſon againſt God is more horrible.

Where alſo were loſt a great number of Sheepe, Oxen, Kine, Horſe, and other Cattell. Amongſt other there, one maiſter Cartwrite Gentleman, hauing his Houſe incloſed round about, the water came in ſo much, that a Cart being lodē with Thorns, did ſwim about the ground. He loſt by the ſame Floud, Sheepe and other cattell, to the value of an hundred pound. The ſame Gentleman had a cloſe gate by the high wayes ſide, where the water ran ouer ſo extreamely, that at the fal thereof it made ſuch an hole, that it was fortie foot deepe, ſo that no man could paſſe that way without great danger.

The Walles of the houſes were broken downe, and the Horſes that were tyed at the Maunger, (which was made faſt in the ground) did ſwim in the water, when the Stable was cleane caried away, vntill the waters were aſſuaged, and were ſaued aliue, and the people were conſtrained to get vp to the higheſt parts of the houſe, and to bee carried away in Boates.
