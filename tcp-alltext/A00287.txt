by Sir Francis Englefield Barronet.
            
               ANthony the now Viſconte Montague purpoſing irrecouerably to ſettle his eſtate, doth in the yeare 1611. couenant with the Lord Dormer his vncle,
Sir Francis Englefield his brother in law, and Sir Iohn Dormer Knight, to ſtand ſeiſed of the greateſt part of his lands to himſelfe for life, the remainder
to his onely ſonne Fran. Browne, with diuers remainders ouer to the next heire male of his houſe; and for the reſidue of his lands he doth by
bargain, ſale, deed enrouled, and recouery, abſolutely conuey them to the ſaid Couenantees and their heires, vpon truſt neuertheleſſe expreſſed in the
ſaid deed that they would therewith within 10 yeares pay all his then debts contained in a ſhedule annexed, amounting neare to 7000 
                  l
               : and within
20 yeares raiſe the ſumme of 20000 
                  l
               . payable in mariage portions for all his ſix daughters, of which he appointeth to Marie 10000 
                  l
               . to Katherine
4000 
                  l
               . to Frances 2000 
                  l
               . to Iane 2000 
                  l
               . and 1000 
                  l
                a peece to his other two daughters; and vpon further truſt (theſe debts & mariage portions paid)
that theſe Feoffees would with the remain of the lands vnſold prouide for all his yonger ſonnes, and for want of yonger ſonnes to reaſſure the ſame
remaine on the next heire male of. 
                  〈◊〉
                houſe; The Viſconte thereby likewiſe laſtly couenanteth not to ſtir, alter nor incumber this his eſtate ſo firmly
ſetled, and giueth to theſe three Feoffees a recogniſance of 20000 
                  l
               . defeazanced for his performance of the ſaid couenant, which cancelled he acknowledgeth
to them a ſtatute of 20000 
                  l
               . intended to haue been defeazanced as the ſaid recogniſance was.
            The lands ſo conueyed to theſe Feoffees, they do quietly enioy 4 yeares, in which time (with the ſale of very little part) they doe pay moſt of theſe
debts and Katherines 4000 
                  l
                mariage portion. Then by Maries mariage with William Lord St. Iohn ſonne to the Marques of Winton. her 10000 
                  l
                portion
did likewiſe grow due, the whole intereſt of which is by the ioynt deed of the Viſconte, the Lord St. Iohn and his Lady, made ouer to the Marques, who
by articles agreed before mariage was to receiue the ſame, and in liew thereof to make his ſaid ſonnes wife a ioyncture of 1200 
                  l
                a yeare; of this aſſignement
made, the Lord St. Iohn and his Lady do by their ioynt letters written the 28. Nouemb. 1613. to theſe Feoffees, giue them notice, who accordingly
do make agreement with the Marques to pay the ſame at 3 equall payments in the 3 Eaſter termes 1615, 1616, and 1617.
            The Lady St. Iohn who hitherto had liued in good amitie with her husband, through ill counſell now leaueth his houſe and company, and being
put in hope to obtain both this 10000 
                  l
                mariage portion and this ioynture of 1200 
                  l
                a yeare, ſhe firſt by a petition to his Maieſtie procureth theſe paiments
to the Marquis to be inhibited, and then viz. 12. Febr. 1616. exhibiteth a Bill in Chancery againſt Sir Francis Englefield in the name of her ſelfe
and her husband, pretending that the intereſt of this 10000 
                  l
                mariage portion did then reſt in her husband, with whom ſhe ſaith ſhe had made an agreement
to receiue 9000 
                  l
                thereof for her ſuſtentation and maintenance, which with damages for detaining the ſame from her, ſhe requireth of the defendant.
In Eaſter Terme 1617. the Lo. St. Iohn hauing notice of this his wifes fraudulent bill exhibited in his name without his priuitie; and conceiuing
the ſame to be done purpoſely to wrong his father and himſelfe, he therefore 12. May. 1617. by his counſell in the open Court of Chancery diſclaimeth
this his wifes bill, and denieth to haue made with her any agreement whereby ſhe might challenge any part of this mariage portion; notwithſtanding
which diſclaime reſting vpon record, ſhe procureth this 9000 
                  l
                for her ſuſtentation and maintenance, together with 2500 
                  l
                more 5. Iun. 1617. to be decreed
vnto her, which Sir Fra. Englefield knowing not to be warranted by the truſt, refuſed to pay, and was for the ſame committed to the priſon of the
Fleete, from whence he could not be diſcharged vntill after nine moneths impriſonment he had paid to the ſaid Ladie St. Iohn all the moneys then in
his hands, by reaſon of this truſt being 10000 
                  l
               .
            Vpon this fraudulent and diſclaimed Bill many orders haue been made, amongſt which 11. Iun. 1618. it was vpon this Ladies motion ordered, that
if Sir Fra. Englefield ſhould not forthwith account for theſe truſt moneys, and aſſigne ouer the ſaid truſts to Sir George Moore, Sir Iohn VValter, and M. Tho.
Spencer, he ſhould againe be committed, and a Fine of 500 
                  l
                is ſet on his head; which Sir Fra. Englefield conceiuing to be no breach of the truſt, he
therefore by his petition reſting vpon Record, proffered the ſame, & tendred performance thereof accordingly, as ſhall appeare teſtified vnder the hands
of the Lord Chancellour himſelfe and two of the Maſters of the Court; yet as if he had refuſed to aſſigne or account, is he againe vpon this order (without
any warrant for his commitment) violently drawne to the priſon of the Fleet, where he continued full 21 months more; and the ſaid Lady St Iohn
hauing by meanes of falſe ſuggeſtions made to his Maieſtie, procured a grant of this 500 
                  l
                pound fine, iudgement is giuen againſt Sir Francis Englefield
contrary to law for this 500 
                  l
               , which forthwith is leuied out of his goods and paid vnto her.
            The lands ſubiect to this truſt being by the ſtrongeſt aſſurance of the Law ſo conueyed to theſe three Feoffees, and no power thereby left in the
Viſcount to ſtir or alter the ſame, neuertheleſſe in May 1615. he exhibiteth a bill in Chancery againſt the ſaid Feoffees, pretending thereby that they
had broken this truſt, as alſo that they deſired to be disburdened from the ſame, and therefore praid that by the authoritie of the Court they might be
enioyned to aſſigne this truſt to ſuch other new Feoffees as he ſhould nominate▪ In anſwer to which bill, the Defendants doe on their oath denie to
haue broken or neglected this truſt, or that euer they deſired to be freed from the ſame; it was neuertheleſſe 16. Iuly. 1617. vpon the Viſcounts motion
(without proofe of witneſſe or hearing the Defendants counſell) ordered, that the poſſeſſion of theſe lands ſhall be taken from the Defendants and deliuered
to Sir Geo. Moore, Sir Io. VValter, and M. Tho. Spencer, whom the Viſcount did then nominate as new Feoffees to execute this truſt, vnto whom
likewiſe he procureth by a writ dated the 18 of Iuly, and directed to the Shiriffe of Suſſex the poſſeſſion of the ſaid lands truſted to be deliuered, and
the ſaid new Feoffees by vertue thereof haue euer ſince taken the whole profit
                  •
                of the ſaid lands, and thereby raiſed at leaſt 16000 
                  l
               .
            The Lady St. Iohn fearing now the lands truſted were taken from the firſt Feoffees to loſe the benefit of her aforeſaid decree, by which ſhe was to receiue
out of the ſame the ſumme of 11500 
                  l
               . procureth by foure ſeuerall orders made in the moneths of December 1617, and April, May and Iune follow
                  •••
               ,
the Viſcount and his ſaid new Feoffees to be inioyned with the whole meane profits of theſe lands, firſt to make her ſatisfaction, then the reſidue
of the Viſcounts daughters their mariage portions vnpaid, and laſtly to imploy the remaine according to the direction of the ſaid truſt, in contempt
of which orders the Lady St. Iohn perceiuing her father and his aforeſaid new Feoffees to conuert the whole profits of the lands truſted to their owne
priuate, ſhe threatneth to complaine of the wrong done her; her father therefore to giue her ſatisfaction proffereth her 600 
                  l
                a yeare out of the ſame
vntill her mony were paid, which ſhe the better to be aſſured of to receiue, procureth to be ordered vnto her by the Court.
            But this 600 
                  l
                a yeare not long contenting the Lady St. Iohn, ſhe requireth her mony decreed vnto her, in liew of which the Viſcount is well pleaſed
that ſhe have the Mannor of Northey and diuers houſes in Saint Marie Oueries being both better worth to be ſold then 20 000 
                  l
               , yet this to be vnto her
but in part of her ſatisfaction; ſo he and his new Feoffees might enioy the reſidue and not be queſtioned for the meane profits of the ſaid lands which
ſo vniuſtly they had detained, and this truſt might be deſtroyed: which proffer the Lady St Iohns accepting, it is reſolued a decree muſt be gotten to
inforce Sir Francis Englefield and Sir Iohn Dormer thereunto, in whom the ſole intereſt of the ſaid lands after the death of the Lord Dormer did reſt; but
how to procure this decree to deſtroy this truſt (which the Vicount by his bill ſeemed deſirous ſhould ſubſiſt) and to croſſe not onely the Viſcounts bill
vpon which it was made, but the aforeſaid decree made vpon the Lady St Iohns bill and all former orders and proceedings in Court vpon theſe bils,
was holden a matter impoſſible to procure; neuertheleſſe by the meanes of great bribes giuen and more promiſed by the Viſcount (which bribes are
confeſſed in Parliament) this Decree is made, bearing date the 23 of Iune 1618.
            The Lord Chancellor who made this Decree, well knowing the ſame by the ancient practiſe of the Court (as hauing no ground) to be voide in it
ſelfe, would therefore (notwithſtanding the aforeſaid bribes) ſo long as he ſate (which was neare three yeares after) neuer ſuffer any execution of this
Decree, yet to giue the Vicount ſome content, it was vpon his motion made the 20 of May 1620. ordered, that if Sir Francis Englefield did not by the
ſecond Returne of the next Terme giue vnto the Viſcount an account of theſe truſt moneys, a Fine of 1000 
                  l
                was impoſed on him: which account
(though neuer demanded by the Viſcount) Sir Francis Englefield in the Viſcounts abſence againe proffereth to his chiefe Counſellor and only Solicitor
of this cauſe; yet neuertheleſſe, as if he had diſobeyed this order, he is by meanes of the Viſcounts bribes yet freſh in memory by an order of the 5.
of Iuly 1620. cenſured to haue forfeited this Fine, and a Scire facias is accordingly awarded againſt him, to ſhew cauſe why this 1000 
                  l
                Fine ſhould not be
leuied out of his goods, to which writ, by reaſon of the vncertaintie, the Defendant could not pleade, and therefore did demurre to the inſufficiencie
of the ſaid writ.
