            To the Reader.
            BY your patience, if you haue leisure to laugh, and will take any paines to Read, it may be you shall be fitted a penny worth to your humour. Heere is no matter of state, diuinity, nor Phisicke, but, and so foorth, such stuffe, as will giue you occasion perhaps, when you haue worne it out, to commende it to your friends: tis no outlandish, but made at home, and nere the worse, for I know no reason to barre any man of his wits, that can tell kindely how to vse them: There are so many excellent writers in high Poetry, and strange plots, that poore men, who would do well, are afraide of euery Scholler, for feare of a scoffe, and of him that hath no learning, for lacke of wit. But at aduenture, this is done: how well, I knowe not, but you that Reade, may iudge as you list, there are changes in it enough to make a Play: but the foole in the midst may marre all: whose part, let it be put vpon my selfe, for too much prattle, I care not, if I here take an order with my pen to make an end of an idle Epistle.
            Your friend as occasion serues.

            YOu Sir, hoping that you vvill take well, that is not worse ment, hauing nothing else, to giue you: I heere present you vvith a booke, vvherin, I haue vvriten as you see, vvhat it is you may Iudge, a strange course of an odde straine, in vvhich if you finde no matter to make you merry, feede fatte vvith your melancholy, till you be as madde as he that hath no more vvit, then he needes to occupie: There are many passages, to little purpose, to him, that vnderstands them not, & yet he that hath both his eyes, may see more then a blinde man: I hope you are none of them, if you be, God help you, for I cannot, for thogh many can make lipp-salue, yet, vvit-salue is past my skill: preceptes there are none, for I doe not keepe a schoole, excepte it bee of had-I-vviste, and then if I should set vp my bill, I should haue too many Scholers: my meaning vvas, to be merry vvith my selfe, and if in mine humor, I haue made any angrie, if he cannot

haue patience, he must fret, till he be vveary: such as are vvise, vvill smile at their conceit, and the foole, for lack of vvit vvill finde fault, vvith he knovves not vvhat.

            The Worldes Folly.
            
               WIthin the compasse of the world ther is an island, whose name I haue not reade, and therefore I care not if I leaue it out: now, in this I slande, were diuers Townes, and Citties, among which, there was one greater then all the rest, the name whereof, was written vpon one of the Gates, but the letters were so worne out that I could make no English of them: and therefore, least I should do wrong to the inhabitants, to set it downe by a false name, I will say no more of it but that it was a faire cittie, and so leaue it. Now in this cittie, were many faire houses: but among all, one, of that bignes, that the Lord of the Towne had bene able to kéepe his Christmas in it, it was full of windows, for a man might looke through it: and all the smoake of the house went out in one Chimney.
            
               
There were to this house, thrée Gates; and all in a forefront, which shewed that it had the foundation of some Caitle: but by decaie, was brought to be an Almes-house. Now in this Towne were many sundrie sorts of people of all ages; as Old, and young, and middle age: men, women, and children: which did eate, and drinke, and make a noyse, and die: but such as liued, had there, their sundry lodgings, that they might quickly be founde out, when there was occasion of their imploymeut. The house was large, and the Gouernor a great Man: I doe not meane in fat, (and yet he was well lined in the Pursse:) but he hadde a great commaund, especially of those about him: which because they were of small wealth, there is little to be saide of them: onely they were Creatures that serued the time, followed Shaddowes, fitted humours, hoped of Fortune, and found, what? I cannot tell you.
            But at the entrance into the first base Court, wher walking of Horses was the chiefest exercise of Idle people: ouer the Gate, I sawe written (Madde Fellowes) Now, asking the meaning thereof of an olde Man (who was the Porter) who had written vppon his breast, The Kalender of Experience, he tolde me, this house was called the Fort of POLLY, where such as sold Lande and followed Fortune, to teache them Patience after poasting, were put to walking of horses: Where great spirits, stouping to little bodyes, made miserie a meane to happinesse: Where in the Crosse of Patience, companie gaue much comfort: yea but (quoth I) Doe all walke Horses? and haue

they no other intertainment? yes (quoth the Olde man) within the house, are many, put to more vnpleasing seruices: As, they that haue spent their patrimony vppon Wantonnesse, are made Pandars to wickednesse He that lost his wealth at play, muste hold the Candle to Gamsters: and he that melted it in banquetting, must waite on a Churles Trencher: and he that spent it in the Warres, must learne to pray for Peace.
            Alasse (quod I) I haue beene a yonger Brother, and glad I would be to see fashions, but if here be no better intertainement, I haue no hart to goe in any further. Oh sir, quoth he, Content your selfe, you may doe better then you are aware of: For, if you haue any extraordinary qualitie, here you may make a gaine of it: If you can make a Ditty to a tune, you may fill your belly for your witte: If you can mende a decayed complexion, you shall be paide for your colour: If you can deuise a new fashion, there are that will be for your humor: if you can tell a strange tale, you shall be thought wise: if you can swthe a lie, you will growe plausible: if you can mannage the carriage of the Foole, you may haue sauour in faire Eies: if you can cheate at play, you may thriue by trickes: if you haue any languages, you may do good vppon strangers. And if you haue the strength of the backe, you shall not want necessaries of the Bellie: But whatsoeuer you doe, beware of conscience for she is in little credite: Alas quoth I then, what should I do héere? For I had rather die, then liue dishonestly: Honesty (quoth hee) whatsoeuer you thinke of it,

speake not a word of it. For in the course of Folly, a faithfull seruant is a good Asse: a kinde friend, is a swéet foole: A liberal hart is a feare of Beggery: and a charitable man is a pittifull creature. And yet, howsoeuer they come héere, I knowe not, but our house is full of them, and therefore if you be as you say, so scrupulous of Conscience, or so carefull of Honesty, you were beste make one amonge a number héere, then loose your selfe in a wildernes with want of companie. For héere, you may be Beauties Foole, Wealthes slaue, or Wittes asse, or Prides vassall, Honours shaddowe, or Powers subiect: you may be a Iester among fooles, a Iuggler among Gypsies, a Fortune-teller among fayre hands, or a flattrer among fine Eares: and perhappes, if you can be wise, bee nere the worse for weldooing.
            For tis no shame to honestie, to furnish necessitie, so that the lawe doe not touch you, for I haue lyued long, and neuer saw a tempred spirit out of Tune: and if you will be ruled by your friendes, you maye doe well. The Mistresse of this house hath no meane power in the world: for in the Warre, she hath her Mutiners: in the Schooles, her Truantes: in the Court, her Prodigals: in the Cittie, her Minions: in the countrie, her Lols: and at Sea, her Pyrates: and at Lande, her out-lookers. And let me tell you, that once a yéere, (howe often more, I knowe not) they all do her homage. The Cuckold hangs downe his head: the thiefe hideth his face: the Prodigall fetcheth a déepe sighe: and the Louer with infolded armes, and (perhappes) a wéeping Eye, singes a

Ballad of his Brainsicknes, to the tune of O man in desperation.
            
            And therefore thinke not much, among so many of such reputation, to haue a place of Entertainment: Which, if you like not, and can mend your selfe, tell me your minde, and I will helpe you in what I can: but, this I say, she is a kinde woman, and will giue you countenaunce whensoeuer you come: for shee loues Straungers excéedinglye, and entertaineth them most kindely. Alas (quoth I) these wordes of yours are straunge, I knowe not when to make of them: I am not for hir hand, except she haue néede of me in some better seruice, then I yet héere of.
            Why (quoth he) let me tell you, it were straunge, that you should spend your wits, with your wealth, if the worste fall, let me tell you, if you can féede an Owle, teach an Ape, or catch a Spaniell, I will warrant you pleas`d for your paine. No (quoth I) imaginations of ydlenesse, are but losse of time, and therefore trouble not your selfe, I had rather neuer serue, then be at such commaunde: But, since Fortune hath brought me hither, I pray you do for me, what you can, that I may not so far loose my hopes, that I pay two déere for my Repentaunce. I will (quoth he) come on thy wayes: so in he brought mee to his great Ladie: who in a great brauerie, vaunting her selfe, asked me who I was? I aunswered, a Cipher among figures: well said, (qd she) more wit in the words then in the matter: now, whence come you? From idlenesse, (quoth I) well, (saide shee) that is the righte waie to Ignoraunce: Eperience,
               
take this fellow, to thee, and let him reade the rules of Patience, which done, let him know his place.
            So taking leaue of his Lady, he led me into a large Roome, paued with rough flint stone in the midst whereof, was a kinde of standing water, that (when it was sticced) gaue a kinde of sent, that would haue kilde a horse: Alasse (quoth I) Father, what shall I doe héere? Why (quoth he) you must know, they that haue spent their wealth in perfumes, sweete waters, and delicate Odors, must first, héere haue patience with a little vnpleasing sauour, for he that comes into such a great house, as your Forte of Follie: must not looke for all places, after the finest fashion?
            For he that cannot away with Sir Reuerence, must not come at Patience: but after you are a little vsed to it, you will easily away with it: Oh, Patience is a vertue, though it waite vpon many villaines: but you must away with many viscontentmentes, before you can be acquainted with the secretes of this house, or haue fauour with our Mistresse. Heere, in this place, which is called the Purgatorie of 
                     ••
                  t
                     •
                  e, I must bring you acquainted with many, that haue lodging in this place, of whom you must haue diuers instructions, touching the Rules of Patience.
            
            So, knocking at one dwre, comes me out a handsome man, but poorely apparrelled, pale faced, thin hayzed, and lowe voiced: who, (with a soft spéech, as in a feare to wake some sléeping Children) badde vs welcome, whome the olde man thus saluted:

Scholler, I haue this morning, met with a stranger, whome I haue preferred to my Lady mistresse: who hath giuen me in charge, to instructe him in all thinges fit for him in her Seruice: nowe, knowing your perfection in the first point of the Principalles of this Purgatorie, I will leaue him for this day to your entertainment: He is Welcome (quoth he) so, (leauing me till the next morning,) he went his may, and I (in a pittifull taking,) was brought by this Anathomie of flesh, into the discomefort of nature, where oppenning a little dwre, and that lowe, where we must stoope ere we got in, there did I sée (with much adoe) through a huge Sea-cole smoake, by a little light, that came through a hole, in the top of the house, a Roome filled with people of diuers humors, aswell olde as young, (but the pittifullest of Creatures, that the Earth carried aliue:) all sitting vpon the bare ground: some sighing; other groaning, some wéeping, other wringing their hands: and not one, but in one Agonie, or other.
            Now, what with feare, and what with Sorrow, in a kinde of maze to beholde this mappe of mtserie, this poore wretch appointed for my Reader in the Rules of Patience, while I expected some booke or other, that he should fall to lay open to such purpose: he brought me to them all, one after another, willing me to note them seuerally, to giue eare to their spéeches, and to take notes of them for my better memorie.
            So sitting downe with him (as it were) in the midst of them, without any regard, either of me or

themselues, while melancholy so domineired in all, that there was not a good humour among them: they thus began their blacke Sauntis. One, who (it shoulde séente), had béene a trauailer, and nowe retyred perforce, from a worlde of Countries, fell thus to talke to himselfe. O Heauens, what a Hell is this? Tyre the bodie, spende the spirite, emptie the purse, weary friendes, waste the wittes deserue well, desire little, and haue nothing: What comforte on the earth, but death? Fortune is such an enimie to vertue, the rowling stone gathers no mosse, the vanitie of varietie settes the wittes a wooll-gathering, where the Shéepe are woorse then woolues, trauaile toylesome, victuall chargeable, apparrell costly, companie iealous, the sea daungerous, and nature vicious.
            These passages who hath paste, and is come vnto the ende of his pilgrimage, let him sing with me in this purgatorie: Oh the winde, the weather, and the raine. When shaking of his heade, with a heauie hearte, hee putte his tounge to silence: when hauing learned by his trauaile, (hauing little money in his purse,) to fare harde, hee fell to breake his fast nowe aboute dinner time, with the pill of an orange, a rawe roote, and a little salte: which with a harde cruste of drye biskette, and a cruze of colde water, hee made his patient repast: when, calling mée to him. Sir (quoth hée) if it please you, that you will take parte with a poore manne, wellcome shall bee your best cheare. A trauailers Table is soone couered: I haue beene verie well acquainted

with kick-shoses, but now I haue learned to satisfie Nature with a little.
            Alasse, thought I, to take a bone from a Dogge, I should starue the dumbe beast, and rather had I fast, then fall to such hungrie fare. So, hauing manie more to looke ouer, the next was a man of Middle age, who had binne a man of some wealth: but, with entering into suretie, and taking vp Creditte, and giuing interest, fell so farre to decay, by leauing his Trade to his Seruantes charge, and followinge the course of his owne Pleasures, satte there with a néedle and a thréed, mending of Byréeches, Petticoates, and Stockinges: In which, being so practised, as got him now and then a little woorke, he had standing by him, for meat and drinke, a pot of strong Ale, which was often at his his nose, that it kept his face in so good a coulour, and his braine in so kinde a heate, as forgetting part of his forepassed Pride, in the good humour of grieuing Patience, made him with a hemming sigh, ilfauourdly singe the Ballad of Whilom I was, To the tune of Tom Tinker.
            
            This poore soule I pittied, but finding little matter in him, I went to the next: who being an olde man with a siluer head, and a snowy bearde, hollow chéeked. Iawe-fallen, and bleare eyed, shaking with the Palsie, and tormented with the Stone, not so Rich, as to haue the Gout, hauing beene a man of some possessions, and with too fat feeding of Horses, too high kéeping of Haukes, and too much delighting in banquetinges, through lacke of husbandrie, was forced to leaue himselfe without Lande, and hauing

no more mony left, then in soiourning with Patience, might pay for his bourde in this purgatorie, hauing in a little Boxe, an Electuarie, which, with a little spirite of the iuice of Grape, kepte lyfe and soule together; this poore man, talking to himselfe, of the vngratefulnesse of the proude; the vnkindenesse of the rich, the hatefulnes of the wicked, the wo of the wan ton, and the miserie of the poore, the wilfulnesse of youth, and the wretchednesse of age: after many a déepe sighe, with a hollowe voice, in a solemne tune, with a heauie hearte, fell to sing the song of Oken Leaues began to wither: to the tune of Heauilie, heauilie.
            
            Which poore soule had no sooner ended, but for his best ease, falling fast asléepe, to his good slumber I left him.
            When nexte to him, sat a dapper fellowe with a smarte countenance: one, who (it séemed) in his youth had béene experte in the Passe a Measure: but, for want of a good eare to kéepe time, made no lasting commoditie of his idle qualitie. Nowe this fellows (as it séemed) had spent a greate deale more then his getting, vpon the gay furnishing of an euill fauoured carkasse, which growing out of square with good fashion, and with some great cold after a heat, in some extraordinarie labour, hauing gotten the crampe of the iointes, sat with a combe in his hande, dressing of haire to send to the Perriewigge-makers, which being a verie poore occupacion, gotte him little, but nowe and than, a little broken meate after the houshoulde had dined: who after hee had spit on his fingers

and wiped them on his patched bréeches after dinner, in steade of grace; fell to sing the ballad of the blinde Beggar, to the tune of Heigh ho. Nowe, taking no great pleasure in this Pawne at Chesse; I took note of the nexte: who was a young man, faire of face, flaxen head, fine hand, and foote, streight body, good legge, and a reasonable good countenance; but with all this, twas pitty he was a foole; for as I found after ward by him, hee had béen a possessor of some small portion: which, through lacke of a good forewit, brought him into this purgatorie of Folly.
            
            For allas poore man, he had been so far in loue, that hee was almost out of his wits, ere his wealth was halfe gon; and being brought to a bare point, hauing no further credit with beautie, then cost, not able to mantaine the course, was sains to giue it ouer in the plaine field: where so far forlorne of all comfort, that he knewe not where to bestowe his litle talent that hee had lost, fell by chaunce vpon this forte, where, hee nowe sat making of ballads; where with a crust of breade out of his pocket, eating, and singing, hee howled out the dittle of When I was faire and young: to the tune of Fortune.
            
            But to heare how he cursed the vvenches that had (as he said) missused him vvith faire looks, kind promises, and such tricks; oh fie vppon them, a man is vvorse then mad that hath to dooe vvith any of them; and then, hovv he vvould curse himselfe, for selling of his lande, spending of his money, and loosing of his time, if a man in that place could haue laughte, it vvould haue put him to his passion.

But there let him sing, and they that liste buye his Ballads.
            Now from him, I tooke note of the next, which was of the feminine Gender, one that was once a virgin had béene a little while a Mayde, knew the name of a wife, fell to be a Widdow, and laste of all, eyther through desire of change, or mislike of choice, or the instinct of Nature, or the corruption of the spirite, or want, or pride, I know not, but for want of a better trade, after she had giuen ouer her shop, betooke her to her Chamber: and there, not able to maintain house-kéeping with Idlenesse, fell to occupye suche wares as were most gainfull: Where, hauing stufs of all coulours, she so pleased her chapmen, that for a while she had good resort: but many of them falling to decaie, her ware growne old, and her stuffes common, she that had béen a whore in her youth, and a Bawde in her olde age, was now become an Almeswoman, and liued vpon a poore pittance, when after many a déep sigh, and bitter teare or two, she would sing the Lamentation of a Sinner, To the tune of welladaye.
            
            After all these, I sawe a yong woman, of reasonable beauty, indifferent good countenance, and of stature not much amisse, who being in all her life none of the richest, nor for her wit, none of the wisest: yet for that, she had a conceit beyond all good vnderstanding, that because a Knaue for a fit of Fie-for-shame or a companion, for gaine of a little coyne, woulde perswade her, that she was wonderfullie Faire, and excéeding wise, she, out of the great lacke of knowledge,

in her little discretion, thinking, that if shée, out of the Common of two, shoulde be of a better declension then a simple Creature, perswading hirselfe that casting a Shéepes eye at a Rams-head, the Hornes shoulde not be séene, till the Ewe mighte auouch the Lambe, by the pride of a few pence, often frequenting the Market, and méeting her Willers at the Tauerne, it fell out, that after an ydle and loos life, by breach of promise of one expence vppon another, and ill dealing of all, hauing lost all fauor with her friends, loue of her Kinne, and the greatest part of her Portion, hauing now nothing left, but a wicked face, and a worse bodie, a gowtie legge, and a splay soote, fit for nothing, but a base exercise, shée was nowe with a little coyne, in a leather pursse, a sowle kerchiefe, a course Petticote, and a clowted shoo, become a Laundresse to the house: where with her handes vppe to the Elbowes in a washing-boul, rubbing vppe a baby-clowt, stood singing the Ballet, of All a greene Willowe, to the famous Tune of Ding, dong.
            
            Now there were diuers others in excéeding badde takings: as Lustie, Gallant youthes, that had spent and made hauocke of their Patrimonies, in attending vpon vaine hopes, and loosing their times, exclaiming vpon Fortune, growing (euen as it were) madde for lacke of money, here in this place were let to diuers Exercises, of whome the number was to be accounted verie great, and therefore I care not if I skippe them over: But yet amongst them al, there was one, that I tooke a speciall regarde vnto: a man

of a good personage, a faire complexion, a quicke wit, and a gratious spirit, who either for punishment of his siunes, or for triall of his patience, had bene married to a most vilde woman: who, as she was neither faire, nor greatly well fauoured, yet, was she most excéedingly foolish, and intollerably frowarde: one, whome nothinge contented, but money, which she knew not well how to vse, when she had it, and yet, with this piece of vngratious creature, had this poore man tugged out twelue yéeres of his life, when, béeing so continually wearied out with vnquietnesse, that he knewe not where to bestowe himselfe, after long losse of time, expence of much money, and many a heactes griefe, thinking no Purgatorie so full of paine, as the passion of her frowardnes, satte there, reading of the vertue of Patience, when with his Eies full of teares, and hart-broken sighes he hummed out the Ballad of the Breeches, to the tune of Neuer more.
            
            Now this man (after his song,) I had some talke withall, who told me, that of all the Torments of the world ther is none so intollerable, as the vnquietnes of a frowarde wife. Oh shee is like Thunder in his Eares, like lightning in his eyes, like a Beare in his bed, and a dog at his Table, so that if there may be a Deuill in a humane shape, he will shevv himselfe in her picture: Oh quoth he) I pray thee trouble mee not with speakinge of her, I haue griefe inough to think of her, for she was the plague of my youth, and is now, the miserie of mine age, for, in respect of her Pestilent tongue, this very Purgatorie, is a Paradise:

shée hath béene the losse of my credite, the crosse of my Fortune, the hurt of my witte, and the onely vexation of my spicite: but peace (quoth hee) noe more wordes; for nowe shee beginnes to awake, you shall sée a proofe of my spéeche: when stretching out a mouth, as wide as halfe a worlde, after a sléepye yawne or two, scarce well out of her dead slumber, (persmading her selfe, that she hadde heard som part of her description) out she breakes into her Naturall fittes: With yea, I heare you well enough, a vengeance of all such Husbandes.
            Good wife, saide he, know where you are, haue patience: Good Asse (sayde shee) Wherefore? What should one doe with a Iacke an-Apes that hath neyther wit nor gouernement; Thou haste nothinge of a man in thée, hange thée Dogge: Fye Sister (saide he) you are much to be blamed, neyther beautie, nor honor, Wealth nor wit, and yet out of Tune still. Fie, fie, learne to be Wise, this is a Purgatorye, where euerie body learnes patience, and you onelie spoile all:
            A Purgatorie indéede, saide shée, to be yoaked and matcht with a Slaue, as is by no meanes able to maintaine me, as well as others doe their Wiues: If thou canst not liue, heere is a knife to cutte thy throte, goe to the Sea and drowne thy selfe, or else vnto the Gallowes and hange thy selfe, I promyse thee I care not for thée: If I were well ridde of thee, I would haue thy betters, I haue no Trade to gette my liuing, and therefore doe as thou wilt or canst, I care not: Naye then (saide she) if that so be you doe

not mend your maners, I shall be enforced to leaue you in your sleepe: and when you are awake, see what your mistcesse will do

               ging mouth she fell to reading, till shee was fast a sleep: where, he (not willing to wake hit) rose quietly away from her, and with me stealing away from the company, brought mee out of that Roome into another Roome, more lightsome and comfortable, and yet, very pittifull to beholde, when the miseries there, were well considered: for, one that had bene in loue, sat looking on his Mistresse Picture, making such a legge to it, writing such verses in honour to it, and committing such Idolatrie with it, that poore man, I pittied him: and in his behalfe, sorrowed to sée how the Foole did handle him: but there sat he, hanging the head, lifting vp the Eyes, and with a déepe sigh, singing the Ballad of, Come liue with me, and be my loue: To the tune of adew my Deere.
            
            Next to him, sat a young woman, that was verie faire, and indifferent wise, of a right good stocke, and reasonably honest: but, for want of a good purse, she had lost her louer, and being grown into some yéers, hauing no excellent good qualitie, was there set with a pan of Coales, a starch-pot, and a setting-sticke, which being now the Trade of Attendance, to hope of the preferment of mariage, to some fellow of more

wealth, then vnderstanding in the world, there sat with her poting sticke, stiffening of a fall: and singing the Ballet of Fortune hath stolne away my loue to the tune of Greene Sleeues.
            
            To which song leauing her, I cast mine eies vpon a pittifull creature, which, in the shape of a woman, made a pittifull sight: for, being both in proportion, countenance, and qualitie, an obiect woorthe the looking on: yet no sooner began she to vtter her passion, in the method of lamentation, but, she did so turne my hart in my belly, that if in hope of her better recouerie, it had not turn`d backe: a thousande to one, but my kindnes had cost me more then I should haue gotten by it: for, to tell you some part of her spéeche, (though it were neuer in the Grammar) yet, being in the Rules of the Accidents, for the better vnderstanding of the Reader, I will set it downe as I can remember it. Oh Lord (quoth she) what plague can be greater to a woman, then to be married to a Muskleboat, which neuer goes further then a cricke, to fish for a Frog, with a Goose-net: was euer any woman in the worlde brought into such a hell? Oh let me thinke vpon my dingle dangle: in my bed, a log, at my table a Hog, in discourse, a Baby, in iudgement, an asse, and for all Imperfections, the substance of worse then nothing, And yet, I must, and haue, (but, will no more,) done reuerence to this monster, and bene a seruant to this slaue, and all, for a little money: but I haue done, I will héere rather pine to death, in this Purgatory of Patience, then passe one day longer, in the Laborinth of sorrow, to liue with

such a none-such, a fool? Why, I had rather be a beg gar with true wit, then a Lady without true honor: but, since Patience is a medcine for all Malladies, if he continue the coxcombe a little longer, I will fit him a pennyworth to the purpose: and in the meane time, till I sée him (which I hope neuer to doe:) let me sing my new Ballet, of the fine foole, to the tune of Tarlton: wherwith pulling a paper out of her pocket, wherein was written both the dittye and the note, she beganne like a Nightingall, to singe with a voice, that if I had not knowne her to haue bene a Woman, I shoulde haue thought her some better creature: but there let me leaue her in her dumps of Wella-day, and tell you further on, of my passage; taking a little viewe of all these obiects, nothing what I thought most néedefull, I tooke the company of my friend, and came into an other Roome, greater then that before: where I saw diuers, sitting at a rounde table: and (as it were) at dinner: for euery one, had his Trencher furnished.
            One, hee fedde on Flies, and Bées, which so stunge his tongue and bit him by the lippe, that hee was forc`st to giue vppe houshold, and leaue all hospitalitie, and studie onely to please the Lady of the Castle: but, while he was in studie, he fed still vpon flies, that, (had not his throat bene the wider) hee had bene choaked with a flie, instéede of some better fare: but loathe to leaue him, without some further knowledge of him: I vnderstood, that, he had bene a man of some vnderstanding, but, so carried awaye with conceit: that because he thought himselfe wise,

there was more hope of a Foole, then of him, for true wit to do good vpon? for, trusting to the compasse of his owne capacitie, so much, that he disdained better company, he was so cosened with the cunning of wit, as, thinking to ouer-reach the Moone with imagination, he fell through the clowdes of Error, so low into the lap of Folly, as being swaddled vp, in her Babies bands, he must be very olde, ere he recouer his wits againe: but, poore wretch, there let him rest, and watch the Spiders webbe for a flie, for I had no more to do with him: but the next to him, sat a handsome woman, in shape, but, for her beauty, nointed with the curriers oyle: and for her wit, it was so naturall, that Art had nothing so do with it, yet hadde this vnséemely creature, among better company, a kinde of Pride, that she was woorth the looking on, till after great expences of apparrel for her filthy outside, and fine diet for her fowle chappes, she grew to so bare a reckoning with her purse, that her portion must now be raised vpon her qualities, which béeing chiefly in her Néedle, she was forced to be sparing of her dyet, and make layd-worke the greatest parte of her liuing, whereof though she had her handes full, yet Cut-worke being more in vse, she was constrained to take excéeding great pains for little profit: but hauing now newe risen vppe from her worke, and set downe at the Table, her meate was most chiefly on a fryed Mouse, and the reason thereof was, for that she being as watchfull as a Catte, and as broade eyed, and euil faced, neuer gotten without the consent, agréement, or conceite of some such like Creature,

it was a dish set before hir to discipher hir disposition: and so let her sitte, her neighbour with a flie, and she with a fried mouse, like good fellowes, or good Fooles togither.
            Now, next her, sat a man, well stept in yéeres, but fine in apparrell, and so briske in countenance, as if he had fed vpon an Elixar, to recouer the losse of his strength, and he more strong in mind, then in body, to preserue the smoothnesse of his countnance, to deceiue the sight of a simple Eie, fedde onely vppon a Snayle, and so litle at once that he kept an exceeding spare diet: which, not being wholesome for all complexions, I meant not to meddle with: but so, leauing him to his perillous dishe, tooke note of her that was nexte him: who in the shape of a woman, was nothing pleaūng to man: for as she was olde, (and therfore not Eiesome,) so was she froward, and that was cumbersome: one, who in her youthe had been so lauish of her kindnesse, that now in her Age, she had nothing left but the contrary: and, where she might haue bene commaunder of many friends, shée now was growne to be an ouerséer of Idlenes: wher being so busie, with a crabbed humour, that she was vnfit for good company: lighting amongst beggers, that would flatter her for a poore reuersion, for want of a paire of spectacles, to leade the right way to her graue, she fell, (by I know not what chaunce) into this Fort of Foll, and so, in the society of these Fooles, sat at this table of good fellowshippe: where the most of her foode, was of the clawe of an olde Crabbe: a true Figure of her substaunce: for her little Eyes,

her crawling féet, and her scratching fingers, the salt khewme, like the Sea water, and her graue, like a hole in the mudde, where, after her going forwarde and backward, she went stealing of time to litle purpose, feeding vpon the gaine of young people, as the crabbe doth on little ashes, she was sweetly disciphered in her diet but, least I grow tedious in her description, I will tell you of the rest.
            The next was a nimble witted, and glib-toung`d fel low, who hauing in his youth, spent his wits in the Art of loue, was now, become the Iest of wit for his looks were so demure, his words were so in print, his graces so in order, and his conceites so in tune: that he was, yea Iwis was he, and that he was, such a Gentleman for a Iester, that the Lady Folly, could neuer be better fitted for her entertainement of all Straungers. The picktooth in the mouth, the Flower in the Eare, the brush vpon the beard, the kisse of the hand, the stoupe of the head the leers of the eye, and what not, that was vnnéedefull, but he hadde so perfecte at his fingers endes, that euery she, was my faire Ladye, and scarce a Knight, was, Noble Sir, the Tabaccopipe was at hand, when Trinidado, was not forgotten: and then a Tale of a roasted horse, to make an asse laugh, for lacke of witte: why, all thinges so well agreede togither, that at this square Table of people, or table of square people, this Man, (made by rule) could not be spared for a great summe. Now, his meate was most of a Goose to which he had so much sawce, that it would haue serued for many dishes: but, for that his talke, was to

little purpose, and he himselfe but a picture of Idlenesse, I leaue him among his fellowe partners, and will tell you onwards of the next two, for the Table was fully furnished.
            The next to him was a woman, I cannot wel say much more of her; for her beautie was worne out; her bodie was able to carrie her limbes, her handes had fingers, and shee wanted not a tongue, whiche was the member she now made most vse of; for shée woulde so praise my Lady, so sooth vppe my coosen, so magnifie my Lorde, and be so pleasing to euerie person, that hauing lost much in her youth by plain-dealing, she thought now to recouer it by plaine knauerie: but meeting with such wittes as met with her wiles, finding no place of worth, fitting her vnworthie company, for lacke of better meanes to liue, betooke her self to be a gossip among fooles, where according to her qualitie, she was serued with tongues onlie for her diet: which tempred to so manye Tunes, and turning to so manie matters, that it troubled my eares with the hearing of them, I will leaue her to her tittle tattle, and tell you a little of the laste, who was in shape a man, and not a man, I knowe not what to saie of suche a man, for he had the eyes of a Calfe, the bearde of a Goate, the head of a Water-spaniell, (meaning the haire,) the Eare of an Asse, the necke of a Bull, the Nose of a bottle (or a Bottle Nose) and the lippe of an Horse, the countenaunce of a Dogge, and the voice of a Hogge, which being fedde vppe for Larde, was a huge péece of Fatte, as for good and firme fleshe hee hadde but a

little.
            Now, this vgly creature, who was scarce able to go from his bed to the boord, must there sit in a chaire made of downe quilt, with a pillow at his backe, and a cushion at his féet, féeding vpon swéete Gelly, and laughing at a bawdy tale. Nowe imagining by the Poets fiction, he should be GOD, or rather, Deuill Bacchus, loth to haue to do with such loathsome creatures, I left the company as they sat, and came into the next roome: where, being brought in by my guide, (the poore man, that was in miserable taking with a woman, I will not say his wife:) there he tooke me by the hand, and setting downe by me, willed me to be silent, and onely giue eare to the discourses that I should héere betwixt two fooles, that in losse of time, should lay open their imperfections: and what I noted worth the laughiug at; to smile, and say nothing: so, after a few friendly instructions for obseruations in that place, he sets behind a cloth, yet not so close, but thorough a light sufficient to looke on Folly, I might sée two goodly personages comming in, hande in hande, who hauing past some complementes of common curtesie, sitting both downe togither, fell into some kinde spéeches: and hadde not she bene painted, Venus hadde beene but a Blowse: and had not he béene pranckt vp, he had bene the shape of a handsome man.
            But as they were like the Idols of Idlenes, let them passe, with their imperfections, and let me tell you a little of their tattle: he, as it fell out for his turne, beganne thus to goe aboute her: by this

faire heauen: (O Lord thought I, thou art I feare neerer hell but on, Did you know swéet Lady, could you guesse, or woulde you conetiue, the true, and faithfull, and vnfained, harty, inwarde, constante, and resolute and vnmoueable loue, (alasse thought I, whats héere to doe, the mans wittes are out of breath, to spend so many words about nothing, but let me goe on) the loue that I beare you, and onely you, and none but you, the Sunne of my daie, the light of mine eies, the any of my hart, and honour of my minde: (yet againe quoth I to my selfe, what ayles this poore man, is he saying a lesson to his mistresse? But a little further.) Then you could not be so hard harted, so cruell minded, nor so vninercifully disposed, to grieue, to torment to her and to disquiet, this poore afflicted, woefull, sorrowefull, and lamentable heart of mine. When, with a sigh he paused, and saide no more for the first part. Much adoe I had to forbeare laughing, but I was glad, when he had done: expecting some woorthy aunswere from her, who, putting vp her loose hatre with her hande, remouing a pretty worme from his place, with a siluer Bodkinne, shaking the heade, with a straunge wincke, setting a face fit for her spéech, begun thus her reply. Oh sir, your words, nor your wittes, nor your wiles, nor your wittes, nor your oths, (whats the matter now thought I? But on) shall not deceiue nor blind, nor ouercome, nor go beyond me, so farre, but, I know, and perceiue, and vnderstande, what you mean, and purpose, & intend, we I enough: (Lord helpe me, thought I, héers strange Eloquence:

but let me goe further) but, I hope I will not be a seruant, where I may commaund, be bound, where I am at libertie, and be betrayed in my most trust. (But then to heare the poore man, how he played the foole, tis pirty that euer it should be spoken: but for the stories sake, let it passe.) Mistris (quoth he) héere is my brest, cut out my hart, sée my thoughts: héere is my purse, take my gold: my whole state is at your seruice. (At these words my heart began to tremble, for nowe the poore man is vndone, for shee will make him a begger, and then will he be a stark foole, but to go on, she tooke his purse and his Iewels, and kissed his brest, and said) nay wéepe not, for I did but try your truth, there shall be no loue lost, and therefore, I pray you onely, be not Iealous of my lookes to any other, for you onely shall haue my loue: and therwithall giuing him a Iudas kisse, she whippes a bracelet of Pearle off from his Arme, with these words, this shall be your pawne, that I will weare for your sake till to morrow: for euer mistris (quoth he) and all that I haue at your seruice; and I prate you mistris, grace me with your voice, to a dittie that I haue mede to the tune of, Lady, Lady, my faire Lady: A vengeance on the foole thought I, it freakes me to heare him play the Asse: but when I heard him fumble the strings of a Bandore, as if it had bene the Backe side of a battle-doore, and her straine 
                  •
               ut a throate like a Pigge, running to a swill tubbe: I thought if the deuill had daunced, there had béene a Morris for Hell: but, let them be, on the suddaine they went away; and in comes another couple; A

man after the countrey manner, and a woman after the our towne fashion: he, no more witte, nor shee, more vnderstanding, then was fit for the plough and the milke paile: And yet, these two (contrarie to all Rules of reason howe it shoulde fall out: fell, as it should séeme, in loue, for, after they had sat downe a while, and he had blow
                  •
               d his nose, and she had wipte her mouth, it came so about, that sitting togither, he fell to her with these words: Ienny, you knowe I am a man, as other are, and my name is Ienkin, so was my father afore me: and, though I haue not béene brought vp at schoole, to write and read, yet, (I thank God,) I vnderstand English.
            Now, I am not one of these fine toung`d fellows, that will forsweare themselues for a fit of knauerie: I meane truely and honestly, and so I hope, doe you, or else, I would you were hang`d for me, and all that meane otherwise, for I do not, beléeue me, and you will, I will saie and holde, I doe not loue to make euery man priuie to my secretes, twere but folly: you knowe I loue you, and more then our selues, no man knowes any thinge of my minde, but your cosenne Hobblin, by whome I sent you the last Sunday, a paire of Gloues, cutte out of the best of the Shéepes skinnes, they cost me thrée-pence, that they did, and I hope, that it shall not be the last loue-token, that I will sende, and you will take, for, I haue somewhat a bréeding for you, and therefore, since you knowe, your Father haue lefte you the pied Heyfare, and your mother haue giuen you the Cosset Lambe, my Gray Mare and the Colte, that I had

left me by my Granam, and the croppe of Rie, that I haue in common field, I hope (if you meane truth and honestye) will doe well to beginne the worlde withall: how say you? shall we clappe handes, and make a bargaine?
            Soft, (quoth she) stay a little, and let me goe with you a little, either trust me, or not trust me: I am either a Woman, or a Beast, and therfore neuer make such a do about nothing, it was a simple napkinne, wrought with couentry blew, wrought with hand in hand and hart betwéene that I sent you, by your Sister Parnell, I will not say what I paide for the working of it, besides a pot of Béere, and two Cakes, but, let it go, I will get it vp againe: you saide you loue me, and I loue you, and I loue you, and you shall finde it, but, I tell you, there is day enough to night: soft fire makes swéet malt: I pray you be not angrie: for, indéed, I am falne out with mine Aunt, and I know your mother is not wiling to the match: but, all is one: I am thine my boy, and I haue saine it, and I will neuer goe from it: thou didst winne me at the May-pole, when that I carried away the Garlande, and nowe, therefore Ienny is thine Ienkin.
            
            Be merry and take no thought, for, I am for thée at an howers warninge, in the waye of honesty, when thou wilt, and therefore, since you are so earnest on the matter, aske the Banes, when you will, bid your friends, and I will bid mine, and wee will haue a merry Bridall day, let the world wagge after as it will.
            
               
so, with a little controuersie, the simple people were soone agréed: he so besmouched her, & she so beclapped him, and there tumbling together, as merrie as they coulde wish, I sighed to thinke, what a supper they would haue after break-fast: for when the meat was spent, they might learn to fast for a supper. Alas pore fooles, but they are simply foolish, and coulde not doe withall: for loue had catcht them, and they were in for a bird: and therefore god helpe the poore, for they were in a pittifull taking, but let them goe: when they were risen and parted, came in thrée men, a Poet, a Musition, and a Painter: but when I sawe them in their fits, oh what an humor did I fall into? I knew not what to thinke. For the Poet studied so long vpon a verse, that forgetting his matter, fell flat out with his wits, and made such a rime, as being not woorth the reading, twere verie idle for me to write it. The Musition, hee kept such a stir with looking vp into the skie, for a note aboue Ela, that being of a suden, so out  
                  〈◊〉
                square with his humor, that he was not wholy him selfe, he plaid such a song of the thrée merry men, that had the dittie béene in a strange language, I shoulde haue béene puzled in the Musicke: but leauing him in his Crotchets, let me tel you a litle of the Painter, who kissed his picture, hugd it in his armes, and grewe so far in loue with his owne workmanship, as in the erfremitie of passion, made him crie out, oh that thou couldst speake to me: but in this humour, these thrée hauing stated a while, went their way, like seruants to Lady Folly, to sée what buisinesse shee had for them.
            
               
But no sooner were they gon then came in thrée other: a lame Soldier, a poore Trauailer, and an vpstart Courtier: where euerie one hauing spoken his minde, in the manner of a play they departed. The Soldier, he beat his boy for lack of attendance, when he had plaied away his allowance at Primero. The Trauailer he talked so of straunge matters, that for lacke of money, hee was glad to fast for his dinner. The Courtier he was so fine in his complemēts, that his obligation grew scarce currant for his clothes. Alas thought I, surely; only Folly hath made these men poore, and now pouertie hath made them fooles: but, in pittie let me speake it, they were proper men, and so let them passe. Now, no sooner were they gone, but came in thrée other: a séely Lawyer, a simple Usurer, and an honest Broker. The Lawyer (as it shoulde séeme) had too much care of conscience, for his worldly cōmoditie; who weying the weight of euery cause, and the estate of euerie client, was more gratious, then polliticke: and so like an honest poore man, better studied in the lawe of God, then profiting by the law of man; more fit for praier, then for pleading, sat reading of a case betwixte the vertue of necessity, and the pride of superfluitie: where Lazarus out of heauen shewed the blessing of patience; and Diues out of Hel shewed the reward of vncharitablenes. But let him there sit shaking the heade at Usurie: and let me tell you a litle of the behauiour of that Monster: who hauing béene, (for the most parte of his life,) fed with the offall flesh, the pairings of chéese, and the droppings of tappes, wringing out the toyle of the labourer,

the harde market of the tradesman, the prodigalitie of the rich, and the miserie of the poore. Those heapes of goulde, that had shutte vp his heart in his purse, sate in the chaire of iniquity, tortured with the gowte, nummed with the palsie, cramped with the collicke, and torrmented in the soule with the woorme of conscience: cryeing by fittes (as he had any case) oh the hell of a wounded conscience: widdowes rise out of your graues, take your leases of your houses, and pray for some ease of my passion: children of vnhappie parents, receiue the gaine of vnlawefull interest, take your portions, too long kept from you: onely pray for my comforte, that I bee not vtterly confounded; miserable men, come out of your prisons, I forgiue you your debts, and wil restore you your due. Oh the ertreame reward of extremitie, where lawe is without loue, andcouetousnes without conscience; oh the teares of the widdow, the cries of the orphane, the miserie of the poore, and the lamentation of the destressed: I sée them, I heare them, I féele them: Oh I knowe not what to doe, nor where to rest for them; they rise vp to heauen, and weigh mee downe to hell.
            Oh, what auaileth all the worlde to him, that looseth his owne soule: but farewell world, I defie thée; wealth, I hate thée Auarice I detest thée, Charitie I imbrace thée, Pittie I loue thée, Necessitie I relieue thée, Oppression I abhorre thée, Mercie I adore thée, Hell I haue not to doe with thée, Heauen I come to thée. So distributing to the poore, and comforting the miserable, disposing of his worldly goods, to the good

of the distressed christian, bequeathing to the lawyer for his care of conscience, an annuitie, to kéepe him from vncharitable fées: and the Broker a reasonable portion, to make him leaue his griping kinde of trade or profession: rising from his seat of torment, fell sodainly on his knées to praier, where his paines mitigated, and his praiers ended, he became a new creature: chusing rather to die a poore christian, then to liue a rich Iew. A strang sight, but worth the looking on: but there let me leaue him, in a good exercise, and tel yon what followed of the Broker: that poore man féeing the lawyer, and the vsurer, both gone from the world, and himselfe left in a pittifull taking to tarrie in it, followes his good maisters before him: deliuers vp his pawnes and his bonds, vpon such reasonable consideration, that within a while he grew out of cre dit with the money-maisters, and so giuing ouer his shop, and contented with a meane pittance, liued like a good foole, with his good masters: but since the folly before men, is wisdome before God, I hold such fools in better estate, then greater knaues in more reckoning: but when these men had a while talked of the comfort of their concertion, I scarce turned my head aside, but they were gone. When presently came in an olde fellowe with a penne in his eare, and a booke in his hande: who sitting downe in a seate, (like a Sumner in a Church portch, or an A B C schoolemasster) laid downe a great booke before him, where hee read certaine names, but his voice being somewhat law, I could not heare him, but his words (I take it were after this manner.
            
               
               William, (I know not what more) of (I know not whence) Gentleman, for selling of his Lande, and putting of it into money, and spendinge of it in the Warres, and comming home a begger: entertained for the shaddow of witte, the fourth of Aprill, in the yéere of Imperfection, shew your selfe in your place: wherewith commeth foorth a strange creature, with a bush on his head, and a forrest on his face, a frowning brow, and a léering, Eye, who sitting downe on a Beanch, answeared, Zounds, héere I am, a pox of all Fooles, what wouldst thou? Well (quoth the old man) enough, Impatience is one badge of Folly: stay a while.
            Then he reads Thomas, but no more, of et cetera, that had a good stocke of money, and loste it in play, entertained for the losse of time, come foorthe: when presently appeared, a poore man, ill clad, leane faced, and heauy Eied, biting his fingers, and cursing the Rascall dice, and rayling vpon Fortune: Oh God, (sayes the olde man) Fortune is the trust of Folly, an other of my Ladies Badges, well, sit you downe.
            Then beginnes he againe: Parnell, of such a place, widdowe, well left by a kind and carefull husbande, and forgetting his loue, and your owne good, bestowed all, and lost all, vpon a Ruffling royster; entertained for the picture of wilfulnesse; where are you? When out commeth a creature like a woman, but hanging the head, and wringing the hands, and wiping the Eyes, and with a deepe sigh, saying Had I wist this would haue falne out: Oh, (well said the old man) Had I wist, another of my Ladies fauours, sit

of the tother towne, Daughter to Goodmanne Braye-goose, that being brought to good huswife ry, and for a fidlinge humour, will runne from your friendes, and learne a Base occupation, shewe the fruit of your frauatle; when commes me foorth a iolly browne Wench, with a face a foote long, a mouth, a yarde wide, a legge, like a mill-post: and a foote, of a Giantes last, and with a belly so full, as threatned two Twinnes at the least: who holding hir hande on her face, saide: Idlenesse, Idlenes, it was my vtter ouer throw.
            True, (saies hee) it is enough: Idlenes another of my Ladies badges: Idlenes brings man tonnes, and shame followeth Wickednesse, the Trulles Trenchiuall: well, take yourplace and sit downe.
            Which done, he reades, goodman Rableyes of hollow Groue, and Hobby Noble, of Lowe Crosse, hauing spente the profite of your yarde lands, vppou triall of the right in a hey-cocke, where be you.
            When out commes twoe countrey people, one with hob-nailde shoes, and the other with

a patcht Ierkin, and swore, as long as they were woorth a groat, they woulde try the right of the law, I care not I, so I haue my wil, both standing vpon one point: well (quoth he) Will, it is enough; a Badge of my mistresses, that briedes nothing but woe: makes the Lawyers rich, and your selues poore: good Fooles; sit you downe.
            Which done, out comes a Gallant, richly apparrelled, but meanely moneyed, who hadde written on his backe, In the midst of my stare. When the olde man writ, Pride will haue a fall: a Lordshippe on his backe, a huge weight, hee must néeds sinke vnder it.
            After him followes a fine Minion, that made tweny faces, and thirty graces, and had so many merry trickes that she made all the companie laugh: when tripping on the Toe, and counterfitting a kinde of lispe, for lacke of sound teethe, she thus made vse of her tongue.
            Oh heauens what a worlde is this? Nothinge but money? Why, is all handsomnes out of fashion?

is beauty at so lowe a price? a dainesye Wench, not woorth the whissting? is all Grasse become hey? Can a dry Summer make suche a dearth, that there is no money to be hadde for mowers?
            Now tie vpon gréene Plununes, in troth they make my stomacke wamble: good Lord, I haue so sweat, with making me ready, that if it were not for wearines, I would not haue rose before noone: But I haue met with my breakefast: and therefore I may stay my stomacke to dinner: oh the French fail, and the Spanish stitch the Italian bodies, and the Persian skarfe, I hope I will be furnisht to the proofe.
            And yet, to say troth, I am so fantasticke, that I shall be weary of them al, within a while: Heigh-ho: well said Sister, (sayes the old man) fantasticke: another badge of my Ladies; sit you downe; which done, came in diuers couples togither, an olde blinde man, and lusty a young wench, and born before them vp in a shielde: A Cornucopia: vnder with was written, Plenty. Next after them an old lame woman, and a nimble young man: and before them borne, a Scorpion.
            
            
               
Ouer which, was written, Poyson. Then followed a young man, and a young woman, both poore in purse, but in good state of body: and before them borne Gemini, and ouer them written, Loue.
            
            Then followed a Riche Cuckolde, and a poore Whore, and borne them Aries: and written Patience.
            
            Many other pretty Figures there were expressing the meaning of these Maskers, which, for lack of a note booke, are suddainlie slipt out of my memorie.
            But, when this Maske had once gone aboute the Roome, comes out a Foole in a pied coat, and tels them, they must make an ende quickly, and take their places, for the Lady was comming, to see an Enterlude, and presētly a noise of shames, with an outery of knaues, came out, with such a Shoute, that, (while I looke for some fine matter) wakt me suddenly out of my sleepe.
            So that I neuer heard more of any of them, but was euer man so troubled in his sléepe? wel I was exceedinge glad when I was awake, I was so vvell and safely deliuered out of this Pur gatory.
            
            Why, there cannot be such a thing: and therfore

as a dreame, let it passe: and so, hoping that if you note well this dreame, it will doe you no hurte, when you are awake, hoping you will heare with Sléepers, if any thing be not as it shoulde be: in some hast about other businesse, I bid you heartily farewel.
            FINIS.
