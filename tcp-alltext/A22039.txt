            ¶ A Proclamation for proroguing the Parliament.
            
               
                  WHereas at the riſing of the late Seſſion of our Parliament, wee prorogued the ſame vntill the ſixteenth day of Nouember now next enſuing, For as much as the Infection of the plague is now in ſome parts of our Citie of London, So that it is to bee feared that if the Terme and Parliament ſhould meete together, and thereby draw a double concourſe of people from all parts of the Realme thither, it might giue occaſion both to increaſe the ſaide Sickeneſſe thereabouts (where our moſt abode is) and to diſperſe it into other parts of the Realme, Wee haue therefore thought it fit to prorogue it further into the Winter, that is to ſay, to the tenth day of February next, at which day our purpoſe is, God willing, to hold the ſame; And doe hereby giue notice to all whom it concerneth, that they may frame their affaires accordingly, and attend at the ſaid tenth day of February to that ſeruice.
            
               Giuen at our Honour of Hampton Court the laſt day of September, in the fifth yeere of our Reigne of Great Britaine, France and Ireland.
God ſaue the King.
