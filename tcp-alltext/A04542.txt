            THE PREFACE.
            To the Christian reader, grace and peace from Iesus
Christ our Lord.
            GReat strife there is at this day, about the ministery of the Church of England, vvhether
it be the same that Christ hath ordeyned in his Testament, or an other. And many by
conference, some also by vvriting, have controverted this question. There coming to
my hands, these tvvo Letters follovving, the one vvritten in defence of the said ministerie,
the other as aunsvver therto, and disproving the same: I have thought them meet and needfull
to be published for thy good (gentle reader) that the truth in this point may appeare. Neyther
will they that vvrote these thinges, blame me for thus doing (I trust), seing the matter 
                  〈◊〉
               
off it ovvne nature publik, and concerneth al men: 2. besides both of them doubtlesse have set
dovvne that vvhich they are persvvaded is the truth, and vvhich they vvould vvish others vvith
them to receyve and follovv: 3. and sundry copies [especially of the first letter] are already
spred abroad in vvriting vnto the handes of many.
            The ground and occasion of these letters (as I vnderstand and as may be perceived also
by the vvritinges themselves) vvas this. The
                  •
               e vvas a gentlevvoman imprisoned, because she
vvould not ioyne vvith the publick ministerie of England in the vvorship of God. She being
much sollicited to the contrarie, gave in vvriting, a reason of that her faith and practise, to
one Mr A: H. a minister, and a man very learned. The reason vvas this (as may also be seen

                  〈◊〉
                the letters follovving).
            Whosoever he be that dealeth with the holy thinges of God and worketh
vpon the consciences of men, by vertue of an Antichristian power
office and calling, him the people of God ought not to receyue
and joyne themselves vnto.
            But al the ministers that stand ouer the Church-assemblyes in
England, deale with the holy thinges of God and worke vpon mens
consciences, by vertue of an Antichristian power office and calling:
            Therefore the people of God ought not to receive them, or ioyne
themselves vnto them.
            VNto this argument Mr H. made aunsvver by a letter vnto her vvhich follovveth. The letter
she communicated vvith some of her friendes: they together advised to get it auns
                  ••
               ered:
vvhich vvas obteyned of one Mr. F: Io. prisoner for the same cause: vvho also directed

                  〈◊〉
                aunsvver to the foresayd gentlevvoman. Both of these (vvith some fevv other things) are

                  Because of my brethren and my fellow-friendes,
                  I will speak now, peace in thee.

            The severall functions and Ministeryes aforesaid, hath
CHRIST appoynted and set in the Church, as Lord and King
thereof: Vnto them he giveth by his SPIRIT sufficient diversity
of gifts ād ablility for the ordinary works of teaching, exhorting,
governing, distributing etc: And being GOD he worketh
by and in them all, to the prayse of his Name and salvation of
his elect. 1 Cor 12. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 18. 28. and 14. 37. Rom. 12. 7. 8.

            Let like evidence and warrant from the Scriptures
be showed for the severall offices and functions
now had and exercised in the Church of England:
Otherwise all men may know they are not from heaven,
but of men.
         
         
            
            A few positions briefly conteyning the
summe of the cause and treatise
following.
            1 THat Iesus Christ is King and Lord of his Church: and
that all which look for salvation by him are bound to yeeld obedience
to him, as in all other things which he hath commaunded, so also in
his ordinance of Ministery, Worship, and Government prescribed in
his Testament, and no other. Mat. 28. 19. 20 1 Tim. 6. 13. 14. 15 16. vvith
Heb. 5. 9. and 12. 28. 19. 29. Ioh. 3. 36. Gal. 1. 8. 9. and 3. 15. 1 Cor. 12. 5. and 14. 37. 38.
Act. 3. 22. 23. and 5. 31. Esa. 60. 12. Rev. 22. 18. 19.
            2. That Christ as head and 
                  •
               ord of his Church hath given vnto it for
the instruction guydance and service thereof, the offices of Pastors, Teachers,
Elders, 
                  •
               eacons and Helpers, together with rules for theyr entrance,
administration, and maintenance. Ephes. 4. 11. 12. 15. 16. Rom. 12. 7. 8. 1. Cor.
9. 14. and 12. 28. Act. 6. 2—6, and 14. 23. 1 Pet. 5. 1. 2. 3. 4. The epistles to Timothy
and Titus.
            3. That the Primitiue Churches were by the Apostles planted in this
way and order, as being the onely true way and order appoynted by Christ,
and to be observed to the end of the world. Rom. 12. 7. 8 1 Cor. 12. 28. and 14.
37. Act. 6. 2. 6. and 11. 30. and 14. 23. and 20. 17. 28. Phil. 1. 1. Col. 2. 5. 1 Pet. 5. 1.
2. 3. Iam. 5. 14. Tit. 1. 5. &c. 1 Tim. 3. and. 5. and 6. 13. 14. vvith Rev. 22. 18. 19.
Mat. 28. 20.
            4. That synce the tyme of the Primitive Churches thus planted, Antichrist
that man of sinne (as was foretold) hath made departure from this
way and order of Christ, not onely in other poynts of doctrine, but also
in the Ministery, 
                  •
               orship, and Government of the Church. Wherevpon
is come to passe, that in stead of the former offices appoynted by Christ, haue
crept in the Locusts of Antichrist, Archbishops, Lordbishops, Archdeaeōs,
Chauncelors, Commissaryes, Parsons, Vicars, Priests, and the rest of that

                  •
               ort, together with theyr new and straunge entrance, administration, and
maintenance. 2 Thes. 2. 3. 4. 7—12. Rev. 9. 1—11. and 13. 11—18. and 14. 9. 10. 11.
and 18. cap. 1. Tim. 4. 1. 2. 3. compared vvith the Scriptures alledged in the former
positions.
            
            5. That the Nations of the earth, and this among the rest, have ben made
drunk with this cup of Babels fornications: Whereof whosoever drunketh,
God hath threatned they shall also drink of the cup of his wrath. Rev. 17. 1—5.
and 18. 3. 4. 2 Thes. 2. 10. 11. 12. Rev. 14. 9. 10. 11.
            6. That this nation hath (to the prayse of God, and honour of her Maiesty)
ben purged from many of the abominations and false doctrines of
Babylon aforesaid, but not from the Prelacy and other Ministery, worship
and government of the Church by Archbishops, Lordbishops. Archdeacons,
Commissaryes, Priests, Parsons, Deanes, Prebendaryes, Canons, etc. 
                  〈◊〉
               
is evident by theyr present estate: and by these reasons follovving.
            First, if all the false ministery, worship, and tyranny of Antichrist wers
in all other places of the world abolished, yet so long as this Prelacy and
other Clergy and worship aforesaid remayneth in this land, Antichrist that

sonne of perdition were not vtterly consumed: As the Scripture testifyeth
he shalbe by the light of the Gospell before Christs comming at the great day.
2 Thes. 2. 3. 8. vvith Rev. 14. 6. 7. 8. and 18. 19. and Ierem. 50. and 51. cap.
            
            Secondly, the Churches of Antichrist cannot be compleet in all the Canonicall
functions, Prelacy, and Ministery of Antichrist, if they have
not the functions, Prelacy, and Ministery of Archbishops, Lordbishops,
Archdeacons, Priests, and the rest now had and retayned in the Land.
This is proved by the Popes Canons and Pontificall, and by theyr Church
constitution.
            
            Thirdly, the Churches of Christ may be compleet in the whole ministery,
worship, and government appoynted by Christ to his Church, and yet
be alway and altogether without the present ministery, worship, and goverment
by Archbshops, Lordbishops, Archdeacons, Priests etc. now
had and retayned in this Land. This is proved by the constitution of the Primitiue
Churches planted by the Apostles: Which (the Scripture showeth) were
compleet in the former, and yet never had nor knew these latter. Rom. 12.
7. 8. Ephes. 4. 11. 12. 13. Act. 14. 23. and 20. 17. 28. 1. Cor. 12. 28. Col. 2. 5. Phil. 1.
1. Tit. 1. 5—9. 1 Tim. 3. and 5. cap. and 6. 13. 14. 1 Pet. 5. 1. 2. 3. 4. 12.
            Fourthly, if that which is had in this Land were the true Ministery,
worship, and government ordeyned by Christ in his Church, then ought
all the Churches of Christ vpon earth to vse the same (Mat. 28. 18. 19. 20.
1 Tim. 6. 13. 14. 1 Cor. 4. 17. and 12. 5. and 14. 37. Iude. ver. 3. Rev. 22. 16. 17.
18. 19.): But even the Prelates themselves and theyr Proctors confesse
it is and may be otherwise. VVhitg. in the preface of his last book against
T. C. Also the Aunsvver to the Abst
                     •
                  act: pag. 58.
            Finally, if that which is had in this Land were the true Ministery,
worship, and government appoynted by Christ to his Church, then might
it be found in the word of God: But that can it not. If any be otherwise
mynded, let them show the severall offices, entrance, administration,
and maintenance of the Prelacy and other Ministery of these assemblyes
out of the Scriptures and Testament of Christ.
            If they speak not according to this vvord, it is because
there is no light in them.

               Another letter written in answer of the

party that it was.
SECTION. 1.
               Grace and peace be with you in Iesus Christ
I haue receyued and read the letter, sent vnto you by
Mr. H. (as I vnderstand:) which you and others
entreat me to aunswer. Very vnwilling I am herevnto
in divers respects: And were it not for the truths sake
(which is called into question) I should not by any meanes
be drawen to write agaynst any, least off all against him who
I vnderstood wrote this letter vnto you. For howsoeuer in
these controversies of religion we do in iudgment or practise
differ one from another, yet for the knowledg I haue of him,
and the good gifts God hath given him, I do and shall alway
love him in the Lord. Yet notwithstanding seyng by
this letter the truth of Christ is obscured and oppugned, seing
also by this meanes you and others might be seduced into errour
and fall from your own stedfastnes: I durst not in this
case be wanting eyther to the defence off Christs truth, or to
the strengthning off you and others thereyn, to the uttermost
off my power: Specially vnderstanding that divers copyes
of this letter are spread abroad to the hurt of many: and being
also earnestly requested to aunswer it, not by you onely, but
by divers others whom in this case I could not well deny.
Besides that myne own present estate doth not a litle vrge me
hereunto for the clearing of my self, who for this truth have
now a long tyme suffred trouble, as an evill doer, euen vnto
bonds: But the word of God is not bound. For these causes
haue I ben drawen to answer this writing: hoping that
the truth will manifest and approue it self in the conscience of
every godly one. And of Mr. H. who wrote this letter, I
haue this hope more specially, for the good things I know to
be in him: howsoever he have ben overtaken thus to write
against the truth, as my self also hertofore in ignorance have
ben an adversary vnto it. But God had mercy on me: as I
trust he will also on him and many other yet otherwise mynded.
To God the Father of mercyes be prayse for ever.
               
                  
In this hope I will nou proceed by the helpe of God to make
aunswer to this letter: And first to the entrance of it,
then to the rest thereof. Concernig the entrance of it, these few
things onely will I note. First that if Mr. H. had duly considered
and compared with theyr estate theIam. 1. 19. 20. 21. words off the
Apostle here alledged by him self together with theVo
                        •
                     . 22. next
immediately following in this place (where it is further said,
And be ye doers of the word, and not heates onely deceyving
your own selues): He would I hope neyther have condemned
the innocent, even you for your obedience of Christ and his
word, neyther haue suffred his pen by misalledging the Scripture
thus to labor your with drawing from the obedience of
faith. But he would rather haue seen and acknowledged that
in theyr Church estate compared with the ordinance of Christ
they neyther are doers of the word, but deceyvers of themselues:
neyther do themselues lay aside the filthynes ād superfluity
of malice, with meeknes to receyve the word which is able
to save theyr soules: but are in deed become the enemyes and
persecuters of the truth, and that in great wrath and subtilty:
howsoever in word they professe otherwise, as do even the greatest
papists. Wherein would to God they were not also over
                  
                     •
                  aryed
with to high a conceit of themselues, and to base a
conceit of others who advise them better.
               Secondly for yourself, well may you think, as we all ought,
that it is no disgrace vnto vs, that our knowledg is imperfect,
and our judgment weak: seing the Apostle saith even off
himself as of all others,1. Cor. 1
                        •
                     . 9. 12. 
                  now we know but in part, and
now we see through a glasse darkely. Yet also would I desier
Mr. H. remember, and you to note it for your comfort,
that God so disposeth for his glory, as euen2. Ioh. ver. 4. and 7. the private
members of the true Church, yea women, are found
walking in the truth, as we have receyved a commaundement
from the Father, when many deceyvers (though men, and
in publick office) are abroad in the world and false Church,
which confesse not (in truth and in deed) Iesus Christ come
in the flesh, that onely Prophett, Priest, and king, whom God
hath giuen to his Church forever.
               Thirdly, towching them whom God vsed as his instruments
to draw you out off the bypa
                     ••
                  s of these assemblyes
into the way of truth wherein you now walk: as you have
iust cause to blesse God for them, so I pray you also regard
not so much who they be, as what they say. And in any case
take heed that youIam. 2. 
                        •
                     2. 
                  never have the faith of our glorious Lord

Iesus Christ in respect of persons: neyther of Princes,
nor prelates, nor any other though otherwise learned, rich, or
famous, any maner way. Neyther let the heat of the adversaryes
persecution, nor the coldnes of the tyme servers swallowing
vp all the abominations yet abiding among them, nor
the love of this present world, nor the colourable perswasion
of any though never so dare vnto you, neyther any other thing
whatsoever, ensnare you to be wrapped in like errour with
them: but remember alway (as is here well noted vnto you)
that the written word of God onely is to be the rule of our Life
and Religion.
               
               Lastly, concerning Mr. H. who wrote this letter vnto
you, as you shall do well to take it that he erreth of ignorance
and not of malice, etc. as he desireth to be taken: so of him
I would desier, for the taking away of this vayle from his eyes,
that he do heedfully look into the perfitt law of liberty: not
onely the better to see the filthynes of theyr corruptions that
he may avoyd them, but to behold also what orders and offices
Christ Iesus hath sett in his Church, to keep and observ
them. To which end he shall do well himself to Consider that
which here he hath sett down vnto you, concerning the writtē
word of God. According to which if he shall examine the particulars
of theyr Church-constitution (of which more, God
willing, hereafter): I hope he will no more say in this case,
that as of syncerity, as of God, in the sight of God, so writeth
he of these things: but will rather acknowledg that whosoever
go about to bring colour out of the Scriptures for them,
they do therein no other but2. Cor. 2. 17. 
                  make marchandize of the word
of God: And therefore will eyther stay his tal
                     ••
                  , and lay his
hand on his mouth: or if he speak, will speak to his own soule,
ādIudg. 6. 31. say, Wilt thou plead Antichrists cause▪ or wilt thou save
him? If he be of Christ, let him plead for himself, against them
that by the word of theyr testimony destroy his ordināces. Thus
much to the entrance of this letter.
               The rest of it is spent in laboring to disprove the writing
which it seemeth you gaue him in defence of your separation
from the ministery of these assemblyes. Which after he hath
well propounded in forme of reasoning, he then bringeth some
show of answer therevnto and of defence of theyr Ministery.
Wherein although I might in few lynes shortly have noted
the subtilty and vnsoundnes of his answers yet have I chosen
rather to write somewhat largely, both for your sake and his
own, and for others also into whose hands these writings

may co
                     ••
                  . And this haue I thought to be the more needfull,
because he doth here so earnestly both protest the syncerity of
his affection, and make promise that nothing shalbe brought
to perswade you, but the word of God. Now of the syncerity
of his affection I make no doubt, but do vertly thinck that
he writeth and walketh as he is perswaded. Onely where he
promiseth and pretendeth to bring the word of God for the
perswasion of your soule, and performeth it not in deed: and
yet hath such obiections and pretence off Scripture and reason,
as greater in this case (I thinck) neyther have ben neyther
can well be brought: there
                     •
                  ore have I thought it best, for
better clearing of the truth, to prosecute his annswers from
poynt to poyut: And although it wil be the more tedious, yet
to take this course therein: first, to sett down in his own
words his aunswers to the reason you gaue him: and then to
examine and take them away by the light of the Scriptures.
For your self, it shalbe your part (as he desireth you) to lay
apart all sinister affection, and with meeknes to receyv the
word of truth grafted in you, and able to save your soule. Consider
therefore well what is said: and the Lord give you vnderstanding
in all things. Now to proceed, it followeth in his
letter to you, thus.
            
         
         
            
               Mr. H. his letter. Section. 2.
               The summe of the vvhole vvriting you gaue me is a reason to prove the lavvfulnes
of your separation from our assemblyes, because vve have no such minissters
as you may lavvfully ioyne vvhithall: and for plainenes, it may fitly be cō
                  cluded
in this forme:

                     Whosoever he be that dealeth with the holy things
of God,The Reason alledged for separation from the Church ministry of England. and worketh vpon the Consciences of men, by
vertue of an Antichristian power office and calling, him
the people of God ought not to receyv or ioyne themselves
vnto: 2 Thes. 2. 4—10.
                     But all the ministers that stand ouer the Church assemblyes
in England, deale with the holy things of God, and
work vpon mens consciences by vertue of an Antichristian
power office & calling.
                     Therefore the people of God ought not to receyv them,
or ioyne themselves vnto them.
                  
               
               The first part of this reason as I am not vnvvilling to yeeld vnto, so do I affirme
that the vvords of the Apostle vvritten 2. Thes. 2. 4.—10. are for the proof thereof
vv
                     •
                  ested and perverted from the right sence. For the Apostle there describeth

Antichrist, nor by his unlavvfull on
                     •
                  vvard calling or office that he should exercise
in the Church, but first by the false doctrine he should teach, as appeareth
plainely by the 10 and 11 verses: and secondly by the authority he should
vsurpe to give lavves vnto mens consciences, and to rule in the harts of men as
God, as you may see in the 4. verse. VVhich tvvo ma
                     •
                  ks of Antichrist as they
may evidently be discerned in the papacy, so admitt all the outvvard calling and
offices in the Church of England exercised, vvere faulty and vnvvarrantable by
the vvord▪ yet you in, your ovvn Conscience knovv that these marks of Antichrist
can not be found amongst the vvorst of our ministers. For neyther do the lavves
of our Church allovv any to teach false doctrine, and vve all professe Christ to be
the onely lavv giver to the conscience, neyther is any thing amongst us vrged to
be done vpon payne of damnation, but onely the vvord and lavv of God.
            
            
               Answer to the 2. Section.
               MAyster H. sayth here, he is not vnwilling to yeeld to the
first part of the reason: Yet afterward in his letter when
he hath taken some exception agaynst the prooff off it,
contradicting himselff, heIn sectiō 5. in the end of it. hath these words, And this I hope
may be sufficient to show how vntrue that is which is affirmed
in the first part of the reason, &c. Now to yeeld to the first part
of the reason (as being true) and to hold that which is affirmed
in it to be vntrue, what are these but contradictary the
one to the other? But to let this passe, because it may be I mistake
his meaning, or he forgott himselff: I com to show
that the words off the Apostle written 2. Thes. 2. 4. &c. do fitly
and directly proue the first part off the reason, and therefore
are not for the proof thereof wrested and perverted from the
right sence, as he taketh exception. I prove it thus first.
               If this2. Thes. 2. 4. &c. Scripture teach that such as receyv or ioyne vnto
Antichrist that man of sinne in his apostasy, opposition,
and exaltation above all that is called God and that is holy,
that such (I say) shall perish because they receyv not the love
off the truth, but are caryed with a strong delusion to beleev
lies and to please themselues in that transgression of the lawes
and ordinances off God: then it proueth that the people off
God may not receyv or ioyne vnto any which deale with the
holy things off God ād work vpon mens cōsciences by vertue
off any off that Antichrists power, offices, and callings: because
in so doyng they cannot but haue fellowship in that apostasy,
opposition, and exaltation off Antichrist, and thereby
stand subiect to perish eternally, forasmuch as they receyv
not the loue off the truth, but in a strong delusion please themselues
in vntruth and vnrighteousnes, even in Antichrists trāsgression
off the lawes and ordinances off Iesus Christ.
               
                  
But the former is true: as may appeare by comparing together
vers. 3. 4. 7. 8. with vers. 10. 11. 12. Therefore also the
latter.
               Next for proof hereoff, let us marke how the Apostle describeth
Antichrist in this Scripture. Which we fynd to be by
many mo effects and propertyes then Mr. H. hath noted: and
such also, as do plainely show that this Scripture proveth
the truth of the first part of the reason for which it is alledged:
               1. As first, that Antichrist shall make2. Thes. 2. 3. 
                  Apostasy and
departure from the faith and order off Iesus Christ prescribed
to his Church. Which whether he haue not done it in the
offices of ministery, in the entrance into them, in the works
and maintenance off them, aswell as in other poynts off the
faith and commaundements of Christ, let the things themselues
speak.
               2. Secondly, that he shall beVers. 3. 
                  a man of sinne. Where
it is to be obserued, that as the true Church of Christ is compared
to the body of a man, and together with Christ the head
thereof, is called by the name of Christ (1. Cor 12. 12.) so
the false Church of Antechrist is compared also to the body of
a man, and consisting of all the parts together is called a man
of sinne: even wholy given and caryed to sinne and transgression
of the law of God. Which as in other parts it is to be
seen, so also in the offices and functions of that body of Antechrist
that man of sinne.
               3. Thirdly, that he shallVer. 3. and 7. first work as it were in secrett,

                     
                        •

                  Sathan shall set all his power and
cunning as to erect and establish, so also to vphold this throne
and kingdome of Antichrist: And that with such power and
lying wonders, as (if it were possible) the very elect should
be deceyved.
               8. Moreover, that notwithstanding all the power of
Sathan, aūd the Apostasy, subtil
                     •
                  y, opposition, exaltation, and
iniquity of the man of sinne, yet at lengthVer. 3. and 8. compard vvith Rev. 14. 6. 7. 8. he shall with
all his offices and constitutions be vtterly consumed by the spirit
and povver of Christ Iesus, appearing in the brightnes of his
Gospell, before the last day. Wherevpon also he is here called
the sonne of perdition, being by God foreappoynted to be
destroyed and abolished.
               9. Finally, that
                  ver. 10. 11. 12. compared vvith Rev. 14. 9. 10 11. 
                  they which partake in his apostasy and
iniquity, shall justly perish: because they receyv not the love
of the truth to obey Iesus Christ, that they might be saved: but
being strongly deluded, beleev and please themselves in the lyes
and vnrighteousnes of Antichrist vnto condemnation.
               By all which it appeareth both how vnperfitly Mr. H.
hath noted down the marks of Antichrist described in this
place, and that Antichrist is here described to haue vnlawfull
calling
                     •
                   and offices. For otherwise how should he stand2. Thes. 2. 3. in
apostasy from the true callings and offices, aswell as from
the other ordinances appoynted by Iesus Christ? how els
should he stand so directly inVer. 4. 
                  opposition against, and so
proudly in exaltation aboue all that is called God, and that is
holy?Ver. 8. how should he els be said to be lavvles, contemning
and treading vnder foot the lawes and commaundements of
Iesus Christ? Yea; how should he els deceyv the world so as
he doth inver. 10. 11 all deceyveablenes of vnrighteousnes, if he
had not vnlawfull callings and offices, wherein to teach and
reigne over the people 
                     •
                  educed by him: which yet they beleving
lyes should count to be lawfull, as they do even vnto this
day?
               But to let other reasons alone, and to take the marks of
Antichrist, which Mr. H. hath himself here set down. I would
aske, first how Antichrist shall teach his false doctrine (which
here Mr. H. noteth to be one marke): whether in the lawfull
offices and callings ordeyned by Christ, or in the vnlawfull
offices and callings devised by Sathan and vsed by this
man of sinne in his Apostasy? Secondly, how he shall vsurpe
that authority, to give lawes vnto mens consciences, and to
rule in the hearts of men as God (which Mr. H. noteth as the
                     •
                  
                  
other marke): whether in the true offices and callings appoynted
by Christ, or in false ones devised by Sathan ād himself?
For the very termes and actions of teaching and of vsurping
authority, here mentioned by Mr. H. do in this case imply
some offices and callings, lawfull or vnlawfull, wherein
to teach and vsurpe authority. Now lawfull they can not be,
because he standeth in apostasy from Christs way, yea oppositt
against it, and even lawles in that respect. It remayneth
therefore that they are vnlawfull ones. And being found not
one lyin the papacy, but in the Church of England: it followeth
that they are not to be receyved or ioyned vnto in the one
any more then in the other: as also that this Scripture is not
wres
                     •
                  ed, but fitly and foundly alledged for the proof of the first
part of the reason.
               But because Mr. H. taketh exception at the proof, though
all in vayne: yet for his better satisfaction, and more strenghtning
of the proposition, let him further consider, first, that
as Christ being king and Lord of his Church, hath given
vnto it the holy things of his word, Sacraments, Censures,
Treasury etc. so he hath also as1. Co

                  e to the end of
the world, to witt, Pastors, Teachers, Elders, Deacons and
Helpers, for the due administration of these his holy things
according to his word, being lawfully called therevnto. So as
neyther any may medle therewith by vertue of any Antichristian
power office or calling, nor if they do, may any ioyne
with them therein, least partaking in theyr sinnes, they receyv
also of theyr plagues. Secondly, that1. Co

                     . 3. 16. 17. and 2. Cor. 6 16. 17. 18. compared vvith 2. Thes 2. 4. 10. our consciences
are the Temples of the holy Ghost. Wherrvpon it must needs
follow, that we may not suffer Antichrist to fitt in them at all:
as he doth whensoever we suffer them to be wrought vpon in
the ministery of the word or any other wayes, by vertue of
any Antichristian power office or calling. And this I thought
to annexe for the further confirmation of the first part of the
reason: which though in word Mr. H. seemeth to graunt, yet
in deed he laboreth to oppugne.
               Now where he saith, the lawes of theyr Church allow not any
to teach false Doctrine: although this be not much materiall
towching the poynt in controversy, seing they allow not
any to teach true doctrine but in false and Antichristian callings,
which is vtterly vnlawfull to be done: yet we fynd that
by the lawes of theyr Church many false doctrines are and

may be tauht amoug them. A tast of which leaven of theyrs▪
I will give in some particulars, as followeth.

               These and divers other false doctrines do the lawes of theyr
Church allow to be taught. And if any among them teach
otherwise, they are subiect to be suspended, excommunicated,

degraded, deprived by theyr Lords the Prelates, theyr Chauncelours,
and Officials. And we, because we teach and walk
otherwise, are haled to prisons and gallowes, banished and
rayled upon, yea hated of all men for the truths sake.
               Now as you see the lawes of theyr Church allow false doctrine
to be taught: so for theyr preaching also of the truth,
consider I pray you what themselues haue heretofore written
of themselues. In anSecond admon. to the Parliam. pag. 6 ād 7. 
                  admonition to the Parliament, they
say and write of theyr Church estate, as followeth. We are
(say they) so scarce com to the outward face of a Church rightly
reformed, that although some truth be taught by some preachers,
yet no preacher may without great daunger of the lawes
utter all the truth comprised in the book of God. It is so circumscribed
and wrapt within the compasse of such articles, such penaltyes,
such Injunctious, such advertissements, such articles,
such canons, such sober caveats, and such manifold pamphlets,
that in maner it doth but peep out from behind the skreen. The
lawes of the land, the book of common prayer, the Queens Injunctious

these together or the worst of them (as some of them be to bad)
may not be broken or offended against, but with more daunger
then to offend against the Bible. To these subscribing, and subscribing
again, and the third subscribing are required: for these
preachers and others are indited, are fined, are prisoned, are excommunicated,
are banished, and haue worse things threatned
them. And the Bible, that must haue no further scope, then by
these it is assigned. Is this to professe Gods word? Is this a reformation?

the vvhole authority aboue it. So did the popish Church. But

to be the onely lavv giver vnto the conscience. Is this so in

                  ssion they make herein.
And first, I aske, what if the Papists professe as much?
Will suchTit. 1. 16. profession in word help any thing, when in deed
by theyr works they deny it? Secondly, let Mr H. remember,
thatDem

                     stra▪in the preface to the Reader also, Declar, of eccses, discip. some of themselues affirme, vvhiles they professe
Christ to be a king, and per submitt not to the lavves he hath
prescribed in his vvord, they make him an Idoll, and putt a scepter
of reed in his hand. Thirdly, do not they fynd fault with
the Papists, ād prove them to bend true Church though they
professe in word that Christ is the king of his Church, becouse
in deed they obey not his lawes, but have invented and use
theyr own canons and constitutions for government of the
Church? Mark well theyr own words inGods arrovv against A therists, Papists, etc. cap. 5. a treatise lately
published, wherein they prove the Church of 
                     •
                  ome not to be
the true Church, by this reason following: The Papists in
vvord vvill not deny, but Christ is a king, vvhich hath all povver
in heaven and in earth: But in deed it appeareth they do exile
and banish him out of his kingdome, or at least leav him but a
small portion or rather none at all. For in respect that he is a spirituall
king and the king of his Church, he is also (as IamesI am. 4. 12.
speaketh) the onely lavvgi
                     •
                  er thereunto: and therefore by his
lavves onely the Church is to be governed: Which they cannot
abide. For they adde their popish Canous, constitutions, and
customes, vvhereby they vvill haue, the Church governed: Yea,
they vvill haue these take place, though they utterly displace the
vvord of God for the maintenance of them. These are theyr
own words in that treatise. Thus they reason against the
Papists. And is not this reason (I pray you) as strong against
themselues, and against theyr own Church, Prelates
and Clergy? Yea, are not theyr ecclesiasticall assemblyes

the obedience of Christ and his lawes, then the Papists hav

                  ?

Lastly, seing Mr H. saith they professe Christ to be the onely
lawgiver to the conscience: Let him in syncerity of heart, as
before God, aunswer vs these few questions:

                     1 Whether then obedience be not to be given to the Lord
Iesus in whatsoever he hath commaunded, and all his
lawes and ordinances to be observed, though all the
Princes on earth should forbid it.
                     2 Why then they abstayne from the observation of
those Lawes and ordinances whichT. C. first reply pag. 177. Declar. of 
                              •
                           ccles. disipline, etc. themselves have
taught and written to be appoynted by Iesus Christ,
to be kept vnblameable and without spott vntill his
appearing, yea, though it be with the losse of wealth, honour,
liberty, and life it self.
                     3 Whether the Lord Iesus the lawgiver of his Church
have not set in his Church to continew to the end of the
world, the offices of Pastours, Teachers, Elders, Deacons
and Helpers: together with theyr entrance, works,
and maintenance: for the administration of his holy
things.
                     4 Whether the Offices of Archbishops, Lord bisshops,
priests, deacons, vicars, and the rest now had in
England, theyr maner of entrance into them, theyr administration
of them by theyr popish canons and book
of common prayer, theyr maintenance in them by tithes
Lordships, Chrismes, offrings ād such like, be appoynted
by Christ that onely Lawgiver to his Church: and
in what places of his Testament.
                     5 Whether being not prescribed by Christ, but derived
from and belonging to Antichrist, any can eyther administer
or joyne vnto them in that estate: and yet in
truth acknowledg Christ to be the onely lawgiver to the
conscience.
                     6 Fynally, whether they which abyde one with the
world and false Church, not separating themselves from
them according to theAct. 2. 40. and 19. 9. 2 Cor. 6. 17. 18. Rev. 18. 4. 1. Tim. 6. 3. 4. 5. commaundement of Christ:
which administer or receyv the word or Sacraments in
or from a false ministery: which how down vnto traditions
and false worship devised and imposed by man:
which stand subiect to be silenced and excommunicated
by the Prelates, theyr Chauncelours and Archdeacons:
whether these (I say) can be said in truth to hold Christ
to be the onely lawgiver to the conscience? Or whether

they receyv not the mark of the Beast, and as yet stand subjects
of his kingdome, submitting to his Antichristian lawes
and constitutions.
                  
               
               In the last place Mr. H. addeth, that nothing among
them is vrged to be done vpon payne of damnation, but onely
the word and law of God. To which I aunswer, first, that
if this were true, yet it is not to the purpose seing many things
among them contrary to the word of God are vrged to be done
vpon payne of imprisonment, confiscation of Goods and
lands, banishment, death, and such like. Secondly, I aunswer
that they do require men to be subiect to theyr excommunication
vpon payne of damnation, asAd salutem animae that is, to the salvation of the so
                        •
                     le. theyr own words
in theyr writs of excommunication do show. Now it is evident
and confessed by the best of themselves, that they have not
Christs power to excommunicate, but execute it contrary to
the word of God, by an Archdeacon or Lordly Prelate, according
to theyr canons, Wherevpon also (to note it by the way)
it followeth, that they are not a true Church of Christ. For
1 Cor. 5. 4. 6. Mat. 18. 17. 18. 19. 20. And this Mr H. graunteth aftervvardrin section. 5. Christs Church hath alwayes Christs power to excommunicate:
Whereas these assenblyes have no other power
to excommunicate, but by the Archdeacon or Lordbischop,
whose offices be Antichristian. And herevpon it is, that the
more religious any is among them, the more he contemneth
theyr excommunication: Which were a fearefull sinne, if theyr
Church were a true Church, whose bynding on earth were
such as bound also in heaven. Thirdly, I aunswer, if theyr
ministery and worship of God were according to the word ād
law of God, then ought all vpon payne of damnation to submit
ād ioyne vnto it. Now if they do not so vrge it, themselves
do thereby acknowledg, that it is not of God. If they do so

                     •
                  rgeit, then they vrge vpon payne of damnation that which
is contrary to the word and law of God: as hath ben and
shall more be showed hereafter. Now it followeth in his letter,
thus.
            
         
         
            
               Mr. H. his letter. Section. 3.
               TO vvhich purpose also I besech you to consider, that althoug there is not the
least part of Christs ordinances that can be neglected vvithout grievous sinne
yet the vvant or neglect of some of these ordinances of Christ, vvhich concerne
the discipline of his Church and the outvvard calling of the ministers, is no such
sinne, as can make eyther the ministers, and governours of our Church Antichrists,
or our Church an Antichristian and false Church. And although divers corruptions remayne in our Church, vvhich vvere derived to vs from the

Papi
                     •
                  es (the least vvhereof I vvill not take vpon me to defendt, yet are they not
of that nature that can make vs an Antichristian Church.
               For first, no one place of Scripture can be found, vvherein he is called a

Antichrist or Antichristian, vvho holding the truth of doctrine, and professing
those articles of religion that are fundamētall as you knovv vve do) doth 
                     〈◊〉
                  
eyther in iudgment or practise from that rule that Christ hath given for the
Discipline of his Church. In the prophecy of Daniel, Antichrist is described by
his Doctrine, Dan. 7. 8. 25.
               
                  So is he in the epistle to the Thessalonians, 2 Thes. 2. 10. 11.
                  And in the epistle to Timothy, 1 Tim. 4. 1. 2. 3.
                  And in the Epistles of Iohn, 1 Ioh. 2. 22. and 4. 3. and 2▪ Ioh. 7.
                  And in the book of Revelation: chap 13. 5. 6.
               
               Neyther can you fynd any Antichrist mentioned in the Scripture, vvhose doctrine
vvas sound▪ Our Saviour Christ calleth him a true Pastour, and no hi

               He affirmeth also that vvhosoever beleveth in his heart, and confesseth vvith
his mouth, that he is that Christ and Messiah promised, is a true member of his
Church and built vpon a rock, against vvhich the gates of hell shall not prevaile.
If then the doctrine of our Church be sound, vvhat vvarrant have you to call
                     •
                  s
Antichrists? If our pastours offer to lead you vnto salvation through no other
doore then Christ, hovy dare you that say you are Christs, refuse to be guyded
by them? If our asse
                     •
                  blyes be built vpon that rock, hov
                     •
                   can you deny them to
be true Churches?
            
            
               Aunswer to Section, 3.
               IT is to be noted here, first that Mr. H. denyeth not but they
stand in grievous sinne, by neglecting Christs ordināces: secondly,
that he graunteth they retayne divers corruptions in
theyr Church, which were derived to them from the Papists.
How theyr case standing thus by his own confession, how can
he peswade you or any other toRev. 18. 4. and 14. 9. 20. partake with them in such
sinnes, vnles he would have you also to receiv of theyr plagnes.
               Agayn it is to be observed, that 
                     •
                  r. H. faith here, he will
not take vpon him to defend the least of theyr popish corruptions:
And yet doth cleane otherwise throughout this letter,
chiefly in his aunswer to the second part of the reason. But to
omitt this, I would desier to have noted down in particular,
the corruptions remayning in theyr Church, which
he confesseth were derived to them from the Papists.
And then, let it be iudged whether they be Antichristian.
               Here also it is to be mynded, that the ministery and

constitution of theyr Church is not charged to be Antichristian,
because of this, that they want or neglect some of
Christs ordinances (as here he may seem to insinuate) but because
they have and submitt vnto Antichrists: as will appeare
in the discussing of them. In the meane tyme (to omitt many
other) let him consider, first, that theyr forcing and confounding
in the body of their Church all maner people though
never so wicked, to stand members thereof, is meerlyRev. 13. 16. and 18 2 Antichristian,
and directly contrary to the order of Iesus Christ,
who hath commanded his people toAd. 2. 40 41. Rev. 18. 4. 2. Cor. 6. 1

Officials (in whom resteth the chief ecclesiasticall power among
them) are also Antichristian, and were never sett by
Christ in his Church. Thirdly, that the offices, of theRev. 18. 11. and 17. 1. &c. ād 9. 3. compared vvith Heb. 7 12. Rom. 12. 7. 8 Ephes. 4. 11. 12. 1. Tim. 5. 17.

                  ipendaryes, and the rest of the
inferiour ministery among them, theyr entrance also into
theyr offices, theyr administration of them, and maintenance
in them, are not found in the Testament of Christ nor in the
Primitive Churches planted by the Apostles, but derived
from and belonging to the aposta
                     •
                  y of Antichrist, and found
in his popish pontifi
                     •
                  all and assemblyes even vnto this
day.
               Next towching theyr profession he speaketh of, I aunswer:
first, that the verball profession of the articles of religion
that are fundamentall, will no more help them then it
doth the Papists: who do also verbally and daily repeat and
professe in generall the articles of faith, called the Apostles
treed, and the Creed of Athanasius, of Nice, and Calcedon:
wherein are briefly and generally conteyned the fudamentall
poynts of Christian religion. But what avayleth this eyther
the one or the other, when otherwise in particular, all
of them in practise, and some in judgment deny Christ to be
that eternall Prophet, Priest, and king of his Church, howsoeuer
in word and generall they both do professe it.
               Secondly I aunswer, that the very strength of delusion, ād
depth of the subtilty of Antichrist (by which he deceyveth) stā
                  deth
in this, that he pretendeth to be for ād with Christ, ād teacheth
many excelēt truths▪ otherwise he would soone be espyed
and forsaken: whereas now it is a mystery (as the Scripture
2. Thes. 2. 7. Rev. 17. 5. saith) hardly discerned, and hardlyer avoyded. Hereupon it
is that among the Papists, so many of them are deluded, whi
                  
                     •••
                  
the Pope professeth he is not against Christ, but for him,

even his vica
                     •
                  , and Peters successor: that his Church is the
Catholik Church, out of which there is no salvation, and such
like. And among these in England likewise, whiles theyr ministers
pretend to be the ministers of Christ, and professe to
bring his Gospell with them: when as in deed they revile
and persecute the true and sy
                     •
                  cexe practise of it even vnto
death.
               Thirdly I aske, whether the ministery worship and government
appoynted by Christ for his Church vnder the gospell,
be not asmuch of the foundation, as the ministery, worship,
and government appoynted by Moses for the tyme of
the law? And if they be, whether they are not as faithfully sett
down by Christ as the other were by Moses, and as carefully
to be observed by vs, as the other were by the Iewes: or rather
much more, in asmuch asHeb. 3 1 2. 3. Christ the Sonne is

                  y of more glory and honour, then Moses the servant.
               Fourthly I aske, what fundamentall articles of religion
Moses and Aar on with the rest of the Iewes ioyning with
them held, thatNum. 16. 1. 2. 3. &c. Corah, Dathan, Abiram
                     •
                   and theyr
company held not: differing onely from them concerning the
office of Priesthood and Ministery thereof, a matter of the
Discipline, as these men
                     •
                  call it. Yet were they with all that departed
not from theyr tents destroyed by the iust iudgment of
God. The like may be seen in other poynts of the Discipline

what pretence soever it be, and transgression is wickednes and
Idolatry, how lightly soever men account thereof.
               Fifthly whereas Mr H. saith there is no Antichrist whose
Doctrine is sound: I willingly graunt it, and have already
showed their case to be such. Yet with all I wish Mr H.
to marke, that even Antichrist that man of 
                     •
                  inne professeth
many notable truths and foundamentall articles of religion,
as that there is a God, one in essence, three in persons, the
Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost: that Christ is God and
Man, Prophet, Priest, and king of his Church: that the
holy Ghost is present with the Church of Christ to the end of

the world: that there shall be a resurectiō of iust and vniust, etc.
And yet notwithstanding standeth he with all his followers
in defection from the truth and obedience of Christ, even to
destruction. By all which is manifest, that the verball profession
helpeth litle, when men in practise and particulars
deny that, which inword in generall they

                  ive the world, as if they held the truth, when
indeed they fight against it.
               Finally therefore on the one hand vnderstanding by the
Discipline of the Church (as we ought) the auncyent and holy
order and ordinances, which Christ Iesus by his last Testament
hath given to his Church, for the administration of
his holy things, and for the keeping of his people in the obedience
of faith: and considering on the other hand, that2 The
                        •
                      2. 3. 4. Rev. 17. 4. 5.
Antichrist hath perverted that holy order, and made apostasy
from those holy lawes, advauncing himself and his own constitutions
above them, and that also in the ministery, worship
and government of the Church, aswell as in other parts thereof:
it doth and must needs follow herevpon, that whosoever
do not onely not keep that holy order and appointement
of Christ, but also bow down to the confusion and false Ministery
of Antichrist, they stand in Antichrian estate, notwithstanding
any truths they teach, professe, or mainteyne. So as
then the Ministery of the Church of England being never ordeyned
by Christ, but derived from Antichrist that man of

                     〈◊〉
                  , it helps them not in this behalf, that they teach and
receiv much truth therein: as we see it helpeth not the papists,
that theyr priests teach, there is a God, a Christ an holy Spirit;
& Church, a resurrection, and many other fundamentall

                     〈◊〉
                   of Christian religion, as before hath ben said.
               But now let vs come to examine, whether in the Scriptures
here alledged by Mr H. Antichrist be not described to be
against Iesus Christ, even in that which they call the discipline
of the Church, as in other things also agreing to them in
theyr estate. The first Scripture he alledgeth, is out of the
Dan. 7. 8 25. prophecy of Daniel. The words are these:

                     I considered the hornes, and behold, another home,
a litle one, came vp among them, and three of the first
hornes were pluckt away before it. And loe, eyes like the
eyes of a man were in that home, and a mouth speaking
presumptuous things,
                      Dan. 7. 8.
                  
                  
                     
                        
And he shall speak words against the most High,
and consume the Saints of the most High, and think to
alter the tymes and law: and they shalbe given into
his hand for a tyme, and tymes, and half a tyme, 
                     Dan.
7. 25.
                  
               
               Now although this Scripture seem first to be vnderstood
of Antiochus Ep
                     •
                  hanes, and of his pride and tyranny against
the truth and people of God: yet may it also fi
                     •
                  ly be applyed
further and compared with the description of the beast in the
Rev. 13. Cap. and 9. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. Revelatiō, and so with the Antichristian prelacy and pri
                     •••
                  
                  hood
from tyme to tyme. For (to omitt other things that
might here be observed, and to note onely such things as art
most evident) we see here that horne of the beast described to
have eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking presumtuous
things. Even so the ministers of Antichrist (who will
needs be the eyes of the people and light of the world) pretend
to be the ministers of Christ: and not that onely, but haue also
(aswell as that horne) a mouth speaking presumptuous
things, even against the most High. See it in these particulars
following, and such like which are rise among
them: that the true ministery and syncere practise of the
Gospell of Christ, is schisme, heresy, fancy, rebellion,
insurrection, sedition, subversion of the State, and what
not? that Christ the Sonne hath ben lesse faithfull then
Moses the servant, in setting down any prescript ministery
and order for the Church vnder the Gospell perpetually to be
kept: that Christ who hath all power i
                     •
                   heaven and in

                     •
                  arth, is not to be submitted vnto in that ministery order and
discipline which he hath given to his Church, if Princes on
earth forbid or refuse to establish it: that the ministery of
Antichrist is to be receyved and ioyned vnto, being appointed
by Christian Princes for the service of God: that it is
lawfull for others to be Archbishops and Lordbishops over
the Church and ministers of the Gospell, besides Iesus
Christ: that a priesthood, a stinted number of words and
prayers, tithes, and such like are appointed for the ministery
of the Gospell of Christ: that Christ shall not reigne over
them by his offices and ordinances prescribed in his word:
that Christ in his soule went down into hell, whiles his
body remayned in the grave: wherevnto may be added the
blasphemous speach of theyr prelates to such as they make

priests, when they say vnto them Receyv the holy Ghost, as
if the holy Ghost were in theyr power to give to whom and
when they please. Now let all men that have any
spark of knowledg or feare of God in theyr hearts iudge
whether these and such like among them be not presumptuous
speaches, even against the most High, and consequently whether
this Scripture be not verifyed of them, that they have
a mouth speaking presumptuous things.
               But besides theyr speaches, to come also to theyr actions
noted in this Scripture: do they not consume the Saints
of the most High, in theyr prisons, at theyr gallowes, by
tossing them vp and down, keeping them from theyr trades,
driving them into banishment, and infinite such calamityes?
Do they not think they may chaunge the tymes
and Law, as Daniel here speaketh? Els whence are come
theyr chaunging of working dayes into holy day
                     •
                  s, theyr
fasting da
                     •
                  es also and forbidding of Mariage in Lent,
Advent, and other seasons of the yeare? Whence likewise
have proceeded theyr chaunging and refusing of the Lawes
of Christ appoynted in his word for the ministery and
order of his Church: and the receyving and practising of
other lawes, offices, canons, constitutions, facultyes,
dispensations, and a thousand such like never appoynted
by God? Thus we see the testimony of Damel here alledged
by Mr H. maketh altogether against themselves, and
in a few words effectually describeth theyr most scarefull
estate.
               
                  Wherevnto vpon this occasion we may fitly adde other
like prophecyes of Daniel, and apply them also in like
maner to this purpose: as for example,

now I adde onely these particulars concerning this
Scripture and theyr estate to be duly weighed of them. First
whether their Prelacy, ministery, courts and proceedings ecclesiasticall
be not deceits of vnrighteousnes. Secondly, whether
theyr obiections, 
                     •
                  avils, and apposition against the truth
be not also of the same nature. Thirdly, whether they receyv
the love of the truth that they might be saved, when as they receyv
not that ministery worship and governmēt of the Church
which Christ hath appoynted therevnto: whoHeb. 5. 9. 
                        •

author of eternall salvation onely vnto them that obey him.
Fourthly, whether they be not strongly deluded to beleev lyes
to damnation, when as in religion they receyv and submitt
vnto the Prelacy, ministery, worship, and constitutions of
men yea of that beastly man of sinne here spoken of: theRev. 14. 9. 10. 11. Psal. 119. 21. vvith Exod. 20. 4. 5.

               The next place he citeth, is out of the1. Tim. 4. 
                        •
                     . 2. 3. first epistle to

Here we see it was foretold, first that Antichrist should
make departure from the faith. Which bring done by him
aswell in the ministery and worship appoynted by Christ, as
in other poynts and doctrines of the Gospell: it can not be avoyded,
but that the ministery and worship of these assemblyes
being derived from that apostasy, they are also within compasse
of this Scripture, notwithstanding they teach and professe
many excellent poynts of the faith, as do also the Papists
themselves not a few.
               Secondly, it was foretold, that the followers of Antichrist
should give heed to spirits of errour and Doctrines of divels, and
speak lyes through hypocrisy having theyr consciences feared
with an hott yron. Which to be verifyed of them in theyr constitution
and practise, may sufficiently be seen both in their false
doctrinesPag. 10. 11. 12. 13. before mentioned to which they give heed, and
in that which hath benPag. 7. 22. 23. 26. said before concerning Dan. 7. and 2
Thes. 2. To which I refer you.
               Thirdly, it is here foretold, that Antichrist and his followers
should forbid mariage, and meats: towching which, two
this onely will I say at this tyme. For the first, that as it
excuseth not the Papists from being deciphered in this Scripture
because they suffer mariage to the lay people (as they
call them) when as they forbid it to theyr priests: so it will
but litle a vayle these, that they permitt it to their ministers,
and yet forbid it to fellowes of Colledges in the universityes,
and to others mo among them. Besides that they forbid it
to all peole whatsoever in Lent. Rogation week, and such like
popish seasons: And when they do permitt it, suffer
it onely to be solemnized by a priest, and according to theyr
book: Which is meerly popish and never appoynted by God.
For the second, that is, the forbidding of meats, let them cō
                  sider
well with themselves theyr absteyning from flesch on
Saints eves, Ember dayes, Fridayes and Saterdayes,
more then vpon of her dayes, and in Lent more then other seasons
of the yeare: let them (I say) consider these things wel
and see whether they more agree with the rule of the Apostle
here set down, or with the defection of Antichrist here foretold.
               Next he alledgeth divers testimonyes out of1 Io

By this shall ye know the Spirit of God: Every spirit
that confesseth Iesus Christ come in the flesh, is of God.
And every spirit which confesseth not Iesus Christ come in
the flesh, is not of God: but this is the spirit of Antichrist,

                  2. Ioh. 7.
               
               HEre in few words is comprised a most notable direction
how to know Antichrist, and declared also by the contrary
in the fourth chapter, as is here noted down. Where
the Apostle teacheth vs to trye and know the spirits of all men
by the confession they make concerning Christ: to witt, by
theyr acknowledging or derogating from his person, or office.
For vnto these two heads he bringeth the whole matter, the
one concerning the person, the other concerning the office of
the Lord Iesus. Towching his person, that he is God and
Man in one and the same person. His Godhead he noteth
out in these words [Iesus Christ is come] to witt, the Sonne of
God from heaven: his manhood in those words [in the
flesh]: the vniting and knitting together of these two natures
in one person, when speaking of one and the same Iesus
Christ, he saith, he is come in the flesh.
               
               Towching his office, that this Iesus is the CHRIST, that
is, the annoynted of God, that should come into the vvorld,
to be the onely and sufficient Mediator betwixt God and man.

This have I shortly noted for the better vnderstanding
of these Scriptures, and deciding of the controversy between
vs and these assemblyes. And this to be the true meaning of
these Scriptures, appeareth not onely by the Argument and
circumstances of the places themselues, but also by the conference
of other Scriptures here quoted in the margent, and infinite
such like in the Book of God. Now before I proceed to
any further application of them, let me here again call to
powr mynd that which hath before ben noted, that even the
Papists themselves (whom these men acknowledg to be of
Antichrist) affirme in generall words and will dy in it against
the Iewes and Turks, that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh,
the Prophet, Priest, and king of his Church. Yet will not
Mr. H. or any of good knowledg say to the contrary, but the
Papists notwithstanding are by these Scriptures convinced
to be of Antichrist, because that although they professe thus
much in generall termes, yet when as theyr estate and practise
is examined by the Scriptures in particular, they are found
to professe that in word which in truth and in deed they do not
acknowledg. And why then may not we so reason from these
Scriptures agaynst these assemblyes, which in theyr constitution
and practise do likewise in deed deny that in particular,
which in generall they do professe concerning Christs prophecy,
priesthood, and Kingdome? Mr. Beza in his notes
Beza his notes vpon 1 Ioh. 4. 2. 3. and vpon 1 Ioh. 2. 22. and 2
                        •
                      Ioh. 7. vpon these Scriptures, sayth thus, The Apostle here
giveth a sure and perpetuall rule to discerne Antichrists and Antichristian
Doctrine by, to vvitt, if the diuine or humane nature
of Christ or the true vnitiug of them together be denyed, or
if never so litle be derogated from the office of that our everlasting
high Priest, Prophet, and King. Math this well. Thus
doth Mr. Beza vnderstand these Scriptures: and thus he
gathereth from them: as you may see in his notes vpon the
new Testament which are printed in English. And these
Scriptures themselues we see do not poynt at the Papists alone,
as if they onely were culpable herein: but they concerne
all others whosoever they be that come within compasse of
these rules. Now to show in particulars how the Papists
offend in this behalf, denying that in deed concerning Christ,
which in word they do acknowledg, is altogether needles at
this tyme: it being graunted on both parts, I meane, both
of vs and of them which yet stand in these assemblyes. It
shalbe sufficient therefore to show that these assemblyes of
England (as now they stand) do not in this theyr constitution

of Church ministery, worship, and order receyv and obey▪
Iesus Christ in his own ordinance, as theyr Prophet, Priest,
and King: And therefore howsoever in word generally they
professe, yet in truth do not in this theyr constitution acknowledg
Iesus Christ come in the flesh: And consequently (by the
rule and sentence of the Apostle in these Scriptures) are not
of God, but of Antichrist.
               First therefore concerning Christs Prophecey, that they do
not receyv and hearken vnto him in his own ordināce as their
Prophett, is to lamentably evident by this, that they do not
receyv and submitt vnto that ecclesiasticall order, ministery,
and government, which Christ Iesus that Prophet of his
Church hath revealed from God the Father in his word, and
prescribed to his Church to be kept to the end of the world.
This I show two wayes: First, by theyr Church constitution:
then by theyr own confession.
               The present constitutiō of their Church assemblyes throughout
the land is such, as they stand every one of them sub

                  ect to
the ministery and government of another Archbishop and
Lord bishop then Iesus Christ, of an Archdeacon, and a parson,

absolutions, and such other theyr procedings.
Which are not onely not found in the Testament of Christ appoynted
by that Prophet: but were derived from Antichrist
that lyar and deceyver of the world.
               
                  Theyr confession is manifest in theyr books and writings,
wherein they have published to the view of the world,

both of Christ himself and of his Apostles. Of Christ himself,

when he sent them into the world, to publish his faith,
and plant his Churches therein. In which he straitly charged
them to teach all his people baptized in his name, not to acknowledg
onely but, to keep and observ vvhatsoever he
had commaunded them: and that even to the end of the vvorld:
not making any exception of Christian or heathen Magistrates,
of theyr allowance or disallowance, or of any other worldly
respects whatsoever. The Apostles also as they were commaunded,
so they performed: both1 Cor. 4. 17. et. 11. 1. 2. 23. et. 12. 5. 18. 28. et. 14. 33. 37. Col. 2. 5. Gal. 1. 11. 12. Eph. 4. 11 12. Tit. 1. 5. Act. 14. 23. et 20. 17. 27. 28. 1 Pet. 1. 13. et. 5. 1. 2. 3 4. 12. plāting the Churches in

his doctrine and deceit thereof, but also in respect of his tolourable

The next Scriptures he alledgeth are of another sort showing
us who be true ministers, and which be true Churches.
The first is out of theIoh. 10. 2. 7. 9. tenth of Iohn: where Christ speaketh

                  Verily, verily, I say vnto you, I am the doore of the
sheep.
                  All that ever came before me, are thieves and robbers
but the sheep did not heare them.
                  I am the doore: by me if any man enter in, he shalbe
saved, and shall go in and go out, and finde pasture,

is, vp Iesus Christ into his Church. Now to enter invp

hath given for the work of his ministery, according to such rules
as he hath appoynted to that end. Seing then the publik
ministers of these assemblyes are neyther immediately called
by Christ himself, nor mediately by his Church: neyther to
such offices as Christ hath sett in his Church: nor according
to such rules as he hath prescribed therevnto: it is manifest
they enter not in by the doore, that is, by IEsus CHrist, but
climbe up another way, to witt, by theyrBook of ordering priests and deacons. deaconry and
priesthood receyved of the Prelates and derived from Antichrist.
And therefore are not true ministers appoynted by
Christ and his Church, but thieves and robbers belonging
to Antichrist and his defection. The further proof whereof,
besides theyr continuall practise and present estate, I refer to

contrary which Christ opposeth vnto it in theIoh. 10. 1 former verse,
when he saith, he thatAna

                  clymeth (not, he that leadeth

propertyes which here Christ attributeth to all false ministers
opposed to the other, as first, that they areIoh. 10. 1. 8. 
                  thieves ād
robbers, that is, such as burst into the howse an other way
then by the doore, and in stead of well ordering the house, make
spoyle of them that dwell in it, even making marchandize of
theyr soules and consciences: Next, that they areVer. 5. 
                  straungers;
that is such whose offices and callings are straunge from the
word of God and ordinance of Christ, and therefore ought
alway of his Church to be accounted as straungers, ād theyr
voyce not to be hearkned vnto: lastly, that theyVer. 8. 
                  came before
Christ, that is, be such as do not follow after him, way

                  ing
for his calling, and walking in his way which he hath
sett vs, but do intrude themselves without him and follow
another way devised by themselves and never prescribed by
him.
               Here also would I aske Mr H. whether one being in no
office of ministery, yet taking vpon him publikly to teach, and
(as here he saith) leading in at the doore, that is, teaching no
other meanes of salvation but Christ onely who is the doore
of the sheep: whether such a one (I say) were therefore to be
reputed a Pastour and, minister of Christ, lawfully sett
in that office? I am assured Mr H. will not say it. For
that were both to give allowance of intrusion, which Christ

                     •
                  ondemneth: and to open a doore to the annihilating of that
order with Christ hath appoynted his Church for the entrante
into his ministery. And now if such a one were not therefore
to be accounted in such office of ministery, much lesse will
such teaching approve him that standeth in an Antichristian
office, to be a Pastor or Minister of Iesus Christ.
               
                  
It may also further be observed, that Christ in thisIoh. 10. 2.
Scripture speaketh of such as be shepeards of sheep: and therefore
that it helpeth not the ministers of these assemblies, who
commonly stand heards of swyne, theyr Church being an
hold of all foule spirits, and a cage of every vncleane and hatefull
bird. Besides that they all, even the most religious
among them, so long as they continew members of that
Church, stand subiect to theyr ecclesiasticall courts, officers
canons, worship, and the rest of theyr abominations,
and therefore as yet in that respect can not be accounted the
sheep of Christ, hearing his voyce and obeying his precepts.
               The next and last Scripture here alledged is out of the
Mat. 16. 18. 16. of Mathew. Where Christ as king his Disciples whom
they said he was: Peter aunswered, Thou art the Christ, the
Sonne of the living God. Wherevpon Christ said agayn,

                     I say vnto thee, that thou art Peter, and vpon this
rocke will I build my Church: and the gates of hell shall
not prevayle against it.
                      Mat. 16. 18.
                  
               
               Here we are taught vpon what rock the true Church
and lively members thereof are built, to witt, vpon this
confession, that Iesus is the Christ the Sonne of the living
God. Now here we are to remember that Christ is described
both by his person, and office. Of which I have spoken
Pag. 28. etc. In the explication of 1 Ioh. 4. 2. before at large vpon like occasion concerning the testimonyes
alledged out of the Epistles of Iohn. To which
therefore I refer you, not purposing here agayn to make repetition
thereof. Onely thus much concerning this Scripture
I will further note: that as we learned out of Ie

                  us
epistles to discerne the Spirit of GOD from the spirit
of Antichrist, so here we are taught how to know the true
Church of God, and so to discer
                     •
                  e it from the false Synagogues
of Antichrist: that is, by considering whether it be
built vpon the rock Iesus Christ, that Propher, Priest,
and king of his Church. For (as the Apostle1 Cor. 
                        •
                     . 11. saith)
other foundation can no man lay, then that vvhich is layd,
vvhich is Iesus Christ. But as before we showed, so here
we are to remember, that a verball and generall profession
of Christ in word being denyed in practise, will not avayle

to make eyther the popish or these assemblyes the true Churches
of God, and not the apostate Synagogues of the man
of sinne.
               The Apostle Peter (to whom with the other disciples
this was spoken, although in the maner of speach Christ
alluded to Peters name, as signifying a stone or rock) he
laying this foundation in the Churches which he planted,
Iesus Christ, that chief corner stone, elect and precious, doth
1 Pet. 2. 6. 7. 8. thus further apply it vnto them, saying, Vnto you which
beleev it is precious: but vnto them that be disobedient, the stone
which the builders disallowed, the same is become the head
of the corner: and a stone to stumble at, and a rock of offence
even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient.
Where he plainely teacheth, it is the obedience of faith; which
is required of all such as are truly baylt vpon this rock and
corner stone, Iesus Christ.
               And this hath Christ himself also taught vs, when he
Mat. 7. 24. 25. 26. 27 like
                     •
                  ed him that heareth his words and doth them vnto
a wise man which hath built his house on a rock, against
which the rayne and floods and wynds prevayle not to cast
it 
                     〈◊〉
                  : and him that heareth his words and doth them
not, vnto a foolish man which hath built his house vpon
the sand, against which the rayne and floods easily prevayle
to beat it down. So in like maner we are to know
for the question in hand, that the true Church of CHrist
is as aPro 9. 1 and 31. 10. 11. 12. Ephes. 5. 23. 24. wise woman and faithfull wife which hearkning
to the voyce of her husband yeeldeth obedience vnto him,
and as anMat. 16. 18. vvich pro 9. 1. house built vpon the rock, against which the
gates of hell shall not be able to prevayle: Whereas the false
Church of Antichrist is as thePro. 9. 13—18. and 7. 10—23. Hos. 2. 2. foolish woman and harlott,
which howsoever she pretend to heare the voyce of
Christ, yet in deed followeth the lust of her own eyes and goeth
a whoring after her own inventions: yea and pretending
onely the name of Christ, but in deed not receyving him as
her Prophet, Priest, and king, is as an house built vpon
the sand, which the2 Thes. 2. 8. Rev. 18 8 21. Esa. 13. 19. breath of Christs mouth and wynd
of his judgments will in the end consume and scatter abroad
as the dust. It is not then a verball profession in generall
that will serve, where an actuall denyall in practise is ioyned
withall. But the true Church which is built vpon the
rock doth in deed and truth obey the Lord Iesus acknowledging
him to be such as he is revealed vnto vs in the word
of God.
               
                  
This the Apostle Paul likewise teacheth vs, when heEphes. 2. 20.
saith, the Church is built vpon the foundation of the Apostles
and Prophets, Iesus Christ himself being the head corner stone.
Wherein he giveth vs to learne that that is in deed the true
Church which is so built vpon Iesus Christ, as the Apostles
and Prophets have layd him for the foundation and head stone
in the corner, that is, have taught him to be the Sonne of
God come in the flesh, the Prophett, Priest and king of his
Church for ever. Which forasmuch as these together with
the popish assemblyes do not in deed and verity acknowledg,
howsoever in words generally they professe, as hathPag. 30. &c. before
at large ben pro
                     •
                  ed: it therefore followeth, that in this estate
they cannot be esteemed truly built vpon the rock Iesus
Christ: and therefore cannot be counted the true Churches of
God, whiles we try them by the rules given vs by the Prophets
and Apostles, and by Christ Iesus himselfe.
               And thus have I showed the severall Scriptures here 
                     •

by Mr H. to be so many witnesses against themselves.
Thus also have we seen both their doctrine to be vnsound,
and theyr ministery and Church constitution to be such as
was never appoynted by Christ, but derived from Antichrist.
And therefore by none to be continued in, but of all to be separated
from, and that vpon payne of everlasting condemnation.
For so hath the2 thes. 2. 10 11. 12. Rev. 13. 8. 9. and 14. 9. 10. 11. and 18. 4 5. Scripture testifyed.

               WE aunswer, they must first probe theyr assemblyes to be
true Churches sett in the way of Iesus Christ, afore these
or any Scriptures (which show true Churches subject
to corruptions) can any way help to defend theyr present
Church estate. Otherwise they do but still begge that which

they should prove. For what though the Churches established
in the order of Christ have had and still shall have divers
corruptions arising among them? Doth this therefore give
any warrant or allowance of such assemblyes, whose constitution
is Antichristian? Was Israel in her defection a true
Church, because Iudah being the Church of God had some
enormityes in her? Or shall the assemblyes in Italy, England,
and such like standing in apostasy he true Churches of God,
because in the Churches of Corinth, Pergamus, Thyatira, established
in the order of Christ, there were found divers corrup

                  ions?
If this reason were strong, might not Rome at this

Scripture, Israel in her defection wasHos. 2. 2. and 4. 15. no wife, no true

that theRev. 2. and 3. chap. 
                  Church of Christ being his spouse falleth daily into
many sinnes and transgressions, whiles it is militant here
on earth. For these two are of a far divers nature and
consideration, I meane on the one side, a Church sett in the
way and order of Christ, but walking therein weakly and corruptly:
and on the other side, a company of people standing
in the defection ād disorder of Antichrist, howsoever perhaps
they may walk ther in with some show of piety and religion.
The former areLevit. 4. 13. 14. 1. Cor. 1. 2. 11. Act. 15. 1. 2. Rev. 2. and 3 true Churches, notwithstanding the corruptions

whatsoever show of holynes they do or can pretend.
Now thē forasmuch as neyther Mr H. nor any other of them
hath proved theyr assemblyes to stand in any other Church-constitution,
but such as is Antichristian: it is evident that
the Scriptures here alledged, which speak onely of Churches
sett in Christs order and of corruptions in them, cannot any
way fitly belong to these assemblyes, to give allowance of
theyr Antichristian estate. This being first sett down generally
concerning all these Scriptures ioyntly together for the
better vnderstanding of the controversy: let vs now come to
consider them more particularly, and see whether as Mr H.
hath vnder taken to prove, so he have indeed performed, that
is, have showed greater corruptions in those Churches vnto

which the Scriptures give notable testimony, then be in
theyrs at this day.
               The first2 King. 12. 2. 3. and 14. 3. 4. and 2 Chron. 20. 31. three Scriptures here cited are of one sort.
These are the words.
               
                  Iehoash did that which was right in the eyes of the
Lord all his dayes, that Ieholadab the Priest taught him.
                  Notwithstanding the hy places were not taken away:
as yet the people offred and burnt incense in the hy places.
                  2. King 12. 2. 3. 
               
               
                  And Amaziah did that which was right in
the eyes of the Lord, yet not as David his Father: he did
according to all that Ioash his Father had done.
                  Notwithstanding the hy places were not taken away: as
yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense in the hy
places.
                   2. King. 14. 3. 4.
               
               
                  And Iehoschaphat reigned over Iudah: and he walked
in the way of Asa his Father, and departed not there from,
doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord.
                  Howbeit the hy places were not taken away: for as yet
the people had not prepared theyr heart vnto the God of
theyr Fathers.
                   2. Chron. 20. 31. 32. 33.
               
               All these Scriptures show vnto vs one thing: which is,
that in the dayes of Iehoash, Amaziah, and Iehoschaphat,
kings of Iudah who did that which was right in the eyes
of the Lord, yet the hy places were not taken away: but
the people did sacrifice and burnt incense therein. This in
deed was a corruption among those people: concerning
which ynough is spoken before in that hath bē said towching
these Scriptures generally. Yet this I adde further: first
that in those tymes all the false ministeryes and kinds of worship
before tyme vsed were abolished, and this defect onely
of worshipping God in the hy places as yet remayning. Now
what comparison then is there between this case, and theyrs
who have not abolished but still retayne ād ioyne vnto a false
ministery and worship. Who knoweth not, that in those dayes
they mightIos. 22. 23. 29. 2. King. 16. 10. 11. 12. not forme to themselves or receyv from others
any other altar or fashion thereof for sacrifice then God had
appoynted: much lesse any new devised ministery? Yea, theLevit. 
                        •
                     0. 1. 2.
sonnes of Aaron, though in a true ād lawfull office, might not
offer with straūge fyer: much lesse might they have received or
exercised a false ūlawfull ministery. Corah likewiseNum. 16. Cap. though a
Levite, Dathā ād Ab
                     •
                  ram though heads of the Cōgregation,

                  2 Chrō. 26. 16▪ 20. Dzziah though a king, might not offer vp the incense which
God had appoynted to be offred, being straungers from the
priesthood: much lesse might they have offred a false worship
in a false ministery, etc. Which is the case of these assemblyes.
These men therefore should compare like things with like, ād
not vnder colour of the hy places in Iudah, seke to retayne and
defend what Antichristian corruptions they please in theyr
Church. Otherwise why might they not also vnder the same
colour still have kept the other popish abominations, which
already (by the mercy of God) are abolished out of the
land?
               Secondly I take it, the fault of retayning the hy places
in Iudah for the true service of GOD which at first were
made for false worship and service of Idols, was such, as if
now the false ministry, worship, and other abominations of
Antichrist were abolished out of the land, and yet these Idoll
temples (they call them Churches) reserved and vsed for
the true worship of God by a true ministery. For these two
may in divers respects seem to be like, I meane, those hy
places, and these Idoll temples. Both which I take
to be with in compasse ofDeut. 12. 2. 3. 4. Exod. 20. 4. 5. compared vvith 2. king 10. 26. 27. 28 and 23. 8. 13. 15. 19. Act. 19. 17. Rev. 18. 12. 22. that morall commaundement of
God, which enioyneth the abolishing of the places aswell as
of all the other monuments of Idolatry, eyther by rasing
them quite downor by defacing and converting them to civill
vse: and not to tourne them to be places for the publick worship
of God, though it were by such ministery and in such
maner as he hath appoynted.
               Thirdly, by that which hath ben said, it is evident these
Scriptures show not that, for which they are alledged, that
is, prove not greater corruptions to have ben found in the
Churches aproved by the holy Gohst, then be now in the
Church assemblyes of England. I deny not but this sacrificing
in the hy places was a great corruption: And so the Spirit
of God noteth it, that2 Chro. 27. 2. vvith 2. King. 15. 34. 35. 
                  the people herein corrupted themselves:
yea and that they
                  2. Chron. 20. 33. 
                  had not prepared theyr heart to
the Lord. But for these men by colour of this to defend the re

                   not at all: but is rather wholy against them, inasmuch

had ordeyned. Neyther of which is yet to be seen in this
land.
               Lastly, in these Scriptures is to be observed, both the
different speaches concerning the Kings and concerning the
people in theyr ages, and that the testimony which the holy
Ghost giveth of them is such, as hath with it a note of
blemish and default in them: and that recorded to posterity,
not to encourage vs to fayle in like maner as they did, but to
be a warning vnto vs to take heed of being so overtaken, as
they were.
               And thus have I showed (so far as yet I see) the true
meaning and vse of these Scriptures, and how they serve not
at all to that purpose for which they are brought: as they have
ben also and still are wrested by the Papists, to boulster
out theyr most filthy abominations likewise, though all in
vayne. For great and strong is the truth, and will prevayle
against all ad
                     •
                  ersaryes of it in the end.
               The next Scripture is out ofMat. 15. 5. 6. Mat. 15. where Christ
reproving the Pharisees for transgressing the commaundement
of God by theyr own tradition, proveth it thus: God
hath commaunded, saying, Honour thy father and mother:
and, he that curseth father or mother, let him dy the death.
               
               
                  But you say, vvhosoever shall say to father or mother,
(It is, or, be it) aA gift, that is, devote vnto God, or an oblation vnto him. gift vvhatsoever thou might be holpen
vvith of me.
                  And shall not honour his father or his mother, he shalbe
giltles. Thus have ye made the commaundemēt of God
of no authority by your tradition.
                   Mat. 15. 4. 5. 6.
               
               Here we fynd a tast of thatMat. 16. 6. 12. leaven of the Pharisees,
whereof our Saviour Christ bad his disciples they should take
heed and beware, and not that they should be encouraged
thereby to be more corrupt, as these men reason out of such
places. But let vs a litle compare this Scripture and theyr
estate together, and see whether is to be accounted more corrupt,
they then, or these now.
               First, we see here the disobedience taught by the Pharisees
was against the second Table: whereas the disobediēce taught
by these men in the poynts now controverted is both against
the first and the second Table. Against the first, in teaching

the people toLiod. 
                        •
                     0. 4. 5. Deut. 12. 30. 31. 32. Rev. 14. 9. 10. 11. and 13. 16. wors
                     •
                  hip God by another ministery and after
another maner then he hath appoynted: yea by such ministery
and in such maner as Antichrist hath invented, and God
most straitly forbidden. Against the second, inExod. 20. 12. Pro. 24. 21. 1 Tim. 2. 2. 1. Pet. 2. 17. disobeying the
Magistrates in deed, whom outwardly in show they would
seem to obey, whiles at theyr commaundemēt they serue God
by a false ministery and worship imposed by them. For as
Act. 4. 19. Dan. 3. 17. 18. and 6. 7. 13. 22. 1. Sam. 22. 17. 18. true obedience to the Magistrates is alwayes in the Lord:
so is it disobedience rather then obedience vnto them, to obey
them against the Lord.
               Secondly, the Pharisees taught the people to neglect the
performance of a duty which they ought to theyr earthly parents
in honouring of them: But these men teach the people to
neglect the performance of thatMal. 1. 6. 2. Cor. 6. 17. 18. 1 Pet. 1. 17. 18 duty they o
                     •
                   to theyr heavenly
father, in honoring fearing and worshipping him as he
hath commaunded.
               Thirdly, the Pharisees taught the people to neglect man,
vnder colour of keeping a 
                     •
                  ow, or doing a duty to God, to witt,
the vowing or offering of that as an oblatiō to God, by which
they should have holpe
                     •
                   theyr parents: But these men teach
the people to neglect God and his commaundements, vnder
colour of yeelding obedience to 
                     
                        •
                     an.
               
               Fourthly, among the Iewes this disobedience against
man was taught by some, notMat. 15. 2 and 16. 12. Luk. 1. 6. ād 2. 25. 38. receyved by all: But in these
assemblyes theyr disobedience against God is taught and

                     〈◊〉
                   
                  of them all.
               
               Fiftly, the Pharisees and other Iewes at that tyme (as
may appeare even by someMat. 8. 4 and 23. 2. Luk. 2. 21. 27 as also Luk. 1 6. 8. 9. 10. Ioh. 1. 19. 2
                        •
                      and 6. 4. places by Mr. H. here alledged)
had not devised a new publik ministery and worship, but retayned
that ministery and worship which God had appoynted,
though they walkt therein corruptly: But the ministers and
people of these assemblyes at this day have such ministery and
worship as was never ordeyned by God, but devised by that
man of sinne: though otherwise they make some show of holynes
and religion therein. So as in this respect there is no
comparison between these two.
               Lastly, it is to be observed that the testimony here given
concerning them that so taught as is aforesaid, is not an approbation
of them therein, but both aMat. 
                        〈◊〉
                      3. 7. 13. 14. sharp reproof of
them, and an earnest admo

                  ition to others for this cause to

                     •
                   alone: together with this generall sentence of Christ
annexed therevnto, Every plant vvhich myne heavenly father
hath not planted shalbe rooted vp. Let them alone: they be the

                     nd leaders of the blynd: and if the blynd lead the blynd, both
shall fall into the ditch. Hitherto of this Scripture of Matth.
15. which we see being duly considered, neyther proveth that
for which it is produced, neyther any way iustifyeth but rather
condemneth theyr Antichristian estate.
               Next he alledgethLuk. 3. 2. Luk. 3. 2. where it is thus written,

                     When Annas and Caiphas were the chief priests, the
word of God came vnto Iohn the sonne of Zacharias in
the wildernes.
                      Luk. 3. 2.
                  
               
               This Scripture is directly agaynst them. For here first
it is playne, that for the ordinary ministery among them they
had not devised a straunge new one, but re
                     •
                  apned that auncyent
function of priesthood appoynted by God (as the mention
of chief Priests doth show): And whereas Iohn
Baptist did now exercise an extraordinary ministery among
them, it is noted, he did it not without speciall warrant from
the word of God therevnto. Which is further proved both
in the wordsVers. 4. follow
                     •••
                   in this chapter, and els where
inLuk. 20. 4. 5. 6. this and theIoh. 1. 22 23. 25. 33. Mat. 21. 25. other Euangelists. Now if then
they might not have any eyther ordinary or extraordinary
ministery but such onely as was appoynted and allowed by
the word of God: muchlesse may we now vnder the Gospell
admitt of any ministery but such onely as hath ben orde

                  ed

beingHeb. 3. 3. the Sonne is worthy of more honour then Moses
the servant. So as first we see here, his own testimony condemneth
their present ministery, which is such as was never
prescribed by CHrist to his Church.
               But it may be M r. H. meant by this Scripture to insinuate
vnto vs, that there were two hypriests at that tyme,
whereas by the ordinance of God there should be but 
                     〈◊〉
                  
Wherevnto I aunswer, first that it was no new thing, but
an a
                     •••
                  cyent approved order among the Iewes to have two
chief priests over the rest: Yet so, as the o
                     •
                  e of them was principall,
and the other the second or next vnto him. Thus we
read that1. Chrō. 24. 2. 3. 2. Sam. 8. 17. vvith Nnm. 3. 32. and 4. 16. 28. Zadok of the sonnes of Eleaz
                     •
                  r, and Ahim
                        •
                     
                     lech
of the sonnes of Ithamar were together the chief priests
in Davids tyme. And afterward2. King. 25. 18. when the Iewes were
led captive to Babylon, Seraiah was the chief priest, and
Zephaniah the second. Where it may be observed, both that

there was two principall priests ouer the rest: and yet the one
chief, and the other the second.
               Secondly, we fynd that Annas and Cayaphas here mentioned
in Luke, were hy priests the one after the other, to
witt, Caiaphas
                  Ioh. 11. 49. ād 18. 13. 24. Mat. 26. 57. at the tyme when CHrist was crucifyed
and before, and Annas afterwardAct. 4. 6. and 7. 1. when the Apostles
Peter and Iohn were brought afore him. As also after this
we read agayne of one Ananias to be hy priest alone. Act. 23. 2.
and 24. 1. and 25. 2.
               Thirdly, it is to be mynded that the word here vsed signifyeth
chief priests, and is spoken oftentymes of others that
were chief among the priests, as well as of the hy priest: and
that even then when there was but one by priest. As in Mat.
14. 53. Mat. 26. 57. Act. 25. 2. 15. and 24. 1. Luk. 22. 52. 54.
               Finally, the having of the hy priesthood then by course
interchaungeably, and but for a yeare, and such like, were
in deed corruptions crept in among them in the ordinance
of GOD. Yet doth not this give any warrant of the
present Antichristian constitution of these assemblyes. For even
then we see they had no new ministeryes, but the priesthood
appoynted by God, yea and but one hy priest at once:
Which also according to the law, kept in the kinred: wherevpon
it is sayd, they that vvere of the chief priests kinred.
Act. 4. 6. Besides that in this often chaunge of it, there seemeth
to ly a mystery, God having so disposed, to declare that
now that Leviticall priesthood drew to an end, andHebr. 1. 7. 11—25. another
Priest was to rise vp after the order of Melchisedech, who because
he endureth ever should have a priesthood that can not
passe from him to any other.
               So then from this Scripture can be gathered no defence
at all of the present estate of these assemblyes, but rather many
arguments agaynst it, forasmuch as now among them
they have no other but straunge ministeryes invēted by man,
and then there was no such new ministery at all eyther ordinary
or extraordinary receyved among the Iewes.

and not left to the vvill of men to devise at theyr pleasure: as appeareth
by that vvhich is noted of Iohn, vvhere the Pharisees

have ben of some other function then of those which were ordinary
in the Church and instituted of God. And therefore Iohn

word of God: whereby appeareth that as it was not lawfull to

the same had theyr calling confirmed from heaven, eyther by signes
or miracles, or by playne ād cleare testimonyes of the mouth
of God, or by extaordinary exciting and movings of the Spirit
of God. So that it appeareth that the ministery of the Gospell, ād
the functions thereof ought to be from heaven and of God, and
not invented by the brayne of men, From heaven (I say) and

that they are of the earth, and so can do no good but much

besides the Levites and priests the ordinary ministers, and the
Prophets vvhich vvere immediately s
                     •
                  irred vp of God, vvere
found to have ordeyned any office or title vvhich vvas not commaunded:
or vvhether therevvas at any tyme any thing added
or enioyned to those offices of priesthood and Leviteship, vvhich
vvas not by the lavv prescribed.
               
                  
These are M. Cartwrights words in the places here quoted.
By which it is cleare themselves also graunt, that in
the tyme of the law in the true Church there was no new ministery
erected: and that there neyther might nor may be any
eyther ordinary or extraordinary, but such as have expresse
appoyntment and warrant from God himself. Whereupon
is followeth that the present ministery of these assemblyes having
no such warrant, these and the like Scriptures give not
any defence of it, but condemne and make against it. Thus
much concerning the testimony alledged out of Luk 3. 2.
               Next is alledgedLuk. 2. 22. 27. Mat. 8. 4. Luk. 2. 22. 27. and Mat. 8. 4. where it
is thus written: first in the second of Luke, cōcerning Christ:

                     When the dayes ofthat is, Mary the mother of Iesus. her purification after the lavv
of Moses vvere accomplished, they broughtthat is, Iesus. him to Ierusalem,
to present him to the Lord,
                     (As it is vvriten in the Lavv of the Lord, Every man
child, that openeth the vvomb shalbe called holy to the
Lord:)
                     And to give an oblation, as it is commaunded in the
Lavv of the Lord, a payre of turtle doves, or tvvo young
pigeons.
                     And behold, there vvas a man in Ierusalem, vvhose name
vvas Simeon: this man vvas iust, and feared God, ād
vvaited for the consolation of Israel, and the holy Ghost
vvas vpon him.
                     And a revelation vvas given him of the holy Ghost,
that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lords
Christ.
                     And he came in the spirit into the Temple, ād vvhen
the parents brought in the child Iesus, to do for him after
the custome of the Lavv,
                     Then he took him in his armes, and blessed God, etc.
                     Luk. 2. 22—27.
                  
               
               And in the Gospell according toMat. 8. 
                        •
                     
                   Mathew, Cap. 8. it
is thus written towching the leper whom Christ clensed:

                     Iesus said vnto him, See thou tell no man, but go shevv
thy self vnto the Priest, and offer the gift that Moses commaunded,
for a vvitnesse to them.
                      Mat. 8. 4.
                  
               
               These Scriptures compared together evince that this
Church of the Iewes had not reiected but retayned the publik
ministery, worship, and ordinances prescribed by God:

and therefore wholy cōdemne the present estate of these Church
assemblyes of Englād, ād are far from proving that for which
they are alledged. In the second of Luke we read, that atLuk. 2. 21.
eight dayes old the child was circumcised, which was according
to the
                  Gen. 1
                        •
                     . 12. Levit. 12. 3. 
                  ordinance of God: that Maryes purification, the
childs presentation to the Lord, and the oblation they gave,
was (not after any new devised maner, but)Lev. 12. 6. Exod. 13. 
                        •
                     . 
                  according to the
Law of Moses, and, as it is commaunded in the Law of the Lord:
Finally, that Sim
                     •
                  ō fearing God, came in the Spirit into the
Temple whither the parēts brought in the child Iesus, to do
for him (not according to the custome ād inventiō of man, but)
after the custome of the Law of God. Where is to be observed,
how often together in these few verses the holy Ghost noteth
down that whatsoever was done to and for the child, was according
to the Law of Moses, the Law of the Lord, the custome of
the Law, as it is written, and, as it is commaunded in the Law of
the Lord. So this Scripture showeth, that the ordinances
appoynted by God for his worship were then observed. Now
if we ioyne herevnto theMat. 8. 4. next Scripture of Mat. 8. we
shall there fynd they had also that ministery which God had
ordeyned for the tyme of the Law. For there it is said, Christ
bad the leper being clensed go and show himself to the priest, and
offer the gift that Moses commaunded. Here then they had both
the priesthood and ordinances which God had commaunded
by Moses his servant. And therefore these Scriptures are
so far from pro
                     •
                  ing greater corruptions to have ben in those
Churches, then be in these assemblyes: as they do directly
condemne theyr Church constitution in the new invented ministery,
worship, and ordinances among them, which God
never ordeyned.
               The nextMat. 23. 
                        •
                      3. Scripture Mr H. citeth is out of Mat.
23. where Christ spake to the mulititude and to his disciples,
saying:

                     The Scribes and the Pharisees sitt on Moses chayre:
All therefore whatsoever they speak to you to observe,
that observe and do: but after theyr works do not: for
they say, and do not.
                      Mat. 23. 2. 3.
                  
               
               This Scripture, teaching that it was lawfull to heare the
Scribes and Pharisees that sate in Moses seat, is commonly
alledged by the preachers and professors of this age for theyr
defence: Insomuch as they vse it as theyr anchor hold in
greatest distresse. But being well weighed, it will prove the very

shipwrack of theyr cause. For first, by conference of this
Scripture withIoh. 1. 19 24. and 3. 1. 10. Mat. 23. 34. 35. 41. Mar. 12. 28. 32. 35. Act. 5. 34. De
                        •
                     t. 17. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. others appeareth, that the Scribes ād Pharisees
which sat on Moses chayre, were priests and Levites,
expounders of the Law or such Iudges of hard pleas and cō
                  troversyes
as we read of, Deut. 17. And therefore were not in
any straunge ministery invented by man, but in those true offices
which God had by Moses commaunded vnder the Law.
               Secondly, the phrase of speach here vsed, when it is said
they late on Moses chayre,
                  Mr Beza. also thus taketh it in his treatise against Saravia, Cap. 16. unporteth ād proveth thus much.
Which also may be gathered from a like maner of speach used
inNehem. 9. 3. 4. 5. Nehemiah, where we read that Ieshua, ād Bani, ād other
of the Levites rose vpon the Levites stayre (or hy seat) and
taught the people out of the Law, and worshipped the lord.
               Thirdly, Pharisaisme was not any new kind of ministery
but onelyAct. 15. 5 and 26 5. Phil. 3. 5. Ioh. 1. 19. 24. 
                  a sect among the Iewes, that is, a sort of people
(ofSo vve read that Paul ād his father vvere Pharisees, of the tribe of Beniami
                        •
                      Act. 23. 6. Phil. 3. 5. others of the tribe of Levi Ioh. 1. 19. 24. what tribe soever among them) which semed to haue
chosen and in outward show pretended a more sirict observation
of the Law, then others did.
               Fourthly the Scribes knew well ynough that every true
ministery was from heauen, not of mē: that is, was appoynted
by God, not devised by mā. So far were they from having
themselves any false ministery of mans invention. This we
may see inLuk. 20. 1. 7. theyr cōsultation which they had amōg themselves
what to aunswer vnto Christs questiō, wh
                     ••
                  e asked them
whether the Baptisme of Iohn were from heaven, or of men.
               
               Lastly, we fynd that the pharisees themselves were carefull
of not admitting in that Church any new ministery that God
had not ordeyned: Insomuch asIoh. 1. 19.—27. they were very earnest vpō
Iohn Baptist, and vrged him to approve his calling and ministery
by thr word of God. Which thing also he did. Ioh.
1. 23. 31. 33.
               Now then seing the Scribes and Pharisees here spoken of
were (not in false but) in true offices and functions appoynted
by God vnder the law: seing they sate (not on Baals, but) on
Moses chayre: seing they knew there was no true ministery
but of God, neyther would allow of any other then GODS
word did approve: yea, seing Iohn Baptist gra
                     •
                  nted thus
much vnto them, that he might not have any ministery, but
such whereof he could bring warrāt from God: who se
                     •
                  th not,
that even this example of the Pharisees so much alledged by
them, plainly condemneth the Ministers of these assemblyes,
which sitt not in CHrists but Antichrists chayre, entring
into and executing such offices of Ministery, as GOD

never appoynted or approved in his word? Neyther is it of
any moment, as towching the poynt in controversy, to say, th
                     •
                  
Pharisees were corrupt in doctrine ād cōversation, vnles the
                     •
                  
could show by the word of God theyr ministers to be Pastors
and Teachers in Christs ordinance, though walking corruptly
therein: as we by the Scriptures show that the Pharisees
which sate on Moses chayre, were priests and Levites,
according to the Law of Moses, though otherwise in many
things they caryed themselves very vngodily with much hypocrisy.
               The last1 Cor. 11 21. 22. and 15. 12. Rev. 2. 14. 15. 20. 21. Scriptures here cited by Mr H. are o
                     •
                  t of
the Epistle to the Corinthians ād out of the Revelatiō. Which
because they are of one sort, towching the question in hand,
therefore will I speak of them together. The words be these:
first in the epistle to the Corinthians, where the Apostle
reproving theyr abuses about the Lords supper, saith thus
vnto them:

                     Every one when they should eat, taketh his ovvn supper
afore, and one is hungry, and another drunken.
                     Have ye not houses to eat and drink in? despi

               And agayne to the 
                     •
                  orinthians, among whom some denyed
the resurrection of the body, thinking that the soule onely
should live for ever in the world to come, the Apostle writeth
thus concerning that matter, in the place alledged:

                     If Christ be preached that he is risen from the dead,
hovv say some among you, that there is not a resurrection
of the dead?
                      1. Cor. 15. 12.
                  
               
               And in the second of the Revelation, first to the Angell
of the Church of Pergainus, Christ thus writeth:

                     I have against thee a fevv things, because thou hast
there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, vvhich
taught Balac to put a stumbling block before the children
of Israel, that they should eat of the things sacrificed to
Idols, and commit fornication.
                     So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the
Nicolaitans: vvhich thing I hare.
                      Rev. 2. 14. 15.
                  
               
               
                  
Then to the Angell of the Church of Thyatira, thus he saith:

                     I have against thee a fevv things, that thou suffrest the
vvoman Iezabel, vvhich calleth herself a Propheresse, to
teach and to deceyve my servants, that they should committ
fornication and eat of the things sacrificed to Idols.
                     And I gave her tyme that she should repent of her fornication:
but she repented not.
                      Rev. 2. 20. 21.
                  
               
               These Scriptures show errors and corruptions in such
Churches as were planted in the faith and order of Christ.
Which nothing helpeth to mainteyne the Antichristian 
                     •
                  state
of these 
                     •
                  ssemblyes: as isPag 45. before declared at large in the generall
aunswer concerning all these testimonyes. We neuer
doubted, but theLev. 4. 13 14. 1 Chron. 15. 13. and 2. Chron. 30. 18. 19. 20. 1. Cor. the vvhole epistle. best Churches on earth have fallen and
still are subiect to fall into corruptions and transgressions of
the Law of God. And how can it be otherwise, when as they
consist of sinfull and mortall men, who both know but in part
and in the knowledg we have, walk with much weaknes ād
imperfection? But what is this to iustify Antichrists apostasy,
or to encourage any to partake in his sinnes? We must alway
remember, that as it is one thing, whenRom. 7. 19. 20. Gal. 6. 1. a true Christian
is overtaken with a sinne, and another whenRom. 8. 13. 1 king. 21 20. Eph. 4. 17. 18. 19. such as
pretend to be Christians, live as the heathen and sell themselves
to work wickednes: so also towching a Church, it is one
thing whē a people are setled in the order of Christ, but through
weaknes fall into divers enormityes, and another when a
people stand in the defection of Antichrist ād receyve the print
of his ordinances in theyr hands and foreheads. Eyther therefore
must they prove the constitution of theyr Church to be
of Christ, and not Antichristian, or els these examples in theyr
estate will give them no succour at all. For it will nothing avayle
Babylō or such as comm

                   fornicatiō with her, to show
that Zion hath her breaches or her children theyr infirmityes.
               Secōdly, in these Scriptures is to be mynded, that but some
of the Corinthians, and some of them of Pergamus and Thyatira
were infected with the errors and corruptions here recorded:
and not the whole Churches generally. And this is the lot and
tryall of the Church of God in all ages, that unto it do creep
men of corrupt mynds, who vnder a show of holynes often
breed schismes and errors in the Church, and in theyr lives tur
                  
                     ••
                  e
the grace of God into wātonnes through hypocrisy. Thus
it pleaseth God to try and exercise his Church from tyme to

tyme, that they which are approved might be knowen. Henre
it is, that in the Church of1 Cor. 11 19. Corinth spring vp schismes
and heresyes: that in the Church ofAct. 20. 30. Ephesus arise men speaking
perverse things to draw disciples after them: that in the
Churches ofRev. 2. 14. 15. 20. Pergamus and Thyatira be found such as
hold the doctrine of Balaam, and of the Nicoiaitans, teaching the
people to eat things sacrificed to Idols, and to committ fornication.
(And such also in these dayes have crept in among vs,
vnder pretence of godlynes, who after a while vpon one occasion
or other have manifested theyr vngodly, contentious, and
fantasticall spirits: and that commonly with great trouble of
the Church, being authors of grievous schismes and other impietyes,
for which the truth and Church have ben and still are
evill spokē of). But these being but the personal sinnes of some
particular men, not the publik estate and constitution of the
whole Churches: what comparison is there between them and
these assemblyes whose very2 Thes. 2. 3. 4. 8. Reve. 18. 4. Esa▪ 52 11. Ier. 51. 6. 45. constitution is Antichristian,
and out of which God hath absolutely commaunded all that
will be saved to depart? Whereas from theLev. 4. 13 14. 1 Cor. 1. 11. and 5. 4. 5 7. Gal. 5. 9. 10 12. Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17. other separation
may not be made; but first redresse is duly to be sought, that
such old leaven being purged out, they may still be a new lampe
vnto the Lord.
               Thirdly, here is to be observed, that it is said, these Churches
Rev. 2. 14. 20. 1 Cor. 5. 1. 2 suffred such amōg them. Which as it manifesteth what was
theyr sinne, so it showeth also they had power, ād should vse it,
for the reclayming or casting out of such from among them.
Whereas these assemblyes have not power to redresse any
abominations or to excommunicate any persons (though never
so wicked): but the whole ecclesiasticall power and iurisdiction
among them is committed onely to the Ordinary,
that is, to an Antichristian Prelate, and to his Chauncelour
and Archdeacon. So as by this also appeareth there is no
comparison between them.
               Fynally, it is to be remembred, that even in these and the
like Churches, where they do not repent and amend but continew
in corruption and iniquity, Christ hathRev. 2. 5. 16. 22. 23. Mat. 21. 42. 43. threatned
to remove his cādelstick, ād to take his kingdome from among
them. And if God thus deale with his own Churches stablished
in his faith and order, when they come obstinately to persist
in sinne ād impiety: what shall be the end of the Synagognes
of Antichrist which stād in emnity against Iesus Christ
and in apostasy from his truth, and will not be reclaymed? If
God will not spare but come against Corinth, Pergamus, ād

Thyatira: will he let Babylon that mother of whoredomes
or any of her daughters escape? If Ierusalem for her sinne be
made to drink the cup of Gods wrath: shall Edom, Moa
                     •
                  ,
or Ammon go free? They shall not: saith the Lord of hostes.
Iere. 25. 15. 18. 21. 29. And thus much to Mr. H. his second
exception: Now followeth his third in these words.
            
         
         
            
               Mr. H. his letter. Section, 5.
               THirdly, if it be a sinne for an vvhole Church to account any private man for
an heathen or publicane though he be knovven to have grievously sinned
Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17. (Mat. 18) till such tyme as by despising all lavvf
                     •
                  ll meanes that can be vsed
for reclayming him, he shall be found to sinne of obstinacy: then must it needs
be a sinne for any private members (such as you are) to account an vvhole
Church and so many famous assemblyes to be all as heathens and publicanes and
Antichrists, before theyr sinne hath ben manifested vnto them and they proceeded
against according to the rule of Christ.
               Novv this hath not ben done vnto vs: for many there are of the ministers
in England, that are not yet in theyr iudgement persvvaded of the discipline: and
many that do yeeld vnto it in iudgment and desier hartily the establishment of
it, ād the removall of all corruptiōs, cānot yet see hovv they may vvith a good conscience
forsake the callings and roomes they occupy, for the vvant of the discipline.
If these sinne, they sinne but of ignorance, and therefore may not for this
sinne be accounted for heathens and publicanes.
               But admitt our sinne had ben manifested vnto vs: by vvhom have vve ben
ensured for it? A private member may not be cast out till he have despised the
censure of the Church, though he have despised the admonition and counsell of
sundry private Christians: Then suerly an vvhole nation may not be cast out of
the Church, though it have not hearkned to the reproof of many private Christians,
till it shalbe found to have despised the censure of other more famous Churches
professing the Gospell. And vvhat such Church is there in the vvorld that

                  ath censured vs? Nay it is most evident that all those Churches in Christendome
that have in most syncerity receyved and mainteyned the doctrine and discipline
of Christ, have alvvayes accounted our Church for a sister, and given vnto
her the right hand of fellovvship.

of them: but that any one private Christian or some fevv severall assemblyes,
vvhereyn also there are some learned men, may account all the Churches

and date bynd my self to prove it, that there is nothing practised amongst vs so
contrary to the discipline, as there is amongst you. For proof vvhereof (to omitt
sundry of your practises and the extream confusion that is to be seen in your best
reformed assemblyes) let this suffice that hath ben already mentioned.

should you or any of your company (vvho for authority you knovv are not to be
compared vvith those holy Apostles) disdayne to call vs brethren, and to account
vs a Church, till such tyme as vve have ben convinced of error, and reiected by
the iudgment of other Churches?
               VVhen there grevv controversy in the Church of Antiochia, the brethren
Act. 11. 21. 26. and 15. 2. 4. 23. thought it not fitt to proceed in iudgment against them of the circumcision

the belevers there vvere more in number and of greater graces then ever those

Churches, yea though they had Paul and Barnabas (men better able to decide
and determine the matter then ever you had any in your assemblyes): yet
vvould they not (I say) proceed, till they had made other Churches, and na

                  ely
that famous Church of Ierusalem acquainted vvith the matter, and required
theyr advise and authority to decide and overrule it, Act. 15. 2. 4. And might
it not asvvell have beseemed those of your company that first entended a separation
from our Church (a matter of so great vvaight and consequence) to have
sought the advise of the Churches of Geneva, and Fraunce, and Germany, and
Helvetia, and Scotland in the matter, and to have stayed theyr separation till
such tyme as those Churches had proceeded against vs according to the rule of
Christs discipline? May I not vvell say, as the Apostle1. Cor. 14 36. doth to the Corinthians,
1 Cor. 14. 36. Came the vvord of God our from you? eyther came it vnto
you onely?
               And this I hope may be sufficient to shovv hovvThat vvhich Mr H. saith here is vntrue, he yeelded vnto it before as being true Pag. 5. Marke this contradiction, vntrue that is, vvhich is
affirmed in the first part of the reason vsed in your vvriting, viz: Whosoever
worketh vpon the consriences of men by vertue of an Antichristian office ād
calling, he is an Antichristiā Minister, whatsoever truth he bringeth with
him.
               
            
            
               Aunswer to Section, 5.
               IN this third exception according to theyr vsuall maner, Mr
H. taketh for graunted that which he should prove, to witt,
that theyr ecclesiasticall assemblyes be the Churches of Christ
sett in his order and constitution: Which thing we deny. And
till they prove it, themselves may see, they can not thus reason
fromMatt. 18. 15. 16 17. 
                  this Scripture of Mat. 18. as here he doth. For although
from thence it may be gathered, that the Churches of
Christ are not for corruptions arising in them to be forsaken,
but first theyr redresse is by all good meanes to be sought: yet
it followeth not therevpō that the Synagogues of Antichrist
are in like maner to be proceeded withall, and not forthwith
to be avoyded. This (I say) followeth not of the other any
more then if one should reason thus: A brother being knowen
to have sinned is not to be accounted as an heathen or publicane,
till being duly proceded with, he have contemned the voyce
of the Church: Therefore also one that is an heathen or publicane,
yet notwithstanding is not so to be accounted, till he

have ben likewise admonished and proceded withall. As there
is no consequence in this, so neyther is there in the other.
The same1. Cor. 5 12. Scripture which saith, Do ye not iudge
them that are vvithin? saith it not also, What have I to do to
judge them that are vvithout? Now then as we are to carry
our selves after one maner towards particular men that are
within, and after another towards them that are without: so
have we also different rules and courses prescribed by God ād
to be followed by vs, how to walk after one maner towards
the Churches of Christ, when corruptions be found among
them, and after another towards the Synagogues of Antichrist
which are fallen into defection from the way of Iesus
Christ.
               If you aske, what these rules be that are given to be observed
when errors and enormityes are espyed in a true Church:
I aunswer, these and the like, thatLev. 4. 13. 14. Act. 6 1. 2. 3. 2 Chro. 13. 2 3. vvith 15. 3. 11. 12. 13. they which espy them,
are not therevpon to forsake the Church, but must first give
the Church knowledg thereof out of the word of God: and
that also according to due order, as first to1 Cor 1. 11. vvith Rev 2. 1. &c. Zach. 7. 2. 3. Heb 13. 17. make it knowen
vnto them to whom the oversight of the Church is committed:
who, if they be perswaded, are1. Cor. 5. 1. 4. 5. and 11 18. &c. Mat. 18. 17. 1 Tim. 5. 17. then by duty bound to
advertise the Church thereof and to see it redressed in all good
maner. If they be not perswaded, thenMat. 18. 16. 17. vvith 2 Cor. 13. 1. Lev. 4. 13. 14 having taken some
others with them and not prevayling, they are afterward to
bring it before the whole Church and to show them theyr estate,
wherein it swarveth from the rules of Gods Law: who
fynding it so to be, are bound to acknowledg and amend it.
Yet if this way they prevayle not, then are they to vse (if they
may) the help ofAct. 15. 2. &c. 1. Cor. 14. 33. 36. Zach. 7. 2. 3. De
                        •
                     t. 17. 8. 9 10. 11. Psal. 122. 3 4. 5. other Churches to advise of the matter and
to admouish that Church of theyr estate, out of the Scriptutes.
Now these things being done as they ought, we may hope
by the blessing of God that issue will follow which the2 Co

Scriptures show hath followed vpon such proceeding heretofore,
that is that they will not now wilfully stand in knowen
transgression convinced vnto them out of the word of
God by so many witnesses: but will rather sorrow for theyr
sinne, and reioyce for the consolation they shall fynd by receyving
the truth and walking in the way thereof showed vnto
them out of the Scriptures. But if they will not amend, the
Lord Iesus Christ, who walketh in the nuddes of the golden
candelsticks and hath all power given him in heaven
and in earth, hathRev. 2. 5, Mat. 21. 43. threatned to remove the candelstick out
of his place, and to take the kingdome of God from them

and to give it to such as will bring forth the fruits thereof:
And then to such as are willing to obey the truth, he hath in
such cases given directAct. 2. 40. Psa. 8. 12. 16. commaundement, to save themselves
from such a froward generation: and to bynd vp the
testimony, and seale vp the Law among his disciples. And
these are the rules (so far as I have observed) given vs for
our walking in and toward the Churches of Christ, when
errors and corruptions be found among them.
               Now towching such assemblyes as stand in false constitution
or apostasy from the way of Christ, the former rules are
not given vs to be vsed in ād with them: but concerning such,
there is one onely rule prescribed by God for our carriage towards
them, which is,Rev. 18. 4. 
                        •
                     os. 4. 15. A
                        •
                     os. 4. 4. 5 and 5. 5. 15. 2 Cor. 6. 17. Rev. 20. 4. with all speed to separate and depart
from them, and in no case to partake in theyr sinnes, but
to witnes against them even vnto death. Forasmuch then as
these assemblyes (how famous so ever he account them)
stand in a false constitution, even in apostasy from that true
ministery and from those holy ordināces appoynted by Christ
to his Church, it is cl
                     •
                  are as the sunne that the golden rules of
such proceding as is before described belong not vnto them in
this estate, but that all men ought vpon payne of damnation
without delay to depart out of them, least if they still partake
in theyr sinnes, they receyv also of theyr plagues. By which also
appeareth how the reason here vsed by Mr H. out of Mat.
18. belongeth not to theyr assemblyes, as now they stand, and
therefore in this case helpeth them nothing at all.
               Nay furthermore I dare affirme and bynd my self to prove
by this Scripture, that there is not (in theyr constitution) any
ecclesiasticall assembly in this land that can be accounted a
true Church, whereyn this rule here given by Christ can be
practised. And thus I prove it:

                     Every true Church of Christ hath Christs power here
spoken of, to cast out obstinate sinners from among them.
                     But no ecclesiasticall assembly in this land hath (in their
constitution) this power of Christ here spoken of, to cast
out obstinate sinners from among them.
                     Therefore no ecclesiasticall assembly in this land can (in
their constitution) be accounted a true Church of Christ.
                  
               
               The proposition or first part of the reason is proved byMat. 18. 17. 18. 19. 20.
                  this place of Scripture: as also by 1 Cor. 5. 4. 5. and Mat. 28.
20. The assumption or latter part of the reason I prove thus:
First, the power of excommunication among them resteth in
the Lordbishop and in his Chauncelor ād Archdeacon, whose

offices and authority Christ never ordeyned in his Church:
therefore can not they (in theyr constitution) have the power of
Christ here spoken of. Secondly, the offices ād authority of the
Prelates aforesaid are Antichristian: therefore also cā they not
in such estate have this power of Christ: For2 Cor. 6. 14. 15. what fellowship
can there be between Christ and Antichrist? Thirdly, let
vs suppose, that some of theyr Church committeth a sinne, ād
is admonished to repent of it by another of them: the sinner repenteth
not, the other taketh with him one or two to admonish
and witnes against him: the sinner notwithstanding still
persisteth: Now what shall the other do, or whither shall they
go? If to the Prelates and theyr Officials, who among them
have the power of excommunication in theyr hands, that is
not to follow this rule of Christ, but to show theyr subiection
to Antichrist: If to that parish whereof the party is a member
(as for example, let vs suppose the best among them, as
Blackfryers or Mary Overyes in London, or Ashby de la
zouch in Lepcester shire, or Maldon in Essex, or Coventry in
warwick shire, or any other) alas what are they the nearer?
Though they would, yet in theyr constitution can they do nothing,
but eyther go themselves or bid the other go and complayne
to the Lordbishop theyr Ordinary, or to his Chauncelor
or Archdeacon, who have the government of the Church
committed vnto them. Or if they should offer to proceed other
wise to excommunication of the party, they are so far from having
power to do it, as neyther were such a one by the Law
of theyr Church to be accounted excommunicate, and they also
whosoever should attempt so to do, were subiect for this cause
to be excommunicate themselves, yea and to be imprisoned ād
further punished by theyr Lords the Prelates. Lo here how
these assemblyes (even the best of them) in theyr constitution
can not practiseMat. 18. 15. 16. 17. 
                  this rule of Christ, which he hath given vnto,
and may be practised by, every true Church of his. The
Lord give them eyes to see it, and hearts to depart from the
tents of such vngodlynes.
               Thus having showed that there is no more strength of
proof in this third exception, then was in the former: I might
proceed to that which followeth in his letter, save that a few
things which he hath here inserted by the way, seem needfull
first to be to wched. As first, where speaking of vs, he termeth
a Church sett in the order of Christ to be private members.
Towching which this I thought to note, that a company of
faithfull people (though considered apart by themselves

they be private men, yet) being gathered together in the Name
of Christ, and joyned together in fellowship of his Gospell,
they are a1. Cor. 12 27. Roma. 12 5. Hebr. 12. 22. 28. Mat. 5. 14. ād 18. 17. 20. 1. Cor. 1. 2. and 5. 4. Phil. 1. 1. 5. Act. 2. 41. 42 47. and 17. 4 publik body, a Church, a citty, a kingdome,
and that of Iesus Christ, who is present among them to
guyde blesse and confirme what they do on earth in his Name
and by his power. So that like as in a Citty, the citizens considered
apart are commonly private members, yet ioyntly together
are the corporation and publik body of that town: so
is it also in the Church of Christ, whether it consist of mo or of
fewer, yea though they be butMat. 18. 19. 20. two or three: so as they be
joyned together in communion of the Gospell, and gathered
together in the Name of Iesus Christ, as before is said.
               Secondly, where he accounteth themselves a true Church,
having many famous assemblyes, and to be proceeded against by
the rule of Christ, Mat. 18. I have already aunswered and showed
that first he must prove theyr assemblyes to be sett in the
way of Christ, afore these sayings can be verifyed of them, or
applyed to them. Many there are in deed amōg them famous
for theyr gifts, learning, wisdome, sobriery etc. but they also
stand subject to the same Antichristian disorder and confusion
that the rest do. Neyther doubt I but in the most popish assemblyes
there be also many famous for theyr gifts and otherwise:
which yet can no way justify theyr Antichristian estate.
The Lord in mercy graunt, that such as belong to him, may
bring themselves and theyr gifts vnto Zion for the help and
beauty thereof: and no more employ them (as they have done)
to the adorning of Babel, that whoore and strumpett appoynted
to destruction, with all her ordinances and constitutions
wheresoever.
               Thirdly where he saith, there be many of the Ministers in
England that are not yet in theyr judgment perswaded of the discipline:
I aske, whether he think not also there be many of
the Ministers in Rome, Spayne, and els where, that likewise
are not in theyr judgmēt perswaded of sundry other most
excellent doctrines of the Gospell? And whether therefore all
other that see them, must stay from acknowledging and observing
them, vntill such also be perswaded of them. If Iohn
wickleff, William Swinderby, Walter Brute, Iohn Claydon,
Martin Luther, Iohn Hus, Ierome of Prage, William
Tyndall, Iohn Frith, Robert Barnes, Iohn Rogers,
Hugh Latymer, Iohn Bradford, Rowland Taylour, Iohn
Philpott, and other the faithfull servants and Martyrs of
Iesus Christ, should in theyr severall ages have stayed from

obeying the Gospell, so far as God revealed vnto them out of
his word, vpon this and such like pretences of the ignorance
and error of others: I would know, whether in so doing they
had ben faithfull to God, as they ought. But besides these,
I would also aske, whether it might not with as great colour
(if not greater in some respect) have ben said to the Apostles
and Primitive Churches, that the Priests and Levites of
the Iewes were not perswaded in iudgment that Iesus was
the Christ? To conclude, is it not straunge that in so great
alight, they should still labour with such, figge tree leaves to
cover the nakednes of theyr filthy abominations?
               The next exception he taketh (when he saith, that other
of theyr ministers do yeeld vnto the discipline in iudgment, and
desier hartely the establishment of it and the removall of all corruptions,
yet cannot see how they may with a good conscience
forsake the callings and roomes they occupy, for the want of the
discipline) This exception, I say, which also might be alledged
for the papists, is of like nature with the former: or rather
much worse, inasmuch as he graunteth they yeeld to the
truth in iudgment, and deny it in practise. They know (by
his graunt) that Christ hath appoynted an order of Ministery
and government to his Church, for the administration of
his holy things and for keping his people in the obedience of
faith, with commaundment to observe it to the end of the
world (for this theyIn all theyr treat

                     . do and must vnderstand by the discipline):
Yet in theyr practise they yeeld not vnto it: for himself
saith here, they want it. And not that onely, but they submitt
also to another ministery worship and government (here called
theyr corruptions): Which seing it cā not be Christs, which
they want, whose can it be but the Romish Antichrists, with
whose cup of abominations this land as the other nations of
the earth hath ben made drunck? God give them in tyme to
make conscience of retayning such Antichristian callings and
roomes, that they may cast of theyrZech. 13 4. 5. Rev. 9. 3. 7. and 18. 4. 5. 6 11. rough garments and
false offices, wherein they have so long tyme deceyved the people,
and may throughly see and consider in theyr hearts how
wittingly they stand in disobedience against Christ: whiles he
graunteth they vvant that holy order of ministery and government
(here called the discipline) which Christ hath1. Tim. 6. 13. 14. Mat. 28. 20. straitly
charged to be kept inviolable vntill his appearing, and whilest
they think there shalbeIer. 51. 26 taken from Babel a stone for a
corner or for a foundation in Zion. Whether this now be a
sinne of ignorance in them, let themselves examine. Yet if it

were, they must remember that even thatLuk. 12. 47. 48. servant that knoweth
not his masters will, and yet committeth things worthy
of stripes, shalbe beat: though in deed with fewer

then he which knoweth it, and prepareth not himself neyther
doth according therevnto. Let them therefore look to it

that which is2. Thes. 2. 8. written, that God will render vengeaunce
both to them that knovv him not, and to such as obey not the
Gospell of our Lord Iesus Christ.
               
               Fourthly where he excepteth, that they havve not ben censured
by other Churches, and therefore are not thus to be refused:
besides that which hath ben aunswered before towching
their Antichristian estate, in respect whereof they are to be departed
from without any other censuring: Besides this (I
say) I would know, by what Churches the assemblyes in Rome,
Germany, Fraunce, and England were censured, when
Arnoldus de villa nova, Ierome of Prage, Martin Luther,
Iohn Calvin, William Tyndall, the Baldenses, and the
Bohemians, with many other the servants of God in former
ages left and forsook them? Or whether they should still have
remayned in Babylon, till by some Churches she had ben censured?
Yea, and how there could ever be a true visible Church
agayne vpon the earth after the generall apostasy wherein all
nations were made drunken with Babels cup, if the people
of God should not at hisRev▪ 18. 4 commaundment depart out of
Babylon, without staying till there were some Churches to
lay open her abominations before her face and to censure her
for them. EveryIer. 50. 8. ād 51. 6. 8. 9. vvith Rev. 18 4. 5. one of Gods people ought in such case ād
estate to deliver theyr own soule, and to be as an hee-goat before
the rest, to lead them the way out of Babel. So far ought
we to be from bringing balme to cure her, or abiding in her
vnder any pretence: least if we should still take part in her sinnes,
we should in the ende drinck also of the cup of her sorrowes.
When1▪ King. 19. 9. 10. Israel stood in defection, should Eliah have
committed like transgression with them, pretending they had

                  ivablenes of

his vnrighteousnes, till he be censured by others? Suerly the
Scripture teacheth, and the people of God in all ages have taken
another course: as we also must do at this day, vnles we
set light both of obeying Gods commaundment which chargeth
vs to depart out of every false Church, ād of vndergoing
his wrath which he will powre vpon all that have spirituall
communion with any such. Hos. 4. 15. Amos. 4. 4. 5. 6. and 5.
5. 2 Cor. 6. 17. Rev. 14. 9. 10. 11 and 18. 4. 5. Let them therefore
eyther prove the constitution of theyr Church to be a true
one according to the Testamēt of Christ, or els let them know
that we must depart from thē, ād every false Church, though
they had never ben putt in mynd by any other Churches or
Christians of theyr Antichristian estate.
               This might suffice though there were no more to be
said in this matter. But now what will Mr H. say to the
multitude of Christians in our own countrey that have testifyed
against theyr Antichristian constitution even to imprsonment,
banishment, and death it self? Or, because the testim

will he say to the publik profession and practise of the reformed
Churches abroad, who thereby have sufficiently advertised
England and all other people so walking of theyr
fearfull estate?
               And because he saith here, the best reformed Churches
have not onely not cēsured thē, but also account theyr Church a
Sister, and give her the right hand of fellovvship, it will be good
in this place to consider what the publik confession and estate
of those Churches is: thereby to see whether they and
the Church of England be in deed sisters of one Mother, and
ioyned together in the fellowship of one faith and obedience
of Christ, as Mr H. and others generally would beare vs
in hand.

                  hold and publikly professe that
it is the part and duty of every faithfull man to separate himself
according to Gods vvord from all those vvhich are vvithout
the Church, ād to couple himself to the company of the faithfull
(whom they describe to be such as submit thēselves to the doctrine
ād discipline of the Church appointed by Christ) vvheresoever
God hath placed it: yea though the cōtrary edicts of Princes
ād Magistrates do forbid them vpō payne of death. Now on the
other hand when we look at the estate of the Church of England,
first we can not fynd it to consist of a company of

faithfull people so separated according to the word of God
and the vse of the reformed Churches, but to stand in confusion
of all sorts of people, good and bad, even of the greatest
persecuters and most profane of the land, after the maner of
Antichrist and his Babylonish assemblyes: secondly we cannot
see that notwithstanding the prohibition of Princes and
Magistrates, they submitt themselves to the doctrine and discipline
of the Church appoynted by Christ, but that they
stand in subiection to the ministery ād discipline of Antichrist.
Wherevpon it followeth that in this constitution they cannot
iustly be deemed a Sister of the reformed Churches abroad, but
of the daughters of the great Babylon spoken of in the book
of the Revelation, chap. 17.
               
                  Next, towching the Ministery and government, which
Christ hath given to his Church, the reformed Churches
                  In the same book: Section, 11. French and Belgick confession. 
                  beleeve and professe, that the true CHVRCH
ought to be governed by that regiment or discipline, which our
Lord Iesus hath established, to witt, so that there be in it Pastors,
Elders, and Deacons: That all true Pastors in what place soever
they be placed, have the same and aequall authority among them
selves given vnto them vnder Iesus Christ the onely head and
the chief and alone vniversall Bishop: And that the Ministers, Elders,
and deacons ought to be called to those theyr functions, ād
by the lawfull election of the Church to be advaunced into those
roomes, earnest prayer being made vnto God, and after the order
and maner which is sett down vnto vs in the word of God.
And on the other side,
                  In the same book: Sect. 11. Helvetia: the latter confes. Capit. 18. towching the new ministeryes brought
into the Church and devised by men, as Patriarks, Archbishops,
Suffraganes, Metropolitanes, Archpriests, Deacons, Subdeacons,
and the rest of that sort, higher and lower: towching all these
(say they) we passe not a rush, what they have ben in tymes past,
or what they are now: the Apostles doctrine concerning Ministers
sufficeth vs. And no man can by any right forbid vs to returne
to the auncient constitution of the Church of God, and rather
to receyv it then the custome of man. And moreover in
the Church of Geneva theyIn the forme of Confession of faith vvherevnto all subscribe that are receyued to be Schollers in the Vniuersity of Gaueva. professe that they detest the Hierarchy,
as a divolish confusion stablished as it were in despire of
God, and to the mocking and reproch of all Christian religion.
Thus we see what the reformed Churches professe to be theyr
faith iudgment and practise in these things. With which if
we compare the present constitution of the ecclesiasticall assemblyes
of this land, wherein are not onely wanting the aforesaid
true offices of Pastors, Elders, Deacons, together with

the calling and administration appoynted by Christ and
acknowledged by the reformed Churches: but are also remayning
the false offices and vsurped authority of Archbisho
                        •
                     s,
Lordbishops, Deanes, Archdeacons, Commissaryes, Parsons,

                        •
                     icars, Priests, and the rest of that rable (for which these
reformed Churches professe they passe not at all, and which
they have reiected as Antichristiā) together with theyr popish
canons and constitutions: if (I say) we compare these together,
who cannot see that the reformed Churches are in these
things so far from giving to these assemblyes the right hand
of fellowship, as they do rather with the left hand put them
over to Antichrist with whom they communicate and vnto
whom they belong in this behalf?
               
               Finally, for the whole worship of God, the reformed
ChurchesHarmony of Confess. Sect. 1. in the Be
                        •
                     
                     gick and French confessions. professe that the whole maner of worshipping God
which God requireth at the hands of the faithfull, is in the written
word of God most exquisitly and at large set dovvn: and
that therefore it is not lawfull for any man or Angel to teach otherwise,
to adde or to detract therefrom, it being perfit and absolute
in all poynts and parcels thereof. So as no other vvritings of
men although never so holy, no custome, no multitude, no mās
vvisdome, no antiquity, no prescription of tyme, no personall
succession, no counsels, visions, miracles, and to conclude, no decrees,
statutes, or ordinances of men, are to matched vvith or
opposed vnto the holy Scriptures and bare truth of God: but that
all things ought to be examined and tryed by the rule and square
thereof. For all men are by nature ly
                        •
                     rs and more vayne then
vanity it self. Thus do the reformed Churches hold and professe.
Whereas on the contrary in England the maner of worship
and administration, is not according to the word of God,
but according to theyr book of common prayer taken out of
the Papists Masse book, together with other theyr Canons,
Articles, and Constitutions, which God hath neyther himself
appoynted in his word nor therein given authority to any
other so to prescribe. And thus have I showed by the publik
confessions and iudgment of the reformed Churches themselves,
that it is far otherwise then as these men would beare
the world in hand: and that in deed the Church-assemblyes in
England in this constitution can not rightly be counted sisters
of the reformed Churches abroad, but rather daughters ofRev. 17 5.
Babylon that mother of whoredomes and abominations of
the earth.
               Next where Mr H. showeth how a private Christian should

carry himself towardan whole Church towching corruptiōs,
I have before spokē of that matter ād noted two maners of
proceding to be appoynted by God, one toward such Churches
as be set in the order of Christ but walk in it corruptly,
another toward such as stād in the apostasy of Antichrist
though with some show of holynes. This therefore being before
hādled, shal not need to be repeated. By it may appeare
how vnsound a directiō he hath here prescribed: besides that
what he sayth, may with like colour be alledged for abiding in
any the most popish assemblyes wheresoever. For might
not such alledge for themselves, that they mislike the corruptions
in those Churches, that they refuse to subscribe or yeeld
consent vnto them, that by prayer and all other good meanes
they seek the reformation of them: Yet that being private Christians,
or a fevv severall assemblyes, they may not account the
Churches that are in an vvhole nation to be as beathens or publicanes:
ād that therefore they will abide in them still? If this
be a sufficient rule, then suerly the Martyrs were deceyved in
former ages, and the godly Christians at this day in Spayne,
Italy, and such places, which content not themselves
with misliking and seeking redresse of the corruptions in theyr
popish assemblyes, but refuse altogether to have any spirituall
fellowship with them, and chuse rather to suffer affliction
for bearing witnes agaynst them.
               Secondly how can they be sayd to mislike the corruptions,
wherevnto many of them subscribe with theyr hands, and
all of them joyne in theyr practise? Or how do they refuse to
yeeld consent to the corruptions, which by word and deed
they receyv, allow, and vphold?
               Thirdly where he insinuateth that by prayer and other
good meanes they seek a reformation, I would aske, with
what comfort they can come before God in prayer, when they
do not onely stand subject to Antichrist (in respect whereof
theyrPro. 28. 9. vvith Rev. 14. 9. 10. Iohan. 9. 31. Psal. 66. 18. sacrifices of prayer must needs be abominable),
but by their continuall practise seem to deale like those Iewes
of whom weIer. 42. 2. 5. 6. vvith vers. 20. 21. read in Ieremy the Prophet, that by theyr
requests they made show as if they would know the will of
God to obey it, and yet when they knew it, would not observ
it. If by other good meanes, he vnderstand theyr suits to the
Parliament, as it is anRev. 17. 16 1 Tim. 2. 2. 3. 2 King. 23. Cap. happy thing and greatly to be
desired that the Magistrates would abolish this false ecclesiasticall
Ministery, worship, and government: so yet if they
do it not, we must notwithstāding at theAct. 2. 40 41 47. Rev. 18. 4. 2 Cor. 6. 17. 18. Psa. 119. 113. 128. commaundement
of God leave all false, wicked, and Antichristian wayes, and

peaceably yeeld obediēce to Christ in his own ordināce: though
we beMat. 5. 11 12. Luk. 21. 12. 16. Rev. 13. 15. and 20 4. Rom. 8. 36. for this cause reviled, imprisoned, banished, ād killed
all day long, being counted as sheep for the slaughter. 1. For in
this case must alway be remēbred, thatAct. 4. 19. Rev. 14. 12. Mat. 22. 21. we must obey God
rather then Man: ād that the cōmaundement or permissiō of
the Magistrate maketh not the way of God any whit more
lawful, but onely more free from trouble. 2. Agayn, if the lawes
of men do once enact ād establish the true ministery ād ordinā
                  ces
of Christ, then must all be forced to submit thereūto, whether
it were Christs or not: So as to withold our obedience
from Christ till the Law enact it, is nothing els but to stay till
we be forced by man to the obedience of God. 3. Furthermore,
what if the Magistrates would never establish that ministery
ād order which Christ hath appoynted to his Church: should
we therefore never observ and submitt vnto it? To what end
then hath ChristMat. 28. 20. enioyned vs (without any exceptiō of the
Magistrates Law) to keep whatsoever he hath cōmaunded,
to the end of the world? And why hath the Apostle so1. Tim. 6 13. 14. straitly
charged Timothy (ād in him2 Tim. 2. 2. all others) before God ād
Iesus Christ, to keep the cōmaundments which he hath givē
towching the Ministery order and governmēt of the Church,
without spot and vnblameable, vntill the appearing of our
Lord Iesus? 4. To cōclude this poynt, if without the Magistrates
allowāce we might not observ whatsoever Christ hath
cōmaunded, what were this els but toIam. 2. 1. have the faith of our
glorious Lord Iesus Christ in respect of persons? Which Mr
H.Section. 1. before in the beginning of his leter according to the Apostles
counsell wisheth in any case to be avoyded. And thus much
by the way towching the obedience which all Christians are
bound themselves to yeeld vnto Christ, leaving the generall reformatiō
of the Lād to the Magistrates to whom it belōgeth.
               Now to proceed, where he expoundeth accounting as Publicanes
to be ment, accounting them such as with whom communion
may not lawfully be had in the service of God, he seemeth
to mistake the meaning thereof: For weLuk. 18. 10. read that the
Publicane went into the Temple to pray aswell as the Pha
                  
                     •
                  isee:
and that the speciall thing wherein the Iewes absteyned
from company of the Publicanes was raiher in civill

                     •
                  onversation, then in spirituall worship: As may be gathe
                  
                     •
                  ed
by this, thatMat. 9. 11. and 11. 19 the Pharisees blamed Christ for eating
with Publicanes, and yet both themselvesLuk. 18. 10. admitted them

                     •
                  nto the Temple, andLuk. 3. 12. 13. and 7. 29. found not any fault with Iohn
Baptist for receyving them to his Baptisme, though he bed

them not leav theyr calling but deale faithfully in it. How well
this was done of the Iewes to absteyne from the Publicanes
in theyr civill conversation whom they admitted to theyr publik
worship, I stand not here to enquyer. Onely this would
I show, that whereas Christs speach (when heMat. 18. 17. saith Let
him be to thee as an heathen and publicane) is taken from the
custome and practise of the Iewes, who had noAct. 21. 27. 28. 29. spirituall
fellowship with the heathen, norMat. 9. 11. and 11. 19 civill with the Publican
                     •
                  s:
therefore the meaning of these words (Let him be to thee as
a publicane) is that with such as contemne the Churches
voyce we should have no familiar civill conver
                     •
                  ation. Which
the Apostle also teacheth when he1 Cor. 5. 9▪ 11. requireth that with such
as are cast out of the Church we should not eat or company
together. So as then Christs speach being taken from the costome
of the Iewes which his disciples could not but know,
the meaning of his words when he said Let him be to thee as
an heathen (with whom the Iewes had no spirituall communion)
and as a publicane (with whom they had no civill conversation)
must needs be this, that they should neyther have
spirituall nor civill fellowship with such as despising the voyce
of the Church (whereMat. 1
                        •
                     . 18. 19. 20. Christ is present to ratify what
is done according to his word) were therefore iustly put
away from amongst them. This I thought good and needfull
to note concerning the true meaning of Christs words in
this place both because they are here by Mr H. some what
mistaken, and others among them, namelyBilsons treatise of the perpetual government of the Church▪ chap. 4. 
                  Bilson of
Winchester, to the ēd thei might with ani colour hide the truth
from the eyes of the simple, have most absurdli ād in deed very
wickedly interpreted them: as I doubt not will appeare vnto
any that fearing God shall compare together this explication
of Christs words which I have here noted from the
Scriptures, and Bilsons sundry expositions of them mentioned
in his book: which are such as if Christ had eyther in that
one speach had three or fower meanings, or had sent his disciples
at that tymeThus doth Bilson interpret those vvords of Christ, M

                  to the Romane Magistrates for help to reclaime
one another from sinne: ād had not givē a perpetual rule
to his Church (for the casting out of obstinate sinners from
among them) neyther made a promise of his continuall presence
with his Church, to confirme in heaven that which they
should do on earth in his Name. But this by the way.
               Next after this Mr. H. affirmeth, and byndeth himself
to prove it, that there is nothing practised amongst them so con
                     
                        •
                     ary
to the discipline, as there is amongst vs. For proof whereof

having belike good store) he is content, first to omit
sundry of our practises: which it may be if he had named, he
perceyveth they would have ben so many witnesses against
himself and for us. Secondly he is content likewise to omit
the extreem confusion which he saith is to be seen in our best reformed
assemblyes. He saith it (I say) but proveth it not: which
in so grea
                     •
                   an accusation should not have ben omitted▪ specially
when he byndeth himself to make proof of that which he
affirmeth. It may be he perceyved also in this, that if he had
noted that down which he calleth extreem confusion, it might
have ben found to be that holy order which Christ hath sett in
his Church: and therefore chose rather to omit then to expresse
it. Yet that the truth in this behalf may better be knowen, I
will vpō this occasion show the order of our assemblyes wherein
we walk: and then let the godly mynded judge whether it
be an extreem confusion, or not.
               First, according to the ordinance of Christ our assemblyes
consist of (i) a company of faithfull people, called out and separated
from the world and all the false wayes of Antichrist.
(k) gathered and joyned together in an holy covenant and fellowship
of the Gospell of Christ, by (l) voluntary publik
profession of our 
                     •
                  aith and purpose to live and walk together
in the obedience of Christ according to his word, to the prayse
and glory of his name (i) 1 Cor. 1. 2. and 5. 12. and 2 Cor. 6.
17. Rev. 18. 4. Ioh. 15. 19. and 17. 6. Act. 2. 40. and 19. 9. (k)

Col. 2. 5. Rom 16. 26. Mat. 18. 17. 20. 1 Cor. 10. 31. Col. 3.
15. 16. 17.
               Secondly, being thus ioyned together we do (m) according
to the appoyntment of Christ by a free and voluntary
election of the Church sett apart from amongst our selves, some
to the (n) offices of Pastors and Teachers, for the work of
the ministery: some to be Elders for the oversight and guydance
of the Church together with the Pastors and Teachers
aforesaid: and others to be Deacons, for gathering and distributing
the benevolence of the Church according to the ability
and necessity of the Saints, specially taking care that the poore
sick and needy be relieved and holpen according to the Churches
ability and theyr severall occasions and necessityes: In
respect whereof we purpose, when God shall give vs such as
for theyr yeares and otherwise are fitt to be Widovves and
Helpers of the Church in this behalf, to designe and employ

them herevnto. (m) Mat. 28. 20. Heb. 5. 4. Act. 6. 3. 5. and 14.
23. and 15. 22. 2 Cor. 8. 19. 1 Tim. 3. 10. 15. and 6. 13. 14.

1 Tim. 3. Cap. and 4. 14. and 5. 9. 10. 17.
               Thirdly, our prayers, preaching of the word, administring
of the Sacraments, exercise of prophecy, vse of the Censures
etc. is not according to the inventions, book worship,
canons, or constitutions of any men whatsoever, but onely according
to the Testament of Christ, as he hath dealt to vs the
measure of grace. Ephes. 4. 7. 8. 11. 12. Iude, ver. 20. Rom▪
8. 26. 27. and 12 6. 7. 1 Tim. 2. 1. 2. and 3. 15. 1 Cor. 4. 17.
and 5. 4. and 11. 23. &c. and 14. Chap. 1 Pet. 4. 10. 11. Mat. 18. 15. 16.
17. and 28. 18. 19. 20.
               Finally, we (o) all of vs labour to build vp one another
in our most holy faith: and when (p) any of vs fall eyther into
error in iudgment, or offence in practise, against any article
of faith, commaundement of God, or publick good order of
the Church or Common-wealth, if the sinne be private, the
party is admonished thereof by such as are privy vnto 
                     〈◊〉
                  
whom if he heare not then taking one or two witnesses, they
admonish him agayn and seek to draw him from his sinne: If
he heare not them, as also if the sinne be publick, then is it
brought before the whole Church, whose voyce if he despise, he
is cast out from among them: least by (q) retayning of such
a litle leaven should leaven the whole lumpeeven them that
are within: least also the name of God which is called vpon vs
should be blasphemed among them that are without: ād to the

                     •
                  nd that the sinners themselves which are thus cast out of the
Church should be ashamed ād repent. Which (
                     •
                  ) if they do, thē
is the Church agayne ready to receyv them and to confirme
theyr love to them, as before, in the Lord (o) 1 Thes 5. 11.
Iude, ver. 20. 21. 22. 23. (p) Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17. Lev. 19. 17.
2 Cor. 13. 1▪ 2. Gal. 5. 12. and 6. 1. 1 Cor. 5. 4. 5. (q) 1 Cor. 5.

Mat. 18. 18. 19.
               And this is that order, wherein by the mercy of God
we have receyved to walk: though we do it with much weaknes,
through owr own coruption that hangeth so fast vpon
vs. Now if Mr H. or any other will needs account this to
be confusion, yet may not we therefore be likewise mynded:
any more then Shadrach Meshach and Abedneg
                     •
                   were when

then were charged withDan. 3. 14. 
                  disorder because they kept the way
of God and would not fall down before the Idoll of Nebuchadnezar:
but we must rather with the ApostleCol. 2. 5. reioyce,
beholding such an order and stedfast faith in Christ. Yet
do I not deny, but there have ben and still may be among vs
many hypocrites, vngodly men creping in vnder pretence of
religion. This hath ben the lott and estate of the Church of
God in all ages: as vpon other occasion hath ben declaredPag. 57. 58.
before. And if it were not so, what vse should there be of that
power and of those rules which Christ hath giuen to his
Church for the casting out of such from among them, when
they burst out into manifest vngodlynes. Therefore are we
not to look, that the Church shall wholy be free from such,
whiles it is vpon earth. Onely this, howsoever with glosing
words and showes such hide themselves from the knowledg
of men, yetIe

                     . 17. 9. 10. Mat. 13. 40. 41. God knoweth theyr hearts and wayes, and
in his day will cast them all out of his kingdome: In the
meane tyme,Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17. Gal. 5. 12. 1 Tim. 1. 19. 20. 1 Cor. 5. Chap. Whensoever the impiety of any such is discover

                  d
and certainely knowen, the Church hath power
and is to vse it for the purging of such leaven from among
them, that they may be an holy people to the Lord. And this
still is order, not confusion in the Church.
               Now here on the other side might I put Mr. H. in mynd of
the extreem confusion which is to be seen in theyr assemblyes:
in theyr constrayning of all though never so wicked, together
with theyr seed, to stand members of theyr Church: in theyr
false Antichristian ministery of Archbishops, Lordbishops,
Archdeacons, Priests, Parsons, Uicars, and the rest of that
crew: in theyr stinted popish Leyturgy, according to which
they offer vp theyr prayers, administer theyr Sacraments,

                  it the sick, bury the dead, marry etc. in theyr ordering also
and making of priests and deacons, together with theyr degradations
suspensions, excommunications, absolutions,
dispensations, licences to marry without the parents consent:
and all these by the Prelates, according to theyr popish canons
and pontificall: with infinite other such like confusions.
But it may be (with the Papists out of whose cup these were
drawen) they take them to be an heavēly order, Yet the Scripture
witnesseth they are no other but theRev. 17. 4. 5. vvith Gen. 11. 9. abominations of
Babel, that is, of confusion: And so the Church of GenevaIn the forme of Confession of faith vvherevnto all subscribe that are receyved to be schollers in the Vniversyt of Gen

professeth that they detest the whole order of papistry called
the Hierarchy as a divelish confusion. These things whensoever
Mr. H. shall duly consider and examine by the Scriptures

he shall fynd true among themselves that which vntruly
he obiecteth against vs, that extream confusion is to be seen
in theyr best reformed assemblyes.
               
               His third and mayne proof whereby he would show that
nothing is practised among them so contrary to the discipline
as there is amongst vs, he saith, is that vvhich hath
ben already mentioned: and of this he saith also, it may suffice,
thinking belike that it is a very sound proof. Which whether
it be so, I leave to every indifferent reader to iudge by that
which hath ben already aunswered to whatsoever he hath before
mentioned. And of Mr. H. himself I desier eyther yeelding
to the truth, or sounder proof of the accusations he chargeth
vs withall.
               After this, he laboreth to prove that we should account
them brethren and a true Church, by the example of Peter vvho
called those levves, that had crucifyed Christ, brethren, Act. 
                        •
                     .
29 and 3. 17. and of Paul vvho accounted the Galatians a true
Church, vvhen the errors they vvere fallen into vvere in matters
fundamentall, Gal. 1. 2. and 5. 2. But Mr. H. should have
considered, for the first, that Peter might call the levves his
brethren, as Paul doth, for that they were his kinsmen according
to the flesh, Rom. 9. 3. and children of the generation
of Abraham, Act. 13. 26. Secondly, because theRom. 9. 4. Act. 3. 25. and 13. 14. 15. 32. 33. Luk. 1. 8. 9. and 2. 31. &c Mat. 8. 4. vvith Levit. the vvhole book. Iewes
were the Church and people of God vnto whom the covenāts
and promises belonged, who also were sett in that order of ministery,
worship, and ministration which God prescribed. In
respect whereof Peter was to account them as brethren, till
Act. 2. 40. and 13. 46. and 19. 9. they had wilfully reiected the Gospell of Christ, whomAct. 3. 17. and 13. 27.
through ignorance they put to death. But what is this to
prove that Christians should account such for brethrē as stād
in2 Thel. 2 3. 10. Rev. 17 
                        •
                     . 2. apostasy from the way of Iesus Christ, and in respect
thereof be children of the fornications of Babylon? Or wh
                     •
                  
should not Iohn Wickleff, Martin Luther and the rest in
former ages by this reason have accounted the Papists as
brethren, till they had ben convinced and reiected by the iudgment
of the Church.
               For the second, that is, Pauls accounting of the Galatians
to be a true Church notvvithstanding some of them erred in
matters that vvere fundamentall: Mr H. should also have remembred,
first that it was but some of them that did so erre,
and not the whole Church: secondly, that they were a Church
established in the order of Christ, howsoever walking therein,

some of them declyned and fell into heynous errors. So as
now in regard of the ordinance of Christ wherein they stood,
they were to be accounted a true Church, and first to be admonished
and convinced before they could be reiected: as already
hath ben showed at large. But how doth this prove,
the assemblyes which stand in Antichristian defection should
likewise be accounted true Churches, and admonished and cē
                  sured
by others afore any may forsake them? Is there not a

and proceding to be vsed toward the Churches of Christ falling
into corruptions, ād toward the assemblyes of Antichrist
standing in defection from the way of Christ? Because the
Churches of Christ are to be admonished and redresse of theyr

of Antichrist make clayme to the same priviledges and maner
of proceding? Or because the members of true Churches are
to be accounted brethren, till having wilfully refused to repent,
they eyther be cast out, or having leavened the whole lumpe,
the candelstick be removed from them all: must therefore the
members of Antichristian assemblyes be had in the same account,
who never yet were ioyned to any true visible Church
in fellowship of the Gospell, but stand in confusion with the
world and subiection to the Beast, howsoever in such estate
they teach and professe some poynts of the truth and Christian
religion? Then sure let the Papists also be accounted brethren,
and no longer theRev. 1

But to conclude, did not the Apostle in that epistle to the Galatians

to be entangled agayne with the yoke of bondage, but to abhorre
all such and count them accursed who should preach or
lead them otherwise, then he had preached and they had receyved,
towching theyr liberty and freedome by the Gospell from
the ceremonyes of the Law? Now if they must abhorre and

                     〈◊〉
                   of all such as would bring in agayne the abolished ceremonyes
of the Law, which once were commaunded▪ by God:
how should such be accounted as brethren which retayne and
inforce the ordinances of Antichrist, never appoynted by God
but invented by Sathan that Prince of the children of disobedience?
               That which Mr. H. next obiecteth about the handling of the
controversy in the Church of Antiochea, hoth the same aunswer
with the former. Onely where he saith, that the errors
in that Church were far greater then any be in theyrs, let him

well consider with himself whether the error of vrging and receyving
circu

                  cision and other ceremonyes of the Law (before
tyme the holy ordinances of God, and now but newly abolished)
was greater then the vrging ād receyving of the Apostasy
of Antichrist (that great enemy of Iesus Christ) in his ministery,
worship, and government of the Church, which is
such as God never ordeyned butRev. 14. 9. 10. 11. and 16. 10. 11 and 17. 1. &c. straitly forbiddeth vpon
payne of eternall condemnation.
               Lastly for our separation from them (which he so earnestly
obiecteth against vs, and contrary toDeut. 30. 13. 14. GOds word
sendeth vs beyond the sea to enguyre his will ther
                     •
                  about) we
have not onely, if need were, that which he so much requireth,
the approbation of the reformed Churches of Geneva,
Fraunce, Belgia, Helvetia, and the rest, asPag. 67. 68. 69. before hath ben
showed by theyr own publick confessions: but we have also
that which is much more and which alone were sufficient,
I meane, the warrant of the Scriptures, and the like practise
of the Churches and people of God in all ages: firstGen. 6. 2 and 4. 26. vvith 2 Cor. 6. 17. 18. before
the stood: and then after the flood, both in theLevit. 20 24. 25. 26. Ezra. 6. 21. tyme
of the Law; and afterward vnder the Gospell: and that also
first in theAct. 2. 40. 41. and 19. 9. 2 Cor. 6. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. Primative Churches planted by the Apostles
themselves, and now agayne in all the Churches and people
which synce the apostasy of the man of sinne have made departure
out of the spirituall Babylon, as it isRev. 18. 4 and 14. 9. 10 11. vvith 2 Thes. 2. 3. 4. 8. written,
Go out of her my people, that ye be not partakers in her sinnes,
and that ye receyv not of her plagues. Now therefore (to
omitt Mr H. his vnseasonable vse of Pauls reproof in this
place) may not we well say of these things, as the Apostle1 Cor. 14. 37. 38.
doth to the Corinthians in the words immediately following
those which are here vsed, If any man think himself to be a
Prophet or spirituall, let him acknowledg that these things are
the commaundements of the Lord: And if any beignorant, let
him beignorant.

                     •
                   of the reason,
which was this, Whosoever he be that dealeth with the holy
things of God, and worketh vpon the consciences of men, by
vertue of an Antichristian power office and calling, him the people
of God ought not to receyv or joy
                        •
                     e themselues vnto: or as
M▪ H. hath here sett it down to like effect, he is an Antichristian
minister, whatsoever truth he bringeth with him. Now it
remayneth likewise to defend the second part of the rea
                     •
                  on,
which was this, But all the ministers that stād over the Churchassemblyes
in England, deale with the holy things of God, and

work vpon mens consciences, by vertue of an Antichristian power
office and calling. Concerning which, and the proof thereof,
first let vs see how Mr. H. setteth them down and aunswereth
vnto them generally: then let vs come to the particulars,
by which he endevoreth to approve theyr office and calling
of ministery from the word of God. It followeth therefore
in his letter, thus.
            
         
         
            
               ¶Mr. H. his letter▪ Section, 6.
               
                  THe second part of the reason is this, But all the ministers in England
work vpon the consciences of men by vertue of an Antichristian office
and calling. Hovv is this proved? First, they have no other office in the
Church then that which the lawes of the land allow: and they allow none
but the Prela
                     •
                  p, Priesthood, and 
                     •
                  eaconry, which are all Antichristia
                     •
                  
offices. Secondly▪ they all enter vpon theyr office, by the Ordinary the
Bishop, whose office is also Antichristian.
               To the first of these reasons I aunsvver, that although the name of Priests
belong not to the true ministers of the Gospell, because it hath ben generally in
our language given to the popish Sacrificers: and although there be sundry circumstances
and ceremonyes appoynted by the lavv to be vsed at they ordination
vvhich I cannot iustify, and many of those good orders neglected vvhich the
Scripture prescribeth in this case: yet is that office vvhich the lavves of our land
call the office of the Priesthood, the very same in substance vvith the Pastors office
described in the vvord: and the maner of outvvard calling vnto that office
vvhich the Lavv allovveth, is the very same in substance vvith that vvhich is sett
dovvn in the vvord.
            
            
               Aunswer to Section, 6.
               THis is Mr H. his generall aunswer to the secōd part of the
reason: which is needfull first to be considered, before we
come to the particulars which follow, that so both the strēgth
of the truth ād the subtilty of his aunswer may better appeare.
               First he yeeldeth (as needs he must) that they have no other
office in the Church, then that which the Lawes of the land allow:
For this is alledged in the proof of the second part of the
reason, and is not at all gaynesayed by him. Yet most of them
which are of the better sort among them, when they are somewhat
pressed about theyr ministery, disclayme their offices and
callings receyved from and by the Prelates (which onely are
allowed by the Lawes of the land) and fly to I know not
what office and calling receyved from some of theyr forward
Ministers and people: as himself also doth in this his writingSection, 10
afterward, where he saith, that many ministers in the land
have, and all may, if they will have, these substantiall parts of
a true calling, examination of theyr gifts by the godly and learned,
choyse of the people, and a right ordination: for I

would aske, why he saith many (and not all the) Ministers
in the Land have these, if it be not because he would fly
from the calling by the Prelates to that other devised calling
by theyr Ministers and people. Otherwise if he affirme these
things, of the calling and ordination by the Prelates, then all
(and not onely many) of theyr Ministers have and must have
it, seing the lawes of the Land allow no other: And then
also should he have shewed these particulars to be had in that
calling of the Prelates: which cannot be done, as will more
appeare hereafter. Thus is he driven to fight not onely against
other of his fellowes, but even against himself, whilest he
fighteth against the truth: for which I am sory on his behalf.
               Secondly, it is to be noted that he yeeldeth (as also needs
he must) that the lawes of the land allow no other office in the
Church but the Prelacy, Priesthood, and Deaconry: of which
it was and is still affirmed, that they are all Antichristian offices.
Which if he would have taken away, then should he
have proved that they are not such, but are by Christ in his
Testament appoynted to his Church. But seing this neyther
is neyther can be avowched by the word of GOD, we must
needs account of them as they be in deed, even the brood of
Antichrist, never knowen nor heard of in the Church of Iesus
Christ.
               Thirdly, it is to be observed that whereas theyr Prelacy,
Priesthood ād Deaconry were all and every of them charged
to be Antichristian: he speaketh onely in behalf of theyr Priesthood,
and helpeth not the Prelacy or Deaconry at all no not so
much as with any show of defence, but leaveth them on the
playne field to shift for themselves aswell as they may. It seemeth
theyr cause is very bad, that is so quite forsaken when it
is so deeply charged, and that fyndeth no succor at his hands
who hath himself bē Deacon after theyr maner, and receyved
from that (Prelacy which thus he forsaketh) that office of
Priesthood which yet he retayneth.
               Fourthly, it can but seem straunge that he should by this
meanes graunt the Prelacy and Deconry to be Antichristian, ād
yet plead for the Priesthood, as if it were not of the same nature:
when as it is no other office but such as is derived from
the Prelacy, and wherevnto theyr Deaconry is a step. As if
we couldIob. 14. 4. bring a cleane thing out of filthynes? Or as if
we couldMat. 7. 16. gather grapes of thornes, or figs of thistles?
Eyther therefore (as ChristMa
                        •
                     . 12. 
                        •
                     
                   sayd) make the tree good and
his fruite good, or els make the tree evill and his fruit evill.

Eyther let them prove theyr Prelacy and Deaconry to be good
according to the Testament of Christ, or els they cannot plead
for the Priesthood which ariseth from them: Or if they confesse
the Prelacy and Deaconry to be evill and Antichristian,
then must they also acknowledg the same of the priesthood
which yssueth from them.
               Fiftly, it is to be marked likewise, that Mr. H. graunteth
the name of Priests doth not belong to the true Ministers of
the Gospell. wherevpon I would aske, whether the office of
Priests belong vnto them any more then the name. If he aunswer,
no, as in deed he must: then will follow, that seing neyther
the Name nor office of Priests belongeth to the true Ministers
of the Gospell, and yet himself with the rest of them all
have the name and office of Priests, and by vertue thereof preach
ād administer the Sacraments, therefore they are not true
Ministers of the Gospell. Now whereas he assigneth this to
be the reason why the name of Priests belongeth not to the
Ministers of the Gospell, because it hath ben generally in our
language given to the popish sacrificers: this semeth not to be
the reason, but rather these which follow: First, becauseHeb. 7. 11 &c.
the Leviticall priesthood being ceased, Christ hath not now
instituted any office of Priests for ministery vnto his Church,
but remayneth himself a priest for ever after the order of. Mel
                  
                     •
                  hisedec,
having a priesthood that can not passe from one vnto
another. Secondly, because in all the New Testament it is
not read that the name of Priest doth note out any of those offices
which Christ hath instituted for the instruction and government
of his Church vnder the Gospell. Otherwise if
Christ had eyther ordeyned an office of Priests for the ministery
of his Gospell, or if the name Priest were vsed in the new
Testamēt to note out the Ministers of Christ vnder the Gospell:
it were no sufficient cause why the name might and ought
not still belong vnto them, because it hath ben generally in our
language given to the popish sacrificers. The name of Bisshops,
Deacons, Baptisme, Eu
                     •
                  harist, Excommunication,
and such like have ben and are generally in our language given
to the false offices, sacraments, and censures of the Church of
Antichrist: Yet do they notwithstanding belong to the true offices,
Sacraments, and censures of the Church of Christ:
Even as in the tyme of the Law the name of Priests, Altars,
sacrifices, feasts, and such like did still belong vnto and were
retayned in the true Church of the Iewes, notwithstanding
1 King. 12. 31. 32. 33. 2 Chron. 1
                        •
                     . 9. 10. Amos. 4. 4 5 and 
                        •
                     . 10. 
                        〈…〉
                     
                   those names were generally in theyr language given at

that tyme to the Priests, Altars, sacrifices, and feasts of the
Heathen, and of Israel also in her defection. But the case standeth
otherwise now for attributing the name of Priests to the
Ministers of the Gospell: as hath ben showed before, and
is agayn vpon other occasion more to be towched hereafter.
               Sixtly, it is here to be noted that he sayth there be sundry
circumstances and ceremonyes appoynted by the Law to be
vsed at theyr ordination of Priests vvhich he cannot justify,
Yea and that many of those good orders be neglected vvhich
the Scripture prescribeth in this case: and yet bothSection. 10. afterward
toward the end of his writing he confesseth he
                        •
                      sought
and receyved his calling from the Prelates, andSection, 3. Pag. 17. before in
the aunswer of the first part of the reason he acknowledged
that the least part of Christs ordināces cannot be neglected without
grievous sinne. Now lay together these things, which
this writing of his and theyr continuall practise witnesseth of
themselves: and then see in what wofull case they stand, and
mourne for theyr misery. Theyr sinne is grievous in theyr own
eyes, yet by theyr own confession they do wittingly seek after
it and persist in it. They know aforehand that the Prelates
ordering them will commit grievous sinne and so provoke the
Lords wrath, yet do they seek to be ordeyned by them, and
plead in defence thereof what they can. Is not this toEsa. 6. 9. 10. have
eyes, and not to see? or (to make the best of it) is it not
Rom. 3. 8. to do evill, that good may come thereon? of whom the
Apostle sayth, the damnation of such is just. Suerly theTit. 11. 12. vvith Ephes. 5. 11.
grace that bringeth salvation teacheth otherwise, even to deny
all vngodlynes, and not to have any fellowship with the vnfruitfull
works of darknes but to reprove them rather. So
the Apostle1 Tim. 5. 22. chargeth Timothy and in him all Ministers,
to keep themselves pure and not to communicate with other
mens sinnes. And the Lord from heaven hathRev. 18. 4. commaunded
all his servants to go out of Babylon, and not to partake
in her sinnes, that they receyv not of her plagues. Howsoever
therefore Mr. H. ād the rest of them account of this theyr
dealing, sure we are that before GOd it is grievous transgression:
ād therefore to be shunned of all such as have care to keep
faith and a good conscience, and the contrary to be witnessed in
testimony of the truth of Iesus Christ whose servants we are.
               Finally, it is here to be observed how they would beare
the world in hand, that they fayle but in circumstances and
ceremonyes, not in the substance, of the ministery. Where we
may first consider, how these forward preachers are now driven

to the same shift, wherevnto they drove the Prelates and
Formalists heretofore. TheAdmon. to Parl. T. C. his replyes. forward preachers proved
this Ministery ād worship to be Antichristian: TheVVhitg. B
                        •
                     idges. Some etc. Prelates
and theyr Proctors pleaded that they fayled but in circumstance,
and not in substance. Secondly it is to be noted
how they would vnder the name of ceremonyes and circumstances
subtilly hide that fowle heap of abominations, which
they have taken out of the whores cup of Babylō: many particulars
whereof havePag. 19. 30. 77. before divers tymes ben handled,
and therefore need not here agayn be mentioned. Thirdly, if
it were so that they fayled but in circumstances and ceremonyes,
yet they should remember that theLevit. 10 1. 2. 1 Chrō. 13. 9. 10. iudgment of God
overtook Nadab, Abihu, Uzziah and others recorded in the
Scripture, for transgressing in matters of ceremony and circumstance.
And what priviledge have they now above others
to stand in knowen and grievous sinne against the Lord Iesus
and his ordinances? Or are they1 Cor. 1
                        •
                     . 22. stronger then God,
that they will thus still provoke him to anger? Fourthly, it
is to be knowen, and they should do well to sett down, what
they account the substance of the Ministery. Mr. H.Section, 10. afterward
speaking of the entrance into the Ministery, setteth
down three substantiall parts thereof, as he calleth them:
first a due tryall: secondly, the choyse of the people (it seemeth
he meaneth a true visible Church, els he speaketh not to the
purpose): thirdly, a right ordinatiō. Of which three seing in his
own vnderstanding (as appeareth afterward) he can not himself
deny but most of theyr Ministers want all, and all theyr
Ministers want some (to witt, the choyse of a true visible
Church, ād a right ordination) it is evident by his own graunt
they want the substance of a true calling to the Ministery, and
therefore fayle not onely in circumstance as he would pretend.
               But that we may the better try out the truth in this poynt,
I will here sett down what I take to be substantiall in the ministery.
And that is, first that it be a true and lawfull office of
ministery which is receyved ād, executed, that is, that it be such
as Christ in his Testament hath given to his Church for the
work of his ministery: secondly, that there be a lawfull calling
and entrāce into such office as is aforesaid: thirdly, that the administration
thereof be according to the Testament of Christ.
Other things there be also which are of great waight towthing
the ministery: but these three specially I take to be such
as are substantiall vnto it: Insomuch as none of these can be
wanting to the execution of a true ministery.
               
                  
For towching the first, that is a true and lawfull office
prescribed by Christ, if it might be wanting in a true ministery,
to what end were it that Christ hathEph. 4. 11 12. 13. given to his
Church certayne and distinct offices for the work of the ministery
to the end of the world? Or how should it be true in this
case, which the Apostle1 Cor. 12 5. 28. saith of all the offices appoynted
by Christ, that God hath sett them in his Church: and agayne,
that there are diver
                        •
                     ityes of ministeryes, but the same Lord?
Otherwise also what a wide doore would be opened to theTim. 4. 3. vvith Exod. 20. 4. 5. Num. 15. 39.
receyving ād executing in the Church of any false offices whatsoever,
even for men after theyr own lusts to get them an heap
of teachers, and so to go a whoring after theyr own inventio
                     •
                  s
in the worship of God? Finally, how should men for
conscience sake1 Thes. 5. 12. 13. Heb 13. 17. honour obey and submitt vnto them which
have the oversight of the Church, if they be not over them in
the Lord and consequently in true and lawfull offices ordeyned
by Christ?
               For the second, that is a true and lavvfull calling and entrance
into theyr office, if it might be wanting in a true ministery,
why saith theHeb. 5. 4. 5. Scripture, No man taketh this honour
vnto himself but 
                        •
                     e that is called of God, as was Aaron:
Yea that Christ did not attribute this honour to himself to be
made the high Priest, but was called of him that said vnto him
Thou art my sonne, this day begat 
                        •
                      thee. Why also doth Christ
account them forIoh. 10. 1. 5. 
                  stra
                        •
                     ngers, thieves, and robbers, which
enter not in by the doore into the sheepfold, but clymbe vp another
way? Or to what end should it be that Christ so earnestly
Ioh. 13. 20. Luk. 10. 16. said, Verily, Verily I say vnto you, If I send any, he that receyveth
him receyveth me, and he that receyveth me receyveth
him that sent me: ād agayn, He that despiseth him despiseth me,
and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. Or why
hath God by theIer. 23. 21. Prophet Ieremy complayned against
and reiected the false Prophets in this respect, saying, I have
not sent these Prophets, yet they ranne: I have not spoken vnto
them, yet they prophecy. Lastly, if a true and lawfull calling
were not substantiall and necessary to the execution of a
true ministery, then why might not men devise new kinds of
entrance, or intrude themselves into the ministery at theyr
pleasure? Both which are vnlawfull.
               For the third, that is a lavvfull administration according
to the Testament of Christ, that it also cannot be wanting the
Scripture showeth many tymes and sundry wayes. First

in that the Apostle chargeth Timothy to2 Tim. 1. 13. 
                  keep the true patterne
of wholsome words delivered by the Apostles: and that
if any1 Tim. 6. 3. 5. 20. and 1. 3. 4. and 4. 7. vvith Gal. 1. 8. 9. Rom. 16. 17. 2 Ioh. 10. 
                  teach othervvise and condiscend not to the wholsome
words of our Lord Iesus Christ and to the doctrine which is
according to godlynes, they should be separated from ād holden
to be accursed. Secondly, in that the Apostle saith that
for1 Tim. 3 14. 15. 
                  this very cause he wrote vnto Timothy, and in him to2 Tim. 2. 2.
all the ministers of the Gospell in ages following, that they
might know how they ought to behave themselves in the house
of God which is the Church of the living God the pillar and
ground of truth. And herevpon therefore giveth most1 Tim. 5. 21. and 6. 13. 14. 15. 10. strait
charge before God and the Lord I Esus Christ and the elect
Angels, to keep that commaundment without spott and blameles
vntill the appearing of our Lord Iesus. Thirdly, in
that he teacheth that even2 Tim. 
                        •
                      16. 17. 
                  to this end the whole Scripture
is given by inspiration and is profitable to teach to improve
to correct and to instruct in righteousnes, that the man of God
may be absolute being fully furnished to every good work.
Fourthly, in that the Apostles themselves did account it substantiall
and of necessity in theyr2 Pet. 
                        •
                     . 16. 1 Cor. 11 23. Gal. 1. 10 11. 12. own administration, not
to follow subtill and cunning fables, but to deliver that they
receyved of the Lord: Neyther to2 Cor. 1. 24. 
                  have dominion over the
Saints, but to be helpers of theyr ioy. Even as Peter likewise
1 Pet. 4. 11. and 5. 1▪ 2. 3. requireth of all others, that they speak the words of
God, and that they feed the flock which dependeth vpon them
caring for it not by constraint but willingly▪ not for filthy lu
                  
                     •
                  re
but of a ready mynd, not as though they were Lords over
Gods heritage but as ensamples to the flock. Fiftly, Christ
himself the Lord of his Church hath taught this both by practise
and commaundement. By his practise, when concerning
his own ministration heIoh. 1
                        •
                     . 49. 50. saith, I have not spoken of my self,
but the Father which sent me gave me a commaundement what
I should say and what I should speak: and I know that his commaundement
is life everlasting: the things therefore that I speak,
I speak so as the Father said vnto me. By commaundement,
when heMat. 2
                        •
                     . 20. charged his Apostles they should teach to observ
vvhatsoever he had commaunded them, promising to be with
such vnto the end of the world. And finally, if it might be otherwise,
what end would there be in the Church ofEsa. 29. 13. Ma
                        •
                     . 15. 9 
                        •
                     ev. 10. 1. 2. Col. 2. 18. 22. 23. mens
precepts, vayne inventions, new ministrations, false
doctrines, straunge worship, voluntary Religions, counterfett
holynes, vsurped tyranny, Antichris
                     •
                  ian Lordlynes,
and such like?
               
                  
Thus then appeareth that in a true and lawfull ministery
it is substantiall and necessary, there be first a true and lawfull
office, that is, such as Christ hath in his Testament given
to his Church: secondly, a lawfull calling and entrance therevnto:
thirdly, a lawfull administratiō thereof according to the
said Testament of Iesus Christ. So as to prove that they have
the substance of a true ministery, Mr. H. should have showed
out of the Scripture, theyr offices, entrance, and administration:
theyr offices (I say) of Archbishops, Lordbishops,
Deanes, Prebendaryes, Archdeacons, Parsons, Uicars, Stipendaryes,
and all other sorts of Priests and Deacons among
them: theyr entrance likewise by the Lordbishops, according to
theyr popish pontificall, that is, according to theyr book of cō
                  secrating
Archbishops and Bishops and of ordering Priests
and Deacons, together with theyr Patrones presentations,
theyr institutions, inductions, othes of Canonicall obedience
to the Prelates, and such like: finally, theyr administration of
the word, Sacraments, and Censures, by vertue of the offices
afore said, and according to theyr popish book, canons, ād constitutions,
together with the performance of such actions as
belong not at all to the dutyes of the ministery, such as be the
Churching of women, the solemnization of mariage, praying
over the dead at burial, ād the like. These (I say) he should
have showed by the Scriptures, if he would prove vnto vs
that they have the substance of the ministery of the Gospell.
Which because it neyther is neyther cā be done by the word of
God: therefore can we in no wise be perswaded that they have
the substance of a true ministery and fayle but in circumstance,
as he would here beare vs in hand. Yet because he pretendeth
as if he could prove that which he saith, let vs see what stuffe
he bringeth to this purpose. It followeth therefore in his writing
for proof of his former assertion, in this wise.
            
         
         
            
               ¶Mr. H. his letter: Section, 7.
               DOth the vvord enioyne the Minister to preach deligently? So by our 
                     〈◊〉
                  
he is expresly charged at his ordination to do: and forbidden to teach any
thing as required of necessity vnto salvation, but that vvhich he is persvvaded
may be concluded and proved by the Scripture: Yea it commaundeth him vvith
all faithfull diligence to banish and drive avvay all erroneous and straunge doctrines
that are contrary to Gods vvord. Doth the vvord authorise him to administer
the Sacraments? So doth our Lavv. Doth the vvord requier that the minister
should not onely publikly teach, but also oversee and look to the peoples conversation,
exhorting, admonishing, reproving, and comforting them asvvell privately

as publikly? Even so doth our Lavv. Lastly, doth the vvord authorise the
minister to execute the censures and discipline of Christ? Our lavv doth also commaund
the same. So that (although many to vvhom the execution of these things
appertayne do grievously fayle in the practise thereof, yet you see) the office vvhich
the Lavv inioyneth to the Minister, is the same in substance vvith that vvhich the
vvord layeth vpon him.
            
            
               Aunswer to Section, 7.
               THis is then Mr H. his proof, by which he would perswade
vs that theyr Priests have the same office in substance
with the Pastors appoynted in the word, because the Law
of the land requireth of theyr Priests the performance of such
things as the word of God requireth of Pastors. But this is no
sufficient proof.
               For first, if he look into the Popes pontificall and Canons
he shall fynd they require also of theyr Priests and Bishops
to preach diligently, to administer the Sacraments, to oversee
theyr flock, and to execute the censures and discipline: And
consequently if his reason were good, the most popish priests
and Bishops should have the same office in substance with
the Pastors described in the word. Which doubtles he will
not affirme: or if he do let him take heed least with Mr Giffard
he prove himself a Schismatick from the Church of

                     ••
                  ome, from whence they have derived theyr ministery,
and yet pretend as if they made departure from that
Church.
               Secondly, he should have remembred, that distinction is to
be made between an office, and the actions or dutyes of an office.
For it often commeth to passe, that many performe the actiōs
of an office, who yet have not the office or substance thereof,
as he calleth it. To offer incense was a duty belonging to
theExod 30. 7. 8. Deut. 33. 10. 2 Chron. 26. 18. priesthood in the tyme of the Law. Corah, Dathan, Abiram,
men famous in the Congregatiō, 
                     •
                  zziah also a king, they
take censers and put incense therein to offer it to the Lord: Yet
hadNum▪ 16 40. 2 Chro. 26. 19 20. vvith Heb. 5 4. they not therefore the substance of the Priests office, but
were punished and made examples to all such as should afterward
attempt to do the dutyes of the ministery, being
not lawfully called and sett in those offices which Christ hath
appoynted therevnto. The administration of Baptisme
likewise is a duty belonging to theMat. 28. 18. 19. Ioh. 1. 25. 26. 33. 1 Cor. 1. 14. 16. 175. 1. ād 3. 5. 6. 9. vvith Ephes. 4. 11 12. Ministery of the Gospell:
Yet women in ENgland do administer it, yea and
areBook of common prayer: in Private Baptisme. by the Law allowed so to do in case of necessity
(as they call it): Yet I suppose Mr H. will not say

that women therefore have the substance of the Ministery: of
whom the Scripture1 Cor. 14▪ 34. 35. 1 Ti. 
                        •
                     . 12. saith, it is a shame for them to speak
in the Church, and therefore doth not permitt it vnto them,
but requireth of them to keep silence. So far is it from accounting
or allowing them to have the substance of the Ministery,
howsoever the Lawes of men allow them to performe some
action
                     •
                   thereof. The same may be said of theyr Deacons, who
Book of ordering Priests and Deacons: by the Law are appoynted also to administer Baptisme,
and (having a licence) to preach the word. Yet have not their
Deacons therefore the substance of the Pastors office, though
they performe some of the dutyes thereof. By this then is evident
that his reason is of no waight to prove that their Priesthood
is the same in substance with the Pastors office, because
by Law such dutyes are required to be done of it, as by the word
are enioyned to the other. As is sayd, an office is one thing, and
the actions or dutyes of the office another. Besides that it seemeth,
the Law at first supposing their Priesthood to be a lawfull
office of Ministery, did therefore enioyne it those dutyes
to be performed thereyn: Whereas now it being found to be
vnlawfull, and altogether vnheard of in the Churches of the
Gospell, neyther the injoyning nor the executing of those dutyes
can make it of vnlawfull to become lawfull before God
any maner way.
               3. But furthermore, doth not the Law of the Land requier
these same things of theyr Archbishops also? And have
they therefore the substance of the Pastors office? How then
will it be true whichD. VVhitg Last book against T. G. pag. 137. some of them hold and write, that a
Bishop is superior both in office and gifts to a Pastor? or asDefence of eccles. discipl. against Bridges. pag. 88. 89.
others of them have proved by divers reasons against Bridges
that Archbishops and Lordbishops are neyther Pastors nor
Teachers: Nay moreover, thatAdmon. to Pa

                     . 2. 
                  they rob Christs Church
of lavvfull Pastors, and that these theyr offices be Antichristian,
Divelish, and contrary to the Scriptures? Or if the Archbisshops
have the Pastors office among them, what is become
then of all the rest of the Ministers of the Land? For by this
meanes there should be but two Pastors in the Land, seyng
there are but two Archbishops. Or if the Lordbishops be
the Pastors, then are there but twenty fower Pastors or thereabout
in the Land: and what be the offices then of theyr
inferior Priests? Or if the inferior Priests be the Pastors (as
seemeth by this writing to be intended) then what office in the
Church have theyr Lordbishops, Archbishops, Archdeacons,
ād the rest of the Clergy among them? Which is needfull

to be considered seingDefence of eccles. disc. against Bridg. pag. 101. themselves have written (according
as the truth is) that our Saviour Christ hath appoynted in the
                  Note that the speach is not of the temporary and extraordinary offices of Apostles, Prophets, Evāge lists, vvhich are ceased: neyther of the Civill Magistracy, vnto vvhich every soule (even the Apostles, if they vvere on earth, ā

                        •
                      and that, onely in the ordinary guydance of the Church. 
                  ordinary guydance of the Church no office to be exercised by
any one * ecclesiasticall person, greater then the office of the Pastors:
and hath also made these all equall in every respect of ministery,
iurisdiction, and power. Whereas it is far otherwise
in the Prelacy of theyr Archbischops, Lordbishops, and the
rest, having and exercising iurisdiction and power over the
inferior priesthood and ministery of the land.
               Fourthly although the word of God lay the dutyes aforesaid
vpon the Pastors of the Churches of Christ, yet it requireth
them not at the hands of this Priesthood or any other
false ministery whatsoever. Therefore is it not materiall
though the lawes of all the nations vnder heaven should enioyne
these dutyes vnto them: so long as the word of God
(which is the word of truth and onely rule of religion) requireth
them not at theyr hand. Iesus Christ theMat. 28. 18. 19. 20. Ephes. 4. 11. 12. 1 Cor. 12 5. 28. 1 Tim 3. cap. and 5. 17. and 6. 13. 14. Lord and
King of his Church, as he gave vnto it the holy things of his
word, prayer, Sacraments, etc. so hath he also given his
own Ministers for the administration thereof according to
his Testament. At the hands of Antichrists priesthood or
any other false ministery he requireth it not: But rather vnto
all such hePsal. 50. 16. 17. saith What hast thou to do to declare myne
ordinance, that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth
seing thou hatest to be reformed and hast cast my words behind
thee? AndEsa. 1. 1
                        •
                     . agayn to such he saith, Who requireth these things
at your hands? If Iupiters priest (of whom weAct. 14. 13 read in
the Acts of the Apostles) or if Mahumets priests now in Turkey
should by the lawes of theyr nations be enioyned and therevpon
should execute the ministery of Gods word, Sacraments,
and censures: would it follow therefore that such
priests had the substance of the Pastors office? And why then
should this priesthood of Antichrist have more priviledge then
those, seing the word of God hath layd these dutyes no more
vpon it then vpon the other, but hathPsal. 119 21. 128. Re

               Theyr Priests (he saith) must preach the word. Well: but
with what limits must they do this? Theyr 
                     〈◊〉
                   Statutes,
and Articles will tell you. They must not speak against
the Prelacy or other ministery of the Land: nor against theyr
book of common prayer (though it be taken on
                     •
                   of the Popes
portuis): nor against theyr ecclesiasticall courts of Arches,
Facultyes, Commissary courts, suspensions, excommunications,
absolutions, degradations, or any other theyr ecclesiasticall
procedings. And may not any popish priest (I pray you)
thus preach the word at

                  ome, being hedged in with such limits
ād cautions? But what if any of our English priests do
from Gods word preach against any the aforesaid abominations

the rest that followeth.
               Theyr priests (he saith) must also drive away all erroneous
and straunge doctrines that are contrary to Gods word. How
is it then, that by law they may teach and maynteyne so
many false doctrines contrary to the Scripture, as have
ben mentionedPag. 10. 11. 12. 13. before? Or how is it that they silence, imprison,
banish, and kill such as speak against and labour to
drive away the erroneous and straunge doctrines yet retayned
among them contrary to the word of God?

administer the Sacraments. Well: but by vertue of what
calling? Is it not from the Prelates the Lordbishops,
who have no power from Christ to give such authority? Of
which moreIn Section 9. and 10 hereafter. How also must they administer
the Sacraments? According to the Testament of Christ? No:
but accordin to theyr own book (for so the Law requireth)
with certayne stinted words for prayer, and certayne for
exhortation: with Epistles and Gospels: with questions
and crosse to infants in Baptisme: with other then the words
of Christs institution in the Lords supper, and with kneeling
thereat as when they receyved theyr maker, and other
the like profanations derived from the Papists. And yet moreover
the Sacraments they administer must be given not to
the faithfull onely and theyr seed (as Christ hath appoynted)
but to the most wicked and profane in the land, even to all
within the precinct of theyr parishes:

                      &c. these, the Prelate speaking to the Priest, Will you give
your faithfull diligence alwayes so to minister the doctrine and
Sacraments and the discipline of Christ, an the Lord hath commaunded,
and as this Realme hath receyved the same, according
to the commaundements of God, so that you may reach
the people committed to your cure and charge, with all diligence
to keep and observ the same. Then he that is to be made
Priest aunswereth, I will do so, by the help of the Lord. Now
who seeth not that these words (as this Realme hath receyved
the same) do so restrayne the other words therevnto annexed,
as the Priests are limited and promise no further nor otherwise
to Minister the doctrine Sacraments or discipline of
Christ, but as this Realme hath receyved them? And have

Yet I trow Mr. H. will not say, they have therefore the substance
of the Pastors office. Next let vs consider more particularly
how they do and must exercise the discipline. The book
showeth, so as is receyved in the Realme: that is, by presentments
to the Prelates, Commissaryes, and Chauncelours
courts, by citations, procurations, getting the Prelates or
theyr Officals to suspend, excommunicate, absolve. dispense,
give licences, give orders, degrade, deprive, and the like: and
these also not according to the rules of Christs Testament, but
according to theyr Romish canons and constitutions.
               Let him not tell us then, that it is but the fayling of some
in theyr practise to whom the execution of these things is committed,
and that otherwise they have the substance of the Pastors
office. They do but thus deceyv themselves and theyr followers,
whiles vnder those generall termes of preaching the
word, administring the Sacraments and discipline (which at
first carry a fayre show) they cover most filthy abominations,
as hath ben declared: Even hereby showing they

among them that perish, because they receyv not the love of
the truth that they might be saved.
               Herevnto might be added (if there needed further proof)

that theyr priests at theyr ordination promise to be subject to
theyr Ordinary (that is, to the Prelate of the Dioces) and
other chief Ministers over them (that is, the Archdeacon
Chauncelor, Commissary etc.) and when they enter into a benefice
do moreover sweare to yeeld canonicall obedience to
the Prelates: and finally do themselves together with theyr
people stand subject to theyr Archbishops, Lordbishops,
and the rest of the Antichristian offices and abominations often
before rehearsed. From all which the true Past

like which by Christ were never appoynted for duiyes of his
Ministery. Hitherto then have we showed that theyr Priests
have not the substance of the Pastors office prescribed in the
word, as he did pretend.
               Now therefore will we proceed to that which followeth,
save that first I would put him in mynd of two things,

theyr office they are Pastors or Teachers in the Church. How
soundly this is alledged for theyr Prelates or Priests (besides
that which is spoken before) let themselves and theyr own

               YEs sure, we must tell them agayn and agayn, that they
are Priests both in name and office. But be it that they
were not Priests by office, yet seing the very name of Priests
(being applyed to a Ministery of the Gospell among men) is

a name? Have they forgotten or do they not regard, that among
the marks of that great whore the Romish Babylon,
this is one that she is full ofRev. 17. 3 
                  names of blasphemy? And
among these names of hers, is not this of Priest (being spoken
of an office of Ministery among men vnder the Gospell)
one of them that is most blasphemous, for the reasons before
alledged? Hath not God also threatned that they shall drink
of the cup of his wrath, and have no rest day nor might, not
onely which worship the beast and his image, but evenRev. 14. 11.

regard we

                   not: but with the Apostle we doAct. 24. 14. freely
confesse that after the way which they call Heresy so worship
we God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, beleving all
things that are written in the Law, in the Prophets and Apostles:
and endevoring our selves to have alway a cleare
conscience toward God and toward men. Let men therefore
call vs Brownists or what they please: it troubleth not vs,
seing we are so termed vntruly and vnjustly.
               But for theyr name of Priests, it is far otherwise. They
are truly and justly so called: and that for these causes following.
First for that the Law (whereto Mr. H. appealeth
for theyr defence) alloweth no other orders of Ministery in
the land, but of Deacons (which is the way to the priesthood)
and of Priests, so made and ordeyned by the Prelates.
               Secondly, because at theyrBook of ordering P

                     iests. ordination, the Archdeacon
presenting them to the Lordbishop vseth these words,
Reverend father I present these men vnto you to be admitted to
the order of Priesthood.
               
               Thirdly, for that the Prelates, by whom they are ordeyned,
admitt them to no other office. For after the Archdeacon
hath presented them as is aforesaid, then the Prelate speaking
to the people saythIn the same book. thus, Good people, these be
they whom we purpose God willing, to receyve this day vnto
the holy office of Priesthood.
               
               
                  
Fourthly, because theyr book of ordination both in the

               Lastly, because the most popish priests, whether they have
ben so made here

yet if they renounce onely those poynts of popery that this
land hath reiected, are receyved and retayned for priests (without
any new ordination) to administer in these asemblyes:
to offer vp theyr prayers, to deliver theyr Sacrmēts to them,

priests so retayned from the begining of her Maiestyes raigne
vnto this day: but also in divers popish priests of this age, as
Tirell, Tither, Nichols, and such other who being made Priests
at Rhemes and Rome, were (without any other ordination
then there they had, vpon recantation of some popish errors,
receyved for ministers of these assemblyes ād inducted into benefices
by the Prelates. Whereas on the contrary such as
have ben allowed for ministers in the reformed Churches beyond
seas (where the popish priesthood is wholy reiected) whē
they come into Englād are not approved for lawfull ministers
to administer in these assemblyes, neyther to enter vpon any
theyr benefi
                     •
                  es, vnles they be first made Deacons and Priests
by some of the Prelates. Proof of this also we have seen not
onely in the troubles raysed in this behalf against Mr Whitting
                     •
                  am
at Durham in the North, and against Mr Travers
at the Temple in London: but most evidently in Mr
Wright (now Parson of Dinnington in Suffolck) who being
presented to that benefice, yet could not (for all the allowance
he had receyved of the reformed Churches in the low countreyes)
be instituted and inducted into it, till he was made Priest
by Scamler Prelate of Norwich now deceased. Thus (to
omit till hereafter how neare of kinne our English Priests
are to the popish) by these reasons is evident that they are truly
and iustly called Priests: Which is the thing that was to
be showed.
               But they will say, they are not ordeyned to sacrifice for the
quick and the dead, as be the popish priests. Whereto I might

                  
                     •
                  unswer, that some of them were so ordeyned, and never receyved
any other ordination: yet notwiths
                     •
                  anding stand they
priests of these assemblyes, at this day, as was showedIn Q: Mary priests In Tirrell, Tither, &c. before.
But be it that none of them were so ordeyned: What
then? Doth it follow therefore they are no Priests? If so,
th
                     •
                   the Leviticall priests vnder the Law were no priests. For
they were not ordeyned to sacrifice for the quick and dead: Yet
were they priests by office of ministery, and lawfully also at
that tyme as theExod. 28 1. Dent. 33. 10. vyith Le. 21. 1. Hos. 9. 4. Deut. 12. 11. 12. Scripture teacheth. Neyther by this reason
are Mahumets priests at this day, or any priests of the
Heathen to be accounted Priests. For they are not ordeyned
(as the popish priests) to offer vp Christ, whom they reiect:
Yet are they priests notwithstanding by theyr office (as weAct. 14. 13.
read of Iupiters Priest in the Acts): but false ones as be also
the Romish and English and all Antichristian priests whatsoever.
               Secondly, although the Masse (whereto those popish priests
be bound) be the chief and principall, yet is it not the onely abominable
sacrifice and worship in the world. To let passe the
Heathens sacrifices and priesthood: what may we think (in
this light of the Gospell) of that Idoll-book of stinted prayers
and exhortations, whereto the priests of England be tyed to
offer it vp as theyr publik sacrifice and worship vnto God?
Will you heare what some of themselves have thought of it,
and have advertised the most honorable Court of Parliament
concerning it? Thus then have they

                        •
                     atise 2. written hereof: We
must needs say as followeth (these are theyr own words) that
this book is an vnperf
                        •••
                     t book, culled and picked out of that
popish dunghill the masse book full of all abhominations. Lo
here▪ in theyr own consciences theyr book of Common prayer
is no other but a pigge of that mezeld sow the Masse book.
Yet this sacrifice do theyr Priests daily offer vp vnto God
and are bound therevnto. And that so, as among them this
may and doth serve alone without any theyr sermons or other
prayers, whereas these without it in theyr constitution are
not sufficient. Although then the Priests of England be not
now ordeyned to say Masse, neyther tyed to the Masse book
in Latin: yet when in stead thereof they are still bound to such
a book and worship, as (by theyr own confession) is culled and
picked out of that popish dunghill the Masse book full of abominations:
what can this help for theyr defence? Nay rather
considering the light and measure of knowledg revealed more
to them then to the Papists, is not theyr sinne (though

not in it self, yet) in this respect so much the greater, as they
have receyved more light and knowledg of the truth then the
other have done?
               Thirdly, neyther is sacrificing the onely duty of the priesthood
in Popery: but besides it they have, by vertue of theyr
ordination to that office, authority likewise to read theyr
service book, to preach, to minister the Sacraments, to bucy
the dead, to solem

of England, wherevnto in this constitution they have authority
by vertue of theyr ordination to that office, as have
the Priests in popery: What great matter is it, if agreing
with them in so many severall dutyes of the same office, they
should altogether differ from them in one? The Turkish
and Heathenish priests at this day, although they differ very
much both from those at Rome and these of England,
yet notwithstanding are they Priests in a false office, as
well as the other. Hitherto then hath ben showed that the
Ministers of these assemblyes are truly and fitly called
Priests. And Mayster H. himself who pleadeth theyr cause,
yet cannot (you see) deny, but they agree in Name with the popish
priesthood.
               
               Now whereas he addeth that though theyr Priesthood agree
in name, yet it differeth in nature and substance as much from
the popish priesthood as light doth frō darknes: it is as true as
whē he saidIn Sec
                     
                        •
                     on 6. and 7. before, theyr priesthood was in substance the same
with the office of the Pastor described in the word: that is, it
is vtterly vntrue. Which although it be sufficiently provedIn the aunsvver to the 6. and 7. 
                        〈◊〉
                     .
already, yet for more clearing of the truth ād stopping of theyr
mouths, it shalbe good here by way of comparison to set down
the agreement of theyrs with the popish priesthood on the one
hand, and on the other the disagreement of them both from
the Pastors office which Christ hath appoynted.
               1 And first of all it would be knowen what the cause is
why they retayne the same name, if they have not the same
office with the popish priesthood? As also, if they have the
same office with the Pastors described in the word, why then
they have not also the same name? In the history of Isaac
the Scripture recordeth (as a thing very godly and memorable)
thatGe
                        •
                     . 26. 18. when he digged agayn the wels of water, which
they had digged in the dayes of Abraham his father, and

which the Philistims had stopped after the death of Abraham,
he gave them the same names which his father had given
them. If these men likewise have recovered agayn the Pastors
office plāted by the Apostles in the Primitive Churches,
and since theyr death stopped vp by the Romish Philistims:
why do they not in like maner give it theEph. 4. 11. vvith 1 Cor. 4. 15 same name that
our fathers the Apostles gave vnto it? Are these men wiser
then the Apostles of our Lord Iesus? or are they fathers in
Christ more then the Apostles? or do they disdayne to tread
in the Apostles steps, as Isaac did in Abrahams? Agayn,
let them tell vs why they keep the name of the popish priesthood,
if they have not still the same office? Have they not
heard of the promise made by the Lord to his Church and
people when he bringeth them from Idolatrous wayesHos. 2. 17.
                  that he will take away the names of Baalim out of theyr mouth
and that they shall no more be remembred by theyr names▪
                  
Hath the Lord said it, and shall he not do it? or hath he
promised, and shall he not accomplish it? Now is it then
that these men have the same name, if they have not the same
office with the popish priesthood? Is it because they would
manifest to the world, that as yet in theyr estate that promise
belongeth not vnto them? Then certainely as yet they
are not the true ministers and Churches of Christ. Or is it because
they would have all mē know that as yet theyRev. 14. 9 11. 
                  worship
the Beast, and receive his mark and the print of his name?
Then suerly as yet they are false Ministers and Churches of
Antichrist. Or finally, is it because they can well like of
theRev. 15. 3. and 18 4. 
                  names of blasphemy written in the whores forehead,
neyther are afrayd to partake in her sinnes? Then needs must
they look to receyv also of her plagues whose end is damnation:
as the ScriptureRev. 17. 1. and 18. 4 5. and 19. 2. witnesseth. This therefore first
is a matter of great waight and consequence (howsoever they
regard it) that in name they both agree with the Priests of
Antichrist, and disagree with the Pastors of IEsus Christ.
But we will proceed to compare them together in other
things which themselves account of greater moment: as in

likewise, with the titles of Kings and Nobles (as Grace,

               Hitherto then have we been both the agreement of the

disagree from the Pastors office appoynted by Chirst. Neyther

that he onely should be called to the Ministery, that is a man of vnblameable
life: If it vvould please you to peruse the book of ordering Deacons and
Priests, you shall fynd it requireth the same. The vvord reqaireth that he should
be apt to teach: So doth our Lavv. The vvord requireth that before he minister
he should be approved: Our lavv commaundeth that before he be admitted,
he be by such as are learned examined vvhat gifts he hat
                     •
                   and ability to teach,
and by the people vvhat his conversation hath ben. The vvord prescribeth that
the people and flock should approve of and choose theyr Minister: Our Lavv
commaundeth that none should be admitted to that office but in a solemne assembly,
and that liberty should be graunted to any in the congregation to obiect
vvhatsoever iust impediment that they shall knevv against him. The vvord
requireth that by the imposition of the hands of the Eldership vvith solemne
prayers, the Minister should be ordeyned and as it vvere consecrated to that holy
office: Our lavv requireth the very same. In deed I confesse that there is great
vvant in our Church in the due execution of these things: but that is the fault
of the men, not of the calling. And therefore to your reason that is brought to
prove
                     •
                  s Antichristian vsurpers, because vve have no other office in the Church
but that vvhich the Lavv allovveth, you see I may truly and suffiicienly aunsvver
that although vve had no other, yet have we that in substance vvhich the vvord
prescribeth.
            
            
               Aunswer to Section, 9.
               RAther by that which hath ben said we have seen such an
agreement of theyr Priesthood and Law thereof with the
popish Law and priesthood, and such a disagreement of them
both from the Law of God and Pastors office prescribed
theyrin, as it can not but be discerned of all (whose eyes are not
blynded) that both the Pastors office differeth as much from
theyr priesthood as light doth from darknes, and that theyr
Priesthood in nature and substance agreeth with the popish as
daughters of one mother and fethers of one ād the same wing.
               Now whereas in the next place Mr H. cometh to their ouward
calling to that office of Priesthood, and therein refereth

vs to theyr book of ordering Priests ād Deacons, that we might
peruse and so compare together theyr law with the Law of
God: it is straunge to see how they do thēselves discover theyr
own shame, even when they labour most to hide it. For if any
would go about to lay open the filthynes of theyr abominations
which in the calling to theyr ministery they have taken
out of the whores cup of Babylon, it can no way better
be done, then by comparing that book of theyrs (whereto
he referreth vs) with the book and Law of God on the one
hand, and with the Popes pontificall on the other. Evidence
whereof we have seen sufficient in the comparison handledPag. 100. &c.
before, and need not repeat it. Yea theyr own consciences are
so convinced herein as themselves have confessed and publisht
it (in admonition to the Parliament) thatAdmo

thatIn the same book: sect. 20. 
                  they haue an Antichristian Hierarchy and popish ordering
of Ministers, straunge from the word of God and the vse of
all vvel reformed Churches in the world.
               
               Let these things then be layd together, ād well weighed. Now
they would perswade vs that theyr calling to the Ministery
is according to the Law of God: Heretofore they published
(as the truth is) that they have a popish ordering of ministers
straunge from the word of God. Now they would beare vs
inhand that they have the substance of a true calling according
to the ordinance of Christ: Heretofore they said (and truly)
that theyr making of Minist
                     •
                  rs is taken out of the Popes
pontificall wherein he showes himself to be A

                  tichrist most
lively. Is it not lamenta
                     •
                  le to see these men thus turne the
truth of God into aly? as if Antichrists apostasy were now
sodenly become Gods ordinance, or the Popes pontificall were
all one with the Testament of Iesus Christ? Besides this
is it not straunge that in this very letter Mr H. should so
forget ād contradict himself, as here to say theyr Law agreeth
with the Law of God as tovvching the substance of a true calling
to the Ministery: ād yet
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      10. afterward accounting right ordination
to be a substantiall part of true calling, to affirme that the
povver of ordination is by act of Parliament committed to the
Prelates, and that by the Lavv of God the Prelates are not capable
of that povver and authority? Is it possible to make these
things accord together?
               
                  
But because they feare not to deale thus doubly in the matters
of God: Let vs (besides that which hath ben sayd) yet
a litle more examine theyr maner of calling to the Ministery,
even by that book of theyrs which he would have vs peruse as
being agreable to the Law of God: and see if God do not
by themselves vncover theyr nakednes, and make his truth
(which they would hinder, yet) more abound through theyr
vntruth vnto his glory. It were long to stand vpon all the
particulars which out of that book to this end might be alledged:
and this writing is already much langer then at first I
purposed. I will therefore but give a tast of some, by which
you may perceyv what smack the rest have.
               And first the veryThat 
                        〈…〉
                      of making and consecrating Bisshops, Priest, 
                        〈◊〉
                     . 
                  title of the book (as a mark in the forehead)
evidently showeth the vnlawfulnes both of theyr office,
and of theyr entrance into it. It is called thus, The forme
and maner of making and consecrating Bishops, Priests, and
Deacons. Now if these offices, and this maner of entrance
were appoynted in the Testament of Christ: what need or vse
were there of this book and forme of theyrs? But because they
follow not the book of God ād the forme prescribed by Christ,
therefore have they framed to themselves this book and forme
out of the Popes pontificall, and termed it as aforesayd.
               Now as is the title, so be also the contents of that book. By
it as likewise by theyr practise it appeareth, that theyr first office
of Ministery is the Deaconship (not that auncient office
of Deacons appoynted by Christ, but) a meer invention of
mans brayne and Antichristian. For first that office is not
imployed (according toAct. 6. 2. 4. Rom. 12. 8. 1 Cor. 12. 28. and 16. 1. compared vvith Ephes. 
                        •
                      11. 12. Christs ordinance) in gathering
and distributing the Churches benevolence: but contrary to
the word of God, in reading theyr books of common prayer
and Homilyes, in administring Baptisme, assisting the Priest
in divine service, and (with the Prelates licence) in preaching
the word. Secondly, at theyr entrance and calling into that
office, they must be presented by an Archdeacon (an Antichristion
officer) or his deputy. Thirdly they must promise reverend
obedience to theyr Ordinary and other chief Ministers
of the Church, that is to the Lordbishop of the Dioces, to
the Archbishop, Archdeacon, Chauncelor, Commissary, and
the rest of that sort (whose offices also are Antichristian).
Fourthly they must be ordeyned by a Lordbishop or his
Suffragane, whose office likewise is of Antichrist. Fiftly,
they must receyv the Communion with the Lordbishop that
day they are ordered. And thus must they testify that they ar

                  aith and body with the Prelates, who are knowen
to be deadly enemyes of the truth and persecuters of the
people of God. Sixtly, in stead of true prayer there must
be sayd or sung the Letany and Suffrages, with the Communion
of the Day and a number of Collects and stinted prayers,
borrowed from the Papists. Finally there must be read
a Gospell and Epistle (as they call theyr shredding of the
Scripture): in which they abuse and pervert the word of
God, falsely fathering vpon the Apostles an office of Deaconship
which they never ordeyned: that is, a Deaco
                     •
                  ry whose
dutyes they assigne to be, to read publike prayer, to baptize,
to assist the Priest in divine service, and to preach, being licensed
therevnto: Whereas neyther in the Apostles example nor
doctrine any such dutyes are layd vpon the Deacons, but such
as are directlyAct. 6. 2. 3. 4. opposed to the Ministery of the word and
prayer, that is, the having charge of the poore and Church

by the Apostles there is no such entrance as is aforesayd, but
a lawfull choyse and calling of a true Church according to the
word of God: as is recorded in the election of Deacons mentioned
in theAct. 6. 2 3. 5. 6. 1 Tim. 4. 8. 9 10. 1 Cor. 12. 28 vvith 2 Cor. 8. 19. Acts of the Apostles and in other Scriptures.
And thus for theyr first office of Ministery it is manifest, that
neyther the office nor entrance into it is agreable to the Law
of God. Which themselves also have seen and publisht heretofore:

               Neyther is theyr calling and entrance to theyr next office of
Ministery, that is, to theyr Priesthood, any better. For (as
appeareth both by theyr book and practise) afore they can be
Priests, they must first be Deacons or half Priests: that is,
they must be ordeyned by a Prelate according to theyr book to
the false Antichristian office aforesayd. For by theyr Law it is
the first step to the Ministery, or rather a meer order of Pri

promise (as before the Deacons did) reverently to obey theyr
Ordinary and other chief Ministers of the Church, that is,
the Prelates and theyr Officers. 6. At theyr Ordination must

as before they did about the Deaconship: Yea they are
so blynd, as they then read suchAs namely, Ioh. 10. 1—16. and 20. 21. 22. 23. Mat. 28. 18. 19. 20. Act. 6. 2—6. and 20. 17. 27. 28 29. 30. 1 Tim. 3. ca. Scriptures for theyr Gospels
and Epistles as most plainely condemne this theyr maner
of entrance and calling. 7. After this, there must be said
or sung, Come holy Ghost &c. And sure they had need desire
the holy Ghost to come vpon them and show them a better
way: For now doubtles he is not present with them at such

                  ion of Gods name, word, and ordinance, as is among
them. 8. When all is said and sung that is appoynted,
till it come to the Ordering of the new priests, then must they
that are to be made Priests humbly kneel vpon theyr knees
at the feet of the Lordbishop. 9. And he with the Priests present
lay theyr hands severally vpon the head of every one that
receyveth Orders. 10. And then the Lordbishop saith to
every of them (but not without blasphemy) Receyve the holy
Ghost: vvhose sinnes thou doest forgive they as forgiven,
and vvhose sinnes thou doest retayne, they are retayned.

divers particulars whereof have before often ben mentioned.
And this is theyr maner of outvvard calling vnto theyr office of
ministery, called the Priesthood. Yet have I not here related
all the straunge, ridiculous, and abhominable things, vsed
at theyr entrance into these offices: neyther have I spoken

at all of theyr consecration of Archbishops and Lordbishops,
prescribed also in that book wherevnto Mr H. referreth vs.
It would griev any Christian heart to wade through such filthy
myer. And these few things are ynow (yea to many) to
show how contrary that theyr book and maner of outvvard
calling to the Ministery is to the Book and Law of God.
               Now further it is to be mynded, that Mr H. tels you
not a word of these and such like abominations vsed at theyr
intrance to the ministery: but with much colourable perswasion
laboreth to cast a mist before your eyes, that you might
not perceyv the Antichristian wickednes of theyr estate. Markethe

                  arry away the matter: not onely passing over the impyetyes
aforesayd and such like wherewith theyr book and practise aboundeth:
but in those things also which he mentioneth, vnder
the colour of this, that he sayth theyr book requireth men
of vnblameable life, and aptnes to teach, to be examined, and
admitted in a solemne assembly, would cover and hide theyr receyving
and retayning of men in the Ministery, which be of
most wicked and shameles life, others also that are no more
able to preach thenPsal. 115 5. vvith zach. 11. 17. Idols, which have a mouth and speak

can bring with them a dish of apples well fild with gold

commonly in theyr examination of the best learned, it is but
to know if he can aunswer a question or two in the Latin
toungue: and to see for such and the rest theyr letters testimoniall,
which it may be are from some that are as ignorant and
prophane as any of themselves. Is this to follow the1 Tim. 3. 10. rule
of the Apostles, Let them first be proved, then let them minister,

Or is it like to theAct. 6. 3 5. 1 Tim. 3. cap. vvith Tit. 1. 5—9. diligent search and consideration enioyned
by the Apostles and practised by the Church in the choyse
of the Deacons? H

                   ād Elders?
               But theyr Law (he saith) commaundeth that none
should be admitted to the office but in a solemne assembly, and
that liberty should be graunted to any in Congregation to
obiect vvhatsoever iust impediment they knovv against
him: Well, yet let him tell vs, what the people of

Norwich when they stād gazing vpō the Prelate ād his Archdeacō
at his giving Orders, what the conversation is of those
that be ordered, wherof one comes out of Sufolk, another out
of Lincolneshire, a third from Cambridge, another from Oxford,
others from Surrey, Kēt etc. whom perhaps they never
saw nor heard of afore, and it may be never after? Let him also
tell vs if the Prelates do not oftē tymes make priests in theyr
private chappels, yea ād in theyr closets too: ād whether these
be not Priests by the Law, aswell as the rest among them?
Now then where is the solemne assembly ād Congregation he
speaketh of: vnles he vnderstand it of the Prelates officers ād
servitors, who commonly are as wicked and irreligious as
theyr Lord and Master? Doth Mr H. write this as of syncerity,
as of God, in the sight of God, as he professed in the
entrance of his letter? Or doth he not rather go about to deceyv
the Reader and darken the truth, when thus colourably
he would beare vs in hand that the Law of God, which prescribeth
that the Church and flock should approve and choose their
own Minister, is observed among them? And yet further let
                     •
                  
him aunswer, whether they be not commonly made Priests
at theyr own suite, without any people to attend vpon, much
lesse to approve and choose them? Yea, whether often it be not
so, as the people where they are to minister never saw them
before, till they come vpon them with the Patrones presentation
and the Prelates induction to the benifice? Which when
they bring, the people are most that can do least, even iust nothing
at all: For priests they must and will be there, whether
the people will or not. Is this to have the Churches
choyse and approbation? Is this to follow the Law of GOD
and to have that in substance which the word prescribeth: as
here Mr H. pretendeth they have?
               But above all, it is most straunge that he would perswade vs
theyr law requireth theyr Ministers to be ordeyned by imposition
of hands of the Eldership: when all the world knoweth
that they imprison, banish, and persecute to death the
poore Christians in the Land which follow that rule of God
in theyr iudgment and practise. Yea and Mr H. himselfSection, 10.
afterward in this letter confesseth, both that the power of ordination
among them is by law committed to the Prelates, and
that by the Law of God the Prelates are not capable of it. How
then possibly can this be true which here he saith, that theyr
Law requireth ordination to be done by imposition of the hāds
of the Eldership, as the law of God doth? These must needs be

contradictory the one to the other. But to proceed, if it were
so as here he pretendeth, why then hath he with the rest of the
forward preachers and people so often sued to the Parliament
for an Eldership (consisting of Pastors, Teachers, and Elders)
in every Church, if already they enioy it? Do they sue
for that they have? that were a mockery. Or doth not the
Law expresly requier that
                  Book of ordering
                        •
                      Priests. Also theyr Canōs 
                  imposition of hāds among them
be done by a Lordbishop or his Suffragane with the Archdeacon
and other Priests present? And are these now of late come
to be an Eldership? How is it then that the Prelates and
theyr followers have heretoforeD. vvhitg last book. pag. 638. 639 written, that in the Apostles
tyme there were Elders in every Church, but now it ought
not so to be? And that the seekers of Reformation haveAdmon. to Parl. first and second treatise.
published, that not onely the office of Elders but theyr Name
also is out of this English Church vtterly removed, and that in
stead of them in every Church the Pope hath brought in and
they in England yet mainteyne the Lordship of one man over
many Churches, yea over sundry shires: Which Lordbishops
being not able (as the Elders) to execute theyr offices in theyr
own persons without substitutes, have therefore theyr vnder officers,
as Suffraganes, Chauncelors, Archdeacons, Officials,
Commissaryes, and such like. Also, that they with theyr Canons
and Courts are drawen out of the Popes shop, and take
vpon them which is most horrible the rule of GOds Church,
thrusting away most sacrilegiously that order which Christ hath
left in his Church and which the Primitive Church hath vsed,
yea robbing the Church of lavvfull Pastors, Elders, and Deacons.
Thus and much more have themselves written heretofore.
Yet see how now Mr H. would perswade vs they have
the Eldership prescribed in the word: And, that vvhereas there
is vvant of due execution of such things in theyr Church as the
Lavv of God commaundeth, that is the fault of the men, not
of the calling. As if the limmes of Antichrist were now become
the Eldership ordeyned by Christ? And the Archbishops,
Lordbishops, Archdeacons, with theyr other priests and Officers
whom the Apostles never knew, were to be accounted
those Elders whom the Apostles planted in the Primitive
Churches?
               Those Elders had aAct. 14. 23. Heb. 5 4 Tit. 1. 5. vvith Act. 6. 2. 3. 5 1. Tim. 4. 14. Num. 8. 9. 10. 2 Cor. 8. 19. lawfull calling of a true Church,

These Prelates and Priests (as hath ben proved) have an

vnlawfull calling in a false Church, to a false office never set
by Christ in his Church, which also they are bound to administer
according to theyr popish Canons, Articles, and Iniunctions:
besides that many of them have Lordship ouer
many Churches and sundry shires.
               Those Elders performed theyr office in theyr1 Thes. 5. 12. 13 14 Act. 20. 17. 28. Iam. 5. 14 1 Pet. 5. 1. 2. 3. Heb. 13. 7. 17. 24. own persons:
These Prelates and Priests have theyr substitutes, Vicars,
and vnder officers.
               Those Elders were in2 Cor. 6. 14. 15. 16. no office belonging to Antichrist:

which no Church of Antichrist (pretending to be Christs) can
be absolute and complete in all the Canonicall functions of
Antichrists ministery and government.
               Those Elders had offices which must1 Tim. 5. 17. 19. vvith 6. 13. 14. Ro. 1

end of the world: yea even then, when Antichrist in all the
partes offices and power of his Ministery and religion shalbe
consumed by the Gospell of IEsus Christ: These Prelates
and Priests have such offices as till they be abolished, all
the offices of Antichrists Hierarchy are not destroyed: Which
the2 Thes. 2. 3. 8. vvith. Rev. 14. 6. 7. 8. and 17. 1. and 18. 20. 21. and 19. Cap. vvith Ier. 51. 60—64. Scripture testifyeth shall come to passe by the Spirit
of the Lords mouth in the light and power of his Gospell.
               To coclude then, these Prelates and Priests are as vnlike
to those Elders, as darknes is to light, and the forgeryes
of Antichrist to the ordinances of IEsus Christ. Where
then is the imposition of hands of the Eldership which
Mr H. would make vs beleev theyr Ministers have? Or is
the want now among them not of the offices of Elders, but onely
of vpright Dealers therein, as here he would perswade?
Thus then you see that theyr Ministers having no other office
nor calling then the Law alloweth, have not at all the substance
of the office or calling of Ministers which the vvord prescribeth,
whatsoever colour he pretend to the contrary.
               And yet (I pray you) what hath he said more for the
maner of calling to theyr Priesthood, then may be alledged
for the popish priests? For the Popes pontificall (out of
which theyr book is drawen) requireth the same things at
the entrance to the priesthood, which Mr H. alledgeth theyr
book doth: As, that they be of vnblameable life, apt to teach,
examined, allowed, ordered in a solemne assembly, and such like.
Yet I trow Mr H. will not cōclude, that the popish priests
have therefore the substance eyther of a true office or of a true
calling to the Ministery. Or if he should, yet will the consequē
                  ce
never be proved eyther for those Priests or for theyr own.
               
                  
Neyther let any think it straunge, that theyr book and
pontificall should have some things that the Law of GOd
hath, and yet that this should nothing help them for having a
true calling to the Minist
                     •
                  ry. In the prophecy of Daniel we
read, thatDan. 5. 1. 2. 3. when king Be
                     •
                  shazar made a great feast to his
Princes, he commaunded that the golden and siluer vessels that
were taken out of the Temple of the Lords house at Ierusalem
should be brought, and the king and his Princes, his wines and
his concubynes drank therein. Now although they had there
the vessels of the Lords house and drank in them, yet was it
not therefore a feast of the Lord, but a feast of Babylon notwithstanding.
Even so it fareth with the Ministery and entrance
into it, vsed in England and among the Papists: Towching
which although theyr book and pontificall have taken
some things out of the scripture (as it were some of the Lords
vessels out of his Temple) yet inasmuch as they are applyed
by them to a false office, ordination, and ministration never
appoynted by Christ but invented by Antichrist (even as it
were in a Caldean banket), they do no more make theyr
Priesthood or calling vnto it to be the Ministery and calling
ordeyned by Christ, then those vessels taken out of the LOrds
house made that banquet of Babylon to be one of the Lords
of vvhich read Levit. 23. feasts. Likewise in the prophecy of Ezechiel we are taught
that albeit men set theyr thresholds by Gods thresholds ād their
posts by Gods posts (that is,E
                        ••
                     ch. 43. 8, theyr inventions by Gods ordinances)
yet it maketh them not therefore to be the house and
Temple of God and to have his true worship and ministery
among them: but as the Lord there testifyeth by his Prophet,
by this meanes they set a wall between God and themselues and
defile his holy Name with theyr abominations.
               
               This is the account the Lord maketh of the ioyning of
his ordinances with mans inventions: And what then will
it help the Priests of England or Rome, that theyr book and
Law requier some things that the word of God prescribeth,
seing they ioyne and apply them to a false ministery devised by
mā? It may in deed make the mist which through theyr delusions
they cast before the eyes of the people to be far the greater:
but it can no way iustify theyr standing or lessen theyr sinne.
Nay rather it doth increase it, because thus they prohaue
the word of God and defile his holy Name, and cause them to

                  rre that are led by them. And thus against themselves they

whereby they make ministers is taken out of the Popes pontificall:
that theyr ordering of Ministers is straunge from the word
of God: that theyr entrance is not by Christ but by a popish and
vnlavvfull vocation: that vvhen the Bishops have made them
Ministers, eyther they may tary in their Colledges and lead the
lives of loytering losels as long as they live, or els go abroad with

                  : they may be chosen and

approved by the people that they are to be set over: they may be rightly ordeyned
and as it vvere invested into theyr office.
               But your vvriting affirmeth they come in by the Bishops who are the limmes
of Antichrist, VVhatsoever is vnlavvfull in theyr callings, I vvill not go about
to mainteyne: Onely I vvill simply and plainely set dovvn vvhat hath moved
me to seek a calling from them, and vvhat persvvadeth me to think that the
calling I have receyved from them is not vvicked and vnlavvfull.
               First, being persvvaded in my conscience that the Lord had a true Church in this
Realme even at the beginning of her Maiestyes raigne, vvhich being assembled
out of all the parts of the Land in Parliament, did commit this authority to ordeyne
Ministers vnto the Bishops: and knovving out of the vvord of God that
euery true Church hath this povver and authority to ordeyne Ministers: I considered
vvith my self that though the Church offended in committin-this povver
and authority vnto them that by the Lavv of God vvere not capable of it, yet I
might vvithout sinne seek and take the Churches ordination at theyr hands: as
I may reverence and take the benefit of the Princes povver and authority vvhich
is of God, though it be committed vnto and exercised by men that by the Lavv of
God are not capable of it.
               Secondly, seing it is a thing not to be refused if a man entring into the ministery
might have the approbation of all and every one of the Ministers of the
Gospell in the land: it seemeth vnto me the approbation of that Bishop that is
also a Minister and preacher of the Gospell cannot be deemed to be meerly vnlavvfull.
               Thirdly, the authority of the Christian Magistrate (vvithout vvhose liking
and allovvance a Minister cannot be admitted to the Ministery in peace) comming
to the Bishop by Act of Parliament, I may more boldly come to him for
his approbation in regard of the Lavv: not looking so much vnto the Man, as

                     ••
                  garding vvith reuerence the povver of the Lavv and Christian Magistrate.
            
            
               ¶Aunswer to Section, 10.
               I Am sory to see Mr H. thus weary himself in seeking balme
for the healing of Babels sore, which cannot be cured.
We need not aske him (as here he deviseth an obiection with
himself) vvhich of them have such a calling as is prescribed by
the Lavv: For notwithstanding theyr manifold breaches even
of theyr own Law, yet we doubt not but ynow and to many
of them have the calling appoynted by Law: that is, are made.
Deacons and Priests by a Lordbishop, according to theyr
book taken out of the Popes pontificall, contrary to the Testament
of Christ: and are also presented by the Patrones, and
instituted by the Prelates, to cure of soules: whereof would
to God they made not marchandize, as theRev. 18. 11. 13. Scripture speaketh.
The oftener then that he mentioneth this, he doth
but so much the more cast doung in theyr own faces.
               Neyther is it to be past over (but well to be observed) that
himself here reckoneth vp and accounteth these three to be substantiall
parts of a true calling to the ministery, 1. A due examination
of gifts: 2. The choyse and approbation of the people
that they are to be set over: 3. A right ordination into theyr

office. These three he sayth are substantiall parts of a true calling:
Wherevpō it followeth, that none of theyr Ministers have
the substāce of a true calling, seyng they wāt these substātiall
parts thereof: as is provedIn the a
                        •
                     nsvver to Section, 6. 8. 9 before and afterward agayne, ād
as theyr own estate testifyeth agaynst them to theyr faces. Yea
Mr H himself vp his own words here importeth thus much,
that divers at least of their ministers wāt the substāce of a true
calling. Els (when he aunswereth to his own objection) why
saith he, Many Ministers in the Land have these substantiall
parts: ād sayth not, that all theyr Ministers have them? Many
he sayth, ād not all. Thus to vphold some of theyr Ministers
(if he could), he careth not to smite down others of them to the
ground: ād those also such, as have the same Ministery ād calling
with the rest, which is prescribed by Law. But compare
this with that which he wrote, and see what a fayre thred he
hath spun for himself. Al theyr Ministers have not the substāce of
a true calling: This he insinuateth here, ād in his own vnderstā
                  ding
of the substantiall parts set down by himself cannot deny
it if he would. Yet all theyr Ministers be made Priests or Deacons,
or both, by the Prelates, according to theyr book aforesayd:
This also he yeeldedSection. 9. before, neyther if he would can
deny it. The conclusion therefore must be this, that the Priests
and Deacons so made by the Prelates according to theyr book
(such as be all theyr Ministers) have not the substance of a
true calling to the Ministery. This you see followeth vpon his
own aunswers: Besides that we omit to speak of theyr presentations,
and of theyr inductions by the Prelates, which
the Law appoynteth as substantiall parts of theyr calling
when they take charge of soules. Onely marke here agayn his
contradictiō with himself, whiles he stribeth against the truth.
               Now to proceed, let him tell vs whom he meaneth here by
the learned and godly whose examination and approbation they
are to have, and on whose judgment they may safely rely in that
matter. If he meane the Archdeacon or other Priests that be
examiners for the Prelates (as theyr Law and vse is): how
will he prove that they are such as he sayth, that is, learne
                     •
                  
and godly? or that theyr examination and approbation was
ever appoynted by Christ, or is to be had as a substautiall part
of true calling to the Ministery? or finally, that any may safely
rely vpon theyr iudgment in this matter? But if he meane
(as doubtles he doth) the examinatiō and approbatiō of some
of the forward Preachers amōg them: himself knoweth, first
that the Law appoynteth it not: wherevpon will follow by
his own assertion that all the substātiall parts of a true calling

to the ministery are not prescribed by Law, which yetSection 9. before
he labored to prove. Secondly he is not ignorant, and theyr
constitution and practise showeth it, that although secretly (it
may be) some of them are tryed ād approved by such as here he
intēdeth, yet neyther is this generall, ād those also which have
this, have notwithstāding ād must have that other which law
binds vnto. Now if that after the Law be of Christ, why have
they the other? If it be not of Christ, why receyv they it at all,
or how is it true which he sayd (Section 9.) before, that their Law agreeth
with the Law of God, as towching the substance of a true
calling to the Ministery? Thirdly, are not these forward preachers
also (aswell as the other) Deacōs and Priests, so ordeyned
by the Prelates as aforesayd: ād therefore have a Ministery
never ordeyned by Christ, but brought in by Antichrist? And
what priviledg them have they herein more then the other? Or
how will it be proved for them, any more then for the other,
that thus standing their examination and allowance is an ordinance
of Christ, or substantiall part of true calling to the Ministery?
Or that any may safely rely themselves vpon theyr
judgment in this matter?
               For the next likewise, that is, the choyse ād approbatiō of the
people that they are to be set over: if he meane it generally of any
people whatsoever, whether Idolaters, Atheists, Papists, or
others standing subject to Antichrist, or such like: how will he
ever prove that such have this power and authority of Christ,
to choose the Ministers of his Gospell? Or if he meane it (as
needs he must if he speak to the purpose) of such people as by
the word of God be called ād separated from the world, ioyned
in covenāt ād fellowship of the Gospell, being true visible Churches
of Christ: then also how will it ever be proved that theyr
people in this theyr Church constitution (as now they stand in
confusion ād spirituall bōdage to Antichrists Ministery, worship,
ordināces, courts, and jurisdiction), are such people and
Churches, having the power ād liberty which Christ hath given
to his Church for trying ād chusing their own Ministers
according to the rules of his Testamēt? Is it possible that they
which stād in subjectiō to Antichrist, should also be the freemen
of Iesus Christ? Or that the priviledges of Christs Church
should belong vnto and be found in the Synagogues of Antichrist?
2 Cor. 6. 14. 15. 16. Christ ād Belial cānot agree together. 2. But yet further
what choyse ād allowāce is it that they pretend to have of
the people? Is it not a secret gathering of the cōsēt of some few
in the towne or parish? And cā this interest them to the charge
of the soules of the whole towne or parish, whē most of them

neyther give theyr consent nor have it asked. But it may be
he will say, they dare not trust any herein but some few, or
that they account them not to be godly mynded. Yet dare they
Minister the Sacraments to them all, and receyv them and
theyr seed as members of the Church, and take maintenance
from them as from the Church. Is this to walk vprightly
before the Lord, and to go with an even foot to the truth of the
Gospell, 3. But be it that all the people gave theyr consent:
yet whom and whereto do they chuse? Chuse they not one that
eyther is already, or before he can minister to them must be
made, Deacon or Priest or both by a Lordbishop? who also
must in that Ministery administer to them theyr holy things
according to theyr book of Common prayer and other theyr
Canons and constitutions? Now that such a choyse and approbation
is a substantiall part of true calling, who ever can
perswade or be perswaded? 4. Or doth theyr Law appoynt
and allow this choyse and approbation of the people for lawfull
and sufficient? Who is it that knoweth not the contrary?
For whether it be had, or not, the Law requireth and they
must have theyr ministery from the Prelates, and when they
take cure of soules, the Patrones presentation, and the Prelates
induction into the benefice. And this onely is that which
standeth for sufficient in theyr▪ Law and constitution. Hence
therefore agayn appeareth even by his own assertion (contrary
to that whichSection, 9. before he would have proved) that the
Lavv appoynteth not the substance of a true calling to the Ministery,
neyther agreeth vvith the Lavv▪ of God therein: forasmuch
as not onely it appoynteth not the peoples choyse
(whichAct. 6. 2 3. 5. and 14. 23. and 1. 15. 23. 26. 2 Cor. 8. 19. Ezech. 33. 2. Num. 8. 9. 1 Cor. 16. 3. Gods word requireth) but in stead thereof enioyneth
presentatiō by a Patrone (be he Papist, Atheist, or whatsoever)
and induction by a Lordbishop: which God never
commaunded, but was and is retayned from the Popes Canons,
custome, and pontificall. 5. Moreover, if the peoples
choyse and approbation be the true choyse and calling (as here
he graunteth): why then do they take that other of the Patrones
and Prelates, never appoynted by Christ, but forged
by Antichrist? Is it because they would have all men know,
that in theyr constitution2 Thes. 2. 3. 4. the man of sinne is exalted above
God and his holy ordinances? Or because they would have
it seen of all, that theyEzech. 43. 8. set theyr thresholds by Gods thresholds,
that they may defile his Name? Will they never learne,
that2. Cor. 6. 14. 15. 16. Christ and Antichrist, light and darknes, cannot
have fellowship and concord together? To end this poynt

then, seing the peoples choyse (by his own confession) is a substantiall
part of true calling to the Ministery (and this is to
be vnderstood of such people onely as be the true visible Churches
of Christ, and theyr people in theyr estate can not by the
word of God be accounted such, but in deed to stand in spiritiall
slavery to Antichrist) it is evident they neyther have, nor
as they stand can have, the substance of a true calling to the Ministery
of the Gospell of Christ.
               
               Towching the last substantiall part he assigneth, which is
a right ordination into theyr office: if he meane of that which
is had from the Prelates (which onely the Law appoynteth)
how will he prove it to be a substantiall part of true calling to
the Ministery? Specially, it being no ordinance of Christ but
part of Antichrists apostasy, as hath ben showedSec 
                        〈◊〉
                      6. 8. 9. before: and
seing also the power of ordination is such as by the Law of
God the Prelates are not capable thereof: as him self here
graunteth and affirmeth in playne words. If he meane of some
other besides to be had among them (not from the Prelates,
but) from some of theyr forward Preachers: then first
he is to mynd that here agayn he crosseth himself, beause making
this a substantiall part of true calling, and the Law not
appoynting it (as it doth not), it followes herevpon that the
Law prescribeth not the substance of a true calling to the Ministery:
Which before he affirmed. 2. Agayn, if this be so, what
becometh of all the Ministers in the Land that have not this
other ordination, but that onely of the Prelates and Priests
present as the Law appoynteth, neyther have the choyse of
the people, nor examination and allowance of the Learned ād
godly he speaketh of? All such by his own account have not
the substance of a true calling: and therefore cannot be true
Ministers: for these three he saith are substantiall parts thereof.
Now in the Land there be an hundred of these for one of
the other. Is not theyr Ministery (think you) well holye vp
by this meanes? 3. Nay and what one of them all that pretend
to have this other, dare stand forth before theyr LOrds
the Prelates, and avow
                     •
                  h theyr Ministery by vertue thereof?
When they come before them, they can show theyr letters of
Orders receyved from them: howsoever before theyr followers
(to mislead them) they colour the matter otherwise.
4. Furthermore, have not these forward Preachers themselves
receyved theyr Ministery from the Prelates and retayne
it still vnto this day? How then can a right ordination possibly
be had from such? Who canIob. 14. 4 bring a cleane thing out

of filthynes? Is it
                     
                        〈…〉
                      7. 16. 
                        〈…〉
                      14. 25. 10. vvith 2 Thes. 2. 3. possible that a lawfull ordination
should be had from the Ministers and apostasy of Antichrist?
Eyther is this vtterly to leave ād forsake (which weEsa. 52. 11. Rev. 18. 4. 2 Cor. 6. 17. ought)
or is it not rather still to cleave vnto and retayne (which vnder
Rev. 14. 9. 10. 11. and 17. 1. and 18. 4. vvith 2. Thes. 2. 10. 11. 12. payne of damnation we may not) the Ministery
and abominations of Antichrist that sonne of perdition?
               It remayneth then, that theyr calling to the Ministery being
examined by these particulars, which Mr H. himself hath
here assigned to be substātiall parts of a true calling: they neyther
have, neyther whiles they thus stand, cā have, a true calling to
the Ministery of the Gospell. Thus well hath he reasoned for
theyr calling, and aunswered the obiectiō framed by himself.
               Now in his writing there followeth another obiection, with
his aunswer therevnto: Whereyn he pleadeth agayn with as
yll successe as before. The obiection is this, that it is affirmed
they come in by the Bishops, who are the limmes of Antichrist.
The obiection suerly is of waight, and had need be soundly
aunswered. For if the Prelates be the limmes of Antichrist, and
they also come into theyr Ministery by them, it cānot be avoyded
but theyr Ministery (by vertue whereof they deale with the
holy things of God, and work vpon mens consciences) is Antichristian:
ād therefore not to be receyved or ioyned vnto: Which
is the thing that was to be proved. What is it then that he
saith herevnto? Doth he deny that the Prelates be limmes of
Antichrist, and prove the contrary by the Scripture? No in
deed: but he leaveth them as he found them, the limmes of Antichrist:
and seemeth so astonyed partly at the truth on the one
hand, partly with the vnlawfulnes of theyr office on the other
as notwithstanding they are thus deeply charged, yet he denyes
not the charge but rather yeelds vnto it, saying, that whatsoever
is vnlawfull in theyr callings he will not go about to mainteyne:
Yea, that by Law of God they are not capable of that
which is committed vnto them by the Parliament. Where besides
that he leaveth them without defence against so waighty
an accusation, he doth himself also charge them with breach of
Gods Law and vnlawfulnes in theyr callings: and so yeelds
vs the cause. The Prelates and his fellow Priests will not
thank him for this. And sure if any way it could have ben done,
now was it altogether needfull to have convinced by evidence
of Scripture, both that the Prelates are not the limmes
of Antichrist, and that theyr offices and callings are lawfull.
But the truth is mighty, and will prevayle against all that
withstand it, 
                     ••
                  ll they, will they.
               
                  
Well then, leaving thus the Prelates to be limmes of Antichrist,
what saith he to the other, which is, that the Ministers of the
land come into theyr Ministery by the Prelates? Doth he deny
this? No, but graunteth it also, as needs he must. For such is
theyr constitution and practise: Besides that if any standing
Ministers of these assemblyes should enter otherwise, they
could not but be intruders and hypocrites. Intruders, because
they should thrust themselves into theyr Ministery eyther
by no calling, or by other then is receyved and allowed in theyr
Church: Hypocrites, because ministring in and to these assemblyes
they should seem vnto men to do it by vertue of such calling
as is appoynted by Law of theyr Church, when in deed
it were otherwise. It cannot be denyed then but they do and
must come in by the Prelates, who are limmes of Antichrist.
Now what followeth herevpon, let themselves and all that
partake with them well consider and repent, whilesHeb. 3. 7. &c. it is
called To day.
               But saith Mr H. nothing in this poynt at all? Yes: though
he leave the Prelates and other Priests to shift for themselves
yet for himself he takes a litle paynes: saying, he will simply ād
playnely set down what moved him to seek a calling from the
Prelates, and what perswadeth him to think the calling he receyved
from them is not vvicked and vnlavvfull. Well: but what
if the other Ministers of the Land (who take themselves to
have as a good a calling as he, yet) were not moved neyther
are perswaded therevnto by these reasons wherevpon he rest
                     •
                  th?
what now will he, and what must we account of theyr
Ministery by this reckoning? Agayn, what if the reasons he
alledgeth for himself be not of waight in this case so to move
and perswade eyther him or any other? How then will he
have vs esteem of his calling and Ministery? Let vs therefore
examine his reasons. But first mark that he saith, he sought a
calling from the Prelates and receyved it. He was not thē sought
spyed out, and called by a Church (as is theHeb. 5. 4. vvith Act. 6. 2. 3. 5. and 14. 23. Ezech 33. 2. 2 Cor. 8. 19. ordinance of
Christ) but himself, he saith, sought to be called by the Prelates,
and receyved his calling from them. Which maner of calling seing
it is such as God never ordeined, it therefore neither might
be receyved of him, neyther may be ioyned vnto by any other.
But let vs see what moved him herevnto.
               FIrst (saith Mr H.) being persvvaded in my conscience that the Lord had a true
Church in this Realme even at the beginning of her Maiestyes raigne, vvhich
being assembled out of all parts of the Land in Parliament did commit this
authority to ordeyne Ministers vnto the Bishops: and knovving out of the
vvord of GOD that every true Church hath this povver and authority to ordeyne

Ministers: I considered vvith my self, that though the Church offended in committing
this povver vnto them that by the Lavv of God vvere not capable of it,
yet I might vvithout sinne seek and take the Churches ordination at theyr hands:
as I may reverence and take the benefit of the Princes povver ād authority vvhich
is of God, though it be committed vnto and exercised by men that by the Lavv
of God are not capable of it.
               THis is Mr H. his first and chief reason. Wherein (as also
in the rest following) let this be observed generally, that
although in theSection, 1. Pag. 1. beginning of his letter he promised nothing
should be brought to perswade, but the word of GOd,
yet now in stead thereof he setteth before vs the perswasions
of his conscience (Which is a thing very vsuall among them):
as if they were eyther divine oracles, or as foroible to perswade
as they. Yea, here he seemeth to prefer his perswasions before
Gods oracles: (Which if he had not done, I would
not thus have noted it). For confessing on the one hand, that
he knoweth out of the word of God that every true Church hath
this power and authority to ordeyne Ministers (and consequently
that it is Gods ordinance to have it in and from a true
Church, as he hath appoynted): yet on the other hand he
professeth, that the Parliament committing this power vnto
such as by the Law of God are not capable of it, to wit, to the
Prelates (and so offending therein), he notwithstanding vpon
his perswasion sought and took ordination from the Prelates
hands. Now what was this els, but to regard his own perswasion
more then the word of God? Specially, when he ioyneth
withall, that he thought he might so do without sinne.
Sure, this is straunge divinity. The Scripture teacheth, that
we1 Tim. 5 22. 
                  may not be partakers of other mens sinnes: And, that1 Ioh. 3. 4.
                  the transgression of Gods Law is sinne. He notwithstanding
thought that he might partake with others in the breach of
Gods ordinance, and yet not sinne. I hope he is otherwise
mynded synce, and so will be every day more and more. In
the meane tyme it is cleare, that though these very things
which he would seem to rest vpon were all graunted him, yet
they make altogether agaynst him: and so this first reason of
his is found in this case to be of no waight. Yet before we proceed
to the rest, it will not be amisse for more evidence of the
truth more fully to consider the particulars here set down.
               1 And first where he sayth he is perswaded the Lord had a
true Church in this Realme at the beginning of her Majestyes
raigne &c. it would be knowen whether he speak of invisible
or of a visible Church of God. If he speak of invisible, he
speaketh not to the poynt in question: besides that they could
not be counted an invisible Church, and yet be knowen to be

assembled together in Parliament. If he speak of a visible
Church (as he must if he will speak to the purpose, and as it
seemeth he meaneth because he sayth they were then assembled
together) then how doth he prove this to be so? In deed we
deny not but God had his flock and Church even a true visible
Church in this Land at the beginning of her Majestyes
raigne: For we have heard and read that in Queen Maryes
dayes there was here a Congregation of faythfull people separated
from the rest of the Land and gathered into fellowship
together to serve the LORD according to his word, and
to keep themselves pure from the abominations of Antichrist:
That this Congregation also chuse them Ministers,
Elders, and Deacons, to instruct guyde and serve them in the
Lord: and that they had theyr holy meetings, and showed notable
testimonyes of their faith and love. So long then as they
kept communiō in this way, we deny not but they were a true
visible Church: though (it may be) in some defects through
want of further light and instruction. The like we think also
of our countreymen that were then at Frankford, Geneva,
and other where beyond seas. But when Queen Mary dyed,
and Queen Elizabeth (whom God long preserve) came to the
Crown, then the Masse and some other superstitions of popery
being abolished, agaynst which these Congregations had
witnessed the truth in much affliction, they herevpon dissolved,
and the severall members scattered themselves to theyr
parishes here and there throughout the Land: commingling
themselves in confusion with the rest of the land that were Idolaters
and repented not: and submitting theyr soules to the
Prelates and to the Ministery receyved from and executed
vnder them: as also to theyr courts, canons, excommunications,
and other Antichristian jurisdiction retayned in the
Land: And so have continued in apostasy from the way of
Christ vnto this day. Now these Congregations being thus
dissolved, and the members there of thus standing: they were
not now any lōger true visible Churches in the order of Christ,
but fallen into confusion with the world and into spirituall
bondage to the Prelates and other Clergy the limmes of Antichrist.
So as from hence for the poynt in hand Mr H. can
derive no help for himself.
               But be it that they had remayned still visible Churches in
true constitution, and had assembled together and committed
this authority of ordination to the Prelates: Yet this being not
warrantable by the word of God, it had bound no mans conscience,

neyther ben sufficient warrant for any to partake in
theyr sinnes. For the sinfull actions of the Church do not bynd
or warrant vs any more, then the sinfull actions of the world:
Neyther can all Churches or Nations vnder heavē make that
lawfull, which God by his word maketh vnlawfull. Though
Exod. 32 cap. all the people of Israel (being the true Church of God) enjoyne
and commit vnto Aaron to make a molten calfe to go before
them: Yet was not Aaron therefore bound or warranted
therevnto, but sinned in so doing: as they also did that tooke
part thereyn. Agayne (for example sake) let vs suppose that
which in deed was not, to wit, that Moses and Aaron and all
that were famous in the Congregatiō, yea that the whole Cō
                  gregation
of Israel (being the true Church) should have committed
to Corah, Dathan, Abiram, ād theyr company, power
to take censers and burne incense thereyn before the LOrd:
Num. 16 cap. yet they being not capable of that power by the Law
of GOD, neyther might have taken it, neyther might any
other have communicated with them thereyn: but all that
would not perish in theyr sinne should have departed from
them and theyr tents. When2 King. 16.

at that tyme were in Iudah should have consented thereyn,
and committed power to Vryah and the other Priests to offer
vpon it burnt offrings and peace offrings, ād that to no other
but the true God): Yet should not

King of Israeel toke counsell with his Princes and
people, and made Priests of the lawest of the people which
were not of the sonnes of Levi (ād therefore not capable of the
Priests office) though the ten tribes, having ben til this tyme
the Church and people of God, consented therevnto: Yet did
not this therefore bynd or warrāt any of them eyther to receyv
that office, or to joyne vnto them in the worship of God. To
come nearer our own dayes, let vs suppose that which himself
will think is as likely if not more thē that he alledgeth, to wi
                     •
                  ,
that in this Land was a true Church at the end of King Edwards
dayes, vvhich being assembled out of all parts of the Lād
in Parliament in the beginning of Q: Maryes raigne, did commit
this povver ād authority of ordination to the Prelates (vvhereof
by the Lavv of God they vvere not capable): Yet will not
Mr H. say, but it was vnlawfull notwithstanding for any to
seek or receyve ordination from then. Otherwise what impiety
is there that by this meanes might not be made at least some

what tolerable: as may appeare by the examples and instāces
before mentioned and infinite other that might be alledged?
The same Parliament whereof he speaketh, authorising the
book of common prayer did thereyn (he knoweth) commit power
and authority vnto weomē in cases of necessity to baptize
(whereof by the Law of God they are altogether vncapable):1 Cor. 14 34 35. 1 Ti. 2. 12. compared vvith Eph. 4. 11. 12. and Mat. 28. 18. 19.
will he therefore say, it is lawfull eyther for women to administer
Baptisme, or for any to yeeld their children to be baptized
of them: because they may reverence and take benefit of the
Princes povver ād authority vvhich is of God, though it be committed
vnto and exercised by such as by the Lavv of God are not
capable of it? Many mo particulars might be alledged of like
nature both out of the Scriptures and Lawes of this and
other Nations: but for the matter in hand the former allegations
may suffice.
               2. Next where Mr H. sayth, that at the beginning of her
Maiestyes raigne the Parliament committed this authority to ordeyne
Ministers to the Bishops: he mistaketh the matter, if he
think that then first they receyved it. For the authority of ordination
was not then first committed vnto the Prelates, but
continued to them from former tymes: ād ratifyed vnto them
both at that tyme and afterward agayne in the eyght yeare of
her Highnes raigne, as may appeare by theAnno. 1. Eliz. cap. 1. and 8. Eliz. cap. 1. statu
                     •
                  es then
enacted. Which it seemeth the Prelates and Priests of the Lād
desired, because theyr offices and authority being called into
question, they were not able to bring warrant for them out of
the Law of God, and therefore got what strength they could
from the Law of Man. The truth then is, that not at the beginning
of her Majestyes raigne, but hundreds of yeares before
her Majesty was borne, the Prelates had this power of ordination
in theyr hands as much as now they have. For who
knoweth not that both their offices and callings and this their
authority of ordination is part of the2 Thes. 2 3. Rev. 9. 1. 2 3. apostasy of the Man
of sinne? even part of thoseRev. 17. 4. 5. and 18. 3. 
                  abominatiōs wherewith the golden
cup of the whore of Babylon is full, and wherewith she
hath long syn
                     •
                  e made drunken the nations of the earth, and
this of England among the rest? Many of which abominations
we confesse have ben swept out of this Land both in the
tyme of King Henry the eyght, and of King Edward the sixt,
ād of Elizabeth our dread Soveraigne: For which we prayse
God. Yet notwithstāding (to speak as the truth is) many also
of those abominatiōs of Babylō
                   are remayning in the Lād, from
which it was never purged ūto this day: Of which sort are the

offices, callings, administration, and maintenance, both of the
Prelacy and other clergy yet retayned in the Land, from the
hyest Prelate to the lowest Priest, together with theyr
book worship, canons, compulsion and confusion of all
sorts of people whatsoever to be members of theyr Church
and such like which were long to relate in particular.
               So then if Mr H. would have simply and plainely showed
vnto vs the originall of this power and authority in the Prelates,
he should have led vs, not to the beginning of her Maiestyes
raigne (as if it had then begun) but to the apostasy of
the man of sinne: from whence it first sprang and spred abroad
into this and other Nations of the earth, many ages before
her Highnes raigne or birth. Neyther hath it hitherto ben abolished
out of this land, as it ought: but being found here
at the beginning of her Maiestyes raigne, was left remayning
still, ād is not suppressed but retayned evē vnto this day. Wherevpō
is come to passe, that the Prelates ād Priests retayning
still theyr calling and authority, have by the iust iudgment of
God showed themselves to be nothing behind theNum. 33. 55. Iosua 23. 13. vvith Iudg. 1. cap, and 3. 4. Cananites,
Hivites, Iebusites, and other inhabitants of the Nations
whom God commaunded Israel to drive out before them, ād
they notwithstanding let them still remayne among them:
that is, they are become pricks in our eyes and thornes in
our sides, vexing all such as feare God in the Land: and it is
to be feared (if Gods mercy be not the greater) will be a snare
and destruction to the Land, as already they are to the soules
and consciences of the people therein.
               The Lord stir vp the royall heart of her Maiesty, that
she may discerne theyr iniquity and abolish theyr offices and
callings out of the Land, and make them desolate and naked,
eating theyr flesh, even theyr revennewes and poffessions, by
converting them to her own civill vses and the weale publik
of the Land. Thesame God, the King of Kings, work it also
in the hearts of the other Princes and Magistrates of the
world, that they may do likewise within theyr Dominions:
that so the most wicked Hierarchy and religion of Antichrist
may be vtterly consumed from of the earth, and the Gospell
of Iesus Christ may have free passage ād be glorifyed among
all nations to the ends of the world: as the Scripture hath
said shall come to passe. Rev. 17. 16. and 18. 20. 21. and 14. 6. 7.
8. and 21. 15. 24. 26. with 2 Thes. 2. 8. and 3. 1. Mat. 24. 14.
               3 Thirdly where Mr H. saith, he knew out of the word
of God that every true Church of GOD hath the power and

authority to ordeyne Ministers, ād that the Prelates by the Lavv
of God are not capable of it, and yet that he sought and took ordination
of the Prelates: this is so far from being any defence
vnto him in this case, as it doth rather manifest his sinne to be
the greater and far more grievous: inasmuch as hereby it seemeth
he took ordination of the Prelates, against the knowledg
which he had out of the word of God to the contrary.
               4. Fourthly let it be observed, that here he saith the Parliament
offended in committing the povver and authority
of ordination to the Prelates, that by the Law of God are not capable
of it: and yet before he affirmed, that theyr Law agreeth
with the Law of GOD as towching the substance of a true
calling to the Ministery, of which he made right ordination
to be a part. Thus he both contradicteth himself, and
agayn yeeldeth the cause. For if they offended against the Law
of God in committing this power to the Prelates (as he directly
affirmeth) and there is no other Ministery had and all
                     ••
                  ed
in the Land but from the Prelates (as there is not):
hence it must needs follow, that theyr calling and Ministery is
vnlawfull, and neyther to be receyved nor joyned vnto.
               5. Fiftly, where he calleth the ordination taken from the
Prelates, the Churches ordination receyved at their hands: and
yet before sayd, the Church hath power to ordeyne, but the Prelates
by the Law of God are not capable of it: here agayne he
forgetteth and contradicteth himself.
               6. Finally, it may be observed that in the shutting vp
of this reason he speaketh of the Princes power and authority
committed to men that by the Law of God are not capable of it,
when as before in the former part of the reason he had spoken
of the Churches power and authority committed to such as by
the Law of God are not capable of it. Thus he keepeth not to
the poynt in question: but speaking of ordination of Ministers,
one while he caryeth vs to the Churches power and authority
committed to men not capable thereof, another while
to the Princes power, so likewise committed: As if the power
and authority of Princes and of the Church were all one ād not
distinct in the ordinance and appoyntment of God: or as if
whatsoever may be done in the one, were also to be admitted
in the other. What straunge consequences would follow herevpon,
let himself consider. And hitherto of the insufficiency of
his first reason. Now let vs see if there be any more wayght in
his second: which is as followeth.
               SEcondly (sayth Mr H.) seyng it is not to be refused, if a man entring into the
Ministery might have the approbation of all and every one of the Ministers of

the Gospell in the land: it seemeth vnto me the approbation of that Bishop that
is also a Minister and preacher of the Gospell cannot be deemed to be meerly
vnlavvfull.
               1. BVt what if the Bishops and Ministers he speaketh of be
not the Bishops and Ministers of Christ, but of Antichrist?
not in a true, but in a false Ministery? not according
to Christs Gospell, but Antichrists apostasy? not servants of
Iesus Christ the onely LOrd and head of his Church, but
Lords themselves over the Ministers ād people vnder them?
Will it not then seem to Mr H. that the ordination receyved
from them cannot otherwise be deemed but meerly vnlawfull?
But such have they ben proved to be both in this andRefucation of Mr Gyfford, printed, 1591. Discovery of the false Church, 1590. Conferenes betvveen certayn Preachers and prisoners. Confession of our faith, &c. other
writings heretofore: to which it shall suffice to refer you and
him towching this matter. Or if for ani preiudice against vs he
will not heare this of vs, let him yet heare and consider what
themselves have written ād professed heretofore in this behalf.
And let the controversy in this poynt be debated between
him and Mr Travers, Mr Cartwright, Mr Fenner,
Mr Chaderton, and all other that have sought Reformation.
               Mr Travers in hisDefence of eccles. discipl. pag. 88. 89. 90. 91. book against D. Bridges proveth
by divers good and sufficient reasons, that theyr Bishops are
neyther Pastors nor Teachers. And what ordinari Ministery of
the Gospell then do they execute? As for extraordinary, the
Prelates were not knowen, when they were in the world: besides
that they are as vnlike them as darknes is to light.
               
                  Mr Cartwright, striking at the chief and strength of theyr
Ministery, that is, at the Archbishops and Archdeacons, vnder
whom the other Bishops and Ministers execute theyr offices,
proveth that
                  T C▪ first reply. pag. 8. and 88. theyr functions are not in the vvord of God, but
of the earth, nevv devised ministeryes, and such as cā do no good
Yea that the Archbishops office is the neck of the popish Hierarchy,
come out of the bottomles pit of hell.
               
                  Mr Fenner hath
                  Defence of godly Minist. against Bridges slaunders. Pag. 111. 
                  published, that if St Paul vvere novv
in England, and no greater man then he vvas made by Christ,
he might not be equall vvith these Bishops: For they are spirituall
Lords, he vvas never so: they might send for him by a pursevant,
lay him in the Counter or commaund him to the Fleet, so
could not Paul do the least Minister of the Gospell. Agayn he
                  In the same book. pag. 123. 
                  saith, speaking of theyr offices, Our kind of Bishops, the
Commissaryes, the Archdeacons and such like, we account them
no natural members of the body of Christs Church because they

are of humane addition, not borne with her, nor growen vp with
her from the cradle.
               
                  Mr Chaderton
                  Sermon on Rom. 1
                        •
                     . pag. 34. 
                  writeth that the callings of Archbishops,
Bishops, Archdeacons, Deacons, Chauncelors,
and all such be rather members and parts of the vvhore ād strumpet
of Rome, then of the pure virgin and spouse of the immaculate
Lamb. And that they have no title nor interest in the
Church as publik members, but by the length of theyr vnlavvfull
svvords keep out lavvfull members of the body.
               
                  Finally, all the seekers of Reformation have in
                  Admon. to Parlia. 2. treatise. Sect. 14. 18. 20. 
                  the
Admonition to the Parliament professed, that the Names
and offices of Archbishops, Archdeacons, Lordbishops, &c.
are together vvith theyr government dravven out of the Popes
shop, Antichristian, divelish, and contrary to the Scriptures:
That the Parsons, Vicars, Parish priests, Stypendaryes
&c. be birds of the same fether: And in a word (as hath ben
noted before) that they have an Antichristian Hierarchy and
popish ordering of Ministers straunge from the vvord of God
and the vse of all vvell reformed Churches in the vvorld.
               Thus have they thought, and thus have they publisshed
heretofore. Let Mr H. therefore dispute the controversy
with them. And if he or any other cannot with pacyence
heare the truth of vs, let them yet be content to heare and
take it in good part at the hands of these men of whom they
have no such prejudice. And then see whether it have or can
have so much as any colour of truth; that the Prelates should
be Ministers of the Gospell: or that ordination may be receyved
from them, who are not members (much lesse officers)
of the body of Christs Church: these men themselves
beyng witnesses. (Not to speak here of the testimony of former
tymes: For which see theAct. and Monum. edit. 4. Pag. 150. 468. 562. 563. 639. hystoryes of Iohn Wickleff, William
Swinderby, the Lord Cobham, Iohn Claydon etc.)
               2. Secondly, let it herevpon agayne be noted, how
wavering and vnstable these men are in all theyr wayes: as if
IEsus Christ were Yea and Nay, and notHeb. 13. 8. vvith 2 Cor. 1. 19. 20 one and the
same yesterday, to day, and for ever. Heretofore theyIn theyr treatises before alledged.
published that the Prelates vvere not Pastors not Teachers, nor
members of the body of CHRISTS CHVRCH: but that
theyr offices callings and government vvere Antichristian,
divelish, and contrary to the Scriptures. But now behold,
they account the PRELATES to be MINISTERS of the
GOSPELL. Is it not piteous to see them thus halt between
two opinions: and to vse such lightnes in the matmatters

of God, as that theyr word should thus be Yea and
Nay, and themselves like reeds shaken with every wynd and
clouds caryed about with every tempest? Let them take heed
least whiles thus they dally with the Lord, he take them in
theyr own crafty
                     •
                  es and bring vpon them that which is2 Tim. 3. 13.
written, The evill men and deceyvers shall wax worse and worse,
deceyving and being deceyved.
               
               3. Thirdly, see here agayn how they take for graunted
that which they should prove: to wete, that the Prelates are
Ministers of the Gospell. For this is the poynt in controversy:
they being charged not onely not to be such, but to be limmes
of Antichrist, standing in
                  2 Thes. 2 3. 4. 
                  apostasy from the way and Gospell
of Christ: yea adversaryes against and exalted above the Lord
and his holy ordinances.
               4. Fourthly, if they were true Ministers, yet it were an
endles work (and without all rule or example in the Scripture)
for a man entring into the Ministery to seek the approbation
of all and every one of the Ministers of an whole land. And
yet if this were to be had, it would make the more against
Mr H. who would onely seek for the approbation of some one
(as here he reasonath) d passe by all the rest of the Land, who
notwithstāding by this meanes should have as much interest
therein as the other.
               5 Lastly, it is to be mynded here, how he turneth away
from the question and matter in hand: telling vs of approbation,
when he should speak of ordination. 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  
                     •
                  rdination
cary with it also an approbation of partly 
                     〈…〉
                  ,
yet every approbation is not ordination: as Mr H. 
                     〈…〉
                  
very well. And hitherto of his second 
                     〈…〉
                  
of it. Now followeth his third and last: 
                     〈…〉
                  
there be any more strength then in the former. The 
                     〈…〉
                  
fare these:
               Thirdly (saith Mr. H.) the authority of the Christian Magistrate (vvithout
vvhose liking and allovva
                     •
                  ce a Minister cannot be admitted to the 
                     〈◊〉
                  
in peace) coming to the Bishop by Act of Parliament, I may more boldly come
to him for his approbation in regard of the Lavv: not looking so much vnto
the Man, as regarding vvith reverence the povver of the Lavv and Christian
Magistrate.
               THis is Mr H. his third and last reason (as also the last
words of his letter that came to my hands): For aunswer
whereof let it be remembred, how before in his first reason
he confessed (as the truth is) that the P
                        ••
                     lates by the Lavv

of God are not capable of this povver and authority to ordeyn
Ministers, vvhich is committed vnto them by Act of Parliament:
Yet notwithstanding here he saith, that in regard of the Lavv
and Christian Magistrate he may more boldly come to the Prelates
for it. As if the authority of Man could make that lawfull,
which God hath made vnlawfull. What els is this, but
to advaunce Mans Law above Gods, and to exalt flesh and
blood above the Lord himself: who is God over al blessed for
ever, Amen. Straunge doubtles is that Ministery and fearfull
is that standing, which cannot otherwise be vpholden
then by making God (by whom Princes raigne) to stoupe
vnto Man, whose breath is in his nostrils. The Prophets,
Apostles, and Christ himself have taught vs otherwise, that
Psal. 2. 10. 11. 12. Deut. 28. 58. Esa. 66. 23. Zech. 2. 13. Luk. 12. 5. Heb. 12. 28. 29. all flesh even Kings and Princes as well as others ought
to feare and tremble before the great God of heave and earth,
that allPsal. 119 21. they are cursed which do erre from his 
                     •
                  ommaundements,
and thatEsa, 60. 12. the nation and Kingdome which will
not serve him, shall perish and be vtterly destroyed. Therefore
should Mr H. eyther have showed this Law and ordinance of
the Magistrates to be agreable to the Law and commaundement
of God (which he doth not): or finding it otherwise
as himself confesseth it to be, he should with the Apostles have
said and showed in his practise, thatAct. 5. 29. 
                  vve ought rather to
obey God then men. Otherwise if we were to receyve whatsoever
religion or whatsoever thing in religion is ordeyned by
the Law and Magistrate: what were this els, but to make
thery State and kingdome such an Idoll as was Nebuchadnezars
golden image ād to exalt earthly princes above the heavenly
King and to annihilate the Testamēt of Iesus Christ
confirmed in that this precious blood?
               If he except and 
                     〈◊〉
                   to help himself by this, that he speaheth
here of Christian Magistrates onely, and not of Magistrates
in generall, he is deceyved. For the povver and nature
of Magistracy (in whomsoever it be whether Christian or
Heathen) isRom. 13. 1—5. 1 Pet. 2. 13. 14. Tit. 3. 1. Mat. 22. 21. Esa. 49. 23. and 60. 2. Rev. 
                        •
                     1. 24. one and the same: even the ordinance of God,
appoynted for the punishing of them that do evill, and for the
defence and comfort of them that do well. So that although
a Christian do and cannot but differ from an Heathē as towthing
the faith and religion they professe: yet as towching
the nature and authority of Magistracy they differ not. Neyther
hath the one of them any more power then the other, in
religion to erect any other faith, Ministery, worship, or
constitution of a Church, then God himself who is King of

Kings hath ordeyned: Or if they do, we are not bound to
obey eyther of them thereyn: but alwayes to remember that
we must yeeld obedience to Magistrates (whether Christian
or Heathen) onely in the Lord. and never against the LOrd,
Constantine the Emperour had no greater nor other power
and authority of Magistracy when he became a Christian,
then he had before when he was an Heathen: Neyther might
he now any more thē before adde to, diminish, or alter the Lawes
and ordinances of IEsus Christ. The same may be said
of all others likewise. For the receyving and profession of the
faith of Christ giveth not to Princes and Rulers any power
to refuse chaunge or break his Lawes and ordinances, which
he as Lord and head of his Church hath commaunded to be
receyved therein: but it ratherPsal. 2. 10. 11. 12. Esa. 49. 23. and 60. 3. 2 Chron. 29 and 30. and 31. and 34. and 35. cap. Revel. 21. 24. byndeth them so much
the more, both themselves in theyr own persons to obey and
by theyr authority to commaund and draw theyr subiects
also to yeeld obedience to the Lord Iesus in his own ordinance,
and no other.
               Read the historyes of the Kings of Iudah professing the
faith of God: and see if theyr authority of Magistracy gave
them power any way to chaunge the religion and worship
of God appoynted by him for his Church at that tyme: And
whether both they and theyr people were not bound to submit
vnto it, and no other. Insomuch as whenAs Vzziah, Achaz, Manesseh, &c. 2 Chrō. 26. and 28. and 33. cap. any of them attempted
or did otherwise, they were sharply reproved and
grievously punished from the Lord. And contrarily, when
As Asa, Iehoscha. phat, Hezekiah, losiah, &c. 2 Chro. 15. & 17. & 19. & 20. & 29. & 30. & 31. & 32 & 34 & 35. cap. they obeyed the voyce of the Lord and followed his Lawes
and commaundements given by Moses, then did they and
theyr kingdomes prosper through the blessing of God. The
same is to be brought and said of Christian Princes and Magistrates
at this day: Yea rather more of these then of the other,
inasmuch as Christ IEsusHeb. 3. 1. 2. 3. the Apostle and high
Priest of our profession hath ben faithfull to him that appoynted
him, even as was Moses in all his house: and being the
Sonne is covnted worthy of more honour the Moses the servant.
Neyther is it or can be any disparagement hindrance or dishonour
to Princes and Potentates for themselves and theyr
people to be subiect to the Sonne of God and his ordinances,
who is King of kings and Lord of Lords, set at the right hād
of God the Father, having all power given him in heavē and
in earth: But it is and will be theyr greatest honour and benefit
both in this life and in that which is to come: even as theyr
disobedience is and will be the cōtrary: as it isPsal 2. 10. 11. 12. writtē, And

now ô Kings be vvise, receyv instruction ye Iudges of the earth:
Serve the Lord in feare, and reioyce in trembling: Kisse the Sonne,
least he be angry and ye perish in the vvay vvhen his vvrath
shall burne but a litle: Blessed are all that trust in him.
               
               Thus have we seen the weaknes likewise of this last reason
alledged by Mr H. for defence of his seeking and taking ordination
at the Prelates hāds. By discussing whereof appeareth
also, that who so wil minister in the Church the holy things of
GOD, must be carefull to have such entrance and calling
thereto as he hath appoynted in his word: And that otherwise
to do, though it were vpon the commaundement and appoyntment
of all the Princes of the earth, cannot but be sinne
against the Lord, who hathDeut. 12. 32. said, Whatsoever I commaund
you take heed you do it, thou shalt put nothing thereto nor take
ought therefrom: And contrary to that strait charge of the
Apostle to Timothy and all Ministers of the Gospell (towthing
the Lawes ād ordināces given by Christ to his Church)
1 Tim. 6. 13—16. saying, I charge thee in the sight of God vvho quickneth all
things, and before Iesus Christ vvhich vnder Pontius Pilate vvitnessed
a good confession, that thou keep this commaundement
vvithout spot and vnblameable, vntill the appearing of our Lord
IEsus Christ: Which in due tyme he vvill shovv that is blessed
and Prince onely, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
               
               And here now would we end this writing, but that it is
needfull in a word to poynt at some other particulars mentioned
by Mr H. in this last reason.
               1 One is, that speaking of the ordination he took from
the Prelates, he saith here he looked not so much vnto the Man
as to the Lavv: And yet in his second reason before would
have vs beleev, he looked to the Man, that is, to the Bishop
as being a Minister and preacher of the Gospell, as there he alledgeth.
Thus still he forgetteth himself.
               2. Another is, that having before in his first reason
confessed that the Prelates by the Lavv of GOD are not capable
of this povver to ordeyne Ministers vvhich is committed
vnto them by Act of Parliament, yet here he saith he came
vnto them for it, regarding vvith reverence the Lavv and
Christian Magistrate. Now how will he ever perswade this,
that he could regard vvith reverence the Lavv and Christian
Magistrate, when by his own confession it seemeth he regard
not with reverence the Lavv of GOD and Christ himself?

ThePro. 8. 15. 16. Rom 13. 1—5. 1 Pet. 2. 13. vvith Act. 4. 19. 1 Sam. 22 17. Mat. 22. due reverence and obedience of the Magistrate doth
and cānot but depend vpon the reverence ād obedience of God
by whom Princes raigne, ād for whom they are to be obeyed,
not for wrath onely but for conscience sake. Where this therefore
is wanting, how can the other rightly be had that dependeth
vpon it? But of this ynough hath ben sayd already. Onely
mark still his forgetfulnes and contradiction of himself.
               3. Thirdly, where he graunteth, the Prelates have theyr
power and authority by Act of Parliament (Yea such power and
authority as by the Lavv of God they are not capable of): it may
appeare that themselves see this Prelacy and authority thereof
to be no ordinance of Iesus Christ, but an humane treature,
the ordinance and constitution of Man. Let them therefore
as long as they will plead for it, and for theyr Ministery receyved
from and executed vnder it: Yet in the end will be verifyed
of it, as of all other the inventions of men in Gods worship,
that which Christ hath long synce foretold concerning
them allMat. 15. 13. saying, Alplanting vvhich my heavenly Father hath
not planted, shalbe rooted vp.
               
               4. Finally, where he sayth that vvithout the Magistrates
liking and allovvance they cannot be admitted to the Ministery
in peace; he now at length plainely bewrayeth what it is indeed
that moveth them to receyv and joyne vnto another Ministery
and worship then the Lord Iesus hath ordeyned, and
so to stand in transgression against him and his holy ordinances:
even the same thing, that moved the 
                     〈◊〉
                   teachers to 
                     〈◊〉
                  
circumcision among the Gentiles that had receyved the Gospell,
which the ApostleGal. 6. 12. sayth was, onely because they vvould
not suffer persecution for the crosse Christ: but would rather
have the peace of the world though with brea
                     •
                  h of Christs ordinance,
then the afflictions of the Gospell by yeelding obedience
therevnto against the liking and allowā
                  
                     •
                  e of men Moses
was otherwise mynded, whoHeb. 11. 24. 25. 26. chuse rather to beare the
rebuke of Christ ād to suffer adversity with the people of God,
then to enioy the treasures of Egypt or pleasures of sinne for a
season: And the Apostles likewise, whoAct. 5. 40 41. vvith 4. 18. 19. 20. refusing to obey
the rulers of Ierusalem that commaunded them not to preach
in the Name of Iesus, and being therefore beat and 
                     •
                  courged,
yet were glad and rejoyced that they were counted worthy to
suffer rebuke for his Name: Yea and Christ himself, whoHeb. 2. 10.
being Prince of our salvation was consecrate through afflictions:
and requireth likewise of all that will be followers of
him,Mar. 8. 34. saying, Whosoever will follow me, let him forshake

himself and take vp his crosse and follow me. And thus have
the servants of GOD through his grace and power ben
mynded and walked in all ages: howsoever these men now
would seem to have found a nearer and more easy way to the
Kingdome of heaven. But let them not deceyv themselves:
Whatsoever they do or may think to the contrary, certayne it
is as Christ hathMat. 7. 14. Luk. 13. 24. said, that the gate is strait and the vvay
narrovv that leadeth vnto life, and fevv there be that fynd it.
               
               Yet do we not deny neyther, but it is to be accounted an
happyEsa. 49. 23 Act. 9. 31. 1 Tim. 2, 1. 2 vvith Mat. 28. 20. benefit and greatly to be desired, that the Church
and people of God may have rest ād be suffred to lead a godly
life in peace and quyetnes: keping the faith, order, commaundements
and statutes which our Lord Iesus hath given and
appoynted to his Church. But if this cannot be had in peace
without persecution, yetPsal. 119 23. 59. 60. 6. 1 Tim. 6. 13 14 vvith 2 Tim. 2. 3. 12. 1 Thes. 1. 6. Rom. 8. 17. 18. 35—39. Rev. 2. 10. ād 14. 12. 13. must we not therefore refuse or turne
from the way and commaundement of Christ, but set our
feet therein notwithstanding, and alway be ready to walk
through the midst of afflictions with ioy in the holy Ghost, by
the grace and assistance of Christ our Lord: Knowing that
if we suffer vvith him, vve shall also raigne vvith him. For the
momentane lightnes of our affliction causeth vnto vs a far
most excellent eternall waight of glory, while we look not on
the things which are seen, but on the things which are not

            Some notes towching that formé of
prayer commonly called the Lords prayer.
            FIrst it is certayne, that the treasures of wisdome and knowledg being him
in Iesus Christ who set it down▪ it is a most perfit forme and rule of 
                  〈◊〉
               :
vnto which nothing can be added, and from which nothing can be taken
away. Col. 2. 3. Mat. 6. 9. 13. Rev, 22. 18. 19.
            2. Therefore also no Angels or Men (who whatsoever they have, receive
it of his fulnes) are ever able to atteyne to the setting down of the like
Ioh. 1. 16. 1 Cor. 13. 9. Heb. 1. 6. 7.
            3. If they do or shall set down any other forme, we must not regard
or follow it, but keep our selves onely to this rule which Christ our Lord hath
prescribed. Mat. 6. 9—13. and 15. 9. and 28. 20. vvith Gal 1. 8. 9.
            4. In this, Christ hath taught vs, 1. to vvhom to pray, that is, to God
onely and not to any Angell or Saint whatsoever: 2. with vvhat affection,
that is, with faith and confidence ofLuk. 11. 11. 13. his willingnes to heare and help
vs as being our Father, and ofPsal. 115 3. Eccle. 5. 1. his ability therevnto (together with due
regard of his Maiesty) as being in heauen, and therefore full of glory and
able to do whatsoever he will: 3. For vvhat things, whether they concerne
Gods glory or ourown benefit, according to the severall occasions ād necessityes
which God ministreth and layeth vpon vs: 4. VVhat difference we
should make of the things and of our desier after them, according to theyr
severall natures: 5. The end of all, that God in and over all may be glorifyed.
            All which directions are here comprised in few words, but such as fulls
and plainely teach and comprehend them all, even whatsoever is needfull to
be knowen and observed in calling vpon the Name of God, Herevpon it is
that all the prayers recorded in the Scriptures which the men of God vpon

                  •
               o many severall occasions have offred vp vnto him are comprised in and
may be reduced to this forme of prayer, although they did not vse the very
syllables and frame of words here set down. By which also may be gathered,
both that this is a most absolute forme and 
                  ••
               le of prayer, and that the
Of this iudgment is Mr Calvin, Beza, Vrsinus, Piscator and those of our ovvn nation vvhich trāslated the Bible into English at Geneva: As may be seen in theyr notes, commē
                  taryes, and expositions of this forme of prayer, Mat. 6. 9—13. right vse of it is to conceyve and frame all our prayers according to this
rule, and not to be bound to vse this number of words, as many now
a dayes in theyr ignorance and superstition do imagine.
            If it be obiected, that ChristLuk. 11. 2 said, VVhen ye pray, say, Our Father &c.
and therefore that we ought in prayer to repeat these words: I aunswer first
that the Scripture showeth his meaning was not at all to bynd vs to the
vse of these syllables, but that in prayer and thanks giving we should follow
this direction and patterne which he gave. So we read inMat. 6. 9. Mathew
that Christ said, After this maner pray ye, and not (as men now would habeit)
Say ouer these vvords.
            
            2. Secondly, seing this is an absolute forme of prayer wherein is no
want or vayne repetition, if Christs meaning were to bynd vs to the vse of
these vvords, why then should we vse any other? why should we not allway
vse these, and these onely? Yea what els were it but vayne bavling and intolerable
presumption to put other prayers in stead of this which is so absolute
and perfit?
            3. Thirdly, it is to be mynded that this forme of prayer being reco
                  •
               
               ded
inMat. 6. 9. 13. Luk. 11. 1. 4. two places of the Scripture, there neyther is all the same worde,
nor the same number of words mentioned in both places. Now then, according
to which of these two must we say it? If according to Luke his recording
of it, then shall we offend against that of Mathevv: and contraily: if we 
                  〈◊〉
               
t
                  •
               ed to the number and order of the words, as they are set down.
            
               
4. As God in giving the Morall law (albeit he did fully and shortly

                  •
               eclare his will in thoseExod. 20. 1
                     •
                  —17. Deuter 5. 6—21. ten Commaundements, yet) did not dynd the
Prophets and Priests in theyr Ministery to vse those very words, but as
occasion required according vnto them to show the people what then ought
to do or leave vndone: so Christ also giving this foune of prayer (a
                  •
               beit
therein he hath fully and shortly taught vs all things needfull for prayer,
yet) hath not bound vs in calling vpon GOD to vse these vvords, but in
all things according to this rule to make our requests vnto God, with giving
of thanks.
            5. It is without question, that the Apostles (vnto whom this rule first
was given) were carefull to keep it according to the true meaning of Christ
But they neyther tyedAct. 1. 2
                     •
                   and 4. 24. Mat. 14. 30. 2. Cor. 12. 8. Eph. 3. 14. 21 Phil. 1. 9. 10. 11 Rev. 22. 20. themselves to the sevvords but alway prayed
as they had severall occasions according to this rule, neyther whē they wrote
vntoPhil. 4. 6. Eph. 6. 18. 1 Thes. 5. 17. 18. Rom. 15. 30 31. 3
                     •
                   2 Thes. 3, 1. 2 1 Ti. 2. 1. 2. 3. la
                     •
                  . 1. 5. 6. and 5. 13. 1 Pet. 4. 7. 1 Ioh. 5. 14. 15. Iude, ver. 20. others concerning prayer, did they ever teach them to say over
the Lords prayer (which doubtles they would have done if they had so taken
the will of Christ to be) but they taught and exhorted them still according to
theyr necessityes and occasions in all things to show theyr requests vnto
God in all maner prayer ād supplication in the spirit with giving of thanks,
and herevnto to watch with all perseverance: because this is the vvill of God
in Christ Iesus.
            
            6. If the Apostles had ben bound or might have tyed themselves to
these or any other set forme of words, then had they not given a sufficient
reason who (in this respect with other) it was not meet they should attend
vnto the Deacons office, because they wouldAct. 6. 2. 4. give themselves [as to the
ministration of the word so also] vnto Prayer: For it had ben easy for them eyther
to have said by rote or to have red o
                  •
               t of a book this or any other set forme
of prayer.
            7. They which think Christ hath tyed vs to say these vvords, and that
such saying of the words is true prayer, must reconcile herewith the Apostles
speach when heRom. 8. 6. saith, VVe knovv not vvhat to pray as vve ought, but
the spirit it self maketh request for vs vvith grones that can not be expressed. These
men (it seemeth) would aunswer, Yes we know what to pray, to witt,
the Lords prayer, which conteyneth whatsoever we need to aske: And what
then need the Spirit to teach vs what to pray as we ought?
            8. The Apostle (speaking of prayer in a stra
                  •
               nge tongue) saith1 Cor. 14. 16. thus,
VVhen thou blessest, hovv shall he that occupyeth the roome of the vnlearned say
Amen, at thy giving of thanks, seing he knovveth not vvhat thou speakest? Now
if they had bē tyed to the vse of the words of the Lords prayer or to any other
set sunted words, they might have aunswered, Yes we know what he saith
when he prayeth or giveth thanks, It is the Lords prayer, or some stinted
prescribed prayer which we know aforehand, and therefore vnto it though it

                  〈◊〉
                spoken in a straunge tong
                  •
               e we can say Amen.
            9 If the saying over of these or of any friend words were true prayer,
then might a man have his prayers by rote, or carry them in his pocket, or

                  ••
               y them at the book bynders shop etc. Which were straunge to imagine
of true prayer, which is theRom. 8. 26. 27. Eph. 6. 18. Iude, ver. 20 1 Sam. 1. 12. 15. lam. 1. 5. and 5. 13. 1 Pet. 2. 5. work of Gods spirit in our hearts, teaching
and enabling vs to powre out our soules vnto God in all necessityes and occasions,
and so to offer vp spirituall sacrifices acceptable to God through
Iesus Christ.
            10. Whenas Christ promiseth that our heavenly father will give the
holy Ghost to them thatLuk. 11. 13. aske it of him: And els where speaking of the
destruction of IerusalemMat. 24. 2
                     •
                  . saith, Pray that your slight be not in the 
                  〈◊〉
               ,
and the like: these things being to be prayed for, a
                  •
               d yet these words

not set down in that forme of prayer, showeth that Christ hath not tyed v
                  •
               
to repeat over those words, but to pray after that rule according to our
wants and occasions.
            11 The words are so generall, as vnles they be some way opened and
particularl
                  •
                applyed, divers men will diversly vnderstand them. For example
if these words (Thy kingdome come) be vsed onely in generall without
any explication, the Papist vnderstandeth them of the advauncement
of Gods kingdome in and by theyr religion, the Protestant vnderstandeth
and intendeth them of the cleane contrary: And so in the rest. Neyther can
any man for himself vse them aright without some speciall application to his
particular estate and occasion: because no one mans faith and vnderstanding
can atteyne vnto all things needfull for all occasioins tymes and persons, as
those words do comprehend.
            12. If these words (Say yee &c): must be taken and pressed according to
the letter, then would follow that in prayer we should alway speak with the
tongue: Whereas there is prayer often in the spirit alone without any words
or dis
                  •
               inet voyce at all: As weExod. 14. 15. Esa. 38. 14. Neh. 2. 4. 1 Sam. 1. 13. Rom. 8. 26. 27. read that Moses, 
                  •
               ezekiah, Nehemiah,
Annah, and others have so prayed and ben accepted of God.
            13. Christ hath given anLuk. 11. 2 expresse commaundement (VVhen ye pray
say, Our father &c.) wherevpon I reason thus: The commaundements of
Christ are to be kept, otherwise it is sinne: therefore if Christ have here commaunded
to vse these words in that number and order, then whosoever pray
at any tyme, and vse not these words, they sinne. But already we have seen
that the Apostles prayed and vsed not these words, and yet sinned not. And
so no doubt do other the servants of God daily according to theyr divers occasions
and conditions: Not to speak here of the prayers which the preachers
vse before and after theyr sermons, neyther of theyr collects and other prayers
(besides this) prescribed in theyr books. Otherwise also every man
that blesseth his table, or sayth to another, God be with you, God blesse
you, God recover you, good morrow, good night, or the like, should sinne
in this, because he prayeth and yet saith not, Our father etc.
            14. Yet I doubt not but we may vse any of these aswell as other words,
applying them to our speciall case and necessity: As we see that Christ prayed
Ioh. 12. 28. saying, Father glorify thy Name, AndMat. 26 42. agayn, O my Father if this
cup can not passe from me but that I must drink it, thy vvill be done, Where
we may learne by Christ who gave the rule, how to vse it, to witt, not in
a superstitious saying over these words, but in praying according to this rule
as our special necessities shall be, whether we vse any of these words or other,
or pray with sighs that cannot be expressed.
            15. Finally therefore all such as have framed or receyved any other forme
of Prayer but this onely which Christ hath taught, offend against this rule
and commaundement of Christ. And thus (not we, but) they who have
devised and follow other formes and books of prayer, are those which deny
and (as much as lyeth in them) disanull the Lords prayer.
