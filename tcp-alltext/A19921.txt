                  Epigrammata prima.
                  
                     Ad Musam,
                     
                        FLie merry Muse vnto that merry towne,
                        where thou mayst playes, reuels, and triumphes see
                        The house of fame, & Theatre of renowne,
                        VVhere all good wits & spirits loue to be.
                     
                     
                        Fall in betwene their hands, that loue & praise thee
                        and be to them a laughter and a iest:
                        but as for them which scorning shall approue thee,
                        Disdayne their wits, and thinke thyne owne the best.
                     
                     
                        But if thou finde any so grose and dull,
                        That thinke I do to priuat Taxing leane:
                        Bid him go hang, for he is but a gull,
                        And knowes not what an Epigramme does meane.
                        Which Taxeth vnder a particular name,
                        A generall vice which merits publique blame.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     Of a Gull

                        OFt in my laughing rimes, I name a gull,
                        But this new terme will many questions bread
                              •
                           
                        
                        Therefore at first I will expresse at full,
                        Who is a true and perfect gull indeede.
                     
                     
                        A gull is he, who feares a veluet gowne,
                        and when a wench is braue, dares not speake to her:
                        A gull is he which trauerseth the towne,
                        and is for marriage knowne a common wooer.
                     
                     
                        A gull is he, which while he prowdlie weares,
                        a siluer hilted Rapier by his side:
                        Indures the lyes, and knockes about the eares,
                        Whilst in his sheath, his sleeping sword doth bide.
                     
                     
                        A gull is he which weares good hansome cloathes,
                        And standes in presence stroaking vp his hayre:
                        and filles vp his vnper

                           ect speech with othes.
                        but speakes not one wise word throughout the yeere
                        But to define a gull in termes precise,
                        A gull is he which semes, and is not wise.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     In Faustum 7
                     Faustus not lord, nor knight, nor wise, nor olde,
                     To euery place about the towne doth ride,
                     He rides into the fieldes, Playes to beholde,
                     He rides to take boate at the water side,
                     He rides to Powles, he rides to th'ordinarie,
                     He rides vnto the house of bawderie too.
                     Thither his horse so often doth him carry,
                     That shortlie he wil quite forget to go.

                     Content thee Kate, although thy pleasure wasteth,
                     Thy pleasures place like a buffe ierkin lasteth:
                     For no buste ierkin hath bin oftner worne,

                     In Medonem 10
                     Great Captaine Medon weares a chaine of golde,
                     which at fiue hundred crownes is valued;
                     For that it was his graundsires chain

                         of olde,

                     and weare it Medon, for it may ensue,

                     For what saide Phillip king of Macedon?
                     There is no Castle so wel fortifid,
                     But if an Asse laden with gold comes on,
                     The guarde wil stoope, and gates flie open wide.
                  
                  
                     In Gellam 10
                     Gella, if thou dost loue thy selfe, take heede,
                     lest thou my rimes, vnto thy louer reade,
                     For straight thou grinst, & then thy louer reeth,
                     Thy canker-eaten gums, and rotten teeth.
                  
                  
                     In Quintum 12
                     Quintus his wit infused into his braine,
                     Mislikes the place, and fled into his feete,

                     Dabled in the durt, and soaked in the raine.
                     Doubtlesse his wit intendes not to aspire,
                     Which leaues his head to trauell in the mire.
                  
                  
                     
                     In Seuerum 13
                     The puritane Seuerus oft doth reade,
                     this text that doth pronounce vaine speech a sinne,
                     That thing defiles a man that doth proceede

                     Hence is it, that we seldome heare him sweare,
                     and therexsof like a Pharisie he vaunts,
                     but he deuoures more Capons in a yeare,
                     Then would suffice a hundreth protestants.
                     And sooth those sectaries are gluttons all,
                     As well the threed-bare Cobler as the knight,
                     For those poore slaues which haue not wher withal
                     Feede on the rich, til they deuoure them quite.
                     And so like Pharoes kine, they eate vp cleane,
                     Those that be fat, yet still themselues be leane.
                  
                  
                     In Leucam 14
                     Leuca in presence once a fart did let,
                     Some laught a little, she forsooke the place:
                     and madde with shame, did eke her gloue forget,
                     which she returnde to fetch with bashfull grace:
                     And when she would haue said, my gloue,
                     My fart (qd she) which did more laughter moue.
                  
                  
                     
                     In Macrum 15
                     Thou canst not speake yet Macer, for to speake,
                     is to distinguish soundes significant,
                     Thou with harsh noyse the ayre dost rudely breake,
                     But what thou vtterest common sence dnth want:
                     Halfe English wordes, with fustian tearms among
                     Much like the burthen of a Northerne song.
                  
                  
                     In Faustum 16
                     That youth saith Faustus, hath a Lyon seene,
                     Who from a Dycing house comes monielesse,
                     but when he lost his hayre, where had he been
                           •
                        ,
                     I doubt me had seene a Lyonesse.
                  
                  
                     In Cosmum 17
                     Cosmus hath more discoursing in his head,
                     then loue, when Pallas issued from his braine,
                     and still he striues to be deliuered,
                     Of all his thoughtes at once, but al in vaine.
                     For as we see at all the play house dores,
                     when ended is the play. the daunce, and song:
                     A thousand townsemen, gentlemen, & whores,
                     
                        Porters & seruing-men togither throng,
                     so thoughts of drinking, thriuing, wenching, war,
                     And borrowing money, raging in his minde,
                     To issue all at once so forwarde are,
                     As none at all can perfect passage finde.
                  
                  
                     In Flaccum 18
                     The false knaue Flaccus once a bribe I gaue,
                     The more foole I to bribe so false a knaue,
                     but he gaue back my bribe, the more foole he,
                     That for my follie, did not cousen me.

                     For still thou grumblest like a Mastie dogger
                     comparst thy selfe to nothing but a dogge,
                     Thou saist thou art as weary as a dogge.
                     As angry, sick, & hungry as a dogge,
                     As dull and melancholy as a dogge:
                     As lazie, sleepie, & as idle as a dogge.
                     But why dost thou compare thee to a dogge?
                     In that, for which all men despise a dogge,
                     I will compare thee better to a dogge.
                     
                        
Thou art as faire and comely as a dogge,
                     Thou art as true and honest as a dogge,
                     Thou art as kinde and liberall as a dogge,

                     Thou art as like thy father as may be,
                     Tis like inough, and faith I like it well,
                     But I am glad thou art not like to me.

                     For these before the rest preferreth he;
                     If reading fiue thou plainst of tediousnesse,
                     Two taine away the labour will be lesse:
                     VVith muse vpreard I meane to sing of ames,
                     Choosing a subiect fit for fierse alarmes
                     Both verses were a like till loue (men say)
                     Began to smile and take one foote away
                     Rash boy, who gaue thee power to change a line?
                     VVe are the Muses prophets, none of thine.
                     That if thy Mother take Dianas bowe?
                     Shall Dian fanne when loue begins to glowe.
                     In woodie groues ist meete that Ceres raigne,
                     And quiuer bearing Dian till the plaine:
                     Whole set the faire treste sonne in battel ray,
                     While Mars doth take the Aonion harpe to play,
                     Great are thy kingdom
                           •
                         ouer strong and large,
                     Ambitious Imp, why seekst thou further charge?
                     
                        Are al things thine? the Muses tempe thine?
                     then scarse can Phoebus say, this harp is mine.
                     When in this worke, first verse I trode a-loft.
                     I slackt my muse, and made my number soft.
                     I haue no Mistres, nor no fauorit,
                     Being fittest matter for a wanton wit.
                     thus I complainde, but loue vn-lockt his quiuer,
                     Tooke out the shaft, ordainde my heart to shiuer.
                     and bent his sinewy bow vppon his knee,
                     Saying, Poet heeres a worke beseeming thee.
                     Oh woe is me, he neuer shootes but hits,
                     I burne, loue in my idle bosome sits.
                     Let my first verse be sixe, my last fiue feete,
                     Farewell sterne warre, for blunter poets meete,
                     Elegian muse, that warblest amorous layes,

                     To rest my limbes, vppon a bed I lay.
                     One window shut, the other open stood,
                     Which gaue such light, as twincles in a wood,

                         night being past, and yet not day begunne.
                     Such light to shamefast maidens must be showne,
                     Where they may sport, & seeme to be vn-knowne.

                     Resembling faire Semiramis going to bed,
                     Or Layis of a thousand louers spread.
                     I snatcht her gowne being thin, the harme was smal,
                     Yet striude she to be couered there-withall.
                     And striuing thus as one that would be cast,
                     betrayde her selfe, and yeelded at the last.
                     Starke naked as she stoode before mine eye,
                     Not one wen in here body coulde I spie.
                     What armes & shoulders did I touch and see,
                     How apt her breastes were to be prest by me.
                     How smooth a bellie, vnder her waste saw I,
                     How large a legge, and what a lustie thigh.
                     To leaue the rest, all pleasde me passing well,
                     I clingde her faire white body, down she fell.
                     Iudge you the rest, being tyrde she bade me Kisse,

                     I Meane not to defend the scapes of any,

                     Yf any eye me vvith a modest Looke,
                     I blush, & by that blushful glas am tooke
                     And she thats coy I like, for being no clovvn,
                     Me thinks she should be quick vvhen she is dovvne.
                     Though her sovver Lookes a sabines brovv resēble,
                     I think sheele do, but deeply can dissemble
                     If she be Learned, then for her skil I craue her,
                     If not, because shees simple I vvould haue her,
                     Before Calimecus one preferres me farre,
                     Seeing she likes my bookes, vvhy should vve iarre?
                     Another railes at me, and that I vvrite,
                     Yet vvould I be vvith her, if that I might
                     Trips shee, it likes me vvel, plods she, vvhat than?
                     She vvould be nimbler Lying vvith a man.
                     
                     And when one sweetly sings, then straight I long,
                     To quauer on her lips euen in her song,
                     Or if one touch the lute with art and cunning.
                     Who would not loue those nimble handes for their swift runing.
                     And she I like that with a maiestie,
                     Foldes vp her armes, and makes low curtesie,
                     To leaue myselfe, that am in loue withal,
                     Some one of theese might make the chastest fal,
                     If she be tall, shees like an amazon,
                     And therefore fils the bed she lyes vpon:
                     If short. she lyes the rounder to speak troth,
                     Both short & long please me, for I loue both:
                     If her white neck be shadowed with black hayre,
                     Why so was Ledas, yet was Leda faire.
                     Yellow trest is she, then on the morne think I,
                     My loue alludes to euery historie:
                     A young wench pleaseth, and an olde is good,
                     This for her lookes, that for her woman-hoode,
                     Nay what is she, that any Romane loues,
                     But my ambitious ranging minde approues?

                     GRecinus (well I wot) thou toldst me once.
                     I could not be in loue with two at once.
                     By thee deceiued, by thee surprisde am I.
                     For now I loue two women equally:
                     both are well fauoured, both rich in aray,
                     VVhich is the louliest it is hard to say:
                     This seemes the fairest, so doth that to me,
                     This doth please me most, and so doth she,
                     Euen as a boate, tost by contrary winde,
                     So with this loue and that wauers my minde,
                     Venus why doublest thou my endlesse smart?
                     Was not one wench inough to grieue my heart?
                     Why addst thou starres to heauen, leaues to greene woods
                     And to the deep vast sea fsesh water floods?
                     Yet this is better farre then lye alone,
                     let such as be mine enemies haue none,
                     Yea, let my foes sleepe in an emptie bed,
                     And in the mids their bodyes largely spread:
                     But may soft loue rowse vp my drowsie eyes.
                     And fom my mistris bosome let me rise:
                     Let one wench cloy me with sweet loues delight
                     If one can doote, if not, two euery night,
                     Though I am slender, I haue store of pich,
                     
                        Nor want I strength, but weight to presse her with:
                     Pleasure ads fuell to my lustfull fire,
                     I pay them home with that they most desire:
                     Oft haue I spent the night in wantonnes,
                     And in the morne bene liuely nerethelesse,
                     Hees happy who loues mutuall skirmish slayes,
                     And to the Gods for that death Ouid prayes,
                     Let souldiour chase his enemies amayne,
                     And with his blood eternall honour gaine,
                     Let marchants seeke welth with periured lips,
                     And being wrackt, carowse the sea tir'd by their ships
                     But when I dye, would I might droope with doing,
                     And in the mids thereof, let my soule going,
                     That at my funerals some may weeping cry,
                     Euen as he led his life, so did he die.

non potuit conqueritur.
                     EIther she vvas foule, or her attire vvas bad,
                     Or she vvas not the vvēch I vvisht t'haue had,
                     Idly I lay vvith her, as if I louede her not,
                     And like a burden greeu'd the bed that moued not
                     Though both of vs performd our true intent,
                     Yet coulde I not cast ancor where I meant,
                     She on my neck her Iuorie armes did throw.
                     That were as vvhite as is the Scithian snovv.
                     And egarly she kist me vvith her tongue.
                     And vnder mine, her vvanton thigh she flong,
                     Yea, and she soothde me vp, and calde me sir
                     And vsde all speech that might prouoke and stirre,
                     Yet like as if colde hemlock I had drunk,
                     It mocked me, hung dovvne the head and sunke.
                     Like a dull Cipher, or rude block I lay,
                     Or shad, Or body vvas lo? vvho can say,
                     What vvill my age do? age I cannot shunne,
                     Seeing in my prime, my force is spent and done,
                     I blush, and being youthful, hot, and lustie,
                     I proue neyther youth nor man, but olde and rustie,
                     Pure Rose she, like a Nun to sacrifice,
                     
                     Or one that vvith her tender brother lies,
                     Yet boorded I the golden Chietvvise.
                     And Libas and the vvhite cheek'de Pith o thrise.
                     Corinna craude it in a summers night,
                     And nine svveet bouts had vve before day light,

                     Why might not then my sinevves be inchaunted,
                     And I grovv faint, as vvith some spirit haunted.
                     To this and shame, shame to perform it quaild me,

                     Yet might her touch make youthfull pilius she,
                     And Tithon liuelier then his yeeres require,
