               SIR, as to be excellent in anie skill is very rare, so the fauorers of excellencie are not euerie where to bee found, whom when by our good happe we find; I know not by what Sympathy we are drawne to admire and honour them aboue all other creatures, as the Saints and Soueraignes of our affections and deuices: few they are I confesse, and so few, that if by euents fore-past we may iudge of things to come, I feare me ere many yeares, euen the most necessary Artes to our posterity erun

Onely I am sory that our courtiers and great personages must seeke farre and neere for some Dutchman or Italian to draw their pictures, and inuent their deuises, our Englishmen being held for Vaunients. To which end as wel for their sakes who are as yet yong practitioners, as in regard of many yong Gentlemen in this Kingdome, who being naturally inclined hereunto, want fit directions to the attaining of this commendable skill, so many waies necessarie, (fauoured in times past of the greatest Monarches, and of late daies practised euen by Princes, and the greatest personages themselues, as Francis the first, king of France, Charl

               The Emperour Constantine got his liuing a long time by painting,

                   and in Plinies times certaine festiuall daies were yearely appointed at Corinth for the exercise of picture for great prizes & wagers. Since Painting then hath beene so well esteemed, and of it owne nature is so linked with the other Artes, as many of them can hardly stand without it, I thinke it not for pleasure onely, but of necessitie most needfull to be practised of all such, that eyther studie the Mathematikes, the art Militarie, or purpose to trauell for the benefit of their friends and countrey.

                     AElian saith, Painters at the first were such bunglers, and so rude, that when they drew a Cow or a Hog, they were faine to write ouer the head what it was, otherwise the beholder knew not what to make of it; but in short time they grew to that excellency, that they were honoured welnigh as Gods, as Metrodor

                  MAny waies I know there haue beene deuised to teach draught, as namely, by crossing the patterne, then your owne papers with equall spaces, filling the same as you finde in your example: also drawing vpon a lanterne horne with a paper blackt with a torch, and such like: neither do I mislike any such conuenient help to a yong learners furtherance; but to learne to the purpose, and to grow cunning in short time, you should rather fall to it onely by your owne conceit and iudgement, and let those toyes goe, you must first get you blacke lead sharpned finely:Blacke lead in quils. and put fast into quils, for your rude and first draught, some ten or twelue.
               Moreouer you must not be without as many Sallow coales,Sallow coales. sharpned at the endes: you shall chuse them thus, they are more blew and finer grained then the other coales, smooth (being broken) like satten: you shal sharpen them vpon one of your 
                     •
                  ingers, as also your blacke lead; other coales will quickly breake, and neuer point sharpe.
               Get you also a small paire of brazen compasses and fine rule,Rule and compasse. for taking the distance, if you follow a print; and be not without the crums of fine manchet or white bread, to rubbe out your lead or coale, when you haue done amisse, or finished your worke.
               
                  Scriueners and writing Schoolemasters in the countrey that teach to write, haue diuers small pensils of broome,Broome pencils. with which they shadow great letters with common Inke in coppy bookes very pretily: they are made in this manner, take a broome stalke about the bignesse of a spoone

                  andle, and cut it euen at the end, when you haue done, chew it betweene your teeth till it bee fine and grow heary at the end like a pensill, but I care not how little you vse them, because your pen shall do better, and shew more art.
               For your drawing pennes, neuer be without twentie or thirtie at a time, made of Rauens and goose quils; your Rauens quilles are the best of all other, to write faire, or shadow fine, your goose quils serue for the bigger or ruder lines. To draw with drie colours, you may make long pastils, which you shall doe by grinding red lead, or any other colour with strong wort, and so roule them vp into long roules like pensils drying them in the Sun, some put heereto a little new milke.

                  HAuing these in a readinesse, you shall practise for the space of a weeke or there abouts, to draw Circles, Squares of all sorts, a Cilinder, the ouall forme with other such like solid and plaine Geometricall figures with a swift hand till you can

do them indifferent well, but after vsing the helpe of your rule and compasse: the reason of exercising you first in these is, when as Symmetry or proportion is the very soule of picture, it is impossible that you should be ready in the bodies, before you can draw their abstract & generall formes, & haue wonted and made your hand ready, in proportions of all sorts, which are cōpounded of the same, as for exāple, your circle will

After you are cunning in these figures (beginning wi

                  h the circle) and imitate somthing of circular form, what you shal think good, in which as in all the other aforenamed proportions you shall worke & helpe your selfe by the Diameter (wch is a strait line, drawn long waies iust in the midst of your circle or square) & which wil guide you maruellously in your work for exāple if I wold draw the Sun, so soone as I haue made a fair circle I draw (with cole or lead that I may rub it out again) my diameter or line down the midst, ouer which if you wil againe,

you may draw a crosse line, both which diuide your Circle equally into foure parts, as you see.

Which Diameter with the crosse line, are not onely your directors, for the equall placing of the greater and lesser beames, on the side as you may perceiue: but also for the drawing of the nose, mouth and eyes euen in the midst of the face.
               I will giue you another example of a goblet or cup. First I make a halfe or semicircle for the bowle, downe the midst of which (as low as I would haue the foote to come) I draw my Diameter or straight line, which being done, the worst is past: you must now marke: I am not tied to make my bowle as round as the circle, but long or what fashion I list, no other vse hath the Circle there then to guide me euen on either side, whether I make it broad or narrow, long or short, embosse it, or how,

soeuer, the other part of the line causeth me to make the foote euen as you see.
               
                  Which line and Circle (as I said before) you may with your white bread rubbe out, when you haue done.
               In these and such like, you may at your pleasure finde infinite varietie to 
                     •
                  set your selfe a worke with, till you are able to fall to worke by your owne iudgement; which you shall doe in your next and second practise.
            
            
               CHAP. VI. The second practise.
               
                  YOu shall, next after your hand is growne readie in the foresaid proportions, practise to draw small and easie things, comming as neere your former examples as may be, by your conceipt onely: as a cherry with the leafe, the shaft of a steeple, a single or canker Rose, &c. wherein you shall begin to take some delight, and finde no great difficulty.
               But in drawing these and whatsoeuer else, I must not forget to tell you; that you must be perfect and quicke in the generall or outward lines, and giue them a reasonable good proportion, ere you fall to shadowing or tricking your worke within: wherefore

I would haue you make an assey sixe or seuen times at the least for the generall proportion onely: if at first it be not to your minde, as for example in drawing of a Rose, be sure that the compasse of it be not faulty, ere you cast out the leaues by fiue equall lines, or in making a womans ruffe, that you score it out first narrow in the necke, then wider from the cheekes, and narrow againe vnder the chin very truly, ere you add

                  SInce a man is the worthiest of all creatures, and such pleasing varietie in countenances so disposed of by the diuine prouidence, that among tenne thousand you shall not see one like another (as well for breeding delight, as for obseruing a methode after you haue practised according to your former directions in other things) you shall beginne to draw a mans face, in which as in all other creatures you must take your beginning at the forehead, and so draw downward till yo

                   haue finished.
               The visage or countenance is (for the most part) drawn but three manner of waies, the first is full faced,The full 
                        •

                  The second is three quarter faced, as our Flanders and ordinarie pictures are, that is when one part of the face is hid by a quarter as thus:
               
                  The third is onely halfe faced,Halfe face. as you see the pictures of Philip and Mary vpon a twelue pence, or as this Caesars head.
               
                  For draught of a full face you must beare in memory, and narrowly obserue the bredth of the forehead, and the compasse of both the cheekes, all which are composed of two lines as thus:
               And be carefull to giue as precise an euennesse to one side as to the other; causing both your lines to meete at the tip of the chin: your Diameter guideth you for the euen placing (as I said) of nose and mouth, your other line for the iust opposition

of the eyes betweene which in distance for the nose, alwaies leaue the space of an eye.
               The end of the nose in ordinary proportion must be brought no lower then the middle of the cheeke,The space of an other eie to be le

                     t betweene the eies. from whence to the chin is for the most part as farre, as from thence vpward to the eye-browes.
               The nose of a full face must not be expressed with apparant lines, but with a very fine shadow on each side, as you see.
               An eye is commonly drawne

in this manner.
               To make an angrie or sterne countenance, let your brow bend so, that it may almost seeme to touch the ball of the ey; at what time you must also giue the forehead a fine wrinckle or two, and withall the vpper part of the nose betweene the eyes.
               A great conceipt is required in making the eye which either by the dulnesse or liuely quicknesse thereof giueth a great taste of the spirit and disposition of the minde,Great difficultie in the eie. (which many times I will not denie may be aswell perceiued by the mouth, and motion of the bodie,) as in drawing a foole or idiot, by making his eies narrow, and his temples wrinkled with laughter, wide mouthed, or shewing his teeth &c.

               CHAP. X. Of shadowing and obseruing the light according to the rules and infallible principles of perspectiue.
               
                  A Shadow is nothing else but a diminution of the first and second light.
               The first light I call that which proceedeth immediately from a lightned bodie, as the beames of the sunne.
               The second is an accidental light dispreading it selfe into the aire or medium, proceeding from the other.
               Vnder this diuision are comprehended the other lights, as the light of glory is referred in the first. The light of all manner of reflexions to the second.
               Shadowes are threefold: the first is a single shadow, and the least of all other, and is proper to the plaine Superficies, where it is not wholy possessed of the light; as for example.
               
                  I draw a foure square plate thus, that shadow, because there is no hollow, but all plaine (as neerest participating with the light) is most natural and agreeable to that bodie.
               
                  The scond is the double shadow,The double

               CHAP. XI. Certaine Questions of the manifold deceptions of the sight by perspectiue.

                  st exterior, or being as I may say in the false apprehension of distance opposition, proportion or the like, the second from an inward cause, as the weaknesse of the eye it selfe, or the decaying of the Spirits, the third from the aff

                  ction of the eye from some outward humour of hurt, but we are onely to intreate of the 
                     •
                  irst.
               
                  
                  
                     1. Why the Horizon appeareth to our sight bigger th
                        •
                     n any part else of the Hemisphere.
                  All quantitie of distance is knowne by bodies interposed, but betweene our eie and the vertical point of heauen ouer our heads we perceiue nothing, betweene our sight and the horizon, there appeareth the breadth of the earth, the space therefore seemeth greater.
               
               
                  
                     2. Why in round and Sphaericall glasses euery thing appeareth crooked to the eye.
                  In all glasses the forme of the figure seene, followeth the forme of the figure reflecting, but the reflection from the superficies or outside, is after the forme of the Superficies which is crooked, therefore must the thing seene needs appeare crooked.
               
               
                  
                     3. Why in the said Round glasses all things appeare lesse then in plaine glasses.
                  Because the concourse or meeting of the beames, with the perpendicular line in orbicular glasses is neerer to the eye then in plaine glasses: Euclide giues another reason which is this. Because (saith he) in plaine glasses, the reflexion is greater & more forceable then in the round, for as I said the Idolon or Image is of the nature of the Superficies reflecting the same.
               
               
                  
                  
                     4 Why in a glasse broken to peeces, in euery peece you see a seuerall face, and but one, if you ioyne them together.
                  The reason is the diuersitie of position or situation, which may be gathered by a concaue or hollow glasse, wherein you shall see your face in sundrie places at once there being a reflexion from euery part of the glasse. Heereupon in vneuen glasses, your face will appeare to be monstrous.
               
               
                  
                     5 Why square things by distance seeme vnto vs to be long as Courts, the roofes of Churches & houses, &c.
                  Because the excesse or multitude of beames falling vpon the sides of the square bodie indirectly presented to the eye, is not proportionate with a sensible proportion to those beames that fal vpon the side directly against the eye by comparison with the whole distance. Besides sight is not able to discerne the obliquitie of the sides, because it is seene sidewaies vnder longer beames, and a lesser angle.
               
               
                  
                     6 Why the Sunne and Moone appeare bigger at their rising or setting, then when they are in our verticall point.
                  One reason is, because as I said before, any thing that hath a relation to a greater space, is imagined greater, the other is the corruption (as I may say) of the ayre or medium being at morning, and 
                        •
                     uening more subiect to vapors and exhalations then at any

other time, the same reason may be giuen; an apple in the water, of birds and stakes vpon the Sea sands, which being foure or fiue miles off appeare bigger vnto you, then neere hand, the like of trees that appeare twice as bigge in a mistie or rimie morning then indeed they are, hereupon a friend of mine was notably cosened in a bargaine of timber hee bought by the great, in a mistie morrning, but I feare me within these few yeares, the mistes will be so thicke, we shall see no timber at all.
               
               
                  
                     7 Why a burning glasse causeth fire.
                  The reason is the concurse and concentration of the broken beames with the perpendicular in the midst of the glasse being round and thicke.
               
               
                  
                     8 Why all things appeare downward in the water.
                  Euery thing seemeth downward in the water by reason of the fall of the other beames in the Catheton or perpendicular.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XI. Of Lant-skip.
               
                  LAndtskip is a Dutch word, and it is as much as we should say in English landship, or expressing of the land by hilles, woods, Castles, Seas, vallies, ruines, hanging rockes, Cities, Townes, &c. as farre as may be shewed within our Horizon. If

it be not drawne by it selfe or for the owne sake, but in respect, and for the sake of some thing else: it falleth out among those things which we call Parerga, which are additions or adiuncts rather of ornament, then otherwise necessarie.
               
                  Generall rules for Landtskip.
                  YOV shall alwaies in your
                        •
                      Landtskip shew a faire Horizon, and expresse the heauen more or lesse eyther ouercast by clouds, or with a cleere skie, shewing the Sunne rising or setting ouer some hill or other: you shall seldome, except vpon necessitie, shew the Moone or Starres, because we imagine all things to be seene by day.
                  2 If you shew the Sunne, let all the light of your trees, hilles, rockes, buildings, &c. be giuen thitherward: shadow also your clouds from the sunne: and you must be verie daintie in lessening your bodies by their distance, and haue a regard, the farther your Landtskip goeth to those vniuersalia, which as Aristotle saith (in respect of their particulars concealed from our sences) are notiora: as in discerning a building tenne or twelue miles off, I I cannot tell whether it be Church, Castle, House, or the like: So that in drawing of it, I must expresse no particular signe as Bell, Portculleis, &c. but shew it as weakly and as faintly as mine eye iudgeth of it, because all those particulars are taken away by the greatnesse of the distance. I haue seene a man painted comming downe a hill some mile and a halfe from mee, as I iudged by the

Landskip, yet might you haue told all the buttons of his dublet: whether the painter had a quicke inu

                  If you lay you Lantskip in colours, the farther you goe, the more you must lighten it with a thinne and ayerie blew, to make it seeme farre off, beginning it first with a darke greene, so driuing it by degrees into a blew, which the densitie of the ayre betweene our sight, and that place doth (onely imaginarily) effect.
               
               
                  Of the fairest and most beautifull Landtskips in the world.
                  Of Landtskips by land the fairest may be taken vpon mount Libanus neere Hierusalem, whence you may discerne all those holy places where our Sauiour liued, and in a manner all ouer the holy Land, moreouer you may plainely view all the townes vpon the Sea coast, and into the Sea, as farre as Cyprus, being distant from Ioppa, or Iaffa (the first entrie or landing place within the holy land) two hundred and fiftie miles.

                  Of the Graces of Landtskip.
                  Though inuention and imitation in this kind are infinite, you must haue a care to worke with a sound iudgemēt, that your work become not ridiculous to the beholders eye as well for true obseruation of the di

                  To settle therfore your iudgment in these and the like, I wish you first to imitate the abstract or labour of euery month. Not as a foolish Painter vndertaking the like, and beginning with Ianuary, drew him sitting in wicker chaire like an old man, with three or foure night caps on his head, by the fire his slip shoes by and one foote vpon the tongues within the chimney, & without doores hay

The same methode obserue in the other seasons.
                  If you draw your Landskip according to your inuention, you shall please very well, if you shew in the same, the faire side of some goodly Citie, hauen, forrest, stately house with gardens, I euer tooke delight in those peeces that shewed to the like a countrey village, faire or market, Bergamas

               CHAP. XIII. Of Draperie.
               
                  DRapery (so called of the French word Drap, which is cloth) principally consisteth in the true making and folding your garment, giuing to euery fold his proper naturall doubling and shadow; which is a great skill, and scarce attained vnto by any of our countrey and ordinarie painters: insomuch that if I would make triall of a good workeman; I would finde him quickly by the folding of a garment, or the shadowing of a gowne, sheete, or such like.
               
                  What Method is to be obserued in draperyThe method now to be obserued in Draperie, is to draw first the outmost or extreme lines of your garment, as you will, full of narrow, and leaue wide and spare places, where you think you shall haue neede of foldes; draw your greater foldes alwaies first, not letting any line touch, or directly crosse another, for then shall you bring an irrecouerable confusion into your worke: when you haue so done, breake your greater foldes vnto lesse, which shall be contained within them: I would giue you an example, but euery print will shew you the like; all your foldes consistes of two lines and no more, which you may turne with the garment at your pleasure: beginne your maine and greatest foldes, from the skirt vpward, and the closer the garments sit, the narrower you must make them: for the shadowing

of euery seuerall fold, obserue the first rule I gaue you in the Chapter of shadowing, and spare not to shadow your foldes, (be they neuer so curiously contriued) if they fall inward from the light, with a double or treble shadow; as you shall s

                   occasion: for the shadow take his place in one and the same manner aswell in folding as without: some haue vsed to draw the bodie naked first, and after to haue put on the apparrell, but I hold it as an idle conceit, and to small purpose. I would herein aboue all other haue you to imitate Albert Du

                     1 Your greater folds must be continued throughout the whole garment, the lesser you may breake and shorten at your pleasure.
                     2 The shadowes of all manner of silkes, and fine linnen are very thicke, and fine, so that your foldes must not onely be little, but their shadow or deepening very light, and rare, which commonly at the most is but a double shadow giuen with a new, and the finest pen.
                     3 You must not vse much folding where the garments ought to sit close, or any eminency appeare, as commonly there doth in the breasts of a woman, the armes, belly, thighes, legs, &c. but to shew art, you shall leaue the forme of the breast, legge. &c. to appeare thorough, which you may doe by sha

one or either side, leauing it white.
                     4 As I told before of the light, so must you in your draperie haue a care of the winde and motion of the ayre, for driuing your loose apparrell all one way, as Ouid describes the garments of Europa, when she by Iupiter carried ouer the Sea: The best drapery in the world is held to be, that done by Michael Angelo in the Popes Chappell in Rome: and that by Raphael Vrbane in Millane in the Church of St. Victor at Nostre Dame in Amiens, and many other places.

               If you diaper vpon folds, let your worke be broken, and taken as it were by the halfe: for reason telleth you that your fold must couer somewhat vnseene, which being drawne forth at length and laid plaine, sheweth all faire and perfect: as Ouid saith of tapistry.

               You must moreouer in diapering, let your worke fall out so, that there may be an affinitie, one part with the other, maintaining one branch or the same worke throughout, setting the fairest in the most eminent place, and causing it to runne vpward: otherwise one might imagine some foolish Tailor had cut out his Ladies gowne the wrong way.
               To make a chamlet, you shall draw but fiue lines waued ouerthwart, if your diapering consist of a double line; you may either shadow the ground, and leaue it white, or shadow your worke, and leaue the ground white: as you shall thinke good, in this kind your filling may be with small pricks of your pens end, which will shew faire.

                   &c. which you shall not finde in the Elephant, Cow, Beare, or Hog, as being beasts heauie and sloathfull by nature: Moreouer wanting

that finenesse of coate or hide, so that you shall escape a great trouble in shewing veines, knitting of ioynts, with the eminency almost of euery bone in them which you haue in a horse & greyhound. Now for the manner of drawing these or any other beast whatsoeuer; begin with your lead or coale (as before I told you, and gaue you a generall rule) at the forehead, drawing downward the nose, mouth, vpper and nether chap, ending your line at the throat, then searching it againe where you began, from the forehead ouer the head, eares, and necke: continuing it till you haue giuen the full compasse of the buttocke, but I will giue you an example.
               
                  I begin in this Lion my first stroke at A, bringing it downe to B, making the nose, mouth, and nether chap wth one line, as you s

                   his mane by prickes with my penne (because if I should make a line, I could not make it iagged) then bring I the backe downe to the taile or D, leauing a little space for it, I continue my line from thence to E, or the heele, where I rest: then beginne I againe at B, and making the breast with the eminency thereof I stay at F, bringing out his neere sore foote, which I finish: then beginne I at

G, not stirring my hand till I come to the foote or paw at H, where I finish it quite at E, or the heele. I next draw from his belly two strokes at I and K: I make the other legge behinde, then the right fore foote issuing from the breast: then I finish the taile, pawes, tongue, teeth, beard, and last of all the shadowing: which methode you shall obserue in all beastes howsoeuer they stand.
               
                  Obseruations of the shadowing.
                  YOu see him shadowed on the backe side from CD, vnto E, the reason is the light beateth on his fore part, wherefore of necessitie the shadow must be in euerie part behinde, eare, mane, backe, hinder legge, &c.
                  But you may say, how happeneth it then, that his nether chap & some part of his throate and belly are shadowed being both with the light? I answere the light of it owne nature can n

                  The treble shadow as it ought, is giuen to the most inward places: if your beast be not in charge, that is, not in armes, and you arme to shew the ground vnder his feet; you must make his farther feet on the other side somewhat shorter then those next you: the reason is, that distance of earth between thē
                     
deceiueth the sight, causing the neerer to seeme longest: as you may see by opening or stretching your fore and middle finger like a paire of compasses long waies from you, vpon a boord or table, drawing them with your pen as they stand, and obseruing the space betweene.

there is in a manner a disproportion betweene his forepart and them: so that if I should draw him in this manner among our ordinary painters, my work would be condemned as lame, when I deserued most commendation.

                  Of Birdes.
                  There is lesse difficulty in drawing birdes then beasts, and least of all in flowers, yet art and needfull directions to be obserued in all of them: begin your draught in a bird, as I said, at the head, and beware of making it too big: Van Londerseet's peeces are much to blame for this fault, for in most of them the heads of all his birds are too great by a third part, neither is that fault proper to him alone, but to many

good workemen else. You shall best remedie that by causing a bird to be held or tied before you, where you shall take with your compasses a true proportion, which afterwards you may conclude into as small a forme as you list: there is not the same reason of proportion (it is true) in the heads and bodies of all birds alike, but hereby you shall euer after be acquainted with a reasonable proportion, which though you hit not iustly, you shal come very neere: hauing drawne the head, bring from vnder throat, the breast line downe to the legs; there stay: and begin at the pineon to make the wing, which being ioyned with the backe line is presently finished: the eye, legs, and traine must be at last, and (as I tolde you before in beasts) let the farther leg euer be shortest, the feathers as the hair
                        •
                      in beasts, must take their beginning at the head very small, and in fiue rankes fall one way backward greater and greater, as this your example sheweth.
                  
                     The birdes that are most easie to be drawn, are Planipedes, or water foule, as the Mallard, Shoueler, Sheldrake, Goose, Swanne, Herne Bitter, &c. the next are those which are called Oiseaux du Proye, birds of Prag, as the Eagle, Hawke, Puttocke, Cormorant, &c. The hardest are the tame birdes, with some other, as Cocke, Turkicocke, Peacocke, Phesant, &c. the action of birds

is flying, pruning themselues, bathing, fishing, swimming, &c.
                  For flowers, flies, and such like, I will leaue them (being things of small moment) to your owne discretion, counselling you a

To draw a flower, begin it ab vmbone, or the bosse in the midst: as in a Rose, or Marigold, there is a yealow tuft, which being first made, draw your lines equally diuided, from thence to the line of your compasse, which you are the first to giue, and then the worst is past.
                  You may shew your flower, either open and faire in the bud, laden with deaw and wet, worme-eaten, the leaues dropt away with ouer ripenesse, &c. and as your flower, so first draw rudely your leaues, making them plaine with your coale or lead, before you giue them their veines or iaggednesse.

               CHAP. XVIII. Of the Sence of seeing, and of the Eye.

                  hall not be amisse as well for methode as for pleasure, to speake somewhat of that sensitiue part of the soule which we call sight, without which it were in vaine for mee to discourse of colours, or you to read what I haue written concerning the same, therefore in briefe I will declare the worthinesse of this sence, and of the Eye the Organe or instrument thereof.
               To begin with the definition, the Sence of seeing is a facultie of the sensible soule, whose Organe is the Eye, and obiect is whatsoeuer may be seene.
               Now since the soule is farre more worth then the bodie, I must of necessitie first speake of this most ex
                  
                     •
                  ellent sence before I come to the baser and corruptible instrument, or the obiect thereof.
               It hath beene a great and ancient controuersie amongst the best Philosophers, I mean Plato, Aristotle the Stoicks, and Academicks, whether visus fieret, extra vel intra mittendo, that is, whether we receiue the obiect or that which we see into our eye, or whether our eye by a secret facultie of the soule casts and sendeth forth certaine beames to apprehend that which we looke vpon, which question as it is hard to decide, so it is most pleasant and not beside our purpose to bee resolued in the same. Heare I pray

you the varietie of opinions among excellent men.
               
                  Plato thought that the sight was caused by Emission or casting forth beames against the obiect.

                     tendo, by sending forth from the eye: and all sight to stretch it selfe forth in the forme of a Pyramis, the Conus or point whereof was in the eye ball, and the Basis dispersed vpon the obiect.
               
                  Empedocles (as also Plato) thought there was in the eye a certaine little fire not burning, but which yeelded as it were a light, the beames whereof, meeting with the beames of the ayre or medium, grew vnited, and more strong betweene both which beames the sight was effected.
               
                  Democritus said (the truest) that it proceeded of water, but he is taxed of Aristotle, because he though, visionem in rei spectabilis simulachro tantum consistere: Others thought that it cast forth a certaine animall spirit with the beame.
               Others againe supposed that that s

                   stretching it selfe vnto the obiect, and beaten backe to be possessed of the same forme, and afterward the soule as it were stirred vp to perceiue the formes of things by meanes of that secret facultie it sent forth.
               Neither did the Platonicks and Stoicks want arguments of strength and probability as they thought to maintaine the same against Aristotle: I will propound some, and after answere them letting or receiuing.
               
                  
                  1 First say they, if sight be caused by emission, then the neerer and closer the obiect is to the eye, the more perfectly it is perceiued, but this is false.
                  2 Secondly, if sight be caused by intromission or receiuing in the forme of that which is seene, contrarie Species, or formes should be receiued confusedly together, and at the same instant, as white and black, which thing how absurd it is, Aristotle shewes in his Metaphisickes and other places.
                  3 Thirdly, the eye is easily wearied with beholding, therefore something proceedeth forth from the same.

                  5 Fiftly, we find by experience, that a menstruous woman infecteth with her sight a looking glasse, causing the same to become faint and dimme, therefore of necessitie something must needes proceede out of her eyes. This Aristotle himselfe confesseth, Lib. de somnijs.

                     •
                  irst argument I answere out of Plato, as also

out of Aristotle, that to the affecting of the sight, there must be medium illustratum, a clee
                     •
                  e medium, that is, such a distāce that there may be light enough betweene the eye and the obiect, which there is not, if you lay your eye close to the same.
               To the second I answere, that species or formes be not contrarie, for were that granted, the medium should haue in it infinite contrarieties from euerie part of the ayre compassing it about, and continually multiplying the formes of things.
               To the third, the sence of seeing is so farre forth weakened and made faint
                     •
                   as the eye, the Organe or Instrument therof becommeth vnable to endure beholding, for the power of the sight suffereth not, nor groweth old, as were an old mans eyes young, his sight would not faile him.
               To the fourth argument I answere, that distance being not perceiued by the eye, but by the common sence, the point of the Pyramis is not lesser to mine eye, by remouing or going backe, but alwaies one and the selfe same.
               To the fift, it is not the sight of the woman that infecteth the glasse, but certaine grosse and putrefacted vapors, that issue from the eies, as we see in those that doe laborare opthalmia.
               
               To the sixt, of the Basiliske, I answere the most haue held it fabulous, yet suppose it to be true, the best authors haue written that infection proceedeth from his breath not his eyes.
               To the seuenth and last, it is replied, that cats and wolues retaine a certaine naturall light in N

                     •
                  iscerne

plainly any thing by night.
               To conclude to these and all other obiections for emission of the sight, in briefe I answere with this dilemma vnanswerable.
               If any thing be sent out from the eye it is either corporeal or incorporeal, if corporeal, it hath motū localē, or mouing in place and time, which motion seemeth to be swifter then the motiō of the heauen, for the eye in a minute can discerne from one part of the heauen to the other, which were repugnant to truth and all Philosophie. Say it were light and no corporall substance, it followed, though that a sensitiue part of the soule went forth with the same, and that an accident should become the subiect of the soule, nothing can be granted more absurd. If incorporeall, as Metaphysicall, it cannot mooue the sence: Now it remaineth, that according to Aristotle and the truth, wee decide this controuersie concerning the sight, wherein so many famous Philosophe
                     •
                  s haue beene blind.
               
                  How sight is caused according to Aristotle.
                  
                     Aristotle saith, that the motion which passeth or commeth betweene the eye, and the obiect, whether it be the light or ayre, is the efficient cause of sight, his words bee, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
                  To explaine his meaning better, there concurreth to sight a double motion one from the obiect into the medium, the other from the medium (ayre or 
                        •
                     ight) to the eye, so that I may say the eye receiues

the forme of the obiect at a second hand, as it were from the medium, being conueyed as it were halfe the way by a former motion. For Aristotle in his second de anima, strongly proueth against Democritus 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         non pati ab obiecto sed à medio. So that sight is caused by receiuing the colour or obiect into the eye by a second motion against Plato,

                     ded of white and blacke or no.
                  
                     Theophrastus hath long since laboured to prooue blacke to be no colour at all, his reason is, because

that colour is proper to none of the elements, for saith he, water, ayre and earth are white, and the fire is yellow, but rather would fetch it from white and yealow, whereto Scaliger leauing Aristotle, perhaps for singularitie sake, seemeth to giue consent, who sets downe foure primarie or first colours, viz.
                     
                        White in the drie bodie
                        as the earth.
                        Greene in thicke and moist
                        as the water.
                        Blew in the thin and moyst
                        as the ayre.

                        as the fire.
                     
Yet not without reason, for Aristotle affirmed that black was the priuation of white, as darknesse of light, to whom Scaliger replies, that nothing can be made of priuation and habit, but we will leaue their arguments, and proceede to the species and seuerall kindes of colours, shewing by their Etymologies, their seuerall nature, and af

                  How to make your Or, or yealow vpon glasse.
                  Your yealow is made in this manner, take an old groate, or other peece of the purest and best refined siluer, that you can get, then take a good quantity of Brimstone, and melt it, when ye haue done, put your

                     luer into the Brimstone melted, and take it forth, gaine with a paire of pliers or small tongues, and light it at the fire, holding it in your tongues vntil it leaue burning: then beate your siluer in a brazen Morter to dust, which dust take out of the Morter, & laying it on your Marble stone, grinde it (adding vnto it a small quantitie of yealow Oker) with gum Arabeck water, and when you haue drawne with your pencell what you will, let it of it selfe throughly drie vpon the glasse.
               
               
                  Another faire Gold or yealow vpon Glasse.
                  Take a quantitie of good siluer, and cut it in small peeces: Antemonium beat to powder, and put them together in a crucible or melting cruse, and set them

on the fire, well couered round about, with coales for the space of an houre: then take it out of the fire, and cast it into the bottome of a candlesticke, after that beat it small into powder, and so grinde it.
                  Note when as you take your siluer, as much as you meane to burne, remember to waye against

                  Argent or white.

                  Azure, Gules, and Vert.
                  These three colours are to be vsed after one manner, you may buy or speake vnto some merchant you are acquainted withall, to procure you what coloured beads you will, as for example, the most

and perfectest red beads, that can be come by, to make you a faire red, beat thē into powder, in a brazen Mortar, then buy the Goldsmiths red Ammell, which in any case let be very transparent & through-shining, take off the beads two pearles, & of the Ammell one part, and grinde them together as you did your siluer, in the like sort may you vse all the other colours.
               
               
                  Another faire red vpon Glasse.
                  Take a quantity of Dragons bloud, called in Latine Sanguis Draconis, beate it into fine powder in a Mortar, and put it in a linnen cloth, and put thereto strong Aquauitae, and straine them together in a pot, and vse them when you need.
               
               
                  Another excellent greene vpon Glasse.
                  Take a quantity of vert grease, and grinde it very with Turpentine, when you haue done, put it into a pot, and as often as you vse it warme it on the fire.
               
               
                  To make a faire Carnation vpon a Glasse.
                  Take an ounce of Tinne-glasse, one quarter of gum, of Iet three ounces, of red Oker fiue ounces, and grind them together.
               
               
                  Another blacke.
                  Take a quantity of yron scales, and so many copper scales, and waie them one against another, and halfe as much Iet, and mixe them well together.
                  Before you occupie your scales, let them be stamped small, and put them into a cleane fire shouell,

and set them vpon the fire till they be red hote, and they will be the better.

                  viz.
                  
                     The Crosse containing the fifth part of the Escotcheon being charged the three.
                     The chiefe containing a third part.
                     The Pale also a third part.
                     The Bend a fifth part.
                     The Fesse a third part.
                     The Escotcheon a fifth part.
                     The Cheueron a fifth part.
                     The Salteir a fifth part vncharged.
                     The Barre a fifth part.
                  
               
               The Crosse is called in Latine Crux, à cruciando, for it was nothing else then an Instrument of execution among the old Romanes, it hath beene a very ancient bearing, yea euen before the birth of our Sauiour Christ among the Paynims themselues. Though they knew it not but in their blazon, they made the field gules, and called the charge foure cautions, bilfets or cantonez, touching the dignity of the Crosse, and the worthinesse of the bearing, I will, wanting words to expresse the same, referre my selfe to the ancient Fathers, who haue had this signe in such estimation and reuerence, That one may serue in stead of many, I will as farre as I can remember, report vnto you the words of Chrysostome in a Sermon of his:
                     Chrysost. in serm. quod Christus sit De
                           •
                        s.
                   The Crosse (saith he) which was wont to be reputed the onely signe of disgrace, is now become the glory and boasting of vs Christians, insomuch

as the most noble part of our bodie is signed therewith in our baptisme, we vse it in our praiers, in diuine seruice, we set it vp in our houses, yea at our beds heads, brides and bride groomes are adorned therewith, souldiers when they goe to the warres, marriners carry it on the tops of their ships, yea the bodies of bruite beasts ill affected are marked herewith, so that I cannot imagine (these being the words of a deuout and most learned father of the Greeke Church, and Archbishop of Constantinople who liued twelue hundred yeares since) that the signe of the crosse is so perilous a thing as most Puritanes would make it. I should fill more sheetes of paper then they would be willing to read, or my selfe to write, if I should report what hath bene said by Saint Augustine, Athanasius, Saint Hierome, and others in defence of lawfulnesse of the same. But I remember that I am writing of Heraldrie, not of those things that cōcerne controuersies in diuinity.

                  The chiefe is so called of the French word Chief, and that from the Greeke 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , which is the head or vpper part, this possesseth the vpper third part of the Schocheon, and is diuided by one line in this manner.
            
            
               Cosm.
               I vnderstand this verie well, proceede, I pray to the pale.
            
            
               Of the Pale.
               
                  Eud.
                  The Pale is the third middle part of the Scocheon, being diuided from the chiefe to the base, or nether part of the Scotcheon with two lines as thus:

Is called from the Latine palus, which is a Pale or peece of woode, wherewith wee fence about Gardens, Parks, Fields and such like. This in ancient time was called a tierce, and you should then haue blazed it thus, hee beares a fierce Sables betweene two fierces, or which will seeme strange to some of our Heralds.
               
            
            
               Of the Bende.
               The French Heralds call this Bande, it resembleth a kinde of Baudricke or girdle, which knights wore in times past ouer the right shoulder, and vnder the left,

whereat their swords hung. Some vnknowne Godfather long since hath named it in Latine Bend
                        •
                     , it hath a fift part of the Escotcheon, beginning from the dexter part, or the right corner of the l

                  ston, which is like, and the same with a Cotize, saue that it must not touch the Scotcheon at both the ends, this is reserued for a difference of kindred or alliance among Princes, as it is to be seene in the house of Burbon in France.
               
                  Cosm.
                  I haue heard say that a bend sinister is the marke of a bastard, it hath beene taken so, but I hope you will not make that proposition, conuertibilis:
                     
For I haue knowne it borne by some lawfully borne, whose ancestors before them were legitimate.

                  Here is a bend sinister.
               
               
                  Cosm.
                  If it had bene brought then from the other side, it had beene dexter and right.
               
               
                  Eud.
                  Very true.

                     The fesse is so called of the Latine word fascia a band or girdle, possessing the third part of the Scotcheon ouer the middle, as thus, If there bee aboue one, you must call them barres, if the field with there be

                  Cosm.
                  
                     To tell you true, I know not.

it is held of all furres in nature the most precious, because they write, that when this beast is hunted, rather then he will runne ouer a puddle, or any dirtie place, where his skin may be endāgered to be spotted with mire, he will stay there, and be torne in peeces with the dogs: which gaue me an occasion of an Embleme (what time I turned his Maiesties ΒΑΣΙΛΙΚΟΝ ΔΩΡΟΝ
