            TO THE RIGHT VVORSHIPFVLL SYR EDVVARD COOKE KNIGHT, His Maiesties Attorney generall:
            SYR, I had no sooner taken a sight of your last Booke, entituled: The fifth Part of Reportes (vvhich vvas some number of monethes after the publication therof in England) but there entred vvith the reading, a certaine appetite of ansvvering the same, and this vpon different motiues, as vvell in regarde of your person and place, abilitie and other circumstances depending theron; as also of the subiect and argument it selfe, vvhich yovv handled, and manner held in handling therof, to 
                  •
               he greatest preiudice, vvrong, and disgrace of Catholickes, and Catholicke religion that you could deuise.
            And first in your person and place, I considered your facultie and profession of the common lavves of our Realme, your long standing, and speciall preferment therin, your experience, and iudgemēt gathered thereby, your estimation and credit in the Common-vvealth, and your authority, honour, and riches ensuing thervpon; all



vvhich drevv me to the greater consideration of your Booke, but principally your said profession of our Common temporall Municipall lawes, vvhich science aboue all other,  A strāge attempt to impugne Catholicke religion by Catholicke Princes lawes in Englād. next to Diuinitie it selfe, doth confirme, and conuince vnto the vnderstanding of an English-man, the truth of the Catholicke Roman religion. For so much as from our very first Christian Kings & Queenes, vvhich must nedes be the origen, and beginning of all Christian common lavves in England, vnto the raigne of King Henry the eight, for the space of more then nyne hundred yeares, all our Princes and people being of one, and the selfe same Catholicke Roman religiō, their lavves must needes be presumed to haue byn conforme to their sense and iudgment in that behalfe, and our lavvyers to the lavves: so as novv to see an English temporall lavvyer to come forth, and impugne the said Catholicke religion, by the antiquity of his Common-lavves, throughout the tymes and raignes of the said Kings, in fauour of Protestāts, Lutheranes, Caluinistes, or other professors not knovvne in those dayes, is as great a nouelty and vvonder, as to see a Philosopher brought vp in Aristotles schole, to impugne Aristotle by Aristotles learning, in fauour of Petrus Ramus, or any other such nevv aduersary, or lately borne Antagonist: Or as to behold an ancient Phisitian, trayned vp in Galens


               
tents, to fight against Galen and Galenistes, out of their ovvne bul-vvarkes, or fortresses, yea and this in ayde of Paracelsians, or any other fresh crevv of Alchimian doctors vvhatsoeuer.
            3. This first consideration then, of your person, place, and profession, did inuyte me strongly to come, and see vvhat you said in this behalfe, but no lesse did the argumēt or subiect of your booke, togeather vvith your māner of treating the same, of vvhich tvvo points I shall speake seuerally; for that they haue seuerall ponderations, & all in my opinion both important, rare, and singular. For vvhat more important matter can be thought of among Christiās, The importance of M. Attorneys Plea. then to treat of Spirituall Power, & Ecclesiasticall Authority, being the kinges bench of Christ on earth, the table of his scepter, the tribunall of his dominion & iurisdiction, vvhereof dependeth the vvhole direction of soules, the remission of our sinnes, the efficacy of his Sacraments, the lavvfulnes of all priesthoode and ministery, the gouernment of the vvhole Church, and finally the vigour, frute, & effect of all Christian religion. This is the importance of your argument M. Attorney, and consider I pray you, vvhether it standeth vs not much in hand, to be attentiue vvhat you say, and hovv substantially you pleade in this matter.
            4. And as for the other tvvo circumstances of



rarenes, and singularity, vvhere may they more be seene, then in this so vveighty a case, conteyning the vvhole povver of the sonne of God, both in heauen, and earth, for so much as belongeth to remission of sinnes and gouernement of his earthly inheritance, vvhich is heere handled and ouer-ruled by a temporall lavvyer, and by him giuen to a temporall Lady and Queene; and this not only by force of a temporall Statute, made in Parlamēt to that effect, the first yeare of her raigne, vvhereby Ecclesiasticall Supremacy vvas ascribed vnto her, The singularity of M. Attorneyes paradox. but by the very vigour of her temporall crovvne it self, vvithout any such Statute, and by vertue of the ancient pretended Common-lavves of our Realme, vvhich Common-lavves being made, receaued, introduced, and established by Catholicke Kings and Queenes, as hath byn said, maketh the matter so strange and rare, the vvonder & admiration so great, as neuer paradox, perhaps in the vvorld, seemed more rare & singular in the eyes of Philosophers, then this in the iudgement of learned Deuines. And vvho then vvould not be allured vvith this singular nouelty to search somvvhat after the depth of so nevv deuised a mystery?
            5. After this ensueth, as considerable, your methode, & manner of handling this subiect, vvhich to me seemeth nothing vulgar, and consequently

               9. Out of vvhich I must here againe repeat one thing briefly, vvhich there I haue more at large declared, and more earnestly vrged, to vvit the obligation you haue both in honour and conscience, according to the rules of all true Christian diuinitie, to enforme rightlie his Maiesty in certayne pointes, vvherin your self being at that time deceaued, misinformed also his highnes, at the first presentation of your Booke vnto him, if my information thereof be true. And for that the point it self is of very great consequence, 
                  M. Attorney bound in conscience and honour to enforme a nevv his Maiesty.
                and that the misconceat or vvrong impression of his Maiesty, ma

               e be to the great preiudice of manie of his dutifull subiectes, I am the more earnest to vrge this obligation vpon you, especiallie for that I vnderstand, that since the edition of your booke, you haue in a certayne publicke Act, solemne assemblie, and most honorable auditorie, repeated againe, and auouched the said iniurious assertion, concerning Catholickes, that their Recusancy began vpon disloyaltie, by occasion of the excommunication of Q. Elizabeth by Pope Pius Quintus vpon the eleuenth yeare of her raigne, and for that cause, and not before, nor vpon anie other motiue.

            12. You said at the very first entrance vnto your speach in that place, that you vvould speake of nothing but of the late most horrible treason, vvhich for distinctiōs sake you vvould call the Iesuits treason.
For if it be iust (saie you) that euery thing be called by the name of the Author, then seing the Iesuits haue byn the Authors of this treason, you vvould not doe them the iniurie, to take from them anie thing vvhich is theirs, or to miscall anie thing vvhich appertayneth properlie to them, especiallie seing in euery crime: plus peccat auctor quàm actor;
the author is more culpable and blame-vvorthie then the actor, as is apparent by the example (saie you) of Adam, Eue, and the Serpent, where the Serpent for that it was the first author of that attempt,

               committed three sinns, Eua that was tempted, two sinns, and Adam that was the chiefest actor, but one sinne. This vvas your eloquence at that time, & I doubt not but that the learned prisoner standing at the barre, vvhome you othervvise so

               hat the prisoner there present, had receaued only a simple notice of that treason, by such a meanes as he could not vtter, and reueale againe by the lavves of Catholicke doctrine, that is to saie, in Confession, and this but a very fevv daies before the discouerie, but yet neuer gaue anie consent, helpe, hearkening, approbation, or cooperation to the same; but contrari-vvise sought to dissuade, dehorte, and hinder the designment by all the meanes he could.
            14. And is this sufficient M. Attorney, to laie the



denomination of this foule fact, vpon the vvhole order of Iesuites? that one of them, or tvvo at the most knevv thereof by such a vvaie, as probablie they could not auoid, Hovv things heard in confessiō may not be vttered by Catholick doctrine. or preuent the knovvledge, not fore-seeing vvhat he penitent vvould confesse, and once hauing heard it in that manner, remained bound by the inuiolable seale of that Sacrament not to vtter the same, but in such manner as the confitent should allovv of, though neuer so great temporall dammage vvere imminent for the concealement. And this is the sacred band of a Catholicke priestly conscience, much like to that of Angells, vvho though they knovv manie great hurtes or dangers to hang ouer kingdomes, States, Common vvealthes, or particuler men, & be desirous out of their loue to mankinde to preuent the same; yet are they not free to reueale vvhat they knovv thereof in regarde of anie future good or hurt vvhatsoeuer, but onlie vvhere they are permitted, and licenced in particular: & yet ar they not iustlie to be accompted accessarie to the euills that fal out, & much lesse authors of the same for their silence, or not reuealing, as in this case of the Iesuits you labour to inferre.

But this defect I suppose that all your auditorie did not obserue, by reason of the multitude of other tumultuary matters, dravvne in by you against the said prisoner, but yet your Rhetoricke in amplifying one point, about the first lavv alleadged against the comming in of Priests and Iesuitts, vvas so markeable, as no man I thinke, vvas so dull, as did not obserue it, and beare it avvay. To vvit, that vvhereas the said lavv did forbid all Priests, vnder paine of death and treason, not to come into England, or execute anie parte of their priestlie function vvithin the Realme, as to preach, teach, offer sacrifice, heare Confessions, absolue from sinnes, reconcile to God, and to the vnion of his Catholicke Church, dissuade from sects and heresies, and other like offices; you in commendation of that lavv, protested to proue it, to be the most myldest law, the sweetest law, the law most full of mercy and pitty, that euer was enacted by any Prince so iniuriously prouoked.

this point sufficientlie at the barre, as also to the Lordes before in the tovver, and a more large discourse maie be made therof hereafter, if neede shall require.
            19. As for your other article, about the Antiquity and continuance of your Church, a man maie easily see, that you sought an occasion to bring it in, by making an obiection on the behalfe of Iesuitts against the same, About the antiquity & vniuersality of the Protestant Church. and thereby to shevv your skill in ansvvering. They hold their religion (saie you) to be the old Religion, where ours is the new, confyned to England; where on the contrary side their Religion is vniuersall, and embraced in the greatest part of this Christian worlde. And thus for the maintenance of their rotten Religion, doe they seeke to disgrace and blemish our Ghospell. But (good syr) if your ghospell be that of the foure Euangelistes novv receaued, vve pretend that it is as much our ghospell as yours, and more also, for that you receaued it from vs, and vpon our Churches credit, and for that you call rotten Religion, if euer it vvere Religion, then neuer can it rott, except you put no difference betvvene apples and religion. But let vs heare hovv you vvill ansvvere this obiection in your ovvne vvordes, as they came set dovvne vnto me from your ovvne mouth.
            20. But to this (saie you) I will answere, that if our Ghospell be as ancient as Luther, it is more ancient then



the Iesuitts are (though not I trovv then Iesuitts religion) albeit it be not conteyned in these narrow limitts of place,

For we doe not deny but that Rome was the mother-Church, and had thirty two virginall martyrs of her Popes a-row, & so continued til in succeeding ages it brought in a masse of errors, and idle ceremonyes. But you will aske perhaps, where our Church lurked before Luthers coming, for some hundreds of yeares? But I say it makes no great matter where it was, so that I

And this haue you gained by leauing the Roman, vvhich you graunt in old times to haue byn the holy mother-Church: see vvherevnto you are come, and this shall suffice for this matter.
            35. This epistle vvould grovv ouerlong, if I should entertaine my self in all the impertinent speeches, vvhich you had that daie (in your glorie as it semeth) against Catholickes, the least parte vvhereof, did in vvise-mens sightes, concerne the prisoner at the barre, though by your Rhetoricall application, all vvas dravven vpon him by hooke or by crooke: for that Yorke, VVilliams, Colen, Squiar and Lopus vvere brought

            36. And vvhereas you saie that he came into England, with purpose to prepare the way, against the great compounded nauy that followed in the yeare 1588. It is euident that his comming into England,

Your combinations also of bookes and attemptes, the one allwaies (as you saie) accompanying the other, though you esteemed it perhaps a vvittie fine deuise, and probable to the vnlearned hearers that cannot distinguish of



times or things; yet others that looked into the matter more iudiciouslie, and found neither coherence of time, or subiect, betvveene the booke by you named, and the attempts pretended, laughed in their sleeues, remembring the saying of the Poet:

                  ons. vvhich vvordes importe that Dolmans booke did accompanie Squiars treason, but he that shall examine the order of Chronologie, shal fynde in this matter, that Dolmans booke vvas in print foure yeares (at least) before Squiars treason (if he committed treason) vvas euer heard of; nor hath the argument of the booke anie more affinitie at all vvith Squiars fact, then hath a fox vvith a figg tree, but onlie that your floating Chimeraes, intoxicating (to vse your ovvne vvordes) your hearers braynes, doe make you seeme to speake oftentimes mysticallie, vvhen in deede you speake miserablie.
            37. Yovv remember (I thinke) hovv the aforesaid gentleman in his booke (for others doe not forget it) gaue you a friendlie reprehension, by the vvordes of the famous Orator Catulus, or rather



of Cicero in his name, 
                  Cicero de Oratore.
                for a ridiculous fact of yours in vveeping, and shedding manie teares in follovving the fiction of Squiars conspiracie at the barre, therebie to vvynne credit, and shevv your self admirable at that time to the Earle of Essex, and others in authoritie: but novv I am to expostulate vvith you vpon this occasion, for another no lesse patheticall excesse, vttered in pleading against M. Garnet, vvherein not so much your teares did run, as your haires did stand and stare, and your eares glovv, to heare blasphemie vttered by him in a certaine letter of his intercepted: VVherein (saie you) was conteyned one of the most horrible blasphemyes that euer I heard proceed from any Atheist, and maketh my haire to stand on end to thinke of it. So you saie.
            38. And vvhat vvas this horrible blasphemie (good Syr) that put your tender, and religious hart in such a pittifull plight and horror? It follovveth that he had written with the iuyce of a lemmō to his friendes abroad out of the tower, that he had byn often examined, but nothing was produced against him, but yet, necesse est, vt vnus homo moriatur pro populo. 
               A fond fayned blasphemy. So you alleadged the text, and added presentlie: See how he assumeth most blasphemously to himself the wordes that were spoken of Christ our Sauiour, but I hope ere he dy, he will repent him of this blasphemy.
            
            39. But (good Syr) did you looke vpon the place



of S. Iohns gospell, before you recited the same, and plaied this pageant in so solemne an essemblie? Yf you did, then vvill you fynd that these vvordes vvere spoken by an euill man, 
                  Ioh. 11. vnto an euill sense in his ovvne meaning, to vvit by Caiphas, 
               The meaning of Caiphas in speaking of the death of Christ. that persuaded first in a Councell gathered vpon the resuscitation of Lazarus, to put Christ to death, thereby to content the Romanes, vvho had the vvhole Ievvish nation in iealosie of their loyaltie tovvardes the Emperour, and that novv by putting one to death that vvas accused (though falslie) to denie tribute to be paied to Cesar, they should cleere their credit vvith the said Emperour, and by his onlie death preuent the destruction of the said Ievvish people by the Romane armies, and therefore he said: Expedit nobis, vt vnus homo moriatur pro populo, & non totagens pereat. 
               
                  Luc. 13. It is expedient for vs, that one man dy for the people, to the end the vvhole nation be not destroied. And therefore he saieth not necesse est, as you cite the vvordes, but expedit, to shevv his politicall drift therein.
            40. And this being Caiphas his crastie and vvicked counsaile, and his vvordes in his sense, bearing this meaning, the holie ghost (vvhich as S. Chrysostome and other holie Fathers doe affirme,

               ostantum, & non scelestum eius cor attigit, moued his tongue and not his vvicked mind, and vvas in



his vvordes, not in his sense) made him vnvvittinglie to vtter a prophesie, and a great high misterie, that except one man (to vvit Christ) should die for the sinnes of the people, none could be saued. Novv then (Syr) this sentence of Caiphas hauing tvvo meanings and senses, The meaning of M. Garnet in vsing the wordes of Caiphas.
                as you haue heard, let vs examine vvhich vvas most probable to be vsed and alluded vnto by M. Garnet, vvho gathering by manie coniectures, that you, and some other of his good friendes, had a great desire to bring the Iesuitts vvithin the compasse of this late odious treason, or at least-vvise vvithin the suspition or hatred thereof, for that the lay-gentlmen partakers of the fact, vvere thought to be deuoted tovvardes them, and their Order; and seing that God vnexpectedlie had deliuered him into your handes, he might verie vvell thinke, that he at least should paie for the rest, and die also of likeli-hood for disgracing the rest, and in that sense alluded to the vvordes of Caiphas, tending to like policie.
            41. But novv for the second sense, vvhich particularlie designed the death of Christ our Sauiour, for the redemption of man-kinde, none I thinke is so simple, as vvould imagine M. Garnet to applie to himself, though in this point also M. Attorney is to be taught out of true



diuinitie, that diuerse places vttered litterallie of Christ in holie scripture, maie secondarily also by allusion be applied vnto men, and this vvithout all horror of blasphemie, or imputation of Atheisme, vvhich are M. Attorneyes passionate accusations in this place. As for example, vvhere the Prophet vvriteth of him: 
                  Isa. 60. 
               Et cum iniquis reputatus est: he vvas esteemed vvith the vvicked; vvhich vvas meant immediatlie and principallie by the holie-ghost of Christ, and yet by allusion it maie be applied to anie of his seruants. And that other place; 
                  Psal. 109. 
               De torrente in via bibit, propterea exaltauit caput: and infinite other throughout all the nevv and old testament, spoken literallie of Christ, and yet by allusion applied to good men, as the ancient Fathers doe testifie in their vvorkes, applying to the members oftentimes that vvhich belongeth principallie to the head: so as herein M. Attorneyes haires needed not to stand vpon end, nor trouble themselues or their maister; neither vvas it nedefull that M. Attorney should praie for M Garnet to repent himself of this blasphemie (vvhich vvas none at all) before he dyed. God graunt Syr Edward Cooke be in state to make so cleere, and easy an accompt at his departure from this vvorld, as the other vvas, vvhich hardlie maie be hoped, considering their great difference of life & functions, except God vvorke a miracle,



or that solifidian iustification doe enter for smoothing of all, vvhich maketh all men equall, and equallie saincts.
            42. But to dravve to an end, one of your last triumphant speeches touching all Iesuits vvas, that they vvere Doctors of foure different doctrines; the one of dissimulation; Sundry calumniatiōs. the second of deposing Princes; the third of disposing of Kingdomes; the last of deterring Princes with feare of excommunications: and of all foure you discoursed vvith great resolution, and peremptorie determination, vvel assuring your self, that none in that place should haue meanes to ansvvere you, though there vvanted not manie, vvho out of their discretions, did note vvhere and hovv you might haue byn ansvvered vvith no small aduantage, as perhaps you may be hereafter more at large, vpon some other occasion.
            43. Novv onlie I thought good to put you in mind, that these, and other your discourses, founded commonlie vpon diuisions, and little concerning the prisoner, or matter in hand, vvere noted and borne avvaie, and this among the rest, vvas obserued; that you vvere more fertile in setting dovvne diuisions, then fruitfull aftervvard in prosecuting the same; yet in the last parte of this four-fold partition, about terrifying Princes with excommunications, you flovving novv vvith



full sea tovvardes the end of your accusations, men saie, that you insulted greatlie ouer Catholicke religion, & brought forth a booke of your ovvne compyling (to vvit your Reportes) pretending to shevv out of the same, that our English Kings in former ages, were nothing afrighted with the idle menaces of Papall excommunications; that one was condemned of high treason for bringing in a Bull against a subiect without the Kings licence: that the King was neuer reputed subiect to any Pope in Ecclesiasticall matters, but that himself was absolute: how the Popes Legates were often times stayed at Calles, vntill the King had giuen them licence to come into England, 
               
                  M. Attorney in his vaunting vayne. vvith manie other such points, partlie true, partlie false, partlie impertinent to the matter, partlie prouing de facto, and not de iure, partlie misalleadged, partly miscōstred, but altogeather misapplyed to the disgrace of that religion, for vvhose seruice al your lavves in those times & ages vvere instituted, and honoured: & yet you protested in that vaunting vaine of yours; that you were exceeding glad to see your moderne religion in this point, so agreable to the ancient lawes of the Realme, which lawes (quoth you) if they were exactly looked into, would restraine our Romish Catholickes for growing any further, as you hoped they would be.
            
            44. But Sir, hovv little ground of truth or substance all this hath in it, & hovv contrary effectes



the devv cōsideration of our English lavves may, & must needes vvorke in the mindes of al discreet men, tovvardes the setling of a stable iudgement and firme persuasion in fauour of Catholicke religion, All ancient English lavves in fauour of Catholicke religiō. in that the said lavves proceeded al from Catholicke Princes (though alvvaies I except such as doe frame their iudgement to the current of the present time, & doe subordinate their vnderstanding to their vvealth and honours) this (I saie) shal aftervvardes be so euidentlie declared in this Answere of ours throughout the vvhole booke, as no mā I suppose vvith any indifferēcy, or probability of reasō, shalbe able to deny or cōtradict the same.
            45. And in particular the Reader shall see refuted the seuerall members by you heere set dovvne, as namelie, hovv great and harty reuerence and respect our Catholicke Kings did euer beare vnto Ecclesiasticall Censures, not onlie of the Pope as supreme, but of their ovvne home-Bishopps also: and that no King in all that ranke for almost a thousand yeares, did euer hold himself absolute in Ecclesiasticall povver, vntill King Henry the eight; and that it cannot be true, The particulers brought in by M. Attorney refuted. vvhich heere & elsvvhere you so much bragg of, & bring forth vpon euery occasion (as the archer that had but one arrovv in his quiuer that vvould fly) hovv that in the raigne of King Edward the first, it was treason by the common-law for a subiect to bring in and



publish a Bull from Rome against a subiect, without the Kings licence; vvhich is your first obiection in that Kings life, and ansvvered by me after in the eleuenth Chapter of this booke.
            46. And as for the obiection of the Popes Legats or Nuntij detained somtimes by the Kings order at Calles, from entering the Realme, vntill some difference betvvene Popes and Kings vvere accorded, though it be so vveake a thing as deserueth no ansvvere, yet haue I ansvvered the same vpon diuers occasions, and shevved amongst other, that by this argument, if it vvere good, King Philip and Queene Mary might be said not to haue acknovvledged the Pope his spirituall authoritie, for that they deteined in Calles the messenger of Paulus Quartus,

                vvhen he brought the Cardinalls hat, and Legacy of England for Friar Peto in preiudice of Cardinall Poole, vvhich the said Princes vvould not suffer to be put in execution, vntill they had better informed the said Pope, vpon vvhich information & their intercession the controuersie ceased.
            47. Much other matter I doe vvillinglie pretermit (M. Attorney) vvhich you vttered that daie in contempt, & derogation of that religion, vvherby all your progenitors, yea all the Peeres and Princes of our Realme in precedent ages thought themselues both happie and honourable: and if



they had imagined that in future times an Attorney vvould haue stept vp to raile, and reuile that religion, calling it rotten and contemptible, & them all blind and deceaued people; vvhat an opinion (thinke you) vvould they haue fore-stallen of you? and hovv base and odious a conceit vvould they haue preconceaued against you? especiallie if they had seene you (as others did that stood neere) so caried avvaie vvith hereticall humour, as to vvander, and range, and runne from your matter in your pleading, to seeke occasion of insolent tauntes against them in such sort, as your vvhole subiect by your ovvne confession, being of treason, the most of your inuectiue speach vvas against their religion.
            48. For vvhich cause I thought my self bound to saie somevvhat in this behalfe, principallie to that vvhich is proper to the argument of your late booke of Reportes, heere by me ansvvered. For as for the other parte concerning treason, and the vvhole Act of the late arraignement about the same, I haue of purpose forborne to speake, as vvell for that it is a matter not appertayning to my facultie; The arraignment of M. Garnet.
                as also in regarde of the devv respect I beare both vnto the lavves, and customes of my countrie, my Princes person, and the honour of that great assemblie: in all vvhich I haue nothing to complaine of (all hauing passed by order) but



onlie of your extrauagant excursions, to confoūd religion and treason togeather: nay to make religion the fountaine of treason, and therby to inuolue vvithin the hatred of treason, all those that by conscience are tyed to that religion, be they neuer so innocent; than vvhich there can be no greater iniquitie imagined.
            49. VVith M. Garnets particular cause I vvill not meddle in this place, he is gone to his last Iudge, before vvhome also you, and others that haue had parte in the handling therof, must finallie appeare, to see confirmed or reuersed vvhatsoeuer hath passed in that affaire. As for that vvhich you & others so often vrged against him, to confesse, that he vvas lavvfullie condemned by the tēporal lavv of the land, importeth little for the impayring of his innocencie before almighty God.

                     t 24 and their error vvas not so much in the obiect, as in the subiect: for as for the lavv it self, vve fynd it in Leuiticus that blasphemie (vvhereof the highest degree vvas for a man to make himself God) vvas punishable by death; but the subiect, to vvit, the person of our Sauiour vvas mistaken, they esteeming him to be onlie man, vvhereas they ought to haue knovvne,



that he vvas God and man, as vvell in respect of the predictions of al the Prophets, foretelling that Christ should be the sonne of God; as also of his stupendious actions, that proued him to be trulie Christ: so as though the lavv alleadged by the Ievves against blasphemie & blasphemers, vvere true and in force of it self; yet held it not in the person of Christ, but vvas in the highest degree iniurious, as all Christian-men must confesse.
            50. Let vs see then hovv from this case of the maister, some light may be dravvne to that of his scholler and seruant. You, M. Attorney, pleaded against him, as the Ievves Attorneyes did against our Sauiour and said; Nos legem habemus &c. vve haue a lavv, that vvhosoeuer reuealeth not treason by such a space, shall be accessarie of treason, and dy as a traytor: nor do vve deny the lavv, or complaine thereof; but yet if this case vvere pleaded in a forrayne Catholicke countrie, vvhere the prisoner also shoulde haue his Attorney allovved him, he vvould saie on the other side: The priuiledge of secrecy to be obserued in Confession. 
               Nos legem habemus superiorem, Ecclesiasticam, Diuino iure intentam, qua sacerdos ne

                     que
                   puniri debet, ob proditionem sub confessionis figillo cognitam, & non reuelatam: vve haue a contrarie lavv, to vvit, an Ecclesiasticall and spirituall lavv, higher then your temporall, and a lavv founded on the lavv of God, vvhereby it is ordeyned, that a Priest shal neither dy, nor be



punished, nor be accompted traytor, for treason discouered vnto him vnder the seale of confession, and not by him reuealed; nay he shalbe punished, & that most grieuouslie, if he doe for anie cause reueale the same.
            51. And this plea of the prisoners Attorney (vvhich by Catholicke doctrine and schooles is easilie proued in all the partes or members heere set dovvne) vvould presentlie haue bene admitted in all Catholicke Countries and Courtes, and in ours also, vvhiles our Kings and people vvere of that religion, and your temporall lavv vvould haue byn put to silence. Oh, you vvill saie, but novv it is othervvise, and vve care not for your Ecclesiasticall lavv. VVherevnto I ansvvere: Gods truth alwayes & euerie where one. Psal. 116. 
               Veritas autem Domini manet in aeternum. If this lavv be foūded in Gods truth & vvas left vnto his Church by Christ himself the fountaine of al truth, for the honour and defence of his Sacrament of Confessiō, as al ancient diuinitie doth affirme; then must it for euer endure immutable: and novv and then, heere and there, this countrie and that countrie, this and that alteration of religion, or Princes temporall lavves, must not alter the case or substance of truth, either in Gods sight, or vvise mens eyes; and so M. Garnets case, dying for this truth in England novv, is no vvorse, then if he had dyed a thousand yeares gone for the same, either in England


               
or any other Cath. countrey, that is to say, he dying only for the bare cōcealing of that, vvhich by Gods, and the Churches Ecclesiastical lavvs he could not disclose, & giuing no cōsent or cooperation to the treasō it self, should haue byn accōpted rather a martyr then a traytor, & no lesse novv.
            52. VVhich being so, cōsider I besech you M. Attorney, vvhat a different reckoning there is like to be betvveene you tvvo, at your next meeting in iudgement: you knovv somvvhat by experience hovv dreadful a thing the forme of publicke iudgement is, but not so much as some others, for that hitherto it hath byn stil your lot to be actor & not reus, predominant both in vvordes & povver, and consequently terrible & nothing terrifyed: but vvhen the time and case shal come, vvherof the holie-ghost foretelleth vs: 
                  Sap. 5. 
               Stabunt iusti in magna constantia, aduersus eos qui se angustiauerunt. Iust men that vvere ouerborne in this vvorld shal stand vp boldly vvith great constancy, against those that ouerbare them: and vvhen the saying of our Sauiour shalbe fulfilled: 
                  Math. 7. 
               that euery man shal receaue, & be treated according to the measure wherby he hath measured to others; then vvil be the day of woe: neither doe I say this, M Attorney, to condemne your office, I knovv that in all tymes, vnder all Princes your office of Fiscal-Aduocate or Attorney hath byn in vse for the Princes seruice



and good also of the Common-vvealth if it be vvell and moderatelie vsed; but yet I cannot but friendlie put you in mind of that, vvhich holie S. Gregory doth admonish, vvhere he handleth the cause and reasons vvhy S. Peter, S. Andrew, S. Iames, and S. Iohn retourned to their art of fishing,

            53. In vvhich kinde trulie, Sir, if any office in the vvorld be daungerous in deed, yours may be accompted in the highest degree, that hath euery day almost his finger in bloud, or in particular mens afflictions, and ouerthrovves.

                  torneyes office. yet the Actor oftentimes runneth no small daunger of his soule through the passions of anger, hatred, reuēge, vain-glorie, couetuousnes, appetite of honour, and the like affections of mynd, vvhich peruert iustice, and vvherof most strait accompt must aftervvard be rendred for the same.
            54. And if in any part of the vvorld this Fiscall office and authority be full of perill, much more in England, vvhere his povver is much more absolute then in any other countrey vvhatsoeuer. For that in other Realmes the defendant for his life,



hath other Attorneyes, and learned counsell allovved him, as hath bene said; but in England all is committed in a certayne sort to the Kings Attorney onlie, vvhere the matter any vvay concerneth the Princes interest: and albeit he be svvorne to be equall, and indifferent betvvene the Prince and his subiect, especiallie in matters of life and death; yet doe all men see, hovv that is obserued, the Attorney thinking it his greatest honour to ouerthrovv any man that commeth in his vvay by all manner of opprobrious proceeding, by scoffs, iestes, exprobrations, vrging of odious circumstances, tales, inuentions, cōparisons, rhetoricall exaggerations, & the like; vvhich seemed in old time so vnciuill, and inhumane against men in misery, that diuers States and Cōmon-vvealthes, though Pagan and Gentile, did forbid them to be vsed by the Actor, notvvithstanding the lavv allovved them a defender and tvvice as much time for the defence, as the Actor had for his accusation.
            55. All vvhich points of ayd and comfort doe faile in our English tryall of life and death, and one more besides of singular importance, vvhich is, that the Iury commonlie is of vnlearned men, and therby easilie, either deceaued by crafty and coloured arguments of the accuser (not hauing time to examine, or iudgement to discerne them)



or led by false affectiōs, or terrifyed by force of authoritie, vvhich in graue learned Iudges vvere not so much to be feared. And by this may M. Attorney acknovvledg vvith me some part of the danger of his office, vvho by one onlie vvorde, looke, signe, or action, may oftentimes preiudice the bloud of the prisoners, that stande at the barre, & much more by so many exaggerations, reproaches, and insolencies vsed against them. VVho remembreth not that late hateful exprobration to the vnfortunate Earle, to vvhome it vvas obiected at the barre: that he thought to be the first King Robert, and novv he vvas like to be the last Earle of that name and hovvse. And the other yet more bitter vnto his Secretary Cuff, that you vvould giue him at length such a cuff, as should make his head to reele against the gallovves: these things to men in misery, are great encreasmētes no doubt of their calamityes, and so much the more, by hovv much they tasted of insolency, neuer allovved of by vvise and moderate men, tovvardes those that be in affliction or distresse. And thus vvill I end this my first speach vvith you, referring my self for the rest to that vvhich ensueth throughout this vvhole Answere.

            THE PREFACE TO THE READER. Concerning the weight, and importance of this our Controuersie; wherby may be resolued whatsoeuer is in question between men of different Religions at this day in England.
            
               ALBEIT the moment, and vtility of that we haue in hand (discreet Reader) will best be seene by perusall of the Treatise it self, and by thy iudicious consideration therof: yet for thy better encouragement to this labour, and to stirr thee vp to more attention herin; I haue thought good, to touch some points in generall, at this first entrance, remitting the larger, and more particular declaration therof, vnto that which is to ensue throughout the whole discussion of the Controuersie.
            2. First then, to pretermit the whole view of our English Christian antiquities, which heer by fit, and necessarie occasion is searched & laid open, togeather with the liues, and laws, gouerment, and Religion of all our Christian Kings, both before and after the Conquest; 
                  The important weight of this controuersy.
                This one point seemeth to me to be of most moment for the present; that wheras vnder the raigne of Queen Elizabeth (about whome principallie is our question) three sortes of Religion did stand vp, & striue togeather (and doe vnto this day) the Protestant, the Puritane, 
               
                  •
               nd the Catholicke: their whole contention seemeth to



mee to ly within the limits of this Controuersie, moued by M. Attorney about Q. Elizabeths spirituall iurisdiction, and that out of the same, the whole may easily be determined, as presentlie you shall see.
            3. For wheras there are two principall partes of any Religion whatsoeuer; the one, doctrine or precepts, for instruction; the other, power and authoritie, for direction, and gouerment; 
                  Two partes of Religiō.
                albeit the first be the ground, and foundation wheron to buyld, and worke; yet is the second that which giueth life, and motion to the former; and must try and iudge the same: for that in euery religion or societie of men, professing one, and the self same faith, those that are the cheife mēbers therof, & presumed to 
                  •
               aue principal power and spiritual iurisdiction therin, are they that must authorize, discerne and iustifie the doctrine therof to their followers. For as S. Augustine said in 
                  •
               is daies to the Manichies that pressed him to beleeue certaine thinges out of the scripture in their sense: That he vvould not beleeue the ghospell it self to be the ghospel, except the authority of the Chuch did moue him thervnto: August. contra epist. Fū

                  menti. cap. 5. that is to say, the cheife gouernours of the Church, and such as had cheife spirituall authoritie therin from time to time: of whome Christ meant when he said: Math. 18 
               Dic Ecclesiae, denounce it to the Church; and againe. If he heare not the Church, let him be to thee, as a heathen, or publican: so in like manner must we say in these daies, nor haue we any



other reasonable answere, why we beleeue any one booke of the new, or old Testament to be scripture (that is to saie to containe doctrine of the holie ghost, and not of man) but for that the gouernours of our Church, which haue spirituall power among vs, doe tell vs so.
            4. Yea, all Sectaries likewise, of what sorte or sect soeuer, are forced to follow the same rule; for that whatsoeuer they admit to be scripture, they admit the same either vpon the credit of our Church, and gouernours therof, or of their owne, or of both; but especially indeed of their owne, which is seen by their doubting or reiecting of any parcels of scripture, doubted of, or reiected by their owne leaders, though admitted by ours. As for example, the booke of vvisedome, 
               
                  See Magdebar. Gen. 2. li. 2. cap. 3. col. 41. 42. & deinceps. Magde. ibid. Col. 53. 54. & deinceps. of Toby, Iudith, Ecclesiasticus, the first and second of Machabees, and other parcels of the old Testament, reiected by Luther, and Lutherans; as also the Epistle of S. Iames, the second and third of S. Peter, the Apocalips, and other peeces of the new testament, which our Church admitteth simply. But Caluin, and Caluinists, though expreslie they reiect them not with the Lutherans, as appeareth by our English Church, where they are left to stand in the Bible: 
                  See Caluin l. 1. instit. cap. 11. & lib. 3. cap. 5. yet is their admission so could, and conditionall, as it may rather seeme a curteous dimission, then any way a faithfull, or confident acceptation.
            
               5. And the same may be said of any other particular point or points of doctrine of any Religion, or sect whatsoeuer; the leaders, or gouernours that are presumed to haue cheife authoritie, must iudge and discerne, distinguish, expound, and determine, what is to be beleued or not; what is to be held and taught, or reiected; and finallie, what is to be done and practised; what Sacraments, what Ceremonies, what Customes are to be vsed, hovv, where, and when; And last of all this second part of power and authoritie, rule, order, gouerment, and iurisdiction is that, which giueth light, direction, and life to euerie religion. And for so much as there can be but one true, that can bring vs to saluation; 
                  True power and spirituall iurisdiction the only

                it followeth, that whersoeuer this true spirituall power, and iurisdiction is found, there is the onlie true religion also, which a man may securelie follow: yea, that vnder paine of eternall damnation, he is bound to follow, for that this authoritie will lead him to life euerlasting, Christ hauing giuen the keies of heauen thervnto, that is to say, Math.

Church, nothing is done in that Court of heauen, but by presidence, and predetermination of that which is done, Heliodor. de vita

VVherof also the said Fathers do inferre, that to find out this authoritie, and to follow the same, and the direction therof, is the only sure way to saluation. And that the erring herin, either wilfully or of ignorance, is the most certaine path to damnation; for that by no other ordinary means (since this Commission giuen, and authoritie instituted among Christians) is any grace, fauour, pardon, light, direction, or other spirituall benefit to be receiued from God, but by way of this subordination of spirituall authoritie appointed in his Church.
            6. VVherfore al hope of life depēding, as you see, of this soueraigne point so as whosoeuer erreth in this, erreth in al; ech man wil easilie cōsider how much it importeth him to looke well thervnto, and to stand attentiue and vigilant in the discussion therof; to see whence, and how, and by what means, and from what sourge and fountaine, this authoritie and spirituall Iurisdiction is deriued: 
                  Three grounds of spirituall authoritie supposed by three different religiōs.
                In which point the three professors of different religions before mentioned, doe principally differ, and distinguish themselues. The Protestāt deducing this spiritual power from the temporall Prince (or rather Princesse vnder



               Q. Elizabeth.) The  
                  See Cartwright, Iunius, & other of then alleadged in the Suruey of pretended discipline. Cap. 16. Rom. 13. Math. 24 
               Puritane from the people. The Catholicke from the succession of Bishops from Christs time downe wards, and especially from the highest, which they hold to be S. Peter, and his successours. And which part soeuer of these three hitteth right, goeth happely & securelie, & the other two doe run to euerlasting perditiō.
            7. The Protestant for his ground, hath those sayings of scripture: That all orderly authoritie is from God. That vve must giue to Cesar, that vvhich is Cesars: That Princes are to be honoured, and obeyed for God; 
               1. pet. 2. 
               and Kings, as highest in dignitie, and that he vvhich resisteth lavvfull authoritie, resisteth Gods ordination: and therby incurreth damnation &c. 
               
                  The foū
                     dation of the Protestants assertiō.
                All which the other two parties granting, doe affirme to haue byn vnderstood of temporall authoritie only, for gouerning the Commonwealth; and not of spirituall for gouerning of soules, which they proue: for that all Kings, and Princes were then infidels, and especially the Roman Emperours of whom this was principally meant, who by these places of scriptures, cannot be said to haue receiued Commission, to gouerne the Christian Church, which was in their times, and vnder their dominions; but onlie in temporall matters, and Ciuill affaires. And that the spirituall power and iurisdiction wherof we talke, was at that time in another sorte of men, to wit in the Apostles and their successours, which were Bishops, according to the



testimonie of S. Paul in the Acts of the Apostles, 
               Acts 20. speaking vnto them, and saying: The holie Ghost hath placed you Bishops to gouerne his Church vvhich he hath purchased vvith his ovvne bloud.
            
            8. The Puritanes, 
               
                  Puritane groūdes. Acts 1.23.
                or rigid Caluinists haue for their ground, certaine elections made by the people, and recorded, as well in the Acts of the Apostles, as in other histories of the Primitiue Church: as for example when they chose two in the place of Iudas, to wit, Ioseph, and Matthias, to bee determined by lot which of them should be. And when afterward they chose S. Stephen, 
               Acts 6.5. & six others to supply the place of Deacons, & many times afterward in the primitiue Church we read, that the people did choose or name their Bishops. But to this, the other two parties doe answere, that in the first two examples, out of the Acts of the Apostles, it is euident by the Text, that those elections, or nominations were permitted to the people, by the Apostles themselues, for their comforte and encouragement; but that the parties so chosen, had, & receiued their authority & spiritual iurisdiction from the Apostles themselues. And the like is answered for the times ensuing, wherin the Bishops did oftentimes permit the said electios to the people, for their greater cōtentment, & consolation in those daies of persecutiō, to choose & nominate for their Bishop & Pastor the man whom they best liked, who afterward was inuested & cōsecrated by the said Bishops notwithstāding: &



tooke his iurisdiction, and spirituall power from them, to whom properly that power and authoritie belonged, to ordaine, both Bishops, and Priests, as we see the Apostles themselues did euerie where, and gaue the like authoritie to others ordained by them. As we read, that S. Paul hauing made Titus Bishop of Creta, gaue him order also to ordaine: vt cōstituas per ciuitates presbyteros, sicut & ego disposui tibi. 
               1. Tit. 5. That thou ordaine Priests for Citties, as I haue appointed thee.
            9. The Catholickes for their groūd haue this: That Bishops only, & Priests were made spirituall gouernous of Christs Church by Christ himself, and so continued vader Infidel Emperours for three hundered yeares togeather, 
                  Groūdes of the Catholicks for spiritual iurisdiction.
                vntill the time of Constantine the great, that was first conuerted, as afterward more largely will be shewed in due place; and that this authoritie is to continue in lawfull succession of Bishops, by ordination, and imposition of hands, vntill the worlds end. And that neither temporall Prince can haue this, except he be also Priest, and receiued it by the same ordinary way of ordination and succession (whereof Q. Elizabeth was not capable) and much lesse the common people, except only by permission, to elect and nominate, as hath byn said: wherof ensueth that if they haue not this spirituall authority in themselues; much lesse can they giue it to others. And thus according to the Catholickes iudgment, doe faile the grounds, both of the Protestant, and Puritan in



this great affaire: and failing in this, doe faile in all the rest; for that of this, dependeth all, as before hath byn said.
            10. For if in their Religions, there be no true authoritie spirituall, or iurisdiction, deriued by ordinarie means, and succession from Christ; 
                  Important consequences.
                then are they awry in all, nor haue they any true authority, to preach, administer Sacraments, absolue, or bind from sinnes, iudge of doctrine, determine or decree of any spirituall action whatsoeuer; nor are they within the compasse of Christs Church, or state of saluation, as by necessarie consequence doth ensue; and the like of the Catholickes, if they in this point be amisse
            11. And herby we may see the importance now of this controuersie, between M. Attorney and me, as also their shallow vnderstāding (if they speake as they thinke) or rather malicious folly (if they doe not) who affirme euery where in their bookes against Catholickes, 
               
                  Sir Frācis Hastings against the vvardvvord & M. Sutcliffe in his defence.
                that Protestants and Puritanes are but onlie iarring-brethren, and reconcilable between themselues, and that their differences are not in principall points of Religion, but in certaine lesser things, and ceremonies. For that this being indeed, not onlie so substantiall a point of doctrine, as before you haue heard; but containing also the whole second part of Religion before mentioned (to wit, all that belongeth to power, authoritie, gouernement and iurisdiction) by which Religion hath her life, vertue, force, and efficacy: It is easily seen, how vaine,



and false, or rather ridiculous and pernicious the other assertion is, and if we well enter into the examination of particulars, we shall easilie see the same.
            12. For suppose (for examples sake) that the Protestants ground be true, that all spirituall iurisdiction, force, and efficacie therof came vnto their Church in Queene Elizabeths time, by her, and from her, out of the Right of her Crowne; & that the Puritanes ground be false, who pretend the same from the people, I meane from their owne Congregations, Classes, & Presbyteries (for no other gaue it them) what followeth of all this? No doubt, it must needs follow, by manifest consequence of truth, that the Puritanes haue no authoritie, or spirituall iurisdiction in the Church of God at all, nor are lawfull Pastors, but vsurpers, and intruders;  
                  Puritan and Protestants grounds vncompatible.
                and that they entred not by the doore, as Christ saith, but by other means: that is to saie, not by the ordinarie doore of lawfull vocation, ordination, and succession of Priesthood. Of which doore the Apostle S. Paul made such high accompt, as hauing set downe that vninersal proposition to the Hebrews: Heb. 5. 2. paralip. 10. 
               Nec quisquam sumit sibi honorem, sed qui vocatur a Deo, tanquam Aâron. That no man taketh vnto him the honour of being a Bishop, or Priest, but he that is called by God therevnto, as Aâron was in the old law. Psal. 2. After this (I saie) he passeth on to proue, that Christ himself the sonne of God, tooke not this honour of high Priesthood vpon him, but by the publike testimonie of his said Fathers vocation, set downe



by the Prophet Dauid, manie hundred years before he was borne. Tu es sacerdos in aeternum secūdum ordinem Melchisedech. 
               Psal. 1 Thou art a Priest for euer, after the order of Melchisedech, and not of Aâron. And according to this high order of Melchisedech, that was both King and Priest, and whose sacrifice was not of beasts and birds, as those of Aâron, but of bread, and wyne onlie, to prefigurate the most pure, and holie sacrifice, that Christian Priests were to offer afterward to the worldes end, of the body and bloud of Christ, in like formes of bread and wyne, as all ancient  Cyprian. l. 2. ep. 3. August. l. 16. de Ciuit. Des. cap. 22. & l. 1. contra aduers. leg. & Proph. cap. 2. & lib. 2. cont. lit. Petil. c. 37. Chrysost. hom. 35. in Gen. Clem. Fathers doe expound it: Of this order (I say) Christ being high Priest, made all his Apostles Priests, and they others after them, and they others againe, by the ordinarie way of ordination, imposition of hands, and succession, which hath endured from their time to ours, and shall from ours, vntill the day of iudgement.
            13. And this ordinarie doore (so called by Christ our Sauiour) of entring into spirituall authoritie, and iurisdiction ouer his flocke, is of such high esteeme and importance, that as the first generall doore, Alexād. lib. 4. strom. wherby a man must enter to be a sheep in the said flocke, to wit Baptisme, is a Sacrament, not reiterable, Ambros. l. 4. de Sacram. c. 3. Hierom. in cap. 1. ad Titum. & alij. Ioan. 10. and so absolutelie necessarie, as no man can enter by any other way: so likwise this other particuler doore of entring into Prelacie, or Pastor-shipp ouer Christs flocke, was ordayned a Sacrament by our Sauiour, no



lesse necessarie for distinguishing theeues, robbers, and intruders, from true and lawfull Pastors (to vse our Sauiours similitude) then the other of Baptisme, to distinguish sheep from wolues, and Christs flocke, from Infidells and others of the Synagoge of Satan.
            14. And now in all this which we haue spoken by occasion of the Puritanes pretence, to enter into spirituall gouerment ouer Christs flocke, by voice and choise of their owne people, we doe not much differ from their Maister and Doctor Iohn Caluin, who confesseth that this doore or entrance to the Clergie by lawfull vocation and ordination, is so necessarie, as if it be not obserued, all would grow to confusion, and no man could know, who hath spirituall iurisdiction ouer soules, and who hath not. Caluin. lib. 4. instit. cap. 19. §. 31. & 14. §. 31. And further he confesseth that albeit be appoint but two generall Sacraments for all sortes of people, Baptisme (to witt) and the Lords supper: yet he graunteth this Ordination of Church-ministers, to be a true Sacrament also, and to haue promise of grace annexed vnto it, as other Sacraments haue, but that it strecheth not so far, as the other two doe; but is particular for ministers and Clergie-men onlie.
            15. But then if we presse him, how he, and his came in by this doore; he and they haue no other shift, but to say, that their first maisters and teachers entred in by this ordinarie vocation and ordination of our Bishops (for others there were none at that time to call; or ordayne them) from whom afterward they disioyned themselues



in doctrine, to ioyne with the Apostles. And this is the leap they make from our age to the Apostles time.
            16. But suppose they could say this of their first teachers, that they had their ordination, and consequentlie also their vocation and spirituall iurisdiction from our Bishops; yet afterward when they fell to different doctrine, and for that cause were cut of by excommunication from them, and especiallie now when the said first teachers are dead and gone; they can haue no other assurance of their vocation of ministerie, then from the people of their owne sect, in their Presbyteries, as before hath byn said: which how much it is, or whether it may be any thing at all, shall  Infra cap. 2. afterward be discussed.
            17. Now it shall be sufficient onlie, for the argument of this Preface, concerning the weight, and importance of this Controuersie we haue with M. Attorney about spirituall iurisdiction, that we consider, and beare in mind the different origen, from which ech partie of the foresaid three professors of Religion, doe pretend to deriue their right and interest to the said spirituall iurisdiction, which they exercise. And what side soeuer erreth therin, erreth also in the maine marke of their saluation, and doth draw both themselues, and their followers to euerlasting perdition. And furthermore that the difference & contrariety in this point, is much more between Puritanes and Protestants, then between them both and Catholickes: For that they both doe graunt and cannot denie, but that the deduction of spirituall iurisdiction



in our Catholike Prelates, 
                  The Protestant and Puritan yelde more in deed, to the Catholicke then to ech other.
                hath come downe line-allie, and successiuelie by ordination, and imposition of 
                  •
               ands, the one of the other, from the Apostles time, though declined (as they saie) in doctrine. But we, on the contrary side, doe inferre the suretie of our doctrine, by the certaintie of this succession of Priestlie power, and spirituall iurisdiction. For that whersoeuer this is trulie to be found, which cannot be but in the true Church; there also hath Christ assured vs, that by his omnipotent power and presence, the puritie, and certaintie of doctrine shall euer in like manner be infallibly conserued.
            18. But to the Protestant, the Puritane doth not yeeld thus much by manie degrees, and much lesse the Protestant to the Puritane. For they doe not graunt the one, to the other, that they haue true ordination of Priests and ministers among them, as to vs they doe: in s
                  •
               gne wherof, if anie Priest of ours doe fall to their side
                  •
                they giue him no new orders, but thinke him sufficientlie ordayned by vs, to minister in their Church, which the Protestant doth not admit in Puritane ministers, 
                  The Protestant and Puritan ministers not admitted the one by the other.
                but that they must be ordered againe by their Bishops, as hauing no Orders before; nor yet the Puritanes with the Protestant-ministers when they turne vnto them, but doe appoint, that he renounce his former Orders in their Congregation, or Presbyterie; and by new imposition of hands of the said Presbiterie he be ordayned a new minister in that profession: so as by opinion and estimation



of the Protestant-religion, the Puritane-ministers are meere laie-men, taking vpon them spirituall iurisdiction ouer soules without any lawfull authoritie, or commission at al; and consequentlie haue no power to preach or teach, or administer Sacraments, and much lesse haue they that high, and excellent iudiciall authoritie to binde, or loose sinnes. 
                  What the Puritan is to the Protestant by this grounde of spirituall power.
                And that which followeth also of this, that they haue no Sacraments at all, no Clergie, no ministerie, no sacred or diuine thinge; but are onlie a lay companie of men and women, ioyned togeather in a certaine worldlie secular society, as Fish-mongers, Iron-mongers, Drapes, and other like companies in London. And the same opinion haue they of the Protestants, and of their Church.
            19. And by this you may see, how farre they differ in substance of religion (though somtimes for fashion-sake they call themselues Brethren) more indeed then both of them from vs, as before hath byn said; which proceedeth from this mayne ground & Principle, to wit, from whence ech part draweth their Ecclesiastical Power, & Spiritual Iurisdictiō ouer soules: for that this being once found out, all the rest is easie and cleere, for so much as this true spirituall authoritie, can be but in one partie, and in one Church onlie, which is the true: and wheresoeuer it is found, there is assurance also of all truth, Christ hauing promised vs, that this Church, and the true Pastors thereof shall not deceiue vs, Mar. vlt. Luc. 10. 1. Tim. 3. nor be deceiued. And therefore that we may boldlie, and confidenlie



heare their voice, and doe that which they bid vs, though otherwise in life, and manners, they should be as bad as Scribes and Pharises. 
               Mat. 23.
            
            20. And on the other side where this true authoritie, and lawfull iurisdiction is not, there we must not beleeue, though they speake neuer so faire, for that we are fore-told and fore-taught, Mat. 7. that they are but wolues in sheeps apparrel, false prophets to deceiue, theeues and murderers to kill and destroie, Iohn. 10. & other such fore-warnings left vnto vs by Christ and his Apostles. All which ought to make vs vigilant, attent, diligent, & curious to vnderstand really the truth about Spirituall Iurisdiction, which in the ensuing Treatise is handled, so far forth, as M. Attorney hath giuen occasion, though nothing so largely, as the thing it selfe might be discussed; but yet sufficientlie for euerie discreet man to see the grounds, and with that modestie also (I hope) as may iustlie offend no man. And so I shall now passe on, to ioyne with M. Attorney more neerly in the maine battaile, if first by the way (as it were of skirmish) we shall answere somewhat in like manner to his Preface, wherin diuers points are not vnworthy of consideration.

open in euery question, with resolution to yeld to them that shall speake the truth. This sentence (I say) giueth mee great comforte, yf M. Attorney will doe as he insinuateth, and follow the indifferencie of his Author alleaged, The indifferency required in treating this controuersy. who in the matters he handled (which were of philosophye) is knowne to haue byn so equall, as he was not well resolued, what part to take. Yet doe I not exact, so much equality in this our controuersie of diuinitie (presuming my aduersary to be preoccupated with the preiudice of one parte) but shall rest well satisfied with his desire, to haue the truth examined in euery point; and much more with his readines, to yeeld vnto her, whersoeuer she shall be founde.
            3. And with this I shall passe to his Preface notinge only one point, or two more, by the way, wherof I shall haue occasion to speake againe afterward. The first is, that wheras this booke of Reports is set forth with two distinct Columnes in euery page, the one in Latin, the other in English, the Title or superscription of the one runneth thus. De iure Regis Ecclesiastico. The other hath this interpretation, Of the Kings Ecclesiasticall law. As though the word Ius (which signifieth Right) were alwayes well translated by the word Law. 
               The vvord Ius, extendeth it self further then Lex.
                Wherof afterward he seeketh to make his aduantage. But the error or fraude is euident, for that the word Ius, hath a much larger signification, then Lex, which may be proued, as well out of auncient Lawyers, as Deuines. For that

               Isidorus sayth, Lex est species Iuris, Law is a braunch or kind of right: and consequently M. Attorney doth not so properly throughout his whole booke interprete Ius by the word Law; which I would not haue noted so largly, but that he being so great a lawyer, had obligation to speake more exactly; though noe man deny, but that Ius and Lex may sometimes be taken for the same, but not euer, nor properly in this case. For that the question is not,



nor was not of Q. Elizabeths Ecclesiasticall lawes but of the right shee had to make such lawes.
            4. The second point, worth the noting is, that wheras both the title, and subiect of all this booke, is of the Kings Ecclesiasticall law. M. Attorney in the whole Course therof, from the begining of our Christian Kings vnto K. Henry the eight, (who were aboue an hundered & twenty in number) neuer citeth so much as one Ecclesiasticall law made by anie of them. For that, they being Catholikes, made not, but receiued Ecclesiasticall lawes, That temporall Princes make not ecclesiasticall lavves but receaue them. from such as had authoritie to make them, in the Catholique Church. And such later Statutes, Decrees, and Ordinances as were made by some later Kings, from K. Edward the first downward, for restraint of some execution of the Popes ecclesiasticall power, in certaine externall points, were not made by them, as ecclesiasticall, but as temporall laws, in respect of the common wealth, for auoiding certaine pretended hurtes, and incommodities therof. And M. Attorney is driuen to such pouerty, & straights in this case, as not being able to alleadge anie one instance, to the contrary, out of all the foresaid ages: hee runneth euery where to this shift, that the Popes Ecclesiasticall, and Canon laws, being admitted in England, m
                     •
                  y bee called the Kings ecclesiasticall laws, for that, they are admitted, and allowed by him, and his realme. In which sense, the Euangelicall law, may bee called also the Kings law, for that he admitteth the Bible. But of this wee shall haue occasiō to speake more often afterward. For that M. Attorney doth often run to this refuge. Now then to the Preface in his owne words.
            
               The Attorney to the Reader.
               
                  It is truly saide (good Reader) that Error (Ignorance being her inseparable twynne) doth in her proceeding, Of Error, and Ignorance. so infinitely multiplie herselfe, produceth such monstrous and strange chimeraes, floateth in such, and so many incertainties, and sucketh downe such poison from the contagious breath of Ignorance; as all such into whom shee infuseth any of her poisoned breath, shee dangerously infects, or intoxicates: and that which is wonderfull, before shee can come to any end, she bringeth all things (if shee be not preuented) by confusion to a miserable and vntimely end.

               5. To this so vehement accusation of Error and Ignorance, I could

                  10. Moreouer our Deuines doe handle this matter of Ignorance so exactly in al their writings, as by treating of Ignorance, they proue themselues not ignorant, but most learned. For first defininge Ignorāce in generall to be want, or lake of knowledge, they distinguish the same into two sortes The one Negatiue, the other Priuatiue.

                     e Albeit they know so much as is sufficient, to their euerlasting beatitude. So as this kind of Ignorāce may stand vvith blessednes in heauen: 
                     Eccles. 5. Rom. 12. Iob. 9. And vpon earth also the Scripture signifieth that it is lawfull, and good for men to be ignorant in many things, & not to know, or desire to know more then is needfull, which leadeth to curiosity, and this of Ignorantia negatiua.
               
                
                  Ignorance priuatiue.11. Priuatiua ignorantia is that which depriueth a man of some knowleg, which he may and ought to haue. And vnto this, our Deuines doe shew that Error doth ad an approbation of that which is false, either in iudgment, or will. And vnto Error, heresie doth ad yet further, pertinacity, and obstinacie, of will especially. And these are the fower degrees of Ignorance in this sense, to witt, Negatiue, Priuatiue, Erroneous, and Hereticall. But now this priuatiue Ignorance is subdiuided againe into diuers other members, and braunches. Diuerse sortes of priuatiue Ignorace As for example into Voluntary, and Vnuoluntary Ignorance: and Vnuoluntary hath two degrees. The one that is altogeather vnuoluntary, so as by noe diligence of ours it could be auoyded, and therfore by Deuines is called Inuincible:

For if a man should kill his owne father not knowing him, or what he doth at all, nor any way concurringe to the said Ignorance; he were to be excused, I doubt not, euen by M. Attorneys law.
               12. The other sort of vnuoluntary Ignorance, called Vincible is that which albeit it proceedeth not of our owne will directly, yet with some kinde of diligence, it might haue bene auoided, and preuented, and according to this it may be culpable, or vnculpable. Voluntary Ignorance also may be either, effect

                     ta that is willingly procured, either in it self, or in her cause, or by some grosse negligence, not auoided; and this either antecedenter, consequenter, concomitanter,



in facto, vel in iure, and other considerations, and circumstances, which Catholike Deuines doe prescribe, for discerning or iudging of mens synnes, and offences, according to knowledg and a good conscience. And in this are they occupied, whilest Protestants stand crying out and exclaiming against Ignorance in generall; and that for the most part so ignorantly, as in nothinge more they shew their ignorance, then by such manner of impugning Ignorance. I will not apply this to M. Attorney, whome I take in his art to be a man of much science, yet is his speach in this place considerable for his degree. 
                     Strange speeches of imagined ignorance by the Attorney.
                   
                  Error (saith hee) doth in her proceeding (hee should haue said (his) according to the gender) so infinitely multiplie her self, produceth such monstrous and strange chimeraes, floateth in such and so many incertainties, as all such into whom she infuseth any of her poisoned breath, she dangerously infects or intoxicates. A strange and sharpe inuectiue; for all men, more or lesse, doe erre; if wee beleeue either Gods word, or our owne experience. Some ignorance also is inauoidable, some excusable, some laudable, some tollerable, some culpable, and some inculpable; as before it is shewed; and being but a priuation, or negation, how commeth she to haue such poison, and soe contagious a breath, as here she is accused to haue, without any distinction at all; seeing that in some degree she is also in Angells, as hath bene sayd; and may be in good and most learned men vpon earth, as holy Iob testified of himself.

To which purpose the holy Ghost saith in another place: Nescit homo vtrum amore an odio dignus fit. 
                  
                     Ecclesiastes 9. A man knoweth not (in this life) wheather he be worthy of loue, or hatred before God. And againe: Nescit homo suum finem. A man knoweth not his end. And none of these ignorances are reprehended. Nay S. Paul doth commend and counsell ignorāce to the Romanes in many things, writing thus. I say vnto yow all by the grace of Christ, which is giuen vnto mee, that yow goe aboute to know noe more, thē you ought to know, but that your knowledg be to sobriety.

For that hee following in his knowledg, and learninge (touching all points of his faith) the knowledg, learninge, wisdome, and authority of the vniuersall Catholike Church, consistinge of infinite, wise, and learned men, and directed by the highest wisdome of God himself; he maketh all their wisdome, his wisdome, their knowledg, his knowledg, and their learning his learning, in this point of his saluation. Wheras the sectary following his owne sense, and braine, ech one in his fancie, is alone as you see, and hath no true knowledge, learning, or wisdome at all, though he bragg neuer so much of speciall knowledge, and illumination, as before you haue heard, out of Tertullian and Irenaeus to haue been their auncient spirit, and will be to the worlds end. And this shall suffice to this point. Now will M. Attorney passe to another, of the commendation of Truth; as though that were with him, and his.



And wee shall follow him, to examine that point also, as wee haue done this other about Ignorance.

She hateth all bumbasting, and sophistication, and bringeth with her certainty, vnity, simplicity, and peace at the last. Putida salsamenta amant origanum, veritas pèr se placet, honesta per se decent, falsa fucis, turpia phaleris indigent. Ignorance is so far from excusing, or extenuating the error of him, that had power to finde out the truth (which necessarily he ought to know & wanted only will to seeke it) as she will be a iust cause of his great punishment. Quod scire debes, & non vis non pro ignorantia, sed pro contemptu habers debet. Error, and falshood, are of that condition, as without any resistance they will in tyme of themselues fade and fall away. But such is the state of Truth, that though many doe impugne her, yet will she of her self euer preuaile in the end, and flourish like the palme-tree: she may peraduenture by force, for a tyme be troden downe, but neuer by any meanes whatsoeuer can she be troden out.

                  VVee can do nothing against truth, but for truth. And therfore do I willinglie ioyne with M. Attorney in this point of praisinge Truth. Wee do mislike also, no lesse then he, all bumbasting, and sophistication: 
                  Truth vaynly cōmended by Sectaries. neither are we delighted with stinkinge salt-fish, that had need of Orygon, to giue it a good sauour. Wee allow in like manner of his other latin phrases, and do confesse, that Truth herselfe may be troden downe for a tyme by force, but neuer troden out. But what is all this to the purpose we haue in hand of findinge out the Truth in this our controuersie? Let vs suppose for the present, that both partes do like well of her? but what meanes is giuen heere, or may be giuen, to discouer where she lyeth?

                  The application of the Fathers directions.18 These are the ancient Fathers directions; now let vs apply them to our present question, which is so much the easier to discusse: for that, albeit it comprehend some part of doctrine in controuersie, concerninge the Right of temporall Princes, to spirituall Iurisdiction; yet is it principally, and properly a question of fact, to witt, whether, by the ancient common laws of England, and practice of our Princes, according to the same spiritual Iurisdiction, they were exercised by them in former ages, by force and vertue of their Imperiall crownes; as Queene Elizabeth did, or might do, by the authority giuen her by an Act of Parlament, in the first yeare of her raigne, wherby she was made head, of the Church, and supreme gouernesse, as well in all causes, Ecclesiasticall,


                  
as temporall. In discussion wherof, if we wil vse the directions of the forsaid Fathers, for cleere and infallible tryall, we shall easily find out where the Truth lyeth; which is the but, we ought to shoore at; and not to contend in vayne: for that our assertion, quite contrary to that of M. Atourneys, is. That if we consider the whole ranke, of our Christian English Kings, from the very first, that was conuerted to our Christian faith, to witt, King Ethelbert of Kent, vnto the reigne of King Henry the eight, for the space of more then nine hundered years, (and King Henry himself, for the greater and best part of his reigne) did all, and euery one of them confesse, & acknowledg the spirituall power and Iurisdiction of the Sea of Rome, and did neuer contradict the same, in any one substantiall point either by word, law, or deed: but did infinite wayes confirme the said authority, ech one, in their ages & reignes. And this is that KATH'HOLON, or secundum totum which S. Augustine requireth; and vbique vnam, which the other Fathers do mention; which is a Catholike proofe, in a Catholike cause, and M. Attorney must needs fly ad partem, to a parte only, to witt, to two or three later Kings, of aboue halfe a hundered, that went before; which is a schismaticall proofe as S. Augustine sheweth, Contra partem Donati.

               The Attorney.
               
                  There is no subiect of this Realme, but being truly instructed, Birth-right of lavves. by good, and plaine euidence, of his ancient and vndoubted patrimonie, and birth-right (though, he hath for some tyme by ignorance, false persuasion, or vaine feare, byn deceiued, or dispossessed) but wil consulte, with learned & faithful Coūselours for the recouery of the same. The ancient and excellent laws of England, are the birth-right, and most ancient and best inheritaunce, that the subiects of this Realme haue. For by them, he inioyeth not only his inheritaunce, and goods in peace and



quietnes, but his life, and his most deere countrey in safty. And for that I feare, that many of my deare countreymen, (and most of them of great capacity, and excellents parts) for want of vnderstandinge of their owne euidence, do want the true knowledg, of their ancient birth-right, in some points of greatest importance: I haue in the beginning of this my first worke directed them to those, that will not only, faithfully counsell, and fully resolue them therin, (such as cannot be daunted with any feare, moued by any affection, nor corrupted with any reward) but also establish and settle them, in quiet, and lawfull possession. Vpon iust grounds to rectifie an error in a mans owne minde, is a worke of cleere vnderstanding, & of a reformed will, and frequent with such, as be good men, & haue sober, and setled wits.
               
            
            
               The Catholike Deuine.
               19 It may please the reader, to consider, that of two propositions, which M. Attorney vseth commonly to lay forth for the furnishing of his discourse; The first called the maior, we haue hitherto admitted, denying the second, or minor, and ther-vpon, his whole cōclusion, for that he subsumeth not wel. As for example, in his first proposition in reprehension of Ignorance, we agreed in such ignorance as is reprehensible, but his application therof to Catholiks, I shewed to be false, and his meere imagination. And the like in the second encounter, about Truth, I admitted his Encomion, and prayse of Truth, but disagreed in the manner of seeking out of the same, which he wholy omitted:  The Attorneys maior admitted, and his minor denyed. And the same must I say in this third meeting of ours; I do not contradict his maior proposition, that euery wise, and discreet subiect of the land, hauing been dispossessed of his ancient inheritance, and birth-right by ignorance, false persuasion, or vayne feare, will consult with learned, & faithful Counselours, for recouery therof. All this (I saie) is graunted; but the application therof to the municipal laws of England (which is the assumpt, or minor proposition) I cannot confesse, to be so wel and fitly made. Let vs discusse a litle what the Attorney writeth. The ancient, and excellent laws of England (saith he) are the birth-right and most ancient, and best inheritance that the subiects of this Realme haue. Much is said in this, and albeit I do not meane to deny, or draw backe any part of the iust commendation, due to our municipal laws; yet this strange hyperbole, axaggeration, or ouerlashing of M. Attorney, tending (as after shal appeere) to a false, and preiudicial conclusion, is worthy some stay theron. For, first I would



aske him what great, and singular antiquity he findeth in our municipal laws, that so often he nameth them ancient, as though, they were eminent, and singular in that point of antiquitie aboue other laws;  Of the antiquity of our municipall lavves. wheras I, for my part, finde noe memory of any of them extant, before the Conquest and no written statute law before the raigne of King Henry the third, which was two hundred years after that againe, & with him doth Iudge Rastall also begin his collection of laws and statutes, from Magna Charta downwards: which was made in the 9. yeare of the said King, and of Christ, one thowsand, two hundered & sixteene; which is not yet ful foure hundred years gone. And yet did Englishmen liue in England before the Conquest, more then twyse as longe, vnder lawes, partly municipal, and partly Imperiall; to say nothing of the Britaines before them againe: And consequently, I see not how we may bragge so much of antiquity in this point.
               20. As for the excellency of our laws, I meane not to withdraw, any due commendation, as before I said, nor to stand heere to discusse, what commodities, and incommodities they haue, as al humane things that depend of the variable iudgment, and likinge of men; yet cannot any indifferent, and disappassionat man, but remember that, which all our writers do commonly note, that they were brought in principally by Conquest, and a Conquerour, and such a one as intended to bridle the English by that meanes, and to bring them vnder by those lawes;  The commodities & discommodities of our municipal lavves. And what misery, calamity and exceeding thraldome, our afflicted nation passed in those dayes, vnder those lawes, and the insolent dominion of the Normans; let any man read Ingulphus, that liued in those dayes, and other English Historiographers that ensued soone after, as Malmesbury, Huntington, Houeden, and the like, and then will he pitty their case that first liued vnder them.
               21. It is euident likewise by all testimony of our old histories, how frequent, and earnest reclaime was made by the people, and nobility to diuerse Kings after the Conquest, against these newer laws, for the restoring of such, as were in vse before the said Conquest, especially those of King Edgar and S. Edward the Confessor, about which point oftentymes, there were no small tumults made, and yet now by vse, and tract of tyme, the mislike being asswaged, and wee taught to be still, yea and to kisse the rodde, wherwith then we were beaten; M. Attorney, now will



needes haue vs, adore the same, and esteeme them not only for ancient, but excellent lawes also, wherin I meane not to loose tyme in stryuing with him, for that I do hasten to a more important conclusion.
               22. Further then, he not being contented with these two most honorable Epithetons and Euloges of Antiquitie and Excellency, passeth on to another superlatiue degree, saying, that they are not only the vndoubted patrimony, and birth-right, but also the most ancient and best inheritance, which the subiects of this Realme haue; wherof hee yeldeth this reason, for that by them, they enioy, their life, liuings, and countrey in peace and saftie: 
                  The birth-
                        ••
                     gh
                        •
                      of our common lavves. Which if it be so, then what inheritance had old English-men, for so many hundred yeares, before these lawes were made? what riches, or inheritance haue those men by them in our dayes, which are borne, without landes or liuings? Will this patrimony of the law, make them rich? M. Attorney, and diuers of his fellowes, haue had a good patrimony, and inheritaunce by them: but this is not euery mans case.
               23. I confesse that the lawes of euery countrey, are a certeyne birth-right of all subiects that are borne therin; and if they bee good and equall, it is a publike benefit, but much more if they be well executed, by a iust Prince, which importeth more than writen lavves. For that he, as M. Attorney confesseth, is the soule of the law, that giueth life, who also without writen lawes, either municipall, or Imperiall, may administer iustice, by law of nature and nations, if he will. What speciall, or singular commodity then, is here shewed to issue out of the municipall lawes of England aboue others, that they should be called our ancient, & best inheritance? Yea, as he addeth after, in matters of greatest Importance, meaning therby our soule, & saluation. Is not this an ouerlashing? is not this an egregious hyperbole? Do not subiects in Scotland, France, Italy, Spaine, and other places, enioy their goods in peace and quietnes, and their liues, and deare countreyes in safty, as wel by their lawes Imperial, as we do, by our municipall Yes; and much more, if we will beleeue them, and their learnedest, & this vpon some attent consideration of euents, which dayly they heare, and reade, of many men both great, and small, to haue bin ouerthrowne, and condemned in our countrey, both in liues, & liuinges, which they thinke by their Imperiall lawes were impossible. And one only circumstance of English tryall in life, and death (to omit the rest) doth leaue them astonished, to



witt, that be he neuer so great a man, yet for his life, and landes honour, & posterity, he may not haue that allowed him, which in an action of fiue poundes renr, or lesse, he should obteyne; The obiection of externe lavvyers against diuerse points of ours. which is a learned lawyer, or aduocate to speake for him at the barre; but that all the Princes officers, and learned Counsell, shall plead against him, exaggerating matters to the vttermost; and he only suffered to speake for himself, and that in measure, who for lack of skill, or memory, or tyme to consider, or boldnes to speake, or talent to vtter well his meaninge, may there betray, and ouerthrow both himself, & his whole posterity in his owne defence.
               24. And finally, the last vpshot being of that dreadfull action, to commit the matter to a iury of vnlearned men, that must giue their verdicts openly; and by consequence, vpon the same causes before mentioned of error, feare, hope, or other passion (the Prince being alwayes on part interessed) may easily be led finistrously to the prisoners condemnation. Se also Syr Thomas Moore Lib. 1. Viepia.
                   All which inconueniences, being carefully prouided for, by course of other lawes do make forreine learned men to thinke, that ours are more defectiue, than we persuade our selues, and that it may easily be beleeued, that they were made indeed by a Conquerour. And I could haue byn glad, that M. Attorney in this place, had alleaged, some singular thing in their extraordinary commendation, for that the enioying of our goods, liues, lands, and contrey by them (which he mencioneth) are very ordinary, and vulgar commendations, and common to all lawes in generall, that euer were made, by reasonable men. And yet, do we not deny, but that our English lawes, for the whole corpes, and dryft therof, are very commendable; especially where the spirit, and meaninge of the first founders is obserued by the followers: yet want there not, by graue mens iudgments, many considerable points that might be better rectified; and namely concerning the imperious, and dominant maner of proceeding of many lawyers, and their exorbitant gaines, which yet perhaps M. Attorney will place among the cheife commendations of our said common lawes.
               25. In the other point also of remitting men for the knowledg of their euidence, & ancient birth-right in some pointes of greatest importance to faithful Counseloures, VVhether common lavvyers determine and deale vvithout passion. 
                  that will resolue them fully without feare, affection, or corruption, if he meane by these Counseloures, as he doth, those Iudges and Sages of the Common-law, from whom



he hath taken these peeces, against Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction; which after he hath set downe, I must needs saie, that it is litle to the purpose. For albeit, now they be dead, he may well saie (as he doth) that they cannot be daunted with any feare, moued by any affection, or corrupted with any reward; yet when they were aliue, & gaue their resolutions, (which he saith they did) it is hardly credible that they were soe deuoide of those passions, as he would make them, they being no Saintes, but wordlie men that sought their aduauncement vnder their Princes, by pleasing their humours; as lawyers of our tymes do; wherof I could alleadg many examples, and some perhaps we may touch after in their due places. Now it shal be sufficient to remember that in diuerse Kings daies, after the Conquest, the cheife cōplaints of the people, were against their cheife Iusticers,

Henry the third and Richard the second, and both of then punished publiklie for their wickednes, doe testifie. And in the begining of K. Edward the third his raigne, I read of a complaint made by the King, and the whole Parliament, that his father, K. Edward 2. had byn induced by euil Counsellours (which in that case may iustlie be presumed to haue byn his Iudges, and lawyers) to sease into his hands the temporaltie of diuerse Bishopricks, &c. Which, for the time to come, he promised not to doe. And finallie after that againe, when the contention, and controuersie, between the two potent houses, of Lancaster, and Yorke began, and endured for almost 100. years, I find few Iudges, or great Sages of the common-law, to haue lost their liues therin, for anie side, or partie, as manie Dukes, Earls, Barons, knights, yea, and some Bishops also, & religious did. Which is a signe that those Sages were to wise to oppose themselues, to anie sorte of Princes whatsoeuer, but could accommodate themselues to all and draw the birth-right of laws to the establishing of any Kings right, that by his sword could get the possession.

Attorney himselfe would in this point follow the direction of his Poesie out of Macrobius de veterum lectione; of reading the ancient Fathers, and old incorrupt writers diligently to this effect: For I doubt not, but that so good a witt, as his is, would quickly discerne the truth, if preiudice or passion, vpon interest or disinterest, do not depriue him of that happines. For albeit our Sauiour hath a dreadful sentence,

                  The end of such as write, concerning any matter, which by some for want of instruction is called into controuersie; should be with all the candor, and charity, that can be vsed, to perswade, & resolue by demonstratiue proofes, the diligent Reader in the Truth:

But now a dayes those that write of such matter, do for the most part, by their bitter and vncharitable inuectiues, transported with passion and fury, either beget new controuersies, or do as much as in them lyeth to make the former immortall. Certaine it is that some books of that argument, haue had Truth for their Center, yet because they haue wanted temperance, modesty, and vrbanity for their circumference, haue, to



the great preiudice of the truth, hardned the aduersaries in their errors, and by their bitter inuectiues, whetted them not only to defend themselues, and to offend in the like, but many times (being therby vrged to write) to defend the error it self to the hurt of many; which otherwise might haue vanished away, without any contradiction.

               27. This candor and charitye, which M. Attorney wisheth in al writers of Controuersyes is laudable, and fully agreeing also to our desires, that be Catholicks; and it falleth out wel, that some grauer men of the Protestant partie do shew at length by publicke testimony, their mislike of such bitter, and vncharitable inuectiues, which their ministers, that should be guides of modestie to others (being transported with passion, and fury to vse M. Attorneys words) do exercise, and therby they do beget nevv controuersies, and make the former immortall.

               28. And yet in one thing I cannot agree with M. Attorney in this point, when he saieth that these bitter inuectiues of theirs haue whetted their aduersaries to defend themselues, which otherwise they would not haue done: For I holde the contrary to be true, which is, that their brutish veine of intemperate, and shamles writinge, hath freed them from all reioynder of any modest or ciuill aduersary; wheras on the other side M. Attorney is answered as you see, for that his temperance, modestie, and vrbanity in the circumference of his Center, deserueth the same, though his said Center haue not that truth in it, which were to be wished, answerable to those other good commendations of his. And this wil ly vpon vs to proue in the prosecution of this whole Answere. Now let vs passe to the rest of his Preface.

               29. Albeit this last part of M. Attorneys Preface, be somwhat close, and darke; yet it is not hard (these circumstances considered) to leuell at his meaning, which is that Catholike men, that write of controuersies in this time, do write against their consciences, vpon discontentment, which he presupposing without proofe (wheras principally he should haue proued this) he passeth on to tell vs, why they doe it, in respect of themselues, or others, and vpon what grounds, their discontentments arise, which by M. Attorneys leaue, is altogeather impertinent, both for that he leaueth vnproued, that which especiallie he should haue proued, and that which he endeuoureth to proue, is wholie from our purpose and hath no coherence with our cause at al.
               30. For first we deny that Catholiks doe write against their consciences to impugne a knowne truth, for this they holde to be a most hainous, and damnable sinne, and one of the six that are against the holy Ghost, and very peculiar to heretiks, as appeareth by those words of S. Paul before recyted, where he writeth in respect of this pertinacy in defending their owne heresies, and proper elections against their consciences, 
                     Tit. 4. 
                  that heretiks are damned by their

As for example in the present controuersie (to pretermit all others) English Catholiks saie, that they approue noe other Ecclesiastical power, than that which all the Kings of England from the first that was conuerted vnto King Henry the eight togeather with their Counsellours, lawyers, and Sages, both spirituall, and temporall, haue allowed, receiued, practised, and confirmed by their owne municipal lawes.

               33. And as for the imaginarie causes of discontentment, which he deuiseth; either for that men haue not atteined vnto their ambitious, and vniust desires, or for that, in the eye of the State, their vices, and wickednes haue deserued punishment, and disgrace; and therfore doe oppose themselues, against the current of the present. These speculations, I saie, cannot fal any way vpon English Catholiks, not doe subsist of themselues. Not the later, for that they are knowne to be temperate men, VVhy Catholiks are not to be thought to vvrite against their conscience. & so will the countrey commonlie, where they liue, beare them wittnes, and the experience of their singuler patience vnder the pressures of the late Queene doth manifestly testifie the same. Not the first, for that if conscience did not retaine them, they might gaine more, and more aduaunce their ambitious desires (if they haue any) by following the Current of the time with M. Attorney and others, than by standing against it, to suffer themselues to be ouerflowne therwith. And it is a great presumption in all reason, that he hath a good conscience who standeth thervnto with his losse, that might run downe the hill with the current, to his gaine, and preferment. For that this later is easie, and vulgar, and common to the worst men, as well as to good: the other is hard, and rare, and needeth gr
                     •
                  at vertue, and fortitude of mind, wherof I may chaunce to haue occasion to speake more largely afterward at the end of this booke in a speciall chapter to M. Attorney himselfe (when our principall controuersie shalbe tryed) shewing what vrgent, forcible, and peremptorie reasons Catholike



men haue, though with neuer so great losse temporall, to stand for the defence of their consciences & not to runne downe the current with him and others, that swymme with full sayle therin. And so much of this.
               34. Some other few pointes of litle importance, doe remaine in this passage of M. Attorneys Preface, which might be touched, and examined; as where he saith, that the particular, and approued custome of euery nation is the most vsuall binding, and assured law; and for more authoritie of this asseueration, as also of whatsoeuer he saith besides, or pretendeth to say, out of our lawes in his ensuing Treatise: he addeth that he hath byn a student therof for these 35. yeares: but I could bring forth lawyers of no lesse standinge, and study, Tyme of 
                        〈…〉
                     . (though perhaps with lesse gaine) that would contradict him, in both these points. First, that custome is not allwayes the most vsuall binding law, either in conscience, or otherwise; & with these would run, all the ministers of Englaud, in the case of Catholike, and Protestant Religion, wherin custome by their owne confession is against them. And in the second point concerning the peeces, & parcelles heere alleadged, out of our Common-lawes, against the Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, as M. Attorney would haue it seeme; these men would alleadge, twenty for one, not shredes or liberts of lawes, but intyre lawes themselues; authorizinge and confirminge, with full vniformity and vniuersality of our English nations consente, the said Iurisdiction, from time to time, and the vse and practise therof. But of this afterward.
               35. Now to conclude with M. Attorney in this his Preface, if his end, and desire be, as he saith, that such, as are desirous to se, & to know, may be instructed, and such as haue byn taught amisse, may se, and satisfie themselues with the truth, and such as know, and hold the truth, may be comforted, and confirmed, I shall gladlie ioyne with him in this end, and desire; p

Yet let M. Attorney ioyne issue with me vpon antiquitie, in this our controuersie (which he

               2. First then our Deuines affirme that almighty God is author of all lawfull Power whatsoeuer, God the author of all lavvful povver. both spirituall, and temporall according to that generall proposition of S. Paul, Non est potestas nisi à Deo. 
                  
                     Rom. 13. There is no power but from God. For that, as it pleased his



diuine maiestie, to imparte with man other sparkes of his excellencyes, as wisdome, reason, knowledge, prouidence, and the like; so vouchsafed he also to make man partaker of his power, and authoritie not only to gouerne all other creatures of his in the worlde, but mankynde also, and this both in body and soule, temporall, and eternall things vnder him in this world, as his liestennant and substitute.
               3. The differences which are betweene these two Powers, & Iurisdictions, Spirituall, and Temporall Ecclesiasticall, and Ciuill; are diuers and sundry, taken from the diuersitie of their ends & obiect; The different ends & obiects, of spirituall, and temporall povver. The end of Spirituall Power being to direct vs, to euerlasting saluation, both by instruction, discipline, and correction; and of the Temporall or Ciuill, by like meanes, and helps, to gouerne well t
                     •
                  e Common-wealth, in peace, aboundance, order, iustice, and prosperitie. And accordinge to these ends, are also their obiects, matter, and meanes. As for example, the former hath for her obiect spirituall things belonginge to the soule, as matters of faith, Doctrine, Sacraments, and such other; and thy latter handleth the Ciuill affaires of the Realme, and Common-wealth, as they appertaine to the temporall good, and prosperitie thereof.
               4. The ancient learned Father S. Gregorie Nazianzen in a certaine Oration of his, doth expresse, the nature, and conditions of these two Powers; Spirituall and Temporall. Ecclesiasticall, Spirituall & tēmporal povver, as spirit, and flesh in a man. and Ciuill, by the similitude of spirit and flesh, soule, and sense; which he saith, may be considered, either as two distinct Common-wealths, seperated the one from the other; or conioyned togeather in one Common-wealth only. 
                     
                        
                           〈1 paragraph〉
                        
                     
                   An example of the former, wherin they are seperated, may be in Beasts, & Angells; the one hauing their Common-wealth of Sense onlie, without soule or spirit, and their end and obiects conforme thervnto, which are the nourishment, and preseruation of the body. And the other Common wealth of Angells, being of spirit only, without flesh or body; but in man are conioyned, both the one, and the other. And euen so in the Common wealth of the Gentiles, was onlie authoritie politicall, earthlie, and humane, giuen by God to gouerne worldlie and humaine things, Temporal and spirituall authoritie separated in the Pri

                     . but not spirituall for the soule; wheras contrarywise in the Primitiue Christian Church, for almost 300. yeare togeather, none or few Kings being yet conuerted, onlie spiritual authoritie was exercised by the Apostle


                  
and Christians Bishopps, their successours for gouerninge the Church in Ecclesiasticall affaires without temporall, accordinge to the saying of S. Paul in the Acts of the Apostles speaking to Bishops. 
                     Act. 20. 
                  Vos posuit Spiritus Sanctus Episcopos regere ecclesiam Dei. The holy-ghost hath appointed you, that are Bishops to gouerne his Church.
               5. And this Spirituall Iurisdiction in respect of the high end, and obiect therof, aboue the temporall, did the same Apostles by instructiō of the same Holie Ghost, so highlie esteeme, as the same S. Paul writinge to the Corinthians, and reprehendinge them for going to law about temporall things, before the heathen magistrate, said, 2. Cor. 6.4 
                  that in secular matters, they should appoint for iudges, such as were contemptible in the Church, that is to say, men of meane account, which was spoken by him, not for that he contemned temporall Power, as the heretical Anabaptists out of this place would proue, Anabaptists. (for so he should be contrarie to himselfe, who a litle before, as you haue heard, auowed, that all power is from God, 
                  
                     Rom. 13. 1. Pet. 2. and in other places, that the King, and temporall magistrate, is to be honoured, and obeyed, as Gods minister, and the like) but onlie, he saith this in comparison, the one of the other, and of their ends, and obiects, so different in dignitie, & worthines, as you haue heard. And this continued in the Primitiue Church, (to witt, Spirituall Iurisdiction, without Temporall) vntill Constantine the Great; and other Emperours and Kings after him, being conuerted to the Christian faith, entred into the said Church, retaininge their Temporall States, and Temporall Power, which before they had, but submitting themselues in spirituall, and Ecclesiasticall matters, vnto the spirituall gouernment and gouernours, which they found to haue been in the same Church before their conuersion.
               6. Furthermore besides these differences, of the end, and obiects of these two Powers, the forsaid Deuines doe shew another no lesse considerable then the former, which is, that albeit, both of them be of God, and doe proceed from him; as the Author, & origen, as hath been said; yet far differentlie: for that Ecclesiasticall authoritie, is immediatlie from God, and was giuen by Christ immediatlie to his Apostles, 
                  
                     Act. 10. and Bishops, as before you haue heard, out of S. Paul, who addeth in the same place, that Christ gaue them this Spirituall Iurisdiction ouer that Church quam acqui fiuit sanguine suo, 
                  Spirituall iurisdictiō independent of Tēporall. which he had bought and purchased with his bloud, to make them and others, in respect of this dreadfull circumstance,



to esteeme and respect the more this Spirituall Iurisdiction ouer soules: which Iurisdiction Christ also himself, God and man, did exercise in person vpon earth, wholie seperated from the vse of all Temporall Iurisdiction, notwithstanding he was Lord of all, as the same Deuines out of the Ghospell doe proue.

               9. Out of all which, is deduced, that for so much, as Christ our Sauiour, God, and Man, hauing purchased to him felfe, by the price of his owne blood, a most deerlie beloued Church, and committed the same as S. Paul saith to be gouerned by his Apostles, and Bishops their successours, vnto the worlds end; it must needs follow, that he hath indowed the same Church with sufficient spirituall Authoritie, both directiue, and coactiue, to that end, for gouerning our soules, no lesse than he hath done the temporal Cōmonwealth for affaires of the body. Nay much more, by how much greater the importance is of the one, than of the other, as before hath been said.
               10. If you aske me yet more particularlie, where and how, by what commission, and to whom, Christ our Sauiour left this high Spiritual Power in his Church: VVhat is the spirituall povver of the church & Pastors therof. what it is, and wherin it consisteth? I answere first to the last, that it consisteth (as often hath been said) in guiding our soules in this world, to euerlasting saluation in the next: Which thinge, for that principallie it dependeth of this, that we auoide sinnes in this life; or if we committ them, that they be pardoned vs, or corrected by this Power; Christ our Sauiour, doth most aptlie giue and describe the same Power, by the words of binding, or loosing sinnes. And therefore, in the foresaid place alleadged, out of S. Matthew his Ghospel,



he giueth the said commission, as you haue heard. 
                     Math. 26. 
                  VVhatsoeuer you shal binde, or loose vpon earth, shal be bound or loosed in heauen. Wherby the Church of God, hath allwaies vnderstood, full authoritie of Iudicature, to haue been giuen to the Apostles, and their successors, to discerne, iudge, binde or loose in all things belonging to this end of directing soules.
               11. Truth it is, that diuers learned deuines, are of opinion, that in these places, Christ did but promise to his Apostles to giue them this high iudiciall authoritie in his Church, when by his death, and resurrection, it should be founded. And that the actuall performance of this promise was made vnto them in the 20. if S. Iohns ghospell, where Christ said vnto them. Sicut misit me pater, & ego mitto vos. 
                  
                     Ioan. 20. As my father sent me so I doe send you; and then presentlie breathing vpon then he addeth. Receiue the Holie-ghost: whose sinnes you shall forgiue, they are forgiuen vnto them, and whose you shal retaine, they are retained. Where we se, that Christ speaketh now in the present tense, they are forgiuen, and they are retained: and not in the future, as before in the place of S. Matthew his ghospell. And we must note that those words of our Sauiour (As my father sent mee, so I doe send you.) are vnderstood by auncient Doctors,

And therfore he saith in S. Matthew his Ghospell: That whatsoeuer they shall binde, or loose vpon earth, (which are the Acts of high iudges) shall be loosed or bound in heauen.
               
               12. And to S. Peter in like manner, as Cheif of the rest, the promise of his Supreame, and singular power (besides the other, which out of the former general commission, he receiued with the rest of the Apostles) was made vnto him, first in S. Matthews ghospell, when Christ said, Thou art Peter, (which signifieth a stone, or rocke) and vpon this rock will I build my Church, and will giue vnto thee the keies of the Kingdome of heauen. 
                  
                     Matth. 16. &c. Which he perfourmed afterward, in the 21. chapter of S. Iohn: after his resurrection, when asking him three times of his loue towards him, he as manie times gaue him cōmission of high-pastor ouer his flocke. Pasce oues meas, pasce agnos meos. &c.
               13. This Spirituall and Ecclesiasticall Power then which Christ hath left for gouerning his Church, though it be to be exercised



heere vpon earth, and by men; yet is it iustlie called by holie fathers, not humane Power, but diuine, and heauenlie, both for that, it was giuen immediatelie, and exercised also by Christ himself, that came from heauen, and for that it tendeth to heauen, and is approued in heauen; yea to vse the Phrase of S. Chrisostome, 
                  
                     Chrysost. homil. 5. de verbis Esa. Vidi Dominum.
                   and other Fathers, directeth and commaundeth the verie Tribunall of heauen; which heauenlie Power on earth, S. Paul, as an Apostle extraordinary, hauing extraordinarilie also receiued, not by man, but by Iesus Christ as himself doth signifie, did so much glorie of, 
                     Galat. 1. as he wrote to the Corinthians. 
                  1. Cor. 13. 
                  If I should glorie some what of our Power, which Christ hath giuen vs to edification, and not to destruction I would not blush at it. 
                  2. Cor. 10. And a litle before in the same Chapter, he saith. Nam arma militiae nostrae non carnalia sunt, sed potentia Deo. &c. For the armour of our warrfare, are not carnall or wordlie armes, but are power from God. In promptu habentes, vlcisci omnem inobedientiam. &c. hauing speedy means to reuenge all inobedience. And yet further to the said Corinthians within two Chapters after. 2. Cor. 13. 
                  Quoniam si venero iterum, non parcam. If I come vnto you againe, I will not spare to punish. And a little after in the same place. S. Paules esteeme of the high povver giuen vnto him & to other Apostles & their Successours. 
                  Ideo absens scribo, vt non durius agam, secundum potestatem, quam Dominus dedit mihi. I doe write vnto you absent, to the end that when I shall come, and be present with you, I be not forced to deale more roughly according to the Power, which our Lord hath giuen me.
               14. Beholde the dreadfull Spirituall Power, which S. Paul affirmeth to be giuen to him by Christ, as well to punish, as to instruct and direct: and according to this Power, he writeth againe to the said Corinthians. Quid vultis? in virga veniam ad vos, an in charitate & spiritu mansuetudinis? what will you haue mee doe; shall I come vnto you in the power of the rodd, or in loue, and spirit of mildnes? As who would saie, choose which you will. And note that heer the Power of correction giuen to the Apostles, & their successours, is called the rodd in respect of strikinge, as before in the words of Christ, it was called the key of the kingdome of heauen, and the power, of binding, and loosing sinnes, in regard of the dreadfull shutting or opening heauen, or hell gates vnto vs. And accordinge to this power S. Paul afterward exercised iudgment, & gaue sentence in a certaine grieuous case of Incest among the said Corinthians in these words. 1. Cor. 5. 
                  Ego autem absens corpore, praesens autem spiritu iam iudicani, vt praesens, eum qui sic operatus est. I though absent in body yet present with you in spirit, haue giuen



iudgment vpon him that hath committed this sinne, as though I were present in body. And the same Apostle writinge to his scholler Timothie doth tell of another sentence, 1. Tim. 1. and iudgment pronounced by him, vpon Hymenaeus and Alexander two seditions and hereticall men; quos tradidi Sathanae. (saith he) whome I haue deliuered ouer to Sathan: which is as much to saie, as I haue excommunicated, & cut them of from the Church of God, wherby they come to be no more in the protection of Christ, but in the power, and protection of Sathan.
               15. And the like Spirituall Iudgment was exercised by S. Peter, vpon Simon Magus when he said vnto him, Diuers excomunications by the Apostles. 
                  Non est tibi pars, neque sors in sermone isto. Thou hast no parte nor participation with vs in this word of God which we preach. By which words of S. Peter, the 30. Canon of the Apostles doth affime, 
                     Act. 8. 
                  Simon Magus to haue bene excommunicated and cut of from the number of Christians and from all spirituall benefit belonging thervnto. Which (if we beleue S. Augustine) was a more greiuous and dreadfull punishment, than if he had been sentenced,

Oh let no man contemne the chaines, which ecclesiasticall power laieth vpon him, (in bindinge, or loosinge his sinnes) for it is not man that bindeth, but Christ which hath giuen vnto vs (that are Gouernours of his Church) this power.

                      nexibus. A man is bound more bitterlie, & miserably by the keyes of the Church, than by any most greiuous sharpe iron, or adamāt bounds. Wherof the holy Martyr and Bishop S. Cyprian gaue the reason, before them both, sayinge: 
                     Cypr. lib. 1. epist. 1. ad 
                           〈◊〉
                         Deut. 6. 
                  That in the old law, vvhich vvas Carnall, God gaue cōmaundement, that such as were rebellious to their Priests, and Iudges, should be slaine vvith the sword: 
                     Math. 16. 
                  But now in the lavv of Christ that is Spirituall, proude and disobedient men, are commaunded to be slaine eternallie vvith the spirituall svvord, vvhich is, their castinge out from the Church out of vvhich they cannot haue life.
               
               16. This then is the Spirituall, and Ecclesiasticall dreadfull Power, which Christ hath planted in his Church, by his owne immediate commission for gouerninge the same, in the affaires of our soules, vnto the worlds end. And heere we may note also, that



the same is double, or of two sortes: The one internall, concerning mans conscience onlie by loosinge or bindinge sinnes, by means of Sacraments. The other is external Iurisdiction, Tvvo points of Spirituall Iurisdictiō internall and externall. in hearing, iudging, and determining causes in publicke affaires, that doe fall out in the Church, tending to the same end; and this distinction is founded in the words of Christ himself, as well for binding and loosing of sinnes in respect of our conscience, as also in that he addeth; Si ecclesiam non audierit, sit tibi tanquam Ethnicus, & Publicanus. 
                  
                     Matth. 6. If he heare not the Church, let him be to thee, as a Heathen, or Publican; that is to say, (as holy Fathers expound) let him be excomunicated & cast out from the Church, and then fled and auoided, as one seperated, by the authoritie of the said Church, from all communion and fruite of Christian religion, as much as if he were an Infidell or Publican. Which meaning of our Sauiour, S. Paul well vnderstandinge, said of like men, 1. Cor. 5. 
                  Auferte malum ex vobisipsis. Take away and seperate the euill from among your selues: which words S. Augustine expoundinge, saith to be as much as if he had said. 
                     Aug lib. 2. retract. cap. 17. & l. de correct. & Gra. c. 15. 
                  Hominem malum, & pernicipsum à vobis seperate per excommunicationem; Doe you seperate from your selues an euill and pernicious man, by excommunication; which is an act of externall Iurisdiction, called by Canon lawyers Actus sori contentiosi. As to absolue, or retaine sinnes in the Sacrament, are acts of Internall Iurisdiction, appertaininge to sorum conscientiae, the tribunall of conscience.
               17. So that as the temporall magistrate for furnishinge of his authoritie, hath Power also to punish temporallie when occasion is offered, and this either in goods, body, or life; so haue Spirituall Magistrates, also by Christ his appointment, Ecclesiasticall Power, not onlie to teach, exhorte, instruct, and direct, as hath been said, but to punish in like maner by Spirituall Censures much more greiuous, and dreadfull in respect of the life to come, than are the fore named punishments of the ciuill magistrate for this life. Which Censures are three in number, answeringe after a certaine manner, to the former three of the temporall magistrate, and these are accordinge to Catholike diuinitie, and Canons of the Church,

               THE SECOND PART OF THIS CHAPTER, About the Subordination of these two Povvers, the one to the other; and different Greatnes of them both. §. I.
               18. Vpon these and other like considerations then, and premisses, Catholike deuines doe deduce that these two Povvers of Spirituall, and Temporall Iurisdiction, whensoeuer they meet togeather (as in the Christian Common-wealth they doe) they are subordinate the one to the other, according to the rule of Aristotle in Philosophie, Aristotle. (which holdeth also in this case of diuinitie) that whensoeuer the ends of anie faculties be subordinate, and doe serue the one to the other, there also the faculties themselues are subordinate. And so wheras the end of Spirituall Authoritie is, to direct men to euerlastinge Saluation of their soules, and the end Temporall Gouernment, to procure their temporall prosperitie; but yet with referment, and subordination to the attainment also of life euerlasting in the next world: it followeth by most certaine consequence, that Temporall Gouernment is subordinate to the spirituall, which is so much the more excellent and eminent, as is an euerlastinge end, aboue a temporall; our immortall soule, before our corruptible bodyes; and the Kingdome of heauen, before worldlie prosperitie.
               19. Out of which considerations, no doubt did proceed those speeches of ancient and holie Fathers, about the comparison of these two Povvers, Ecclesiasticall, and Temporall, 
                  The eminency of Spirituall Povver aboue Temporall. which are founde euery where in their workes, highly preferringe the one before the other, and subiecting the one vnto the other. An me liberè loquentem, aequo animo feretis?

                   (saith S. Gregorie Nazianzen to the Emperour) Nam ves quoque, &c. will you heare me with patience to speake my minde freely vnto you?
Which truelie you ought to doe for so much, as the law of Christ, hath made you subiect to



my Power, and to my tribunall. For wee (Bishops) haue an Empyre also, and that more excellent, and perfect then yours, except you will saie that spirit is inferiour to flesh, and heauenly things to earthly. But I doubt not, but that you will take in good parte, this my freedome of speach, you being a sacred sheepe of my holie flocke, and a disciple of the great Pastor, rightly instructed by the Holy-ghost, euen from your young years, &c. So Gregorie Nazianzen to the Emperour.
               
               20. And heere we see, what difference this greate Doctor and Father S. Gregorie Nazianzen almost 1300. yeares gone, did put between these two Powers of Kings, and Bishops, Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall dignitie; euen as much, as between, flesh and spirit, heauen and earth. And the same difference doth S. Chrysostome set downe in his bookes of Priesthood, 
                  
                     Chrys. lib. 3. de sacerdoti
                           •

                   and elswere. I shall alleadge some place or two out of him, as breifly as I may, that you may see his sense, and iudgement therin: though I would wish the Reader, to peruse the places themselues heere cited, for that they will fullie satisfie him in this matter.
               21. First then in his third booke of Priesthood, comparinge the Power of a King with the Power of a Priest he hath these words. Habent quidem & terrestres Principes vinculi potestatem, verum corporum solum, &c. 
                  
                     S. Chrysost. sentence of spirituall povver. It is true, that earthlie Princes, haue power to binde, but our bodyes onlie:
But the bands, which Priests can lay vpon vs, doe touch the soule it self, and reach euen vnto the heauens so far forth as whatsoeuer Priests shall determine heere beneath, that doth God ratifie aboue in heauen, and confirmeth the sentence of his seruants vpon earth. And what is this, (I pray you) but that God hath giuen all heauenlie Power vnto them, according to those words of his. VVhose sinnes soeuer you shall retaine they are retained. 
                     
                        Ioan. 20. And what Power, I beseech you, can there be greater then this? I read that God the Father gaue all manner of Power vnto his Sonne. 
                        Math. 28. And I see againe, that God the Sonne hath giuen ouer the self same Power vnto Priests, &c. what a manifest madnes then is it, for any man to despise this Princedome of Priests, without which we cannot possibly be made partakers, either of eternall saluation, or of the good promises of our Sauiour, &c.
                  
                  Quo nomine, sacerdotes non modo plus vereri debemus; quam vel Principes, vel Reges; verum etiam maiori honore, quam parentes proprios honorare.

                   In which respect, wee ought to reuerence, & feare Priests more, not only then Princes, and Kings; but honour them also



more, then our owne parents, &c. All these are S. Chrysostomn wordes.

                      est, administranda, &c. The King hath receiued the administration, and gouernment of those things that are on the earth.
But the Priests authoritie commeth from heauen; whatsoeuer you shall binde (saith Christ) vpon earth, that shall be bound in heauen.

To the King are committed the bodies, to the Priest the soules: the King can remitt bodily spotts; but the Priest can take away the spotts of sinne: Maior hic principatus, This principallitie of Priests is greater, then that of Kings.
               
               23. Aud yet further in another Homilie vpon the same Prophet. Sacerdotium principatus est; ipso etiam regno venerabilius, & maiu

                  Si vis videre descrimen, quantum absit Rex à sacerdote, expende modum potestatis vtrique traditae. 
                  Marke this notable discourse of S. Chrysostome.
                  
                  If you will see indeed the true difference between them, and how much the King is inferiour to a Priest; consider the manner of the Power deliuered to them both; and you shall see the Priests tribunall, much higher then that of the King, who hath receiued onlie the administration of earthly things.
                  Nequè vltra potestatem hanc, quicquam habet pratereà authoritatis.
                  Neither hath he any authoritie, beyond this earthlie Power: But the Priests tribunall is placed in heauen, and hath authoritie to pronounce sentence in heauenlie affaires. And who affirmeth this?
The King of heauen himself, who saith, vvhatsoeuer you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heauen, and vvhatsoeuer you shal loose, shall bee loosed. 
                  
                     Matth. 18.
                  Heer you see heauen, to take principall authority of iudging from earth, for that the Iudge sitteth on earth, and our Lord followeth his feruant: so as whatsoeuer the said seruant shall iudge heere beneath, that will his maister allow in heauen.
So S. Chrysostome.
               
               24. And consider heere (good Reader) that this holie Father and Doctor, wrote all this in Constantinople, where the Emperour was present, and many Courtyers togeather with the Empresse



herself, auerted from him for his seueritie of discipline, and ready to note and take aduauntage against any thinge that he should say. A vveighty consideration. And yet was this doctrine neuer obiected against him, as iniurious to the Emperour, or to his Emperiall crowne: notwithstanding (as you see) he speaketh plainlie, both about the Subordination of temporall and spirituall Povver, the one to the other; as also that the Emperour had the one, and not the other. And if the same Father should preach this doctrine at Paules Crosse in these our daies, he would be hissed out, and be called into question of treason by the tenor of M. Attorneyes booke; so far are our tymes differēt from these. But God & his truth are alwayes one.
               25. And to this very same effect might I alleadg heere the sayings, and doings of diuers other auncient Fathers and Bishops, 
                     Anno 116. (for all were of one spirit, opinion, and faith in this behalfe) but it would bee ouerlonge; yet S. Ambrose I cannot omitt, Diuers examples of S. Ambrose
                   who in two or three occasiōs with the Christian Emperours of his time, did expresse most manifestly, the iudgement of the Catholike Church in those daies. The first wherof was with Valentinian the the younger, who being induced by the Empresse Iustina to commaund S. Ambrose Bishop of Millaine to dispute with AuxentiuS the Arrian Bishop, and other of his Sect, before the Emperour, and his Counsellours, and whole courte in his pallace, he refused the same, and gaue his reasons to the said Emperour in a seuerall booke which beginneth thus.

I answered (saith he) that which your Father of glorious memorie (Vaelentinian the elder) not only answered in speach vpon like occasion, but confirmed also by his lawes, that in causes belonging to faith, Priests only should iudge of Priests:
Yea further also that if a Bishop should bee called in question for his manners, this iudgment likewise should appertaine vnto Bishops: Episcopal authoritie greater then Imperiall in matters of faith. And who then of vs, doe answere more peruerslie? wee, that would haue you like your Father, or they that would haue you vnlike him, &c. Quando audisti, Clementissime Imperator, laicos in causa fidei de Episcopo iudicasse.
                  When haue you euer heard, most Clement Emperour, that lay men did iudge Bishops in matters of faith. Certè si vel scripturaerum seriem diuinarum, vel vetera tempora retractemus,



quis est qui abnuat in causa fidei, (in causa, inquam, fidei) Episcopos solere de Imperatoribus Christianis, non Imperatores de Episcopis indicare.
                  
                  Truly if we will consider, either the whole course of diuine scriptures, or the vse of auncient times, no man can deny, but that in matrers of faith (I say in matters of faith) Bishops were wont to iudge of Christian Emperours, and not Emperours of Bishops.
                  Eris, Deo sauente etiam senectutis maturitate prouectior, & tunc de hoc censebis qualis ille Episcopus sit, qui laicu ius sacerdotale substernit, Pater nunc, vir maturioris aeui dicebat, Non est meum iudicare inter Episcopos; Tua nunc dicet Clementia; Ego debeo iudicare? You shall be, by Gods fauour, by the maturitie of old age (you being now in your youth) better informed, and then you will be able to iudge better of this point, what manner of Bishop he is to be accounted, that subiecteth the right of Priestdome to laie men, your Father being a man of riper yeares, said, It belongeth not to me to be Iudge amongst Bishops; And will your Clemencie say now, that you ought to be their Iudge? so S. Ambrose in this occasion.
                
                  
                     Anno 387.27. The next yeare after with the same Valentinian, who by instigation of the said Arrians, fauoured by Iustina the Empresse, decreed, that a Church in Millaine should be giuen vnto them, S. Ambrose resistinge the same,

Conuenerunt me primò viri comites Consistoriani, &c. First, there came vnto me certaine Earles of the Court to commaund me to deliuer the Church, &c. 
                  
                     S. Ambrose his combat about deliuering vp a Church to the Emperour. I answered that which belongeth to a man of my order, that the Church could not be giuen vp by a Priest, &c.
                  
                     Ego mansi in munere, missam faecere caepi, dum 
                           •
                        ffero, raptum cognout, &c. I continued on in my Priestlie function, I began to say masse, and whilest I was offering, I vnderstood that one of the aduersarie parte, was taken by the people, I began bitterlie to weep, and beseech God in my oblation; that he would help, that no bloud might be shed in this cause of the Church; but that my bloud only, if it were his holie will, might bee shed not only for saftie of the people, but also for the wicked sorte themselues. &c. The Emperours Earles and Tribunes vrged me againe, that I should deliuer the Church sayinge. Imperatorem iure suo vti, eò quòd in potestate eius essent omnia. Respondi quae diuina sunt, Imperatoriae popotestaeti non esse subiectae, &c. They said that the Emperour did but



vse this owne right, and due authoritie, for that all was in his power. I answered that those things that were diuine, & belōged to God, are not subiect to the Emperours power.
So S. Ambrose for defence of this his particular Church against the Emperours commaundement, which notwithstanding was but a materiall Church as you see; and yet he said the cause vvas diuine and not subiect to the Emperors power; but to a higher authoritie of the clergie.
               27.
And yet further when the said Tribunes, sent by the Emperour required to haue certaine Church-vessels deliuered vnto them. S. Ambrose writeth thus. 
                        Ambr. ibid.
                      
                     Cum esset propositum, vt Ecclesiae vasa iam traderenpius hoc responsi reddidi, &c. when it was proposed vnto me by the Emperours officers, that we should presently deliuer vp the vessels of the Church (behold Church-vessels of price in those daies) I gaue this answere: that if anie things of mine were demaunded, either land, or house, or gold, or syluer, or anie other things that lay in my power to giue, I would willinglie offer the same; but from the Church of God I could take nothing away, nor deliuer that which I had receiued to be kept. 
                        S. Ambros. conflict about Church vessells.
                  
And that in this point I did respect the health principally of the Emperours soule: for that it was not expedient for me to deliuer the said Vessels, nor for him to receiue them: And that he should take in good parte, the speach of a free Priest.
If the Emperour did loue himself, he should doe well to cease from offeringe iniurie to Christ. So he. And what would he haue said (thinke you) or answered, if he had been in our English Parliament, when K. Henry the 8. both demaunded, and obtained not onlie the Vessels of many hundred Churches, but the lands, liuings, houses, and Churches also themselues which he pulled downe, & equalled with the ground, or from sacred, translated them to prophane vses.

                   handling this subiect more cleerly in another place, to witt, in a publike sermon to the people, wherin he instructeth them of the true nature, and subordination of these two Powers, Spirituall, and Temporall, Ecclesiasticall and Imperiall.
                  
                     Soluimus (saith he) quae sunt Caesaris, Caesari; & quae sunt Dei, Deo. &c. we doe pay vnto Caesar those things, 
                        Tom. 5. that belong to Caesar, and we giue vnto God, the things that appertaine vnto him. Is it Caesars tribute that is demaunded? we deny it not. Is it the Church of God? It ought not to be giuen vp to Caesar. For that the Temple of God, cannot be the right of Caesar,


                     
which we speake to the Emperours honour, for what is more honorable vnto him, then that he being an Emperour, be called a child of the Church? The Emperour a childe of the church and not aboue the Church. which when it is said, it is spoken without sinne, and to his grace, for that a good Emperour is within the Church, but not aboue the Church, and he seeketh rather help of the Church, than refuseth the same; this as we speake in humilitie, so with constancie wee freelie affirme it.
                  And albeit some doe heere threaten vs fire, sword, and exile, yet we being Christs seruaunts haue learned not to feare such things, and him that feareth not, no threats can daunt.
               
               29. And finallie not to be longer in this matter, the same good Bishop some few years after, hauing occasion to reprehend, and correct by his Ecclesiasticall Power and Iurisdiction, the famous Emperour Theodosius the Great, 
                     S. Ambrose his correction of Theodosius the Emperour. he failed not to vse the same, and therby shewed the eminency of his iurisdiction aboue the other. The occasion was, for that the said good Emperour had suffered himself, by the incitation of certaine of his courte about him, to permit the sackage, or spoile of the Citty of Thessolonica, 
                  
                     Ambros. epist. 18. for certaine howers to his souldiars, in reuenge or chastisement of a certaine disorder committed by them, but the said sackage and massacre proceedinge further vpon furie of souldiars, then the Emperours meaninge was, and many thousands of innocent people slaine. S. Ambrose wrote first an earnest epistle to the said Emperour, laying before him, the grieuousnes of his sinne, and exhortinge him to doe pennance; 
                     Anno 390. Wherin he; when the Emperour performed not so much as hee desired, proceeded further. And when the Emperour came one day to the Church, the foresaid Bishop went forth, and met him without the Church dore, forbidding him to enter therin, as vnworthy the communion of Christian faithfull people, vntill he had done sufficient pennance for his sinne, which the good Emperour meeklie obaied; as he did afterward also, when he comminge to the Church to be reconciled, and hauing made his offring, he remained within the chauncell amonge the Priests. But S. Ambrose sending vnto him his Deacon, signified, that, that place was only for Priests and Clergie men, and therfore he should departe forth into the body of the Church amonst lay men, adding this sentence. Purpurae Imperatores, non sacerdotes efficit. Purple robes make Emperours, but not Priests. Which admonition (saith Theodorete) the most faithfull Emperour tooke in good parte, and said, that



he did not stay vvithin the chauncell, vpon any presumption, but for that he had learned that custome in Constantinople: 
                     Theodoret. lib. 5. hist. cap. 17. and therefore gaue him thankes also, for this wholsome admonition. So he.
               
               30 But all which is seene what eminency of Spirituall Authoritie, was ascribed by these holy Fathers and Doctors, to Bishops Priests, and Clergie-men, aboue Kings and Emperours; and I might adde much more out of them to the same effect for confutation of M. Attorneys Paradox, but that I am to reserue diuers things, to the fourth chapter of this booke, where I must answere his principall argument; That vvhosoeuer ascribeth not all supreame power to Princes, as well in Ecclesiasticall as Temporall matters, maketh them no complete monarches: But these holy Fathers of the auncient primitiue Church were of another iudgement, as you see.
               31. Wherfore this being so, that in the Church, & Common-wealth of Christ, though Kings and Emperours be Supreame in temporall Authoritie, and both honour, obedience, and tribute due vnto them in their degree, 
                     Matth. 21. Rom. 13. 1. Pet. 4. as Christ and his Apostles doe teach: yet, that in spirituall, and Ecclesiasticall matters, concerning the soule, Priests and Bishops are more eminent in Authoritie. Hence it was deduced, that for combininge these two Powers, and Authoritie togeather in peace and vnion, and due subordination in the Christian Common wealth, Hovv these tvvo povvers are to be combyned. the one hauinge need of the other (for that neither the temporall partie can saue their soules, without the spirituall function; neither the Ecclesiasticall State be defended without the temporal sword) hence (I say), it proceeded that presentlie after the entrance of Constantine the Emperour into the Church, wherby Temporall, & Spirituall Power were to be conioyned togeather, and exercised in one body (though in different tribunalls, & distinct affaires) seuerall laws, and ordinances were set downe, and agreed vpon, how they should liue togeather in peace, and concord, and dutifull respect the one to the other: See of the distinctiō of these 2. names the Canons of the Apostles.

                   the Ecclesiasticall partie, by an auncient name, euen from the Apostles time downwards, being called the Cleargie, which signifieth the Lott, or peculiar in heritance of God himself; and the temporall partie named the Laity, which importeth as much as the rest of the people, besides the Cleargie.
               
               32. These two parties I say, are directed by most anncient laws both diuine, and humane how to liue togeather in vnion, & due subordination, giuing to each power, and gouernment, that which is due to each other, especiallie in these points following,



which Catholike deuines, and Canon-lawyers doe larglie handle: But I shall breiflie touch the sunne onlie in this place so far, is it may appertaine to better decision of this our controuersie. Noting first by the way for the Reader his better aduertisement, 
                     Note.
                   that these two Powers of Spirituall, and Temporall Iurisdiction, being different (as hath been said) and hauing so different ends, and obiects; and proceeding so differentlie from God, by different means and manners; and that they may be separated, and remaine seuerally and alone in different subiects, as they did for diuers ages togeather in the primitiue Church. All this (I saie) being so, it followeth that it is no good argument, but rather a manifest fallacie, to inferre the one of the other, as to saie, he hath spiritual Iurisdiction ouer me, and therfore also temporall; which followeth not, and much lesse the contrarie; he hath temporall Authoritie ouer any ergo spiritual also. And least of all, as M. Atorney argueth euery-where. A Prince or Monarch hath supreame authoritie temporal, ergo also spirituall; for that the one may be without the other, as comming downe from one origen, by different means, and to different ends, as before hath been declared. Now then let vs passe to the decisions aboue mencioned for due Subordination in these two Powers.
            
            
               THE THIRD PART OF THIS CHAPTER, Shewing how these two Povvers, and Iurisdictions, may stand well togeather in agreement, peace and vnion. 4. II.
               33. The first affertion both of Deuines, and Canonists is, that notwithstanding the former Prerogatiues of Spirituall Power aboue Temporall; yet when they are conioyned in one Common-wealth (as they haue been in the Catholike Church for these thirteene hundred years at least, since the Conuersion of Constantine the Emperour) the Cleargie, and Ecclesiasticall persons of euerie



Realme, as members of that Common-wealth, are subiect vnto the Emperour, King, or other head of that Ciuill and politicke body, or Common-wealth in al temporall laws, and ordinances, not contrary to Gods law, nor the Cannons of holie Church; and are punishable for the same, though not in temporall courts, but spirituall, as after ward in the third assertion shall be declared. As for example; when the Ciuill magistrate appointeth things to be solde at such, or such price: that no man goe by night with armes: or carry out cōmodities of the Realme without licence, and the like: The obedience of Cleargie men, due to the Ciuill magistrates. cleargie men as Cittizens of the Common-wealth are subiect also vnto these laws which are made for direction of of the Common-wealth, to peace, aboundance, and prosperitie: and consequentlie, are to be obserued also by Bishops, Priests, and Cleargie-men.
               34. And in this sense, are to be vnderstood the words, both of our Sauiour, and his Apostles, when they ordaine all obedience to be exhibited by all Christians to their temporall Princes, without exception of anie, yea though they were euill men or infidells. AS namely where S. Paul saith. 
                     Rom. 2. 
                  Omnia anima potestatibus sublimioribus subdita sit. Let euery soule be subiect to higher powers, which S. Peter expoundeth, 1. Pet. 2. 
                  siuè Regi, siuè Ducibus, &c. Whether it be to Kings, Dukes; and the like. Vpon which place to S. Paul, the holie Doctor S. Chrysostome inferreth that politicall, 
                     Chrysost. comment. in Rom. 13. and temporall laws, are not abrogated by the ghospell, but that both Priests, and monkes, are bound to obey the same in temporall affairs. And Valentinian the good Christian Emperour, 
                     Valent apud Theod. l. 14. hist. cap. 7. in a certaine Epistle of his, to the Bishops of Asia aboue 12. hundred years gone, said
                     •
                   
                  that good Bishops doe obey, not only the laws of God, but of Kings likewise. Which Pope Nicolas the first, writing to Michaell the Emperour doth proue, when he saith, 
                     Nicol. 1. epist. ad Mica
                           •
                        lem. Imper.
                   
                  that Christian Emperours doe need Bishops for the attaining of euerlasting life; But that Bishops doe need Kings, and Emperours onlie, to vse their laws, for their direction in temporall affaires. And finally the matter is cleer not onlie, by the testimonie, and practise of the primitiue Church (say our Deuines) but also by reason it selfe. For that if any sorte of people should liue in a Common-wealth, and not obserue the laws therof, it would be a perturbation to the whole. And for that these Ciuill laws, albeit their immediate end be temporall good; yet may the obseruation therof be referred also to a higher spirituall end by good men, and therfore are all good



subiects bound to obey them. And this for the first point.
               35. The second is, that in causes meere Ecclesiasticall, and Spirituall, which appertaine to Religion, Faith, Sacraments, holie Orders, and the like, and are to be determined out of the ghospell, Councells, Canons, and Doctors of the Church: In all these affaires Catholike deuines holde, that Ecclesiasticall persons, are no way subiect to temporall Princes, for the reasons before alleadged of preheminēcy of Spiritual Power, 
                  Cleargie men in spirituall matters cannot be vnder the laytie. aboue Temporal in these affaires. In respect wherof the holie auncient Bishops did stand with Christian Emperours, and auerre their Authoritie to be aboue the others, as before out of S. Gregorie Nazianzen, S. Ambrose S. Chrisostome and others you haue heard declared. So as heere you se a mutuall Subordination of Preists to Princes, in Ciuill and temporall matters, and of Princes to Preists and Bishops, in spirituall affaires: which according to S. Gregorie Nazianzen his comparison before mencioned, may thus be expressed; that the soule in matters of this life, though with some griefe and regreate of spirit in good men, is bound to follow the direction, and law of the body for health, strength, and other such corporall commodities; and the body in matters of life euerlasting, must be content to follow the soule, and direction of spirit, and so is bound to doe, though with repugnance oftentimes of the flesh, as in fasting, praying, pennance, & other such like exercise. And wheresoeuer these two mutuall subordinations be wel obserued; there the Common wealth goeth forward wel, and prosperouslie; and contrarywise where the said subordination is neglected or perturbed, there all goeth out of order and ioynt.
               36. But now there remaineth a third point of further moderation, between these two Powers, which is accordinge to our deuines, and Canon-lawyers; Ha

                      povver. That albeit Ecclesiastical men be subiect to the obseruation of temporall laws; as before is said; yet are as well their persons, as their goods free, and exempted, from the temporall magistrate, and his tribunalls, euen in those causes also: in so much, that if Cleargie men doe offend against the laws of the Common-wealth, they are to be iudged, and condemned by Ecclesiasticall iudges, in the Courts, and tribunals of their prelats, and afterward to be deliuered to secular power, to inflict the decreed punishmēt vpon them, which they shall be found worthie of. Their goods also both Ecclesiasticall, and temporall, are exempted from all secular power, and their



impositions, or exactions, by auncient Decrees and Constitutions, as well of the Church, as of old Christian Emperours in honorem Cleri in honour of the Cleargy, See Concil. La

               37. And there doe not want many learned deuines, who are of opinion, that this exemption of Ecclesiastical persons, and their goods, is not onlie Iuris humani Ecclesiastici, by positiue and humane Ecclesiasticall laws: Exemptiō of Clergie men en Iure diu

                   But Iuris diuini also; that is to saie, by right of diuine law in a certaine sorte, which is thus to bee vnderstood; That albeit God hath not expreslie commaunded it in the written law of Scripture, yet is it conforme both to the law of nature, which is also Gods law; as likewise it may be deduced, & inferred from exāples recorded in Scripture, vnder the old Testamēt, that God would haue this honour of exemption, and immunitie in temporall things to be exhibited to his Cleargy. 
                     Gen. 47. And therfore we doe reade in Genesis that Ioseph the Patriarch in the law of Nature, did exempt the Priests of the Egyptians, from all temporall tributes. 1. Esd. 7. And in the bookes of Esdras we read, that Artaxerxes King of the Persians, out of the same law of Nature, did make free also the Priests of Israell. And that the very Gentiles did the same to their Priests out of the same law, and instinct of Nature, is euident out of Aristotle in his second booke Oeconomicorum. And of Caesar in his sixt booke De bello Gallico. And out of Plutarch in the life of Camillus, and other Pagan writers. And in the written law we read, as well in Exodus, 
                  
                     Exod. 30. as in the booke of Numbers, 
                  1. Num. 5. That God did often affirme, that he would haue the order of Leuites to be his, and to be freelie giuen, and made subiect onlie to Aaron their high Priest, and to paye no tribute. Out of which is inferred,



that if God in the law of Nature, and of Moyses, would haue Priests, and Leuites to be free in their persons, & goods, from temporall exactions; much more may it be presumed, that he will haue it so in the new Law of the Ghospel,

Now then, matters standing thus, and the Church in euery countrey throughout Christendome being in possession of these liberties, freedomes, and immunities, for their persons, and goods, and acknowledging for their supreame superiour in Spirituall Power, and Iurisdiction, the Bishop of Rome, and their temporall Kings in Ciuill, and temporall matters: there grew in processe of time, many difficulties, and entanglements, about the execution, and subordination of these two Iurisdictions Temporall, and Spiritual the one to th'other, sometimes by abuse, passiō, or indiscretiō of some vnder-officers of these two supreame powers, & tribunals within our land; ech side seeking to incroach vpon the other, or at leastwise not to be content with their owne limits, For as between the spirit, and flesh in this life, (to vse againe S. Gregorie Nazianzens similitude) there is some continuall strife, and struglinge; The competence betvvene temporall and ecclesiasticall Magistrates in some externall things. so hath it been allwayes in a certaine sorte between these two powers of Spirituall and Temporall Iurisdiction, or at leastwise in the exercise therof, especially as riches, & temporalityes grew more in the Clergie; and therby gaue matter of enuy, and emulation; and lesse deuotion to the laytie towards them; in so much, that at length for auoidinge worse inconueniences, limitations, conditions, concordates, and transactions, were made and brought into vse, how far the execution of ech parties authoritie should be extēded in certaine inferiour things, that might seeme either mixt, or doubtful, as by many examples, both in France, Spaine, Sicily, Naples, Flaunders, England, and other countreys may be declared: Whervpon notwithstanding daylie wee see sundry difficulties, sutes, and controuersies to arise.

Some States also, and Catholike Kingdomes, haue made certaine Decrees, or Restraints at sometimes de facto (whether rightfully or noe, I will not now dispute) for preuentinge, and remedyinge some pretended inconueniences, in the exercise of certaine points of the Popes Authority within their said Realmes, Some other also pretend to haue done the same with indult, consent, transaction, or conuiuency of the Pope himself. But none of all these (which is the mayne pointe) did euer deny, or call in question the said Authoritie it self, as after shall appeare; but rather did many wayes acknowledge, and confesse the same; and of this kind of Restrictions, or Interpretations, are the most part of these few peeces of Decrees, and Statutes, Customes, Laws, or Ordinances, that M. Attorney doth alleadge, which make nothing at all for the proofe of his mayne question, that our English Kings before and after the Conquest, did take vpon themselues supreame Spirituall Authoritie, as deriued from the Right of their Crowne: nay rather they make fully against him, for that the very manner of making these restraintes, first by way of supplication to the Popes themselues (as after shall be shewed) and then by domesticall ordinances, doth well declare what opinion the said Princes had of that power to be in the said Popes, & not in themselues. And this is so much as needeth to be said in this place for a generall light to the whole matter. Now shall we passe ouer, to treat of the particular occasion, wherevpon M. Attorney thought good, to ground his whole discourse of Q. Elizabethes Ecclesiasticall Authoritie, as presently shall be declared.

I doe call the case pittifull, not so much in respect of the poore man depriued and vexed, as after shall appeare, but much more of the publike partiality appearing to haue been vsed against him, by sway of the tyme, and by such men, as occupied the place of Iustice.

(in parte wherof the Cloase was broken) by a sentence of the said Bishop of London, Cum assensu A. B. C. D. &c. Collegerum suorum. For that he had preached against the Booke of Common-praier, and refused to celebrate diuine seruice according to the same.
               
                
                  The groūd of the controuersie.3. Heerupon it came in question, how and by what Authoritie, the said Bishop of London had giuen his sentence, either rightfully or wrongfully. And first it was alleadged by Cauderyes Coū
                  sell, that the Authoritie of commission giuen to him (to witt to the forenamed Bishop of London) and certaine others his Colleags, Statute for spirituall authoritie Anno 1. Elizabethae.
                   by the foresaid Q. Elizabeths letters Patents, was only founded vpon a Statute, made in the first yeare of her Raigne, by which it was enacted,
That such Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, as by anie spirituall, or Ecclesiasticall power, hath heertofore been, or may lawfully be exercised, for the visitation of the Ecclesiasticall estate, and persons, and for the reformation, order, and correction of the same, and of all manner of errours, heresies, schismes, abuses, offences, contempts, and enormities within this Realme, should for euer be vnited and annexed to the Imperiall Crowne of this Realme. And that her highnes, her heyrs, and Successors should haue full power, and Authoritie, The Spirituall authoritie giuen to Q. Elizabeth by Statute. by vertue of that Act, by letters Patents vnder the great Seale of England, to assigne, nominate, and authorize such persons (being natural borne subiects) as her Highnes, her heirs, or Successours should thinke meet, to exercise and execute, vnder her highnes, her heyrs, and successours, all, and all manner of Iurisdiction, Priuiledges, and Preheminences, in anie wise, touching or concerning anie spirituall, or Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, within this Realme of England, and Ireland. And to visite, reforme, redresse, order, correct, and amend all such errours, heresies, schismes, abuses, offenses, contempts, and enormities whatsoeuer, which by anie manner of spirituall, or Ecclesiasticall Power, Authoritie, or Iurisdiction, can or may lawfully be reformed, ordered, corrected, and amended. &c.
               
               4. This was the ground, wherby both the Queene was indued as you see, with all manner of Ecclesiasticall power, and Iurisdiction, and had authoritie also giuen her, to bestow the same vpon others: without anie other condition heere expressed, but onlie that they should be naturall borne subiects. So as if it had pleased her Maiestie, to haue bestowed a Commission, vpon so many



                  Ladies of the Courte, to visit some parte of the Cleargie, or Laitie; to redresse their errours, heresies, abuses, or other enormities; or insteed of the Bishops named by her, she had thought good to nominate their wiues for high commissioners ouer them, to reforme, order, redresse, correct, or amend abuses, I see not by the words of the Statute, why it had not been lawfull; For so much, as there is no exception of sex therin. And as well might the Queene haue made women her substitutes in this point, as this Statute gaue all the power in capite to her self being a woman. I would aske moreouer, that wheras K. Henry the eight, when he was made head of the Church appointed for his Vicar-Generall in Spiritualibus the Lord Cromwell, 
                  Certaine cases of inconueniences vpon Q. Elizabethes supreme spirituall authority. that was a meere lay man, and caused him to sit aboue all the Bishops in Synods and Councels, about Ecclesiasticall affaires: why his daughter Q. Elizabeth that had the same authoritie that he had, might not haue appointed my Lady Cromwell, or anie such other Ladie of that sex, wherof there were diuerse that professed good skill in diuinitie (at the beginning of her Reigne) for her Vicaresse-Generall, in Ecclesiasticall affaires. Nay why the feminne sex might not haue conspired togeather to haue put downe men for a time, and to haue taken the gouernment of the Church vpon themselues: making themselues the Cleargie, as their husbands were the laity. And truly albeit this may seeme ridiculous; yet I see not, what in earnest can be answered heervnto, but onlie the noueltie, and indecency of the thinge. For, as for the lawfulnes, according to Luthers doctrine,

And as for the said inconueniences of noueltie and indecency, there might seeme to be as great, or greater in giuing Ecclesiasticall primacy to a woman, as to make another woman her substitute, or Vicaresse; But we see the first done, and therfore the second in like manner might haue been done, if her Maiestie had pleased.
               5. But leauing this we shall returne to our Case of Caudery the Clerke, who whether he were a Catholike Priest, or Puritan-minister, that was depriued for refusing to follow the Communion-booke, is vncertaine; but whatsoeuer he was, it seemeth that his cause was much ouer borne by the Current of the time, in fauour of the Bishop of London that depriued him, which I notwithstanding would not trouble my self, nor my Reader to repeate



in this place, but that I am forced therunto in regarde, that vpon his Plea, & Resolution of the temporall Iudges theron, riseth out the occasion of our particular Controuersie, about Q. Elizabeths Spirituall Iurisdiction.
                
                  The first argument of Caudery.
                  6. First then the said Cauderyes Counsell pleaded for him, that wheras in the Statute concerning the foresaid Booke of Common praier (which they said was made with much moderation, and equitie) it was appointed and ordained, that if any did offend against the same, he should for the first time loose onlie the profit of his Ecclesiasticall liuings for one yeare, and suffer imprisonment for six moneths: And for the second offence, be depriued ipso facto: And for the third, be imprisoned during his life; And that of euery of these offences, in order, the delinquent should be seuerally conuicted, & condemned iudiciallie; which they said, that the Bishop of London had not obserued, but had depriued Caudery for the first offence; and this vpon no notorious euidence of the fact, or by his owne confession as the statute ordeyned: but onlie by default of his appearance. So as they alleadged two great, and important defects, to haue been committed by him; The reply against Caudery. Reportes fo

                        . 5. and consequentlie his fact to be voide. And yet not withstanding saith M. Attorney; it was resolued by the whole Courte, that the Bishops sentence was not to be impeached, for either of them; First, for that it was not said in the Queens Commission, that you shall proceed thus, and not other wise, or in no other manner or forme. Secondlie for that the Ecclesiasticall and temporall laws, haue seueral proceedings, and seuerall ends. And thirdlie, for that there is a certaine prouiso in the said Act, that all Archbishops and Bishops, and euery of their Chancellours, Commissaryes, Archdeacons, and other Ordinaries, hauing peculiar Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction; may inquire, and punish within their said Iurisdictions, by admonition, excommunication, sequestration, or depriuation. &c.
               
                
                  Three shiftes re

Attorneyes leaue, none of these three shifts can satisfie the reason of an indifferent man in this Case:  For first the Commission giuen to punish by the Queene, was stricti Iuris, and consequētly not to bee inlarged further, than the expresse words doe beare; especially seeing that it is in preiudice of others.  And the second euasion seemeth preiudicial to the Iudges themselues, confessing therby in effect, that albeit by their Common-law, which pretendeth to follow Reason, the Bishops proceeding was not warrant-able: yet it might be so, by the Ecclesiasticall



law, (that belike proceedeth without Reason) though how, or why, nothing is here sett downe, but onlie this,

Attorney, (as though he had said somewhat to the purpose) quote his  12. Isa

Then (saith he) both these distinct, and seuerall Iurisdictions, consist and stand vvell togeather, and doe ioyne in this, to haue the vvhole man inwardly, and outwardlie reformed. Which conclusion supposinge, as you see, all Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, to be inward onlie, is denied by vs flattlie; for that we hold Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction to be both internall, and externall, in fore conscientia, & in fore contentioso: as in the precedent Chapter we haue shewed. And secondlie we saie, that this seemeth nothinge to the purpose, for releeuinge the Bishop of London his Act, in depriuinge Caudery beyond the forme of his Commission.
               8. The third euasion also, Shifte. vnder colour of the forenamed prouiso, is to little purpose; for that it alloweth only ordinary Ecclesiasticall Iudges within their proper Iurisdictions, to proceed by admonition, excommunication, sequestration, or depriuation; which was not so dangerous a matter, for so much as the partie aggreiued might allwaies appeale from them to higher courts for remedy, if he were aggreiued. But this authoritie of the high commissioners, being extraordinarie and supreame, hath no Appellation from it, and consequentlie it was more reason and needfull, that their Authoritie should be limited with some bounds; and that they should not exceed, the strict words of their commission, to the end, that the aggreiued might appeale, at leastwise to the faid Commission & clauses therof, when they found themselues iniured. And the argumēt vsed heere by M. Attorney, à fortiore, 
                  M. Attorneys Argument à fortiore of no force. hath no force at all; to witt, that for so much, as these inferiour Ecclesiasticall ordinarie Iudges had power to proceed, without restraint of anie particular forme; much more, high Commissioners had that Authoritie giuen them; For that (saith he) Cui licet quod in maius est, non debet quod minus est non licere. Hee that may doe the greater, may not be denyed the lesser. This I say, is to simple to be brought forth, by so graue a Sage of the law, as M. Attorney is



held to be. First, for that this Maximè agreeth not properly to out case: For albeit no man deny, but that high Commissioners could doe more and greater things, than these ordinarie Commissaries; yet, for this it self, they needed more to be bound, and tyed to a prescript manner of iustifiable proceeding, as hath been said; least they might iniure, and oppresse men at their pleasure without remedy. And secondlie is is not allwayes true, that he which can doe the greater, can doe the lesse, when it is in different kind of Iurisdictions, ordinary, or extraordinarie: as in our case it falleth out.
                
                  An example against M. Attorney.
                  9. For if (for examples sake) a Visitour be sent to a Colledge to visit the same for certaine defects, with particular order, how to proceed, and punish the said offences; though in many things he haue greater Authoritie, by his extraordinarie commission, then is the ordinarie of the President and fellows, and other ordinarie officers: yet cannot hee either tacitè or à fortiore by vertue of this Maximè take vnto him, all the power, and manner of proceeding which the said President and fellowes haue, by their ordinarie Authoritie of Statutes, in admitting and reiecting schollers, giuing, and changing offices, setting, and letting of lands, and the like: except it be epresslie in his Commission. Noe, not in punishments neither, concerning those defects, which he hath to visit may he exceed his prescript order; they being things, as I say, stricti Iuris, which both law, reason, and conscience doe forbid to be enlarged beyond his commission. And so doth M. Attorney seeme to graunt that it should be so in any iudgement giuen by Commissioners, of Oyer and Terminer, or other Commissioners, or Iudges of the common law; insinuating belike, that the Canon, or Ecclesiasticall law now vsed in England, is abritrary, & to be applied, as they please that sit in Authoritie.
                
                  The secōd argument of Cauderyes case.10. And this seemeth greatlie to be confirmed, by another Resolution of his Iudges made to another argument of Caudery, wherein his Counsell vrged for him, that according to the commission, sentence should haue been giuen against him, by three at least of the Commissioners ioyntlie concurring, which was not obserued; but giuen onlie by the Bishop, though he pretendeth, that it was also by the consent of some of his Colleage. Strange resolutiō. 
                  It was resolued (saith M. Attorney) by the whole Courte that the sentence giuen by the Bishop, with Consent of his Colleags, was such, as the Iudges of the Common Law, ought to allow to be giuen according to the Ecclesiasticall



laws. Consider, I praie you, this Resolution, that they, out of the Common-law, doe allow it to be well done, according to the Ecclesiasticall laws: but heare the reason, for it importeth much, to se therby the manner of proceeding: 
                     Reportes fol. 7. 
                  for seeing (saith hee) that their authoritie is to proceed, and giue sentence in Ecclesiasticall causes, according to the Ecclesiasticall law, and they haue giuen a sentence in a cause Ecclesiasticall, vpon their proceedings; by sorce of that law, the Iudges of the common law, ought to giue faith, and credit to their sentence, and to allow it to be done according to the Ecclesiasticall law. For Cuilibet in sua arte perito est credendum. VVee must beleeue euery skillfull man in his arte &c. So hee. And is not this a strange Reason of a iudiciall sentence thinke you? that for so much, as the Bishop of London had depriued Caudery by pretence of an Ecclesiasticall law, his fact must be allowed by vertue of this maxime: That euery skillfull man is to be credited in his art. And was not the poore plainteife well holpen vp, who after foure years trauell and cost, as it appeereth, wherin he followed the suite at the Common-law against the said Bishop, he was now answered, That euerie skillfull man, must be beleeued in his art, without further inquiring.
               11. And yet M. Attorney heere auerreth, that it is a common, receiued opinion of all bookes, and citeth diuerse  11. Hen. 7. 9. 14. Hen. 6. 14. &c.
                   booke-cases for the same. And albeit I haue not by me the bookes themselues nor doe professe my self skillfull therin; yet must I needs ascribe so much equitie, prudence, & reason, vnto the Common law as to presume that it will not admit this Maxime without some distinction or reasonable restriction. As for example; that this Peritus or skillfull man, that must be so beleeued, be eminent in his art, and be not interessed, nor passionate in the Case proposed; For other-wise absurde effects would insue: as for example. If a surgeon hyred to cure a wound, should be suspected to haue intoxicated the same, and that the Plainteife should haue this answere, that euery skillfull man is to be beleiued in his arte, it were iniustice: For that he might, either of ignorance, haue erred therin, if he be not knowne to be very well learned in his arte; or of malice, if he might be presumed to hope, or expect gaine by the wounded mans death. An example vvith the application therof. And howsoeuer it be, the matter in right, & conscience were not to be shuffled ouer with such an answere of the appointed Iudges, but the Case were to be examined, other surgeons to be consulted, them ans skill, honestie, and reputation to be inquired of, and other such diligence



to be vsed, as might content, and satisfie the afflicted partie; wherof none was done, as it seemeth, in the behalfe of Caudery.
               
               12. For wheras in this case the Bishop of London was interessed in his honour, to defend that which he had done; Caudery shifted of 
                        •
                     ightly. & not perhaps the greatest Canoinst, or Ciuilian Lawyer in the world for his skill; and this poore plainteife, as I saie, hauinge followed the Common Lawyers to iudge the case for so many years; it seemeth a sleight shifting off, for the Iudges to tell him now, in fauour of the said Bishop and his Colleags, Cuilibet in sua arte perito, est credendum. We must beleeue euery man skilfull in his science; which is as much as if they had said; he hath depriued you, and he is skilfull in depriuing, and therfore you must thinke that he hath done it very well. And this is all the remedy you are like to haue.
               31. And by this the reader may also perceiue how much is to be ascribed to M. Attorneyes words before recited, when he saith of those Iudges of the Common law, from whome he citeth some certaine little peeces of Interpretations, Ordinances, Statutes, or decrees, in proofe (as he would haue it seeme) of the Queens Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction; persuading vs, that they could not bee daunted vvith any feare, moued by any affection, nor corrupted vvith any reward: which as I beleiue in some, so the experience of these our daies, and of these our fornamed Iudges and moderne Sages, may teach vs to suspect the same in others also of those auncienter times, who may be presumed to haue followed the current of their dayes, and to haue been no lesse ready, to run after their Princes humours, than we see many lawyers and Deuines also in our dayes to doe. But now to the last argument of Caudery, & finall Resolution against him.
               14. After that he had declared the three defects before mentioned of the Bishop of Londons sentence against him. First that he was depriued vpon the first accusation. Secondlie that hee was conuicted by no Iury, wittnesses, or confession, but vpon not appearance. Thirdlie that the sentence was not giuen by three, or more Commissioners ioyntlie. All which are expresse clauses of their commission sleightly euacuated, The third argument of Caudery & hovv it vvas ansvvered. as before you haue heard: he came to the fourth point, which is, that the Statute wherby this supreame Ecclesiastcall power was giuen to the Queene herself by the Parlament, hath a clause; that such as should be named for commissioners must be naturally borne subiects. Which his counsell



said did not appeere by the special verdict of the Iury, to haue been obserued, & consequentlie that the sentence was not good and auailable in law. Heervnto (saith M. Attorney) a threefold answere vvas giuen, and resolued by the vvhole courte. 
                  
                     Reportes fol. 7. First, that they which were Commissioners, and had places of iudicature, should be intended to be subiects borne, and not aliens, &c. Quia stabitur praesumptioni, donec probetur in contrarium. The common presumption must bee followed, vntill the contrarie be proued. Heer you see how much this answere weigheth. It seemeth to me that this matter might easilie in foure years haue been verefied, if the Iudges had listed, whether these Commissioners were aliens, or borne Subiects, & not to reiect the Plainteife now with this shaddow, of common presumption, that they might be presumed or supposed to be naturally borne.
               15. Secondlie, saith M. Attorney the Iurors haue found that the Queene, by her said letters Patents, did authorize them secundum formam Statuti praedicti: according to the forme of the said Statute that authorized her; and therfore it doth by a necessarie consequence amount to as much, as if they had found, that they had been subiects borne. Marke this kinde of reasoning. 
                  For if they were not subiects borne (saith he) they could not be so authorized secundum formam Statuti praedicti. This is the second answere somewhat weaker (as to mee it seemeth) than the former, of presumption and common intendement. For heere, insteed of prouing that the Commissioners were borne subiects, and consequentlie well anthorized; he subsumeth, and inferreth the contrary, to witt, that they were authorized by the Queene, secundum formam Statuti praedicti. ergo they were borne subiects: as who would saie the Queen, or those that counselled her, could not be deceiued or euill informed, or negligent in this point, about the obseruing of that clause: and yet this is all, that was answered by the Court to this matter. Which themselues (belike) considering, fell to deuise a third answere, more absurde and paradoxicall, than all the rest, which haue giuen the ground or argument of this Sage fable or Comedy, which M. Attorney hath heere partlie reported, and partlie exhibited vnto vs, in this his booke, to the laughter of such as reade it, and doe consider the exorbitant vanitie therof. I shall set it downe in very few words.

As also by the body of the Act in diuerse partes therof, for that this Act doth not annex anie Iurisdiction to the Crowne, but that which in truth was, or of right ought to be, by the auncient laws of the Realme, parcell of the Kings Iurisdiction, and vnited to his Imperiall Crowne, &c. so as, if the said Act of the first yeare of the late Queene, had neuer been made, it was resolued by all the Iudges, that the King or Queene of England for the time being, may make such an Ecclesiasticall commission, by the auncient prerogatiue, or law of England. Thus hee.

Authoritie vniuersally receiued: So as, for so much as their kingdomes being entyre Empires, and Monarchies, (as ours is) they must needs be said, to haue had this Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction also in the highest degree, included in their Kinglie right, as parcell of their Imperiall Crowne; wherof insueth, that either they, and their learned Counselours, Lawyers, and Sages, did not see or know the same, which had been great Ignorance: or esteemed it not, which had been great negligence; or (which is most likely) that our lawyers now will be thought by them ridiculous, to set forth such a strange Paradox to the worlde, contrary to that which so many thousand Sages of former tymes both in generall Councells and otherwise, haue resolued, decreed, and determined, vpon better deliberation, and more searche, both of diuinity, history, and lawe, than these temporall Iudges could doe vpon the suddaine in Cauderyes case, howsoeuer M. Attorney doth magnifye the same; whoe as I heare by some that will seeme to reporte it from his owne mouth, he that is the Reporter, is in great parte also the author, or at least wise affecteth to be thought so, as of a new witty inuention; hauing often, and vnto many promised to proue it, and now hath begun to sett vpon it.

               THE SECOND PART OF THIS CHAPTER, Vvith a more cleere explication of the Question. §. I.
               18. But before wee come to treate of proofes, we must consider of one circumstance of the matter more, which is of no small importance, for iudging of the whole, and this is the circuite of words, and multitude of darke and dazeling phrases, which the foresaid Statute vseth, in deliuering, and setting downe the Ecclesiasticall power & Iurisdiction, 
                     Reportes fol. 1. giuen to Q. Elizabeth, to wit; that all such Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, as by anie spirituall, or Ecclesiasticall power, hath heertofore been, or may lawfully be exercised, for the visitation of the Ecclesiasticall estate and persons, and for their reformation, order, and



correction of the same; and of all manner of errors, heresies &c. is given to the Queene, with full power and authoritie, to assigne, nominate, and authorize others also, to exercise and execute vnder her highnes all, and all manner of Iurisdiction, priuiledges, and preheminences, in anie wise touching or concerning, anie spirituall or Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, and to visit, reforme, redresse, order, correct, and amend, &c.
               
               19. Which words may seem by their often naming of visitation and visiting, that they meant onlie to make the Queene a visitrix ouer the Cleargie, which importeth much limitation of supreme power, and yet on the other side, they giue her all Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, that euer hath been heertofore, or may be exercised by anie Ecclesiasticall authoritie or person; and that both she, and her substitutes, haue all, and all manner of Iurisdiction, priuiledges, and preheminences concerning spirituall affaires, as you haue heard. VVhy so great circuit of vvordes is vsed in the Statute of Supremacy. So as, on the one side, they seeme to restraine and limitt, not calling her head of the Church, as before in the stile of K. Henrie, and K. Edward was accustomed, but rather a supreme Visitrix, as by these words appeereth. And on the otherside they giuing her, all, and all manner of Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall that by anie power, or person Ecclesiasticall hath euer heertofore been vsed, or may be vsed (including no doubt therin both the Pope, and all other Bishops, or Archbishops, that euer haue exercised Iurisdiction in England) they make her spirituall head of the Church in the highest degree; giuing her the thinge, without the name, and dazeling the eyes of the ordinarie Reader, with these multitude of words subtilie couched togeather. And why so thinke yon? I shall breefly disclose the mysterie of this matter.
               20. When K. Henry the eight, had taken the Title of Supreame head of the Church vpon him; as also the gouernours of K. Edward had giuen the same vnto him, being but yet a child of 9. years old: the Protestants of other Countries, which were glad to se England, brake more and more from the Pope, whome they feared; yet not willing insteed therof to put themselues wholie vnder temporall Princes, but rather to rest at their owne libertie, of chosing congregations and presbyteryes, to gouerne; began to mislike with this English stile of Supreame head,

                   as well the Lutheranes, as appeereth by diuers of their writings, as also the Zuinglians; and much more afterward the Caluinists, whereupon Iohn Caluin their head and founder, in his Commentary vpon Amos the Prophet inueigheth bitterlie against the said



Title, and authoritie of supreame head taken first by King Henry, and saith it was Tyrannicall, and impious. And the same assertion he held during his life, as after by occasion, more particularlie shall be shewed. And the whole body of Caluinists, throughout other Countryes, are of the same opinion and faith, though in England, they be vpon this point deuided, into Protestants and Puritans, as all men know.
               21. This then being the State of thinges, when Q. Elizabeth began her Raigne, those that were neerest about her, and most preuailed in Counsell, inclining to haue a change in Religion, that therby also other changes of dignities, offices, and liuings might insue, and desiring to reduce all to the new Queens disposition; but yet finding great difficultie and resistance in many of the Caluinists, to giue the accustomed Title of headship, in respect of Iohn Caluins reprobation therof: A nevv deuise to giue the headship to Q. Elisabeth vvithout the title of Head.
                   they deuised a new forme and featute of words, wherby couertly to giue the substance without the name; that is to saie, the whole spirituall power, & iurisdiction of supreame head vnder the name of Visitrix, or supreame gouernesse, as in the Oath of the same Statute is set downe where euery man, vnder forfiture of all his lands and liuings, (and life also in the third time) is bound to sweare, and professe, that he beleiueth in his cōscience, that the said Qneene is supreame gouernesse in all causes Ecclesiastical in this sense; and that there is no other Spirituall power, or Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction ouer soules in England, but this of the Qneene, or such as commeth from her. And this was also the high iniquitie of this tragicall Comedye among other; that the whole Realme being almost all Catholike and of a contrarie beleife at that time, was forced to sweare, within thirtie daies after the said Act, to this fantasticall deuise of giuing supreame authoritie Spirituall to a woman, wherof by naturall, diuine, and humane law, she is not capable, (as in the next chapter shall bee proued) being a deuise of some few, in a corner first, and then procured by negociation to passe in Parlament; or els to incurre the daunger of the foresaid penalties; that is to saie, either sacrilegiouslie to forsweare themselues against their consciences, or to vndoe themselues and theirs in wordlie affaires; a hard and miserable choise.
               22. But now to the point it self, what reall, and substantiall difference (thinke you) can their be imagined between the spirituall Authortie of Head-ship giuen vnto K. Henry the 8. by the Statute



of the 26. yeare of his reigne, and this of visitrix or supreame gouernesse, giuen to Q. Elizabeth in the first of her reigne? Was not the self-same power and Iurisdiction ment to be giuen? And if there bee no difference in the thing it self why doe they fly the word in this, which they vsed in that; and why doe they vse such large circumloquutions, of visiting, ordering, redressing, and the like? For as for K. Henries statute, 
                     Statut. 26. Henr. 8 c. 1. anno Christi 1535. it beareth this Title. An act concerning the Kings highnes, to be supreame head of the Church of England &c. And in the statute it self it is said. Be it enacted by the Authoritie of this present Parlament, that the King our soueraigne Lord, his heirs, and successors, shall be taken, accepted, and reputed the onlie supreame head on earth of the Church of England, called Anglicana Ecclesia. And the same Title was 9. or 10. years after, giuen in like manner to K. Edward the sixt, by the same Authoritie of Parlament, if in this Case it had anie authoritie: anecting also therunto all Iurisdiction spirituall whatsoeuer; as it appeereth by a certaine declaration therof, made in the Statute of the first year of the said King.

                        •
                     7. It saith thus. That for so much as all authoritie of iurisdiction, spirituall, and temporall, is deriued and deducted, from the Kings Maiestie, as supreame head of these Churches, and Realmes of England, and Ireland, and so iustlie acknowledged by the Cleargie therof; and that all Courts Ecclesiasticall within these said two Realmes, be kept by no other power and authority, either forreine, or within the Realme, but by the Authoritie of his most excelent Maiesty: Be it therfore enacted, that all sommons and citations, and other processes Ecclesiasticall in all causes of Bastardy, Bygamye, and such like, called Ecclesiasticall shall be made in the name of our King. &c. And that in the Archbishops, and bishops seals of office (for testisying of this) the Kings Highnes armes, be decentlie sett with Characters vnder the said Armes, for the knowledge of the diocesse: & that they shall vse noe other seale of Iurisdiction, but wherin his Maiestyes armes be engraued, &c.
               23. Lo heere, not onlie the name, and Authoritie of head of the Church giuen to K. Edward the Child, and taken from the Pope; but all Iurisdiction also, and signe of Iurisdiction spirituall taken from the Archbishops, and Bishops of England, excepting onlie so far forth as it was imparted vnto them by the said Child K. Which importeth much, if you consider it well: For this is not onlie to haue power, to visitt, and gouerne Ecclesiasticall persons and to reforme abuses &. Set downe in the Queenes graunt by parlament; but to haue all Ecclesiasticall and spirituall power, and iurisdiction originallie included in his owne person and so to be



able from him self, as from the first fountaine and highest origen on earth, to deriue the partes & parcells thereof to others, which you may consider how different it is from that which here the Statute would seeme to ascribe to the Queene, and opposite and contrarye to all that which the ancient Fathers in the precedent chapter did affirme, & protest not to be in their Kings and Emperours at all, but in Bishops and Preists onlie, as deliuered immediatlie to them by Christ our Sauiour, and by them, and from them onlie to be administred to others for their saluation. But by this new order of the English Parlament, The absurdities of the Statute decrees about soueraigne spirituall authority. the contrarie course is established, to witt, that it must come to Bishops and Preists, from a laie man; yea a Child, and from a lay-woman also, as the other Parlament determineth, and then must it needs follow also (as after more larglie shall bee proued) that both the one, and the other (I meane K. Edward, and Queen Elizabeth) had power, not onlie to giue this Ecclesiasticall iurisdictiō vnto others; but much more, to vse, and exercise the same in like manner in their owne persons if they would, as namelie to giue holie orders, create, & consecrate Bishops, confirme Children, absolue sinnes, administer Sacraments, teach, and preach, iudge, and determine in points of faith and beleife, sitt in iudgement vpon errors and heresies, and the like. And this for K. Edward.
               
               24. Now then if it may be presumed, (as I thinke it may) that Queene Elizabeths meaning was, to haue no lesse Authoritie Spirituall, and Ecclesiasticall giuen vnto her, and acknowledged in her, then her said Father and Brother had vsed before; why did not the makers of this Statute set it downe in plaine words as the other did, but disguised the matter, by such māner of speach as they might seeme to giue but little, wheras they gaue all, and more then all? The Cause was that which I haue said before, for which they laboured not to be vnderstood of all men, but to speake, as it were in mysterye; not to offend so publikelie the Caluinists, and yet to include matter inough, to ouerthrow Catholikes. But the said exacter parte, and purer Caluinists,

                   quicklie found out the matter, and so they began verie shortly after to mutter and write against this, and diuers other points of the Statute, and so haue continued euer since; and the Controuersie betweene them, is indeterminable.
               25. Well then, for so much, as now we haue laid open the true state of the Question, and that M. Attorney is bound to proue



his proposition in this sense and explication, that heere is sett downe out of K. Henry, and K. Edwards Statutes, to witt that Q. Elizabeth had all plenarie power of Spirituall Iurisdiction in her self,

                     stion. to deriue vnto others at her pleasure, as from the head, and fountaine thereof. And that no Bishop, Archbishop, or other Ecclesiasticall person within the Realme, had, or could haue anie spirituall power, or iurisdiction, but from the wellspring, and supreame sourge thereof. And this not onlie by vertue of the foresaid Statute of the first yeare of her raigne, but before, & without this also by the verie force of her Princely Crowne, according to the meaning of the old, and most auncient cōmon laws of England. It will be time now to passe on to the veiw of his proofes, which for so new, strange, and weightie an assertion that toucheth (if wee beleiue the former alleadged Fathers) the very quicke, and one of the neerest means of our eternal saluation or damnation, ought to bee very cleere, sound and substantiall; We shall see in the sequent Chapter what they are.
            
         
         
            
            VVHERAS IN THE CASE PROPOSED, THERE MAY BE TVVO KINDES OF PROOFES, The one DE IVRE, the other DE FACTO; M. Attorney is shewed to haue fayled in both: and that we doe euidently demonstrate in the one, and in the other. And first in that DE IVRE. CHAP. IIII.
            
               THat the late Queene of England had such plenary Ecclesiasticall Power, as before had byn said, & this by the intent & meaninge of the old ancient Common-lawes of Englād; though vnto me & to many others, it seeme a most improbable Paradox, and doe meane afterwardes, by Gods assistance, to prooue and euidently demonstrate the same, and shew that from our first Christiā Kings vnto K. Henry the eight, the Common-lawes of our Land, were euer conforme and subordinate to the Canō Ecclesiasticall lawes of the Roman Church in all spirituall affayres: yet for so much as M. Attorney hath taken vpon him, to prooue the contrary, two heades of proofe he may follow therin. Proofes de Iure and de Facto.
                   The first De Iure, the second De facto. And albeit he entitle his Booke according to the first, to witt, De Iure Regis Ecclesiastico; yet doth he nothing lesse then prosecute that kind of proofe, but rather flippeth to the second which is De Facto, endeauoring to prooue, that certaine Kings made certaine lawes, or attempted certaine factes somtimes and vpon some occasions, that might seeeme somwhat to smel or taste of Ecclesiasticall



power, assumed to themselues in derogation or restraint, of that of the Bishops, Popes, or Sea of Rome.
               
               2. Now albeit this were so, and graunted (as after it will be reproued) yet well knoweth M. Attorney that an argument De facto inferreth not a proofe De Iure. For, if all the factes of our Kings among others, should be sufficient to iustifie all matters done by them; then would (for example) fornication be proued lawfull, for that some of them are knowne to haue had vnlawfull children, and left bastardes behinde them: And the like we might exemplify in other things. Neither doe I alleadge this instance without peculiar cause or similitude; For as in that vnlawfull act of the flesh, they yelded rather to passion and lust, then to their owne reason & iudgment, knowing well inough that they did amisse, when they were voyd of the same passion: so in some of these actions of contention, about Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, some of them were byassed with interest somtymes, by indignation, ielousy, & other like motiues to doe or attempt that, (especially in these later ages) which reason and Religion did not allwayes approue, nor themselues nether vpon more mature deliberation. And yet doe I not graunt that M. Attorney bringeth any thing of moment in this kind of proofe de facto also, as after shall appeare, though all his pretences of proofes be in this kind only.
               3. For, as for the first, though he entitle his booke De Iure as you haue heard, yet little or nothing doth he alleadge therin worthie to be repeated: Only he hath one Argument mencioned and refuted by vs before in the second Chapter of this Answere: 
                     
                        
                           ••
                        portes fol. 9. which is that the Kingdome of England being an absolute Empire and Monarchie, consisting of one head, which is the King, and of a body politicke deuided into two generall partes, the Clergie and the Layty: both of them next vnder God, must be subiect & obediēt to the same head in all causes, for that otherwise he should be no perfect Monarch or head of the whole bodye &c.
               4. But to this the answere is playne, by the groundes we haue laid downe in the same Chapter, of the different origen of spirituall and temporal power, and that it is sufficient to any temporall Monarch and to the perfection of his Monarchie, that all sortes of people throughout his dominions, as well Clergie as Layty, be subiect vnto him in all temporall affayres: and that with this perfection of Monarchie were content both Constantyne


                  
the first christian Emperour, & also Valentinian, Gratian, Theodosius, Arcadius, Honorius, Iustinian, and other Emperours that eusued after him, as also Charles the Great in France with his Successours & all our English Kings before K. Henry the eight, who esteemed themselues for greate perfect Monarches ouer their people (as in deed they were) without this chalenge of Spirituall Iurisdiction in Ecclesiasticall matters. And therfore the said greatest Emperours, were content also to beare patiently, and christianly the denyall therof in diuers occasions, Freedome of speach in the Fathers to Emperours. by their good Bishops & Prelates, S. Basil, S. Gregory Nazienzen, S. Ambrose, & S.

Trouble not your self, Emperour, in cōmāding me to deliuer the Church, nor doe you perswade your self that you haue any Imperiall right ouer those things that are spirituall or diuine; exalt not your self, but be subiect to God if you will raigne; be content with those things that belong to Cesar, and leaue those which are of God vnto God. Pallaces appertaine to the Emperour, and Churches vnto the Priest. You haue right ouer the walles of the Cyttie, but not vpon sacred howses. So he; And the same S. Ambrose some 3. or .4. yeares after, vsed the like speech of superiority in spirituall matters to the good Emperour Theodosius checking him greiuously, yea keeping him out of the Church, and holding him vnder excommunication, for eight monethes togeather. And when the said good Emperour came humbly on foote unto him, saying: Ora vt mihi soluas vincula, & ne mihi occludas ianuam. I beseech you loose my bandes and shutt not the Church doore against me; The other answered, what pennance can you shew me that you haue done since the committing of your greiuous sinne. &c.

                        Hebr. 7. for that (according to S. Paul) the lesser allwayes receaueth blessing from the greater, and more eminent. Other Fathers sayings to the same effect I purposely omitt for breuityes sake, but by these few M. Attorney may see, how he is deceiued in placing the perfection of a temporall Monarchie, in hauing spirituall Iurisdiction ouer Priestes in Ecclesiasticall affayres.

                   and keep they self pure from this kind of synne, and doe not intermeddle with Ecclesiasticall causes.
Do not vse commandements to vs in this kinde, but rather learne of vs God hath committed the Empire vnto thee, but vnto vs the things that appertaine to his Church; and as those, that malignantly doe carpe at thy Empire, doe contradict the ordinance of God; so beware thou, least by drawing vnto thee those things that appertayne vnto the Church, thou doe inuolue thy selfe in a hainous synne, Giue vnto Cesar those things which are of Cesar (saith the Scripture) and to God those things that are of God; 
                        Matt. 22. Luc. 20. & therfore as yt is not lawfull for vs to meddle with thy earthly Empire; so hast not thou power, ô Emperour, ouer sacred things; which I write vnto thee for the care I haue of thy saluation. &c.
                  
               
               8. And doe you see here this liberty of speech in Ecclesiasticall Prelates of the primitiue Church, towards their Kings aud Emperours? doe you see what difference and distinction they make betwene Ecclesiastical & temporal power? & yet we read not that any Attorney or Aduocate of these Emperours, did euer accuse these Bishops of treasō for speaking as they did, or once obiected that they meant hereby to take away any parte or parcell of their entire and absolute Monarchies. No though S. Athanasius for his parte went yet further; for when he saw that all these admonitions, and reprehensions would not preuaile, but that the said Constantius went forward to intermeddle more, and more in Ecclesiasticall affayres; he wrote thus in the same Epistle. 
                     S. Athanasius his seuere reprehension of the Emperour Constantius.

Now againe hath the Emperour Constantius made his pallace a Tribunall of Ecclesiasticall causes, in place of an Ecclesiasticall Courte, and hath made himself the chiefe Prince, and Author of spirituall pleas. &c.
These things are grieuous and more then grieuous, but yet are such as may well agree to him that hath taken vpon him the image of Anti-christ, for who is there, that seing him to beare himself as Prince, in the determyning of Bishops causes, and to sitt as Arbiter in Ecclesinsticall iudgemēt, will not worthily say, the Abhominatiō foretold by Daniel to be now come, &c.
                  
So he. And there were no end if I would prosecute all that might be said out of the sense and iudgement of the ancient Fathers against this first argument of M. Attorney, That tēporall Princes are not absolute Monarches, except you giue them spirituall iurisdiction also.

Attorney would insinuate (for vrge it he doth not) by the consideration of two Tribunalls or Courtes of the King of England: the one Temporall, the other Ecclesiasticall, and seuerall causes belonging vnto them. You shall heare it out of his owne speach, To the second argument of M. Attorney.

                     o all persons of his Realme as before hath bene declared: So heere the very naming of two generall partes of the kingdome, which M. Attorney graunteh, that the ancient law of England deuideth into Clergy, and Laytie and the mencioning of two seuerall Courtes, and distinct causes to be handled therin, by distinct Iudges, in such manner, as the one cannot haue conusaunce of the other, inferreth



plainly two distinct powers, descēding from two distinct origens, the one Temporali the other Ecclesiasticall; and so doe the places quoted by him, of Circumspectè agatis, westm. the second and Articul. Cleri vnder K. Edward the first and second most euidently declare.
               10. And first I would aske M. Attorney what the distinction of Clergie and Laity doth meane; Of Clergy and Lay men. not made or brought in first by our Common-lawes (as he would insynuate when he saith that the lawe deuideth our Politicall body into two generall partes, the Clergie & the Laity) but rather instituted by the

                   I would aske of M. Attorney what it importeth, & especially in this case of Queene Elizabethes supreme primacy? doth it not argue a distinct order of men, gouerned by distinct lawes, distinct Iudges, and distinct power & Iurisdiction? But you will say the Queene was head of them both, and we grannt it, as they are members of one Common-wealth, but in their seuerall distinction and seperation, as they are Clergie and lay people, she could not be of both, but of one only, to witt of the Laity: For that no man will say that she was also a Clerke, or of the Clergie. And yet in this partition, no man will deny, but that the Clergie is the worthier parte and member, and so is placed first in all our lawes: wherof is inferred that the said Clergie, as Clergie, is of a higher degree, according to our Common-lawes, then the temporall Prince, which is of the laitie only, and not Clerke, as in Q. Elizabeth is confessed; and consequently she could not be head of the Clergie, as Clergie, that is in Ecclesiasticall Clergie matters, belonging to Religion. Wherof we may take a notable example from the great Emperour Valentinian the elder, who refused to be present, (and much more President) in certaine conferences about religion betwene the Catholicke Bishops & the Arrians, vpon consideration of these two distinct Orders of Clergie and lay-men, though he were inuited therunto by Catholicke Bishops themselues.

am but one of the lay people, it is not lawfull to examine such things (as appertayne vnto religion) but let priests, to whome this care is committed, meet togeather amōg themselues to discusle the matter where they will. So much was this distinction between lay-men and priests esteemed by this auncient Christian Emperour.
                
                  The diffeence of Courtes vvhat it proueth, Reportes sol. 9. 11. Secondly I demaund of M Attorney concerning his distinction of Courtes and causes to be handled therin, Temporll & Spirituall, how it commeth to passe, that the Conusaunce of such causes as here he calleth Spirituall, belong not, as he saith, to the Common-lawes of England: No, nor (as presently after he affirmeth) could not belong: For that they are not within the conusaunce of the sayd Common-laws. And why is this, I praye you? For if the temporall Prince be equallie head in both causes, and in both Iurisdictions, and that the power to knowe, discerne & iudge in both sortes, doe descend only from the temporall Prince, as before out of the Statute of King Edward the 6. you haue heard, by the Statute-makers determined, and M. Attorney confirmeth euery where in these Reportes: then should the common-Lawes of our Realme which are the temporall Princes law be cōmon indeed according to their name to all causes, aswel Spirituall as Temporall, for that their author and origen, which is the King, hath equall Power, & Iurisdiction in both, for that it is a maxime vncontrollable, that, according to the Iurisdiction of the L
                        •
                     w maker, vertue and power of the law doth extend it selfe. And then doth M. Attorney affirme that the conusaunce of so many Ecclesiasticall causes as he setteth downe, is not within the compasse of our Common-lawes, or what compasse will he assigne or lymitt to that Princes lawes, that according to this assertion, hath power in all? Is not this to contradict himself, and to ouerthrow with the one hand, that which he goeth about to establish with the other? For, if the Kings power be common to both causes, aswell Ecclesiasticall as Temporall, then must the Kings Common-lawes be common to both Courtes and matters therin handled.
               12. But let vs see a certaine sleight or euasion of his worth the noting: As in temporall causes (saith he) the King by the mouth of the Iudges in his Courtes of Iustice, doth iudge and determyne the same by the temporall lawes of England; so in causes Ecclesiasticall, as Blasphemy, Apostacy. Heresyes, Ordering, Institutions of Clerkes, &c. the same are to be determined and decyded by Ecclesiasticall Iudges, according to the Kings Ecclesiasticall



lawes of this Realme. Marke here (gentle reader) how M. Atnorney playeth wyly beguyly; For according to the proportion of his cōparison, he should haue cōcluded thus:

                     outh of his Ecclesiasticall Iudges, doth iudge and determine the said Spirituall & Ecclesiastical causes, by his owne Ecclesiasticall lawes. But this he foresaw would include this great inconuenience among others, that if he said, that the King did iudge & determine by the mouthes of his spirituall Iudges the aforesaid spirituall causes, as he doth the temporall, then might he doe the same, yea and exercise them also immediatly by himself, if need were, aswell as by others; for in all temporall iudgments and affayres, the King may sit himself in courte, and performe in person whatsoeuer his Officers, by his authority doe or may doe: which yet M. Attorney saw would be somwhat absurde to graunt, in the spirituall causes proponed by him of Blasphemy, Ordering of Priests (or giuing holy Orders) Institutions of Clerkes, Celebration of diuine seruice, and the like, to witt, that the King should performe them immediately in his owne person; for who would not say it were absurde (for example) that the King should sing, or say the common seruice to the people; or administer the Sacrament of Absolution or Marriage, or giue holy Orders, and the like: which yet the Bishop of Rome and all other Bishops or Prelates, He that giueth povver to another to doe a thing must first haue it i

                      himselfe. neuer so great doe & may doe without inconuenience. And in truthe it followeth euidently that he, who can giue authority or power for another to doe a thing as from himself, and in his name, may performe the same in person also if he list, at least wise it cannot be vnlawfull for him so to doe. And therfore coming to the application of his comparison, he changeth his phrase, and saith, that the same are to be determined and decyded by Ecclesiasticall Iudges, according to the Kings Ecclesiasticall lawes of this Realme.
               
               13. Wherin you must note another shifte more poore and silly, then the former; for that hauing declared vnto vs before that there are two generall partes and members of the Realme, to witt the Clergy and the Laity, and that these two haue two seuerall Tribunalls in their affaires, gouerned by two sortes of different lawes, Temporall and Ec

Atorney, but specifieth not from whom, or whence, though all the world knowe, that they come originally



from the Church & Sea Apostolique: (all which inferreth distinct originall Iurisdictions) M. Attorney by his great witt hath deuised a newe sleight neuer perhaps yet heard of in the world before which is to make these Ecclesiasticall lawes though deriued from others, to be the Kings owne lawes, for that he approueth and alloweth them within the Realme; and consequently that all lawes both Temporall and Spirituall doe come from the King, A

                      to make Ecclesiasticall lavves to be the Kings lavves. as their Author: which is a token that he hath full Supreame power. And this singular deuise pleaseth him so well, as he repeateth the same sundrie tymes in this Treatise. You shall heare the same in his owne words in this place, & how dangerous and preiudicyall a Conclusion he buildeth vpon the same, against Catholiques.
               14. For as the Romans (saith he) fetching diuers lawes from Athens, yet being approued and allowed by the State there, called them notwithstanding, 
                        Reportes
                      
                     Ius Ciuile Romanum. And as the Normans borrowing all or most of their lawes from England, yet baptized them by the name of the lawes, or customes of Normandy; so albeit the Kings of England, deriued their Ecclesiasticall lawes from others, yet so many as were approued and allowed here, by, and with a generall consent, are aptly & rightly called the Kings Ecclesiasticall lawes of England, which whosoeuer shall deny, he denyeth that the King hath full and plenary power, &c. And consequently that he is no cōplete Monarch, nor head of the whole entire body of the Realme.
               
               15, You see whervnto this deuise tendeth to make yt a matter of treason, to deny this fancy of M. Attorney, that for so much as the Canons, and Ecclesiasticall lawes of the Church, made by Popes and by Generall Councells, from tyme to tyme, and receued vniuersally for spirituall and Ecclesiasticall matters throughout the Christian world, were receued also and allowed by the Kings Comnn wealth of England. (which was an euident argument of their acknowledging of the said Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction of the Church, and spirituall gouernours therof) of this approbation and allowance, he would inferr, that these lawes were the Kings lawes, though deriued, as he sayth, from others; that is to say from Popes and Bishopps. At which inference I doubt not, but that his fellow-lawyers will smile. And truly, I am sory that he being accoumpted so great a man in that faculty, which is wont to reason well, hath giuen so manifest occasion



of laugther. For that euery puney & young student of law, Admitting of other Prince
                        •
                      lavves shevveth rather subiection then superiority in the admitter. will see by common reason, that the admitting of an other mans lawe, doth not make it his lawe, or that he had power to make that lawe of himself, but rather to the contrary it sheweth, that the admitter acknowledgeth the other for his Superiour in all matters contained vnder that law; For the power of making lawes, is the highest power that principally proueth dominion in any Prince, and the admitting and obeying therof by another Prince, is an euident argument of inferiority and subiection; and so here the admitting of the Popes Ecclesiasticall and Canon-lawes, was an argument that the admitters acknowledged his supreme authority in Ecclesiasticall affayres.
               16. Neyther is M. Attorneys example of the Romans or Normans any thinge to the purpose all; The ansvver to M. Attorneys instance. For that the Romans did not take from the Athenians any formall lawes made by them, for the gouernment of the Romans (for that had been to acknowledg superiority as before hath bene said) but rather they taking a suruey of all the Grecian lawes, aswell of Athens as other Common-wealthes or States, they tooke parcells therof here and there, and applied the same to their Common-wealth, which was properly to make lawes of them selues. And the like may be sayd of the Normans, if they borrowed any of their lawes from England; which yet I neuer read in any Author besides M. Attorney, but rather that the Normans gaue lawes to England.
               
               17. But nowe in the Canon-lawes receiued in England for almost a thousand yeares together after our first Conuersion, the matter is farr different; for that these were receiued wholy and formally, as lawes made by another superior power in a different Tribunall & different causes, & sent expresly to England, Hovv the Canon-lavves vvere receaued in England. and to all other Christian Kingdomes, to be receiued and obserued, and some also out of the same Ecclesiasticall power made within the land, by Synodes and Prelates therof, and promulgated to be obserued both by Prince and people formally and punctually as they lay; and so were receiued, admitted, allowed, and put in execution by the said Prince and his Officers, except perhaps some tymes, some clause or parte therof might seeme to bring some inconuenience to the temporall State; for which exception was made against it, and the matter remedied by common consent. And this was another manner of admitting lawes, then the Romans admitted some peeces of there lawes from



                  Athens, or rather translated some pointes of the Athenian lawes into theyrs, which was to make them selues Maisters of thus lawes, and not receiuers or admitters. And finally wee see by this, to what poore and pittifull plight M. Attorney hath brought the title of his booke, De Iure Regis Ecclesiastico. Of the Kings Ecclesiasticall law, to witt that it is the Popes Ecclesiasticall law
                     •
                   in deed, made and promulgated by him and his, but receiued and obeyed by the King, and consequently not the Kings law, but the Popes.
               18. Wherfore to conclude the first part of this Chapter, for so much as M. Attorney by these two arguments De Iure, (which are the only he mentioneth) hath proued no right at all of supreme spirituall Iurisdiction,

Elizabeth by the title and interest of her temporall Crowne, but rather the contrary, to witt, that both his Arguments haue proued against himself: we see therby how vnable he is to proue his said affirmatiue proposition, by this first head and sorte of proofe De Iure. I shall now in the second part of this chapter endeuour to prooue the negatiue, by as many sortes of rightes and lawes as any thing may be proued, that is to say not only by Canonicall & Ciuill lawes, but by law of Nature also, of Nations, Mosaycall, Euangelicall, and by our ancient Common-lawes of England; all which doe concu

First by the disposition of the Canon-law, Canon-lavve. which contayning the sense of Gods vniuersall Church, from time to time, both in the right and practise of this affayre of spirituall gouerment, ought to be, and is with wise, learned, & Godly men, of principall accompt, credit, and authority. For that the said Canon-law is deduced from the decrees of Councells, Synodes, Popes, auncient Fathers, Doctors, and Bishops, and from the custome and practise of the said Church from time to time directed



by Gods holy spirit according to his promise, and receiued throughout all christendome from age to age, though now contemned by certayne new maisters, whose maistery standeth in this, to scoffe at that which they vnderstand not, or list not to follow, be it neuer so good.

And the princypall reason herof is, that all spirituall power being of two sorts, Ordinis & Iurisdictionis of holy order, & Iurisdiction, the femynine sex is capable of neither of them. Not of the power of Order, saith S. Thomas, which belongeth to the administring of Sacraments, for that a woman by her sex cannot administer them, nor is capable of Preist-hood, or sacred orders required therunto.

                  Faeminas remotas esse ab officijs publicis, & ideo iudices esse non posse. That women are to be remoued (by the Ciuill law) from all publique offices, & therfore cannot be Iudges. And if in Ciuill matters, by that law they could not be Iudges, how much lesse can they be supreame Iudges in spirituall causes, which are of a far higher dignitie, and indecency for women to meddle therin. All which better appeare by that which is to eusue, out of the law both of Nature, and Grace, which are the groundes of these Ciuill, and Canonicall Constitutions. For as the Ciuill law followed the one, so the Canon followeth the other, or rather both, for that both proceed from God, and are his lawes.
               25. To consider then of the law of Nature, 
                  The lavv of nature. which is common to all Nations; we read in the booke Genesis, that the order obserued by God in the creation of man and woman was this; that first Adam and all other Creatures were made, 2. Gen. 
                     
                        •
                     9. and placed in paradise, and afterward Eua was created for man, and out of man, and to the liknes of man, as man was created before to the likenes of God. Out of which order of Creation, S. Paul doth in diuers places gather the naturall subiection of woman vnto man, (especially in spirituall matters appertayning to God) to be eternally established by this law of their creation.
               26. For when to Tymothie he had said, 1. Tim. 2
                        •
                     . 
                  Docere autem mulieres non permitto, neque deminari in virum, I doe not permitt women to teach, nor to haue dominion ouer her husband, he addeth presently for his reason, these words. For Adam was first created and then Eua; And Adam was not seduced, but the woman was seduced. And the same Apostle writing to the Corinthians about a certayne precept and ordination of his, 1. Cor. 1
                        •
                     . that woman should be couered in the Church, & men not, and men to haue their hayre cutt, & women not, in signe of subiection, and subordination the one to the other, he saith, A vvomā cannot be the head of man in spirituall matters. 
                  I doe prayse you, brethren, for that you are mindfull of me in all things, and doe obserue my precepts, as I deliuered them vnto you. I will haue you knowe that Christ is the head of euery man, and man the head of the woman, and God the head of Christ. And as euery man that prayeth, or prophesieth with his head couered, dishonoreth his head (which is Christ) so euery



woman praying or prophesying with her head not couered, dishonoureth her head (which is man) And the man ought not to couer his head, for that he is the Image, and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man; for man was not made of the woman, but the woman out of man, not was the man created for woman, but the woman for man, &c. Ipsa natura docet vos. Nature it self doth teach you, &c.
               27. Now then out of these deductions from the law of Nature; so much vrged, as you see by S. Paul for subiection, and subordination of women, euen in little small points, concerning Religion, Absurdities ensuing the supremacy Ecclesiasticall of a vvoman. as about speaking, teaching, and veiling their heads in the Church; it may be inferred how earnest the same Apostle would haue bene, if the question had been propoūded about the highest poynt, honour, & office of Religion, which is to exercise the place of Christ, by mediation betweene God and man, and to be as it were high-priest, and President ouer men, in matters belonging to their soules; 
                     Heb. 3. Gal. 3. Act. 3. for in this case all this law of Nature, would be broken and the women should be head ouer men, in the highest degree, and so should not be the glory of the man as S. Paul saith, that is, subordinate to his glory; as he is to the glory of Christ, and Christ to the glory of God; but the man should be her glory, that is to say, subordinate to her In iis quae sunt ad Deum. In those things that appertaine to God: yea she should be mediatrix betweene him and God, in place of him, that is chiefe priest. And so all this first naturall institution of God should be wholy peruerted, broken, and turned vpside-downe.
               28. Neyther is it of any force, to obiect (as some doe) that a woman may be head of men in temporall affaires, as Queenes are, for that God hath left this free to m

                   women to gouerne them, for auoyding worse inconueniences, when there are no heyres-male to succeed, as before hath been said. But the matter is farr different in spirituall gouernment, which dependeth immediatly of God himself; and was deliuered by him to men, & not to women; and so hath been continued, throughout all ages from Adam to our dayes; and vnder all lawes, both of Nature, Moyses, and Christ. For in the law of Nature, 
                  The singularitie of Q. Elizabeths case. the first borne-male among the Patriarches was alwayes head of the family, both in temporall and spirituall matters, and consequently also Priest. And in the law of Moyses the said priesthood, and presidency in spirituall matters,



was annexed vnto a tribe of men, and no woman admitted therunto. And much more in the law of the ghospell as presently we shall declare; and so we may conclude that from Eue, to Elizabeth there was neuer woman that was supreame head, concerning matters of Religion, before her self; so singular was she and her case in this point.
               29. Now then for the Euangelicall law, Of the lavv Euangelicall. meaning, and sense of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, in founding of his Christian Church, that it was not to leaue any part or parcell of the spirituall gouerment and Iurisdiction therof vnto any woman (and much lesse the supreme in any Kingdome or Countrey) besides that which before hath been cyted, and pondered out of S. Paul that, women may not teach or speake in the Church (which yet is a necessary part to be able to doe if need require) and that which the Canon-law putteth in cōsideration, that Christ left no part of Ecclesiasticall gouerment, either to his mother, or to any other of his women-disciples; besides all this (I say) it is not hard to shew, out of the very Institution of Gods Church from the beginning, and the establishment and perfection therof, when Christ came in flesh, he excluded cleerly women from all dominion therin.

               31. This being supposed, we are to note further, that as Christ created Adam as the first head of his Church heere on earth vnder



himself, and made him Lord of all both temporall and spirituall and as Priest to offer Sacrifice; and Eue out of him afterward
                     •
                   subiecting her therby vnto him, 1. Cor. 11. 1. Tim. 2. and to his perpetuall Dominion, (as before you haue heard S. Paul to collect out of this first institution); so the diuell taking vpon him presently to contradict and ouerthrow this worke of Christ; followed a quite contrary order and went first to Eue, persuading her to goe & preach to Adam the sermon that he had taught her, as she did, & because his Doctor and Mistresse in this Ecclesiasticall function, & therby turned vpside-downe, to both their tuynes, and to the ruyne of vs all, the whole order of subordination which Christ had appoynted before: Wherby she should haue bene taught by Adam, and not he by her. 
                     Gen. 2. But Christ comming afterward to visit them againe, and to take accoumpt of this disorder, albeit he knew then that the woman had bene the author therof, yet would he not speake first to her, but according to the order appointed by himself, asked first for Adam. Our Lord called for Adam, saith the text, 
                     Gen. 3. 
                  & dixit ei, vbi es? and said vnto him, where art thou? And when afterwards the whole cause being examined he gaue sentence vpon ech part for this disorder; he specially confirmed againe his first Institution, for the Dominion of man

                   and the subiection of woman, saying vnto her,

                     man must be subiect to man in all respects. aswell domesticall and politicall, as Ecclesiasticall or diuine: so as in all these three kinds of affayres, man is made head, and gouernour both at home, in the common-wealth, and in the Church by this first institution of Christ, though in the former two, it is permitted vnto man, as hath been said, vpon some occasions, to yeld vp his right, when he will, though more in the second then in the first, for that the things are more arbitrary and tollerable, to witt that a woman should be head ouer all in the Common-wealth then at home ouer her husband. But in the third which is in the Church, and Church-matters, no dispensation is permitted, but that womans subiection must be perpetual. And therfore when S. Paul, as before hath been touched, cōmeth to talke of Church-matters, he suppresseth women presently by this law of Christ Mulieres (saith he) in Ecclesia tace ant, non enim permittitur eis loqui sod subditas esse sicut lex dicit.

               32. This law named here by S. Paul, is the lawe instituted by Christ in the former wordes of Genesis, where he appointeth women to be subiect not only at home vnto their husbandes, but especially & principally vnto the gouerment of man in Ecclesiasticall matters, as you see by the application therof so often by S. Paul to Church affayres. For before in the eleuenth chapter to the Corinthians, 
                  1. Cor. 11. he repeateth a precept of his owne made vnto them about veyling of womē in the Church, as you haue heard, founding the same vpon the first Institution of man and woman in paradise, prouing thence that the woman could not be head in the Church, Hovv eagerly S. Paul did stand against vv

These precepts which I write vnto you, are not myne but of our Lord. Adding presently this terrible threat, Qui autem ignorat, ignor

                  1. Tim. 2. Let the woman (in the Church) learne in silence with all subiection. Marke the asseueration of all subiection. What would S. Paul haue said, if any woman in his tyme had challenged to her self all dominion in the Church, and yelded subiection to no Ecclesiasticall person whatsoeuer?
               33. But to goe forward in the Institution of Christ, for the spirituall gouerment of his Church: when he had gouerned the same by men and not by women, for the space of foure thousand yeares and more, vnder the law both naturall and written, and comming now to institute a new, more exact and perfect gouerment therof, vnder the law Euangelicall; what did he? was he vnmindfull of this his first Institution in paradise? No: For he chose men, to witt his Apostles, and their Successours to gouerne his Church, saying vnto them,

                   though there were many holy women among them, and one more high in Gods fauour then they all, as before hath been said. Neither euer is it recorded, that afterward any Apostle, Father, Doctor, Councell, Synode, Schole, Vniuersity, Pope, Prince, Nation, Countrey, Common-wealth, or priuate man in Christendome, did appoint, admit or allow any woman to be cheefe in spirituall matters, before the English Parlament in the beginning of Q.

                  About the spirituall supremacy of a woman in the Church of God (for that they neuer imagined any such thing would, or could fall out) yet in other occasions, wherin great women sometymes, not as heads but helpers to vnlawfull purposes, would be medling in Ecclesiasticall affayres, as the Empresse Eudoxia against S. Chrysostome & the Empresse Iustina against S. Ambrose and other the like: the said Fathers spake so sharply, and reiected them with such indignation, as a man may easely se what they would haue done, if any least insinuation had bene made, to challeng vnto them Ecclesiasticall power and Iurisdiction, and much more to be heads of the Church, which in those dayes was neuer so much as dreamed of. And if the said Fathers vpon occasion offered, did so earnestly deny vnto the husband of the one, & the sonne of the other, that were Emperours, the said supremacy in spirituall things, or that they had any power at all, in Ecclesiasticall causes, as you haue heard: what would they haue said to the women, if they had pretended any such matter? Let one short sentence of S. Chrisostome serue for all in generall, to declare his opinion of womens gouerment euen in temporall thinges, and much more in spirituall.

                   and for that his discourse in the said place, is of great weight, and consideration being sett downe between him, & his deer freind S. Basil in Dialogu-wise with much maturitie, and doth not only deny all spirituall gouernment to women, but placeth it where it ought to bee, in S. Peter, & his Successors aboue all others; I shall alleadge the place somewhat more at large, which containeth a graue ponderation of those words of our Sauiour vnto S. Peter in S. Iohns ghospell. 
                     Ioan. 21. 
                  Petre amas me, &c. Peter dost thou loue mee more then the rest, and he answearing that he did: Christ replied; if thou loue mee, feed my sheep. Wherof S. Chrysostome doth inferre, that Christ in these words did first of al specially commit the supreme charge of his said sheep to S. Peter, and his Successors. Pecud

curam (saith he) quas sanguine suo acquisierat, tum Petro, tum Petri Successoribus committebat. He committed to Peter, and to Peters Successours the care of his sheep which he had purchased with his owne bloud. And againe. Petrum Christus authoritate hac praeditum esse voluit, & reliquos item Apostolos longe praecellere. Christ would haue Peter to bee indued with this supreme authority ouer his sheep, and therein far to excell all the rest of the Apostles, &c.
               
               37. Secondlie S. Chrysostome maketh a deep ponderation vpon these words of our Sauiour, of the singular loue, which he would haue Pastors to beare vnto his sheep, and which hee bare himself, giuing his bloud for them, and what hee exacted at this high Pastors hands for gouerning and feeding of them, in this his demaund or interrogation, concerning his loue.

But now, Christ pretermitting all these other good works, what saith hee vnto him? Pasce oues meas, &c. Feed (and gouerne) my sheep: for that all the rest of those good works before mētioned, may bee perfourmed by many subiects, not only men but also women, At cum de ecclesiae Praefectura, de credenda huic vel illi, tam multarum animarum cura agitur; vniuersa quidem mulieris natura, functionis istius moli ac magnitudini caedat oportet, itemque & bona virorum pars.

Peter, and his Successours, to endure to the worlds end.
               38. And thus haue wee cleerlie the sentence, beleife, & iudgement, of S. Chrysostome concerning spirituall authority, for gouerning our soules, that it was giuen eminently to S. Peter and his



Successors, aboue the rest of the Apostles, but so, as only men, and those not all, but Priests alone, and Cleargie-men, doe, or may succeed therein, and that all kinde of women are excluded, in respect of their sex from any superiority, or prefecture ouer the Church. Hovv much S. Chrysost. authoritie ought to be esteemed in this point. And what-soeuer S. Chrysostome held, preached, or left written in this behalfe, be being so great a Doctor, and piller of Christs Church in his dayes, & the thing it self neuer contradicted, or reprehended by any other, may assuredly be held for the common doctrine, iudgement, sense, faith, and beleife, of the vniuersall Catholike Church in that age; and consequently also, both of the former and following ages, vntill our time. And how much this consideration ought to preuaile with a prudent man, that followeth not passion, but reason, and hath care of his owne soule, is easy to see. And so much of this matter.
               39. And now further I remember that I promised to proue my negatiue also by the ancient common & municipall lawes of England; of which, though I might say, as before I said of the Fathers and Doctors of former tymes, that they ordayned nothing expresly of this particular case; for that they neuer imagined that any such matter would fall out: The municipall lavvey of England. yet doe they determine that expresly which includeth this; which is that they confirme euery-where the libertyes, preheminencyes, and prerogatiues of of the Church, and Church-men of England: which doe principally consist in this, that only Ecclesiasticall men haue Power and Iurisdiction in Ecclesiasticall affayres; and that no lay person (and much lesse a woman) can meddle therin; and that there be two distinct swords in a Christian Common-wealth the one temporall in the hands of the Prince, the other Ecclesiasticall in the hands of the Bishop; and that the Ecclesiasticall is greater and more soueraigne then the temporall, & that this later must help & be subordinate to the former. All which yow shall see decreed as well in the lawes of K. Edgar, and K. Edward before the Conquest, as also of the Conquerour himself which

               40. And to all this now may we ad certaine manifest reasons, which besides the foundations before laid, or rather out of them all, Manifest reasons. our Deuines doe alleadge whie a woman may not be head of the Church, or haue spirituall Iurisdiction in Ecclesiasticall affayres. 
                      A vvoman can not be Priest Wherof the first is that Christ our Sauiour being a Priest according to the order of Melchisedech, and refusing to be a temporall



King, as out of the ghospell is euident, he left in his place Priests to gouerne his Church, as before hath bene declared, both out of Scriptures and ancient Fathers: but a woman cannot be a Priest, as both we and Caluinists doe hold; though Luther taught otherwise for a tyme (as hath bene said and is refuted at lardge, by K. Henry the 8. Q. Elizabeths Father in his booke against him) and therefore the said Q. Elizabeth could not hold the place of Christ, in spirituall Iurisdiction, in the Church of England.
               
               
                   41. A second reason is founded vpon the maxime before alleadged by M. Attorney, Cui licet quod maius est, licet quod minus. He that can doe the greater, can doe the lesse: But it is more to be able to giue authority to others, to exercise spirituall functions and Iurisdiction, than to doe the same in his owne person, ergo if Q. Elizabeth could giue authority to Bishops, and Pastors to make Ministers, administer the Sacraments, preach, and teach with the like (which belongeth to the head of the Church) than could she doe them also her self. Which conclusion notwithstanding all English Protestants commonly doe deny; yet is the Consequence euident, and the Minor proposition is proued. For that, he that giueth a power to an other, A

                   is presupposed to haue it first in himself, for that no man can giue that which himself hath not; so as if Q. Elizabeth did giue any spirituall Iurisdiction to her Bishops to teach, preach, make Ministers, absolute, & loose sinnes, and the like (who otherwise could haue no such authoritie at all) she might, no doubt, haue exercised the same in her owne person, as in all temporall Iurisdiction we see, that whatsoeuer power the King giueth to any Gouernour, Iudge or Magistrate to exercise in his name, he may exercise the same also him self if he wil. And the same holdeth in the Pope, for any spirituall Iurisdiction or function that he committeth to any Bishop, Priest or Clerk whatsoeuer.
               
                   42. A third reason is taken, ab inconueniente, to wit from this inconuenience, that if a Queene could be spirituall head of the Church, and should marry without making hir husband King, A

                   she should be his spirituall head also, to loose and bind his sinnes, and to exercise Ecclesiasticall Censures of Iurisdiction, Suspension, or Excommunication against him at her pleasure, and he for his part should be bound in conscience vnder payne of sinne to heare and follow her doctrine, if at any time she list to preach vnto him, or to prescribe what he must beleeue or not beleeue



in matters of faith; which besides that it should be contrary to that we haue alleadged before out of S. Paul, and Christ his Institution, for the subiection of women in these causes, it would be very absurd and ridiculous also, as you see, and vnworthie of the excellent gouerment of Christ his Church, instituted and framed by the highest wisdome of almighty God.
               
                   43. Wherfore lastly to shutt vp this matter, after all these proofes alleadged, we shall adioyne one only more, which howsoeuer it be esteemed of vs, Consent of Protestant vvriters. yet ought it to be of singular great moment with M. Attorney, and this is the vniuersall agreement of all Protestants, both of Caluin & Luthers sect, commonly throughout the world, except only in England. And as for Caluinists the matter is cleere, if we respect France, Germany, Holland, Zeland, Scotland, and other places, who all agree in this point; following therin their first Author Iohn Caluin, who not only in the place by me alleadged vpō

                   doth earnestly impugne not only this Ecclesiasticall power of a woman, but of any temporall Magistrate whatsoeuer; affirming further in a certayne epistle of his, to his freind Myconius, that those who defend the same, are prophane spirits and mad-men, and that the Lord with the breath of his mouth shall destroy them, and that both he, and his, would encounter and fight against them with a valiant and inuincible Zeale &c. Of the same opinion and spirit, was Theodore Beza the cheife scholer and successour of Caluin, in his chayre of Geneua as appeareth by his writings,

And I doe passe ouer the writings of many other principall men of that profession, both in England and abroad, who in this point are no lesse opposite, and earnest against M. Attorney, that we, and are knowne in England by the name of Puritanes or precise Caluinists, who being the farre greater parte, if we respect all Countreyes about vs, must needs in this point be confessed to haue more reason (the thing being affirmed so earnestly as



you haue heard by Caluin himself,) than the other of that sect, who for pleasing of tēporall princes, are accused by them to hold the contrary. For that if Iohn Caluin be to be followed in all the rest, as they confesse; why not also in this? And if the holy-ghost fayled him in this so important a point, as comprehendeth the whole gouerment of their Church, and the lawfull or vnlawfull vocation, and function of their whole Ministerie, what certaintie can they haue in any other thinge, or point of his doctrine.
               44. But now not only those of the Caluinian sect, but others also of the Lutheranes, doe laugh at our English Protestants, for holding this position of M.

It was not expedient that the office of punishing Caluinists should cease in the meane space, vntill the said generall Synode were held, as they demaunded.

Elizabeth her self, and her title of supremacy, saying first that no good thing in Religion was further to be expected from her; that she had vsed hardly the Protestants of Germany; that she saw and felt no

a third sect risen vp in her Realme of Puritanes, that hated both her and the other Caluinians that followed her, who were enimies in like manner to Lutherans; So he. And then passing yet further he scoffeth merily, that she being a woman had taken vpon her to make Ecclesiasticall lawes. Et quòd faemineo, & à saeculis inaudito fastu se Papissam & caput Ecclesia fecit. That with a womanly pride, neuer heard of in former ages, she had made herself a She-pope, & head of the Church. Thus Kemnitius. And marke that he saith à saeculu inaudito that from the beginning of the world there was neuer any such thing heard of, either among Christians, Iewes, or Gentiles.

Attorney wilbe able to bring to the contrary to proue his affirmatiue propositions De Iure, with any shew of probability. Wherfore I shall conclude this whole Chapter, noting only to the Reader two considerations, for his better memory out of all the premisses. The one worthie of laughter, the other of teares.
               49. The former is the euill lucke that M. Attorney had in making choyse of Q. Elizabeth for an example of Ecclesiasticall supremacy in a temporall Prince; For wheras three Princes only of our Nation, from the beginning of the world, had taken vpon them this title, A point vvorthy of laughter. to witt K. Henry the 8. K. Edward the 6. and Q. Elizabeth; M. Attorney chose the worst and weakest of all the three, to be defended. For, as for K. Henry,

                   though by the Canon-law he were incapable of Priesthood or holy orders (wherof dependeth spirituall Iurisdiction) for that he was marryed when he tooke the same vpon him, and not only marryed but many times marryed, which is another Canonicall impediment (for he was not only Bigamus, and Trigamus, but twice also Trigamus, hauing bene marryed the sixth tyme) yet was all this in rigour of Ecclesiasticall power dispensable by the Church, being but only.



                  Iuris humani impedimenta, & non diuini: Impediments of humane, & not diuine lawe; and so K. Henry either by dispensation, or by occasion, that this last wife had dyed, might haue been made Priest and capable of spirituall Iurisdiction.

Edward being a child, of 9. yeares old, and consequently vnder the vse of reason, when this supreame spirituall Iurisdiction was giuen vnto him, he was so vncapable therof, as by no dispensation it might be made lawfull, vntill he came to the years of perfect reason, and so doe proue both Canonists, & Ciuilians; for that Iurisdiction cannot be giuen nor admitted, but where perfect vse of reason is; for that otherwise, it should be no humane act. But yet this impediment though not dispensable for the present, would haue come afterwards to be remoued without dispensation, by tract of tyme it self, which would haue brought the perfect vse of reason.

Attorney his choyse was very erroneous;

            OF THE SECOND SORT OF PROOFES NAMED DE FACTO, VVherto M. Attorney betaketh himselfe, alleadging certaine Instances therin: And first, out of our Kings before the Conquest. CHAP. V.
            THE whole bulke of M. Attorneyes booke (such as it is) consisteth (as before hath byn noted) in the recitall of certayne lawes, or peeces of lawes, and therfore called by him Reports or Relations of clauses, found in his Commonlawes, or Statutes that may seeme somwhat to sound against the absolute Iurisdictiō Ecclesiasticall of the Bishops and Sea of Rome, or to the restraint therof vnder certayne Kings, and in certaine occasions; and to ascribe vnto the said Kings some Ecclesiasticall power, in those cases, as afterwards shalbe seene. Wherin first is to be considered, that which before hath been obserued, that he abandoning, as it were, the first head of proofes De Iure, flyeth only to the other De facto which alwayes holdeth not: for that all factes, doe not infer necessarily the right of equity and Iustice, as before hath been shewed. And secondly, if all the examples De facto were graunted, in the sense, as by him they are set downe; yet are they farr of from prouing his principall, as often afterwards vpon many particular occasions shalbe declared. For that his said principall Conclusion is (as yow may knowe) that Queene Elizabeth by the ancient Common lawes of England, 
               
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                
               had as full, and absolute power, and Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, as by any spirituall or Ecclesiasticall person, had euer byn at



might lawfully be exercised within the Realme. And these Instances by him alleadged doe concerne but certaine peeces, 
                  Reportes fol. 1. and parcells of Iurisdiction in some particular cases and causes, as by examination wilbe found. Wherfore to drawe neere to this examination we must vnderstand, that M. Attorney rightly deuideth the tymes of our Kings into before, and after the Conquest; and I shall willinglie follow him in this diuision, and search out what Ecclesiastical lawes or Ordinances there were made in those dayes, by our Kings of those ages, for his or our purpose.
            2. And first before the Conquest when our best English Kings were most eminent, if we respect pietie and religion, as liuing neerer to the origen & fountaine of their first conuersion & fernour of Christian spirit: Of English Kings before the Conquest.
                out of this tyme (I say) and ranke of our Christian Kings frō 
               Ethelbert the first, to K. Edward the last before the Conquest (for of K. Harold we make little accompt, he being an intruder and raigning so small time, and with so many troubles as he did) they being otherwise aboue a hundred in number, within the space of almost fiue hundred yeares, two only inferences he produceth, and these of very small moment, as presently will appeare, yet let vs heare how he beginneth and what Preface he maketh to his proofes in these words. 
                  Reportes fol. 9. 
               To confirme (saith he) those that hold the truth, and to satisfye such as being not instructed, know not the ancient and moderne lawes and customes of England, euery man being perswaded as he is taught: these few demonstratiue proofes out of the lawes of England in steed of many in order & serie temporum are here added. This is his Preface wherin he promiseth as yow see demonstratiue Proofes which are the strongest, most cleer, euident, and forcible, that logicke doth prescribe in any science: but we shalbe enforced afterward to admitt proofes of a lower degree, then demonstrations, as by experience you will find: Wherefore to the matter.
            3. His first instance is taken out of the words of a certaine Charter, giuen by King Kenulfus of the VVestsaxons, 
               The Charter of K. Kenulphus anno 755. some two hundred and fifty yeares after the conuersion of K. Ethelbert of Kent, & confirmed afterward by K. Edwin Monarch of all England, 
               
                  Stamford. lib. 3. c. 39. fol. 1012. which Charter beginneth thus. Kenulfus Rex, &c. per literas suas patentes, consilio, & consensu Episcoporum, & Senatorum gentis suae, largitus fuit monasterio de Abindon in Comitatu Bark. & euidam Ruchino tunc Abbati monasterij, &c.

               Thus goeth the Charter, which though M. Attorney thought not good to put in English, but to set downe both his pages in Latin; yet wee shall translate the same, for the better vnderstanding of all sortes of Readers. K. Kenulfus, &c. by his letters parents with the Counsell, and consent of the Bishops and Councellours of his nation, did giue to the monasterie of Abindon in Barkshire, and to one Ruchinus Abbot of that monastery, a certaine portion of his land, to witt fifteen mansians, in a place called by the countreymen Culnam, with all profittes, and commodities, both great and small, appertaining therevnto. And that the foresaid Ruchinus, &c. should bee quiet from all right of the Bishop for euer, so as the inhabitants of that place, shall not be depressed for the time to come by the yoke of any Bishop, or his officers, but that in all euents of thinges, and controuersies of causes, they shall be subiect to the decree of the Abbot of the said monasterie; so as, &c.
               
            
            4. Thus goeth the Charter, which if it were all graunted by vs, as it lyeth; yet is it far of (as you see) from inferring M. Attorneys conclusion, that K. Kenulfus was head of the Church, or had supreame power Ecclesiasticall. It might make it probable, that hee had some Iurisdiction in some particular case, but what or how much that was or whence hee had it, either of himself, or by delegation of another, to wit of the Popes or Cleargie that is not euident by the Charter. 
               
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                But let vs see, what M. Attorney can make of these words, for that lawyers commonly can make the most of matters to their aduauntage. First he will needs inforce out of his Charter, that this K. Kenulfus, tooke vpon him Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction; for thus hee writeth. By this it appeareth, that the King by this Charter, made in Parlament (for it appeareth to be made by the Councell, and consent of his Bishops, and Senatours of his kingdome, which were assembled in Parlament) did discharge and exempt the said Abbot from the Iurisdiction of the Bishop, &c. And by the same Charter did graunt to the same Abbot Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction vvithin his said Abbey: VVhich Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction being deriued from the Crowne, continued vntill the dissolution of the said Abbey in the raigne of K. Henry the 8. So hee.
            5. In which words three things are affirmed by him, wherof



I hould neuer a one to be certaine, and the last euidently false. For neither doth it appeare, by the words of the Charter, that the King did exempt the said Abbot from all Iurisdiction spirituall of the Bishop, but rather of some temporall interest or pretense that the Bishop of that Diocesse might haue, or pretend to haue in those daies. Nor doth he seeme to haue giuen Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction to the Abbot, but rather temporall concerning controuersies that might arise about the lands of the lordship of Culnam, wherof he had made donation to the said monastery. And thirdly howsoeuer this might bee, the third point and cheife conclusion is false, that he either gaue, or tooke away Iurisdiction by his owne power deriued from his temporall crowne (for this was impossible, as before in the second Chapter of this answere hath been shewed) but rather by some spirituall Iurisdiction, cōmitted vnto him by some other higher Ecclesiasticall power, either of his Bishops gathered togeather in Parlament, or Synod; or of the Bishop of Rome himself: all which three points, wee shall breiflie here shew, and therby conclude that M. Attorney his inference, sett out with a Nota in the margent, is worth no note at all, but onlie of weaknes and impertinencie.
            6. For first, to begin with the second, The first pointe of M. Attorneys collection refuted. it doth not appeare by the words of this Charter, that the King did graunte to the same Abbot Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, within his said Abbey; but only that in all euents, and discussions of causes or controuersies arising about the foresaid Lordship of Culnam, giuen vnto the said monasterie, the Tenants therof should stande to the Decree of the said Abbot, and not haue recourse to the Bishop of the Diocesse, who before, perhaps, pretended temporall Iurisdiction ouer them, or at least-wise ouer that Lordship of Culnam. And this coniecture is greatlie confirmed by a Canon of a Nationall Synod held in Hereford almost a hundered yeares before this, vnder Theodorus Archbishop of Canterbury, the 24. of September. Anno Christi. 670. and related by S. Bede: 
               
                  Bed. lib. 4. hist. Angl. cap. 5. where the third Canon of the Councell decreeth thus. Vt Quacunque monasteria &c.
               That all monasteries consecrated to God, noe Bishop hath authoritie to inquiet them, nor violentlie to take from them any thing of their goods; &c. wherby appeareth that some Bishops in those daies did pretend also temporall Iurisdiction ouer monasteries and their goodes, which heer K. Kenulfus would preuent in this his monasterie, to which he gaue his Lordshipp.

                  d7. And by this also the other point is confirmed, that it doth not appeare by the force of these words, that the Abbot was exempted from all spirituall Iurisdiction of the Bishop by this Charter of the King (though otherwise by some priuiledge of the Pope I doubt not but he was, it being a thing common lightly to all Abbots) for he saith only: Abomni Episcopali Iure: from all right of the Bishop, and not Iurisdiction, which might be meant, as hath been said, of some temporall right pretended ouer that Lordship, and was found now not to be iust; or for that the said Bishop in Parlamēt, or otherwise (for M. Attorney holdeth, that all this was done in Parlament) had renounced his temporall right therin, which before hee pretended to haue; or that the King made this declaration of the monasteries exemption (for he seemeth rather to haue declared what was done, or graunted, then to ordaine it himself) by force of the foresaid Synodicall Decree of the Ecclesiasticall Councell before mentioned.

               8. And truly, that the words of this Charter doe seeme rather to meane temporall, then spirituall Iurisdiction in this place (though I doubt not (as I said) but that they were exempted in the one, and in the other by the priuiledges of the Sea Apostolike accustomed in such cases) that which ensueth in the said Charter doth much confirme, to witt, that the Abbot should be quiet from the Bishops right, and that the inhabitants from thence-forward should not be depressed by the Yoke of the Bishops officers. Which importeth as much, as that they had byn vniustly disquietted & depressed before; the same noe way seeming fittly to agree to be spoken of Bishops Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, and consequently it is not improbable, that only temporall Iurisdiction is heere talked of: and so neither spirituall Iurisdiction taken from the Bishop, nor giuen to the Abbot by the King in his Charter.

               9. But howsoeuer this were, or may bee; most certaine it is, that M. Attorney his inference and conclusion, is manifestly false; to witt, that it vvas deriued from his Crowne. For albeit, it were euident, that the meaning heere were of spirituall Iurisdiction: yet might the King haue that power, to giue the exemption which he did to the monastery, either from the Bishops gathered togeather now in the Parlament, or before in Synod, as hath been said, renouncing all their Iurisdictiō therin: or he might haue it from the Pope, which is most likely, for that all such priuiledges, and exemptions were demaunded in those dayes at his hands, by



Princes, and founders of pious workes. And the said Popes made ordinary graunts therof, (as in our dayes also they doe) and this is different sorte and manners: For that sometimes they graunted the same immediatly, as from themselues, sometimes they gaue comission to Princes to giue it in their names; and some other times they confirmed that which Princes had done before in this kinde vnder ratihabition, or future allowance, or ratification by the Sea Apostolike.
            10. And of all these three sorts, many examples might be alleadged, Of diuers sortes of exemptiō

Alban the Protomartyr of England, at the hands of Adrian the Pope, as also that he might build a Monastery in the place where he was martyred,

To be free, and exempted from all subiection of Bishops; the Pope graunted both his demaunds, answering him thus, as the same author recordeth. VVe doe most willingly giue our cōsent to your petition for building of a monastery, and doe priuiledge the same; and vvhen you haue made your Charter or priuiledge, vvee shall afterwards confirme & strengthen your Originall vvith ours, and exempt that monastery from all iurisdiction both of Bishops, and Archbishops, subiecting it immediatly vnto our Apostolike Sea. So hee. Wherby we see, that a temporall King, and founder of a monastery or other pious worke, might giue priuiledges, either by commission, or vnder ratihabition as before hath been said.
            11. The like examples we finde in the liues of King Edgar and S. Edward the Confessor, and many others that demaunded & obteined confirmation and exemptions for pious works erected by them, of the Popes of their times. But for that these examples will be more fittly produced in the sequent Chapter, and fourth demonstration therof, I will remitt the Reader therunto. Only I cannot let passe to recite vnto you in this place a certaine Charter of K. Ethelbert of Kent our first Christian English King, confirmed by a Bull in lead, of S. Augustin first archbishop of Canterbury and legate of the Sea Apostolike, vnto the monastery of S. Peter, & Paul in Cāterbury erected by the said K. Ethelbert: the words of the Charter are these.

Augustin was: & how many lamentable inheritours wee haue of these curses and imprecations in our countrey and round about vs at this day, where all such pious works are ouer throwne. And secondly for that he saith expresly, that he did all by the counsell, and consent of S. Augustine; it may be inferred, that whatsoeuer priuiledges he gaue, that may seeme to appertaine to Ecclesiasticall matters or Iurisdiction, he did them vnder ratihabition of the said S. Augustine, that was not only Archbishop, but legat also of the Sea Apostolike, and confequentlie had authoritie to exempt the said monastery (as we see, he did) not only from the Iurisdiction of all other Bishops, but of his owne Sea also, 
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  . in such sorte, as no Archbishop of Canterbury had any authoritie ouer them, which is much more then the Charter of Kenulsus alleadged heere by M. Attorney. And we doe reade that the monks of Canterbury did pleade this Charter of K. Ethelbert confirmed by S. Augustine, for their liberties against the Archbishop Richard Successor of S. Thomas Becket in the yeare of Christ 1180.
            
               13. Wherfore to conclude this matter; it seemeth that M. Attorney hath gotten nothing at all by this his instance of K. Kenulfus, whether in his Charter he meant of temporal, or spiritual iurisdiction. For if he meant of tēporall, that is to say, that the Abbey of Abindon should be free from molestation of the Bishops officers in temporall affaires, it is nothing to our purpose, and if he meant of spirituall Iurisdiction, cleere it is, that the said King had it not of himself by right of his crowne, as M. Attorney often repeateth and vrgeth without all grounde, but either from the Bishops of his Realme, gathered togeather in Parlament: (which seemeth very probable by the words of the Charter: Consilio, & Consensu Episcoporum: That he did it by the Counsell and Consent of his Bishops) or that, he had it immediatly from the Pope, as we haue shewed the vse to be in those dayes, & shall doe more largly in the ensuing Chapter.
            14. And that which is yet more,

                and seemeth to conuince the whole matter & to decide our very case in particular, I doe reade of one Bishop Rethurus who was Abbot also of Abindon, during the reigne of the said Kenulfus, who went to Rome to obteine the confirmation of priuiledges to the said Abbey of Abindon, about the yeare .812. Romam profectus (saith the Story) Pontificia authoritate privilegia Canobij communiuit. He going the Rome (by consent no doubt, of K. Kenulfus himself) obteined the confirmation of the priuiledges of the said monastery (of Abindon) by the Apostolike authoritie of the Sea of Rome. 
               
                  K. Kenulfus gaue his Charter to Abindon by authority of the Pope. And it is no doubt, that among other priuiledges, this Charter also of Kenulfus was one; which being so, euery man may see, how much this instance hath holpen M. Attorney his cause, or rather made against him, that Kenulfus procured the confirmation of his Charter from the Pope himself.
            15. And surely if in this M. Attorney committed an errour in alleadging Kenulfus for an example of one that tooke supreme Iurisdictiō Ecclesiasticall vpon him, he being so obedient and subordinate to the Church of Rome, as we haue said: much more did he erre in choosing S. Edward the Confessor, for his second instance (for he hath but two, as before I haue said, out of all our Kings before the Conquest) which K. Edward of all others, The instance of K. Edvvard the confessors charter examined. was most deuoutly obedient to the Sea Apostolicke, as may appeare both by that, which before we haue touched of him, as by that which after we shall more largly shew in the next Chapter, that



he presumed not to found his monastery of VVestminster, without particular licence, and approbation of the Pope. In like manner, for that hauing made a vow,

                   1033. To the high Father of the vniuersal Church Nicolas, Edward by the grace of God King of England, doth offer due subiection and obedience. Wherby is euident, that if K. Edward did hold himself for supreme head, and gouernour of the Church in spirituall matters as M. Attorney would inferr vpon certaine words of one of his lawes, as presentlie you shall heare; it must needs bee, that he was gouernour, vnder the Pope, to whome he professeth (as you haue heard) obedience and subiection.
            16. But what proofe (think you) hath M. Attorney out of this King to shew, that he exercised spirituall iurisdiction by vertue of his temporall crowne? You shall heare it all, as it lyeth in his booke; for the whole narration is but of 3. or 4. lines taken out of K. Edward his lawes. The words are these in Latin. Rex autem qui vicarius summi regis est,

               ad hoc constitutus est, vt regnum & populum Domini, & super omnia Sanctam Ecclesiam regat, & defendat ab iniuriosis; malefices autem destruat. Which M. Attorney Englisheth thus. The King, who is the vicar of the highest King, is ordeined to this end, that he should rule, and gouerne the Kingdome, & people of the land, and aboue all things the holy Church, & that he defend the same from wrong-doers, and destroy and roote out workers of mischeif. Which words, supposing them to be truly alleadged, as they lye, haue a plaine and easy interpretation, which is, that the King, as Gods minister (for so S. Paul called also the hea-Magistrate) must gouerne the Church, and Cleargie of his land in temporal matters; 
                  cap. 2. for that they are members also of the Common-wealth, as before we shewed: In which respect they are



subiect to the sayd temporall Magistrate, and in that sense to be gouerned by him, though not in spirituall things.
            17. And if M. Attorney will inferre, that because the King is calcalled Gods Vicar, he hath spirituall Iurisdiction; then may he as well inferre that the heathen Magistrate had spirituall Iurisdiction ouer Christians, for that S. Paul calleth him the minister of God, which is as much in effect as Vicar, 
               
                  Rom. 13. for that the minister supplieth the maisters place. And thus you see that albeit we admit these words as heere they ly alleadged by M. Attorney, noe aduantage can be rightly inferred against vs by them. But I am forced to suspect some little fraud or shuffling to be vsed in the citation of this peece of law, and therfore I intreate the Iudicious Reader, who is learned and hath the commodity to see the Originals; that he will examine both this, and the former instance of K. Kenulfus, in the authors whence they are taken, for I haue them not by mee.
            18. The reasons of suspicion are, first for that I see M. Attorney his translation in these few lines, not to be very exact, as it will appeare to him that examineth the same; and secondly for that I find this clause of S. Edwards law, differently alleaged heare by M. Attorney from that which is cited by Roger Houeden in the life of K. Henry the second, 
                  Rog. Houed. part 1. ant. al. in vit. Hen. 2. as also from another allegation therof by Iohn Fox in his Acts and Monuments: 
               
                  Ioan. Fox in Act. & Monument.
                by all which may be gathered that the verbe regat is wrongly placed in M. Attorneys allegation, which being amended, and the said verbe placed before in his dew place, the sense is perfect; to witt, vt Rex regnum terrenum & populum Domini regat, & sanctam eius veneretur ecclesiam, & ab iniuriosis defendat, &c. that the King rule his earthly Kingdome, and the people of God, and reuerence and defend the holy Church. Thus (I say) ought the words to stand, to make good and congruons sense, and not as they are transposed, both by M. Attorney and Iohn Fox to make a blind sense: who yet agree not in their allegations therof, as in the places cited you may see.
            19. And this our assertion (concerning the true sense & meaning of the former clause) is confirmed yet further by the words of K. Edward immediatly following in the same law, omitted heere by M. Attorney, but sett downe by Fox, which are these. Quod nisi secerit, nomen regis in eo non constabit, verum, Papa Ioanne testante, nomen Regis perdet. If a King doe not perfourme the points before mentioned (of gouerninge his people, and defending the



Church) the name of a King agreeth not to him; but he must leese that name, as testifieth Pope Iohn. So he. And the same K. Edward in the end of this speach, doth cite the authority of the said Pope Iohn againe, saying that the wrote to Pipinus, and his sonne Charles, be
                     •
                  ore they came to be Kings of France, that no man was worthy to be called a King; except he did vigilantly defend and gouerne the Church, and people of God; So as now this gouernment of the Church which M. Attorney hitherto hath vrged so much against the Popes authority, must be vnderstood according to the meaning and sense only of Pope Iohn; 
                  
                     〈1 paragraph〉
                  
                who I suppose notwithstanding will not meane that temporall Princes shall be heads of the Church, and to haue supreme spirituall Iurisdiction in causes Ecclesiasticall, deriued from their Crownes as M. Attorneys meaning is. And so you see vnto what good issue he hath brought this argument out of S. Edwards lawes, which is, that Kings haue so much gouernmēt ouer the Church, as Pope Iohn allowed them, and no more.

            HOW THE ATTORNEY NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVE HIS AFFIRMATIVE PROPOSITION, Of English Kings Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, before the Conquest: VVe doe ex abundanti proue the negatiue, by ten seuerall sortes of most euident demonstrations, that there was no such thing in that tyme, but the quite contrary. CHAP. VI.
            THov hast seene and considered I doubt not (gentle and iudicious Reader) how M. Attorney in the former Chapter hath byn grauelled in prouing his affirmatiue proposition, that our Kings before the Conquest, tooke supreme Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction vpon them, and acknowledged it not in the Pope or Sea of Rome. For proofe wherof he brought forth two such poore, and petite instances, as they being, besides their weaknes, impertinent and vntrue, and not subsisting in their owne grounds, they were no more for perfourmance of his promise of cleere and demonstratiue proofes; then if a man being bound to pay ten thousand pounds in pure and current gold, should bring forth two mites of brasse for discharge of his band. And surely if M. Attorney should haue failed soe, some yeares gone before he was so wealthie, Hovv little M. Attorney proueth. as that taking vpon him with so great an ostentation, to proue an affirmatiue assertion of so mayne importance, and consequence, as this is, he should haue performed no more, then he



hath here done, he would neuer haue attained by law, to the preferment he hath. But now
                  •
                perhaps he persuadeth himself that by his only credit already gotten, he may say what he will, and proue as little as he list; because by only saying he shall be beleeued.

But on the contrary side we require proofes, & offer proofes (gentle Reader) & for that the matter is of singular great weight euen for thy soule, we rest not in ostentation of wordes only but in probation of deedes. And though we might remaine sufficiently with the victorie, for that our aduersarie resteth with so apparent a foyle in the proofe of his forsayd affirmatiue; yet that you may see, and behold, as in a glasse, the difference of our cause and confidence therin; I haue thought conuenient, out of the great aboundance and variety of proofes, that our truth hath in this controuersie (as well as in all others betwene vs and Protestants) to take vpon me to proue the negatiue, against M.

How great a King Inas was in Gods affaires, the lawes which he made to correct the manners of his people doe sufficiently declare, in which vntill this day, there is seen as in a liuely glasse the said Kings purity of mynde. And the like lawes (no doubt) other Kings also made in their Dominions, all which remained afterwards to their posterity, vnder the names of Mulmutian lawes. For the lawes of the Britans, as also the lawes of the Mercians, Differences of lavves and lavv-makers before the conquest. called in their tongue Mercen laga, and of the West-Saxons, called VVest-saxen laga, and of the Danes named Dan laga, stood in force vntill England came to be a Monarchie, when the first authour of the said Monarchie King Egbert began first to drawe them into one body of conformity. But after him againe K. Edgar surnamed the peaceable and wise King, confirmed the same and sett them forth, but by the warrs and confusion of the Danes, which after his death ensued, they were for the most part put out of vse againe, vntill K. Edward the confessor recalled them, encreased, and made them perfect, and by the counsaile of his Peeres and Realme, did frame a new ordination of the same lawes, which remained afterwards vnder the name of K. Edward his lawes; and were so much approued and loued by the people, as Iohn Fox also out of Mathew Paris doth affirme, Fox Acts and Mon. pag. 149. that the common people of England, would not doe obedience to VVilliam Conquerour, but that first he did sweare to keepe these lawes, which oath notwithstāding (saith he) the Conquerour did afterward breake, and in most points brought in his owne lawes.

                   So Fox which if it be true, yet is it to be vnderstood principally of his lawes, appertayninge vnto secular men: for that in the rest which concerned the



Church, & her priuiledges, he followed absolutely the lawes of K. Edward, as in the next Chapter shall appeare, where we shall sett downe the said Conquerour his lawes in this behalfe, which are as fauourable and respectiue vnto Ecclesiasticall power and persons, as of any one King, eyther before or after him.
               4. Wherevpon it followeth, that M. Attorney, who so often iterateth this worde of auncient and most auncient common-lawes of England, which as he saith (but cannot proue) did authorize Q. Elizabeth her spirituall Iurisdiction ouer the Church, speaketh but in the ayre and at randome, beating vs still with the empty sound of these words, without substance: For in reall dealing he should haue alleadged some one law at least to that purpuse, out of all these before the Conquest, if he had meant to be as good as his word.
               5. But this he cannot doe, as already you haue seen by his two poore instances, and we doe shew on the contrary side that all these and other lawes of these dayes were for vs, in the fauour of Catholike Religion, and particularly for the liberties, franquizes, priuiledges, exemptions, and immunities of the Church and Clergie, according to the Canons and Decrees of the Popes Ecclesiasticall law, which is the very decision of our Question. For that by these phrases & clauses is signified, as in the Canon-law (and particulerly throughout the sixt booke of Decretals may be sene) is properly meant, that the Church and Clergie is free from all iurisdiction of temporall Princes, except only in Ciuill matters; and that their goods and persons are exempted from Princes secular Courtes, & that they are immediatly vnder their Prelates, and they againe vnder the Sea Apostolike, What the

And you haue heard before in the second Chapter of this booke, how conforme all these things are to Gods law, and how willingly they were embraced, approued, and allowed by the first Christian Emperour Constantine, and his Successours, and by all Christian Catholike Princes since that tyme throughout the world: but especially, and aboue others in comparison, by our English Kings before the Conquest. and after also, as in their dew places shalbe shewed.
               
                  6. And so when the forenamed Kings Edgar & Edward, in their very first law doe sett downe and determine (as Fox also confesseth) that the Kings office is to keepe, 
                     Fox vbi supra.

Attorneys proposition; & so doe all the Kings in like manner after the Conquest, who following this example doe euer in the beginning of their lawes, renew, and confirme this lawe of King Edward, for the libertyes, and priuiledges of the Church and Church men.

Henry did Edward the first his sonne publishe and confirme after him, Confirmation of Churches libertyes in England. as appeareth by his owne preface prefixed before the said Magna charta. And Edward the second, that ensued after him, not only ratifyed the same, but added other Statutes also called Articuli Cleri in fauour of the same Clergie.

                     . Ethelbert of Kent (for example) was sirst of all other Kings conuerted to Christian faith by S. Augustine the Monke, sent from Pope Gregorie the first to that effect, vpon the yeare of Christ 600. and that by this occasion, a new Ecclesiasticall Common-wealth was to be instituted and erected within his dominion, concerning matters depending of Religion, farre different from that which passed in his Realme before when he was a Pagan, as namely (to omitt matters of doctrine, and meere spirituall gouernment) concerning marriages legitimation of children, burying, paying of tythes, iurisdiction of Bishops and priests, & the like that might seeme in some sorte to be mixt and concerne also the Common-wealth: to whome was the recourse made sor direction, counsaile, and ordinance in these affaires? to K. Ethelbert think you, or to S. Gregorie the Pope? no man will say, I think, to K. Ethelbert, for that he was yet but a nouice in Christian religion, though as capable of spirituall iurisdiction by his Crowne, as either Q. Elizabeth being a woman, or K. Edward the sixt a child of nyne yeares old when he was proclaimed Head of the Church of England, as well in spirituall as temporall affaires.
               
                  10. But in our case vnder K. Ethelbert we reade both in S. Bede and S. Gregory himself, that in all Ecclesiasticall matters, recourse was made to the said S. Gregory, as hauing supreme authority in these affayres, and therfore the said King was no sooner conuerted, & S. Augustine made Archbishop, but the said Archbishop according to his office sent two messengers to Rome, Laurentius a priest, and Petrus a Monke, See Bede lib. 1. histor. Angl. c. 2

                  hem after their child-birth, and the like.
               11. To all which questions S. Gregory answereth, and prescribeth in particular what is to be done, as lawfull Iudge in these matters. And to that of the French Bishops, he giueth such answeres, as therby he testifyeth that he wel knew himself to haue supreme authoritie and iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, as well ouer all Bishopps of France, as of England, and all countryes besides throughout all Christendome. For thus he wrote, as S. Bede relateth: 
                     Ibidem. The ansvvere of Pope Gregory cōcerninge French Bishops. 
                  For as much as concerneth the Bishopps of France, I gaue you no authoritie ouer them, and from the ancient tymes of my precedessors, the Bishop of Arles hath receaued his pall; (from the Sea of Rome) whome we ought not to depriue os that authoritie, which from them he hath receaued, &c.
               
               12. And the same Pope Gregorie sending the pall (which is the proper signe of Archi-episcopal authority) vnto the same S. Augustine of England, he appointeth him his limitts of power and iurisdiction, and what he shall doe, and giue to others, and this without any reference vnto K. Ethelbert, any way to depend of him in his said authority or execution therof. For thus he writeth vnto him: Reuerendissimo & Sanctissimo Fratri Augustino, Coepiscopo, Gregorius seruus seruorum Dei.

               13. By this epistle, and commission of Pope Gregory, we may see what authority he tooke himself to haue, for all matters spiritual and Ecclesiasticall in our Countrey: neither did he thinke herby to doe any iniury to King Ethelbert, neither did the King take it soe, or imagine that himself had any spirituall Iurisdiction, or Ecclesiasticall authority to gouerne the Church, by vertue of his temporall crowne, more now by being a Christian, then he had before, when he was a Gentile; but only that now he was to gouerne Ecclesiasticall persons also, in ciuill and temporall matters, and therby might rightly be called King of them both in the sense which befo

                  e in the second Chapter of this answere we haue declared.
               14. Nay, good King Ethelbert was so far of from thinking himself



to receaue any preiudice against the power and authority of his temporall Crowne, by the spirituall iurisdiction ouer him and all others, instituted by Pope Gregory; as he infinitely reioyced therat, and presently made temporall lawes to confirme the same: hauing speciall care to prouide for the fafety, and immunity of the Clergie, as S. Bede doth signifie. 
                     Bede lib. 2. hist. Anglicana cap. 5. And moreouer that he reduced the forme of his secular iudgements and Tribunalls, to the likenes of those of Rome. 
                  Among other good things and benefits (saith he) which King Ethelbert with his wisdome did bring into his nation, one was, that he appointed by the counsaile of wise men, the decrees of iudgements to be made according to the example of the Romanes, which decrees being written in the English tongue doe remaine in vse and force vnto this day. So Bede. Who liued an hundred & fifty yeeres after. And this may suffice for example of the first Kingdome conuerted to Christian religion, which was of Kent, and the countreyes round about euen vnto the riuer of Humber.

All these Pagan Kingdomes, as they receaued the faith and Kingdome of Christ, by the industrye and labours of spirituall and Ecclesiasticall men, that preached and instructed them, and were subordinate the one to the other, but all to the Sea os Rome: so did those Kings (now made Christians) subiect themselues vnto them, not only in matters of faith and beliefe, but in discipline also and Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, as sheep to their Pastors,

                  all warrs for the suspition, the one had, that the other would encroache vpon him. And yet shall you neuer reade, that any of them did goe about to punish a Priest, or Clergie man for bringing in any Ecclesiasticall ordinance, function or order from his enemyes countreyes, which is an euident argument that all was one in Ecclesiasticall matters, and consequently that these law

               17. To all which may be added this consideration of one Metropolitan, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who had the spirituall iurisdiction ouer the far greatest part of all these English King

                   Dominions, wherof diuers were enemyes in temporall matt

                   to the King of Kent, in whose territoryes his Bishopricke and Residence was: & yet did no one of all these other Kings except against this his spirituall authority & ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, in matters belonging to Religion, which doth euidently demonstrate that this Ecclesiasticall power of the said Archbishop, was a different thing from the temporall of these Princes, and placed in a different person; and that all these Kings were one in acknowledgemēt of obedience vnto this spirituall iurisdiction, though in other things ech man had his temporall power and State a part. But if these powers were combyned togeather in the person of the Prince, and annexed to his Crowne and Scepter, as M. Attorney doth pretend; then would ech of them haue had a seuerall Metropolitan vnder him, independent the one of the other, which we see was neuer attempted, but all acknowledged the said Archbishop of Canterbury, or the other of Yorke, in their districts, ac
                     •
                  ording to the power, and limitations giuen them by the Bishop of Rome, as already hath byn declared. And



though much more might be said in this point, and many particularities alleadged, which for breuities sake I omitt, yet this already said, will suffice to shew the force of this argument.
               18. One thing only I may not let passe, to aduertise the reader of, which is a certaine wyly slight deuised by M. Attorney, to decline the force and euidence of this proofe saying that albeit those Ecclesiasticall lawes were taken from others; yet being allowed and approued by the temporall prince, they are now his lawes. 
                  M. Attorney his euasion ansvvered. But this shift is refuted by that which already we haue sett downe before. For if one & the self-same Ecclesiasticall law, receaued by seauen Kings and Kingdomes ioyntly within our land, shalbe said to be ech Kings proper lawes, for that they are approued and receaued by him & his realme: then shall one and the self-same law haue seauen authors, yea more then seauenty: for that so many Kingdomes and States, as through-out Christendome shall receaue the same Ecclesiasticall and Canon-law (for example) made and promulgated by the generall Pastor therof: ech particuler Prince (I say) admitting the same, as he is bound to doe, if he be truly Catholike, shal therby be said to be the particular author therof: which is no lesse ridiculous, then if a man should say, that euery prouince in France admitting a law made by the King in Paris, should be the seuerall makers of that law. But for that I shall haue occasion perhaps to handle this point more at large afterward, I shall say no more now but passe to another Demonstration.
            
            
               The third Demonstration.
               19. The third Demonstration consisteth in this, that in all the tyme of our Christian Kings before the Conquest, 
                  That all Ecclesiasticall vveighty matters vvere referred by our Kings & people to Rome.
                   being aboue an hundred in number in the space of almost fiue hundred yeares (as before hath byn said) all doubts, or difficulties of greatest importance, that fell out about Ecclesiasticall busines, or mē, all weighty consultations, and recourse for remedy of iustice, and decisions in Ecclesiasticall causes of most moment, were not made to the Kings of our Realme, nor to their Tribunalls, but to the Bishops of Rome for the tyme being, as lawfull iudges therof, both by the subiects and Princes themselues: and consequently those Princes did not hold themselues to be heads of their Churches, nor did thinke that they had supreme Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction,

But I shalbe myndfull of breuity, and out of many and almost infinite examples name a few, obseruing also some order of tyme therin.

Augustine our first Archbishop vnder & Gregory the Pope (both of them our Apostles) who did exercise, and put in vre spirituall iurisdiction ouer all the Church of England, without reference to K. Ethelbert, though he were a Christian and a very good Christian King. And when the sayd S.

                  K. Eadbald an Apostata reclaymed. who after the death of his good Father K. Ethelbert, by dissolute life, had fallen backe againe to Paganisme, and renounced the Christian faith. But afterward returned againe, and became a good Christian King: and presently therupon he wrote his humble letters of submission to the said Pope Boniface the fifth, as appereth by the Popes answere vnto the said Archbishop Iustus, vpon the yeare of Christ 618. related by S. Bede, where Boniface writeth: Susceptis namque apicibus filij nostri Eadbaldi Regis, &c.

Eadbald we doe fynd therby with how great learning of Gods worde, you haue moued his mind to true cōuersion & vndoubted faith. And in the same letter he signifyeth, that togeather therwith he sent him (to wit to S. Iustus) the pall, with authority of Archbishop of Canterbury: and further, concedentes etiam tibi ordinationes episcoporum exigente opportunitate, we doe also graunte vnto you power to ordeyne Bishops, Autho

And togeather with him they sent certaine religions oblations & almes to the vse of S. Peters chappell, but the said Priest dying, so soone as he arriued, could not satisfie their desires.

Ethelwold, and Oswald, to make this reformation, which he would neuer haue done, if he had thought, that by his owne Kinglie power, descending from his Crowne, it had belonged to himself; or that his Parlament might haue giuen him the said authority of visiting and reforming, altering and disposing, as it did to Q.

Wherfore he concludeth thus: Quare Excellentiam vestram humiles exor amus, quibus à Deo merito clauis scientia collata est, vt super hac causa cum Sapientibus vestris quaeratis, & quicquid vebis videatur nobis seruandum rescribere dignemini, &c.

Others I omitt because these alone are sufficient to shew what opinion was held from time to time by the Kings of England concerning the Popes soueraigne supreme authority in spirituall matters, belonging to conscience and direction of soules; farr different, yea quite contrary to that which M.

                     ope.37. The fourth argument, is gathered out of that which before we haue mentioned in the precedent chapter, of confirmations of Churches, Hospitalls, Monasteryes, and other pious workes, that are to be perpetuall, and of priuiledges immunityes, and exemptions, graunted thervnto; which alwaies were demaunded of the Sea Apostolike in these dayes (as they are now in ours) and their foundation was neuer held for firme to perpetuity, without the said confirmation, and ratification of the Bishop of Rome, which is a signe that they acknowledged his supreme spirituall authority, and that it was not in their temporall Kings: especially for so much as the said Kings themselues, did sue to Rome for such confirmation, ratification, and spirituall priuiledges, as the workes by them founded had need of.
               38. And of this, infinite examples might be shewed throughout all this tyme before the Conquest, but I must moderate my self, as well in this, as in the former; and therfore shall touch some few only and those all as briefly as I can, for that this chapter groweth to be ouerlong. We haue shewed how King Ethelbert 
                  
                     •
                  or the first Monastery that euer was in England, within foure yeares after his conuersion, procured confirmation and exemption



therof from S. Augustine Archbishop and Legate of Pope Gregory: and how S. Mellitus some yeares after that, being the third Archbishop of the same Sea, went to Rome in person, about the confirmation of his Monastery of VVestminster (by Pope Bonifacius) and how Pope Honorius after him againe graunted priuiledges to the Churches of Canterbury and Yorke, at the petition of King Oswyn of Northumberland, & of King Egbert of Kent. And this course was held afterward by all other Kings, in the founding of Churches, Monasteries and other pious workes; to wit that they made recourse vnto Rome and the Bishops therof, for the confirmation, ratification, establishment, priuiledges & exemptions of the same in spirituall matters, which by all likelyhoode they would not haue done, if these Kings had thought themselues to haue had sufficient authoritie, from their Crownes, to doe the same without dependance from the Sea Apostolicke.
               39. We reade in S. Bede that in the time of King Egfrid and S. Theodorus before mētioned the seuenth Archbishop of Canterbury, 
                  Abbott Biscopus sent to Rome for priuiledges. about the yeare of Christ 680. one Biscopus an Abbot, otherwise called Benedict, hauing by the licence and liberality of the said King, builded a Monastery neere to the mouth of the riuer VVyer, went by consent of the sayd King to Rome, to aske confirmation and priuiledges of Pope Agatho: He demaunded and receaued (saith S. Bede) of Pope Agatho a letter of priuiledge, 
                  
                     Bed

                  confirmed by his Apostolicall authority, for the defence and strengthning of the liberty of his Monastery, according to the will and meaning of King Egfrid, by whose licence and liberall gift of lands aud possessions, he had erected the same Monastery. So Bede. Who also in another parte of his workes, writing the life of S. Bertolphus a holy Abbot, saith: that in the dayes of Honorius the Pope, for that a certaine Bishop went about to molest the said holy mans Monastery,

                        .
                   he made a iourney to Rome to demaund franquises and exemption for the same, from the said Episcopall authority: Cui praebuit (saith Bede) optatum munus sanctus Papa, priuilegia scilicet Apostolicae sedis, quatenus nullus Episcoporum, in praefato Coenobio quolibet iure dominari conaretur. 
                  The priuiledges of S. Bertolphus his Monastery. Vnto which holy man, the holy Pope Honorius gaue the gifte which he desired, to wit the priuiledges of the Apostolicall Sea, to the end that no Bishop vnder any pretēce of right whatsoeuer, should goe about for the tyme to come, to take vpon him any dominion in that his Monastery.
               40. Furthermore some few yeares after this againe, vnder



Pope Sergius, there went to Rome to be baptized, the famous young King Ceadwalla of the West-saxons, Ceadwalla. of whome Malmesbury saith: Tantum etiam ante baptismum inseruierat pietati, vt omnes manubias quas iure Praelatorio in suos vsus transcripserat, Deo decimaret. He did obserue such piety euen before his baptisme, as he gaue to God the tythes of all his spoyles, which he had applied to his owne vse out of the bootyes he had gotten of his enemyes; Of whose baptisme and death in Rome we shall haue occasion to speake after. Inas. To whome the famous King Inas succeeded both in his Kingdome and vertues. And with both of them was insingular credit, the holy Abbot S. Adelmus, afterward by the said Inas, made Bishop of Shirborne, who going to Rome with the said Ceadwalla, retourned after his death, and carried with him saith Malmesbury,

He brought from Rome the priuiledge for the liberties, or franquises of his Monasteryes, which he had obteyned of Sergius Bishop of the Sea Apostolicke; which priuiledge King Inas did willingly confirme, and by his persuasions did bestowe many benefits vpon Gods seruants, and last of all honoured him also with A Bishopricke (to witt of Shirborne) though he resisted the same what he could.

second his time, as all our historyes doe sett downe.
               42. And all this hapned out in the first age of our primitiue Church, and it would be ouerlong to run ouer the rest with like enumeration, but yet some few more examples we shall touch, as they offer themselues in order. And first we read that immediately after this first age, to wit in the yeare of Christ 70

                     . as Florentius declareth, who retourning home required of them, as it semeth no other reward, but that by their intercession and his owne, he might obteyne of Pope Constantine, and Charter of priuiledges, for a monastery of his, newly erected within the territory of VVorcester, which the said two Kings had endued with many temporall possessions; and so he did, and retourned with great contentment for the said priuiledges and exemptions obteyned for his foresaid Abbey of Euesham. (for soe it was called) And by this we see, that he did not holde his said Abbey for secure, Priuiledges of the Abbey of Euesham. and well defended, by the prouisions of the said Kings, except he had obteyned also his confirmation therof from Rome.
               
               43. Next after this we read, of the foresaid famous King Offa of the Mercians, who meaning to buylde a royall, & stately Monastery vnto the protomartyr of Englād S. Alban, went to Rome to Pope Adrian, to aske licence, confirmation, and priuiledges for the same, vpon the yeare (as Matthew of VVestminster writeth) 794. and among other exemptions (to vse his owne wordes) that he might haue it ab omni episcoporum subiectione emancipandum, 
                  The priuiledges of S. Albanes founded by King Offa. that is to say, that it might be free and exempted from all subiection of Bishops: which the Pope graunted willingly, as appereth by his letter vnto the said Offa, wherin among other things he saith: Fili charissime &c.
                  Most deare chyld, and most potent King of the English Offa, we doe commend greatly your deuotion, concerning the protomartyr of your Kingdome S. Alban, and doe most willingly giue our assent to your petition of buylding a Monastery in his memory, 
                        Math. Vestmonasteriensis in historia anno 794. and doe priuiledge the same &c. Wherfore by the counsayle of your Bishops and noble men, you may make your Charter, and afterward we shall confirme



and strengthen the same with our letters, and exempt the sayd Monastery from all authoritie of Bishops and Archbishops, and subiect it immediatly to this our Apostolical Sea.
So VVestminster

                   wherby we may see that this potent King Offa did not pursuade himself that he had authoritye by the right of his crowne, to giue Ecclesiasticall exemptions to the monasteries of his realme, though they were of his owne founding: which yet M. Attorney, as you haue seene in the former chapter, would needes proue by the example of K. Kenulsus, about whose tyme as before hath byn alleaged out of Marianus Scotus, Bishop Rethurus was sent to Rome to obteyne priuiledges for the Abbey of Abindon from the Sea Apostolicke as he did.
               44. But before we passe from this example of King Offa, let vs heare the words of Mathew Paris about this fact:

bestowed vpon the same Monastery, beseeching that the Pope also would strengthen the same with some writing of his Apostolicall authority. Which embassadge of the Kings Pope Iohn receauing benignly, and by the vniforme consent of the Councell gathered togeather, Priuiledges grāted to Glastenbury at the petition of K. Edgar. confirmed the said priuiledges of K. Edgar by an Apostolicall rescript, and not only did he confirme that which Edgar had done before, but added diuerse spirituall priuiledges besides, saying amongst other things thus:

                     VVe yelding to the humble petion of King Edgar, and Archbishop Dunstane, doe receaue the said place (of Glastenbury) into the bosome of the Roman Church, and into the protection of the blessed Apostles, endewing and strengthning the same, with diuerse priuiledges, namely that the Monkes may chuse vnto themselues a Pastor or Abbot of their owne, in whose power it shalbe to prefer Monkes and Clerkes vnder him to holy orders; that no man may molest them, take, or retayne any thing of theirs, &c. Concluding in the end thus. In the name of the Father, the Sonne, & the holy Ghost &c. euerlasting malediction to the breakers therof.

And moreouer that it be secure eternally, King Edgar charter confirmed the Popes charter. from all worldly yoke; and that it remayne free from al Episcopall exaction and molestation, according to the libertyes giuen therunto by the Sea Apostolicke, and the authority of the most Reuerend Archbishop Dunstan &c. And furthermore we haue thought good to corroborate by this Charter the said priuiledges from the Sea Apostolicke of the Roman Church, according to



the first institution of the said Monastery, which whosoeuer shall presume to infringe, let him be damned eternally to hellfyer, by the punishment of the high Iudge S. Peter & all the order of Saints. Thus far that charter.

And finally not to goe further in this argument wherof infinite examples might be alleadged, I shall end with one only more to shew the perpetuity, and continuance of this vse taken out of the fifth age of our English Church, The priuiledges of VVestminster procured by K. Edvvard. to witt of King Edward the Confessor, not long before the Conquest, who hauing a great desire to enlarge the Monastery of VVestminster with new buyldings and possessions, dealt with two Popes therin, to witt Leo the nynth, and Nicolas the second, asking their approbation and confirmation therof, which they graunted one after the other. Leo wrote backe vnto him in these wordes: Leo episcopus servus seruorum Dei:

For that we haue vnderstood your intention to be laudable and gratefull to God, &c. We doe agree vnto the same, and doe commaund by our Apostolicke authoritie, that whatsoeuer possessions you haue giuen or shal giue, vnto your said Monastery of VVestminster, it be firme, and appertayne vnto the Monkes, and that the said place be subiect vnto no other lay person, but only to the King; And whatsoeuer priuiledges you shall there appoint to the honour of God, we doe graunt the same, and confirme the same by our most full authority, and doe damne finally the breakers therof vnto euerlasting malediction.
               
               48. Thus Pope Leo the nynth, who dying vpon the yeare of Christ 1054. two-other succeded within the space of foure yeares, 
                     Anno Domini 1054. to wit Victor the second, & Stephen the tenth, after whome succeded Nicolas the second, vnto whome S. Edward made sute againe by a solemne embassage, for confirmation of his said priuiledges of VVestminster and other affayres, giuing this title to his letter, 
                     Ibidem.
                   as before hath bene noted. To the highest Father of the vniuersall church Nicolas, Edward by the grace of God King of England, doth offer due subiection and obedience. 
                  Mutuall letters betvvene Pope Nicolas and King Edvvard. Wherunto the Pope answered in these wordes: Nicholas Bishop and seruaunt of the seruaunts of God, vnto the most glorious and pious, Edwarde King of England, most worthie of all honour, & our speciall beloued sonne, doth send most sweete salutation and Apostolike benediction. And after many louing and sweet speeches in the said



letter, he saith to the petition it self about priuiledges: Renouamus ergo, & confirmamus, & augemus vobis priuilegia vestra, &c.
                  We doe renew and confirme, and encrease vnto you your priuiledges: And for so much, that this place of VVestminster, from antiquity hath belonged vnto the Kings of England, we by the authority of God, and the holy Apostles, and of this Roman Sea and our owne, doe graunt, permitt, and most strongly confirme, that the place for euer be of the iurisdiction of the Kings of England, wherin their royall monuments may be conserued, and that it be a perpetuall habitation of Monkes, subiect to no person but to the King, &c.
                  
We doe absolue the place also, Priuiledges of VVestminster vvith a terrible curse to the breakers. from all seruice & subiection of the Bishop, &c. and whosoeuer shall goe about to infringe, or inuade, or diminishe, or vndoe any of these priuiledges, we damne him to euerlasting malediction, togeather with the traytor Iudas: that he haue no parte in the blessed resurrection of Saints, &c. Thus he. And with this shall we end this fourth consideration or argument, whereby is sufficiently made euident, if nothing else were, how vayne, and vntrue the imagination of M. Attorney was in the former chapter, who by the pretence of certayne words, in the charter of K. Kenulsus, to the Monastery of Abindon, would seeme to persuade himself, & others that our English Kings in those dayes, did take vpon them spirituall iurisdiction, to giue priuiledges, & exemptions from Episcopall authoritie vnto Monasteryes, and consequently, that they had all supreme iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, in as ample manner, as Q. Elizabeth tooke vpon her, or was giuen vnto her by Act of Parlament, which is a most euident dreame as you see.
            
            
               The fifth Demonstration.
               49. Now then to passe to the fifth argument, Appeales and complaints to the Sea of Rome about controuersies that fell out. which maketh matters yet more manifest, the same is taken from the consideration of Appeales when any controuersie fell out, either betwene the King and his Bishops, or betwene any lay power and Ecclesiasticall, or betwene Bishops and Churches themselues; which Appeales shall neuer be read to haue byn made in these times before the Conquest, either to the King, or to his secular Courtes, but rather to the Archbishop of Canterbury or to the Pope for the tyme being.
               
                  50. And albeit in this time of religious feruour of our Eng
                     ••••
                   Kings, there were fewer occasions giuen of Appeales to the Sea Apostolicke, then after the Conquest when Kings were lesse deuout and sometymes more violent, as may appeare by the examples of S. Anselme, S. Thomas, S. Edmond all three Archbishops of Canterbury, 
                  Appeales more frequēt since the Conquest. 
                  Thurstan, S. VVilliam & Gaufred Archbishops of Yorke, S. Richard of Chichester, Hugh of Durham to speake nothing of that notorious Appeale betwene Richard of Canterbury against King Henry the third and Hubert Earle of Kent, and diuerse others, as is euident by the histories of our Countrey, in which we fynde that alwaies the Bishops for remedy of such aggrieuaunces, as either by the Kings, Nobility, or others after the said Conquest were layd vpon them, or their Churches, made their recourse for succour to the Sea Apostolicke: yet before the Conquest also though the occasions (as I said) were not so frequent sometimes they were driuen to vse the benefit of this remedy, as we see in the two Archbishops of Canterbury, 
                  Appeales before the Conquest. 
                  Lambert and Athelard before mentioned, vnder King Offa and Kenulfus of the Mercians: and before that againe in the famous cause of S. VVilfryd Archbishop of Yorke who in the very first age after our conuersion, was twice put out of his Bishopricke, and forced to appeale to Rome, first by Egfryd King of the Northumbers, and then by Alfryd his successour, with the concurrence against him of certaine Bishops. And both times he appealed vnto Rome, 
                  
                     Bede lib. 4. historia cap. 11. & 13. as S. Bede declareth, and to follow his appeales, went thither twice in person, and was twice absolued; first by Pope Agath
                        •
                     
                   in a Synode of an hundred twenty and fiue Bishops, vpon the yeare of Christ 679. and the second tyme by Pope Iohn the seuenth six and twenty yeares after, S. VVilfrides Appeales to Rome anno. 679. to wit vpon the yeare 705. Of the first absolution, S. Bede himself writeth that he was not only found innocent, and thervpon cleered by the Pope and whole Synode (as hath byn said) but that they thought good likewise, to giue him his place in the said Councell, and to note his absolution, and the speciall respect borne vnto him in the very acts of the sayd Councel, holden against the Monothelites in these words:

                     VVilfryd the beloued of God, Bishop of the Citty of Yorke, 
                     
                        Beda lib. 5. histor Ang. cap. 10. hauing appealed to the Sea Apostolike in his cause, and being absolued by the authority of this Councell in all things, both certaine and vncertaine, was placed in his seat of Iudgemēt togeather with an hundred twenty fiue his fellow-Bishops, in this Synod, and hath confessed the true and Catholike faith, and



confirmed the same by his subscription, for himselfe and all the north partes of Britanny and Ireland, which are now inhabited by English-men, Britanes, Scotts, and Picts.
                  
               
               51. Thus relateth Bede of S. VVilfrids first appellation, and most honourable absolution in Rome, and that then retourning to his countrey he conuerted the kingdome of the South saxons, and that afterward againe, being inuyted by King Alfred, that succeeded Egfryd, to returne to his Bishopricke of Yorke, heat length vpon persuasion of good men accepted therof. 
                     Beda ibid.
                   But after fiue yeres he was expulsed againe by the said Alfred, and appealed againe to the Sea Apostolike, and went to Rome to Pope Iohn the seuenth (as hath byn said) who hearing his cause in the presence of his aduersaryes, The second Appeale of S. VVilfride to Rome. Bede ibid.
                   and accusers togeather with many Bishops that did sit in Iudgemēt with him: Omnium iudicio probatum est, &c. saith Bede. It was proued by the iudgement of all, that his accusers had deuised certaine calumniations against him:
whervpon he was absolued; and letters were written (saith Bede) by the foresaid Pope Iohn vnto Alfred, and Edelrede Kings of England that they should cause him againe to be receaued into his Bishopricke, for that he had byn vniustly condemned.
This is the summe of the story, breifly sett downe by S. Bede.

                        .
                   But VVilliam of Malmesbury writeth the same, to witt, both these appellatious of S. VVilfryd much more at large, telling how the first persecution against this holy Bishop had beginning from the enuy of Queene Ermenburga second wife to King Egfryd of the Northumbers, who vnderstanding that his first wife Ethelreda did loue, & reuerence much this good man, she thought it a sufficient cause for her to hate him, and so incensing first the King her husband against him, by saying that he was rich, and that many gaue their goods vnto him to build Monasteryes, she drew by little & little the King to mislike him, as also she did by like meanes & sleights incense the good Archbishop Theodorus of Canterbury, to impugne and contradict him.
               52. The same Malmesbury also setteth downe the particulars that passed in that Councell, wherin he was absolued at Rome, and how at his retourne into England with the Popes letters, the said Theodorus Archbishop of Canterbury repented himself much, that he had byn drawne against him, and wrote earnest letters vnto King Alfred, that had succeeded Egfrid, that he would admit him againe into his Archbishopricke of Yorke: saying among other words: Et ideo charissime te admoneo, & in Christi charitate pracipio



tibi, &c. And therfore most deere King I doe warne you, and in the loue of Christ doe commaund you: Malmesb.

                  I Theodorus humble Bishop (of Canterbury) in this my broken old age, doe suggest this vnto your Happines or Maiesty, both for that the authority of the Sea Apostolike, (as you knowe) doth commend it to be done, and the holy man VVilfryd hath (according to the saying of our Sauiour) possessed his soule in his owne patience:
and most humbly and myldly forgetting the iniuries done vnto him, hath followed the example of his head and maister Christ, and hath expected the remedy at his hand; And if I haue found any grace in your sight, although the way betweene you & me be long, yet I beseech you, let my eyes once see your face againe (to treat of this matter) and that my soule may blesse you, before I die. Wherfore my dere sonne deale with this holy man (VVilfryd) as I haue besought you, and if in this point you shew your selfe obedient to me your Father, that am shortly to departe out of this world, it will profit you much to your saluation. Fare you well.
               
               53. Vpon this letter King Alfred being much moued permitted him to retourne to his Archbishopricke againe: And S. VVylfryd by the persuasion of the said Theodorus and other Bishopps, was induced to accept the same, and so he did for some time, but after fiue yeres, the complaints of his emulatours growing strong against him, S. VVilfrid restored to his Bishoprick of York the secōd tyme. he was forced to fly the second time, vnto King Etheldred of the Mercians, but after againe appealed to Rome, and went thither being now full threescore and ten yeares old, whence retourning absolued (as hath byn sayd) with letters of commendation from Pope Iohn the seauenth, both to Britwald Archbishop of Canterbury, that had succeeded Theodorus, as also to Alfred King of the Northumbers, and to Etheldred King of the Mercians; he obteyned againe his Archbishopricke of Yorke, and held
                     •
                   it foure yeares before his death.
               54. The letters of Pope Iohn, vnto the two foresaid Kings, doe begin with a complaint of sedition raysed in England amongst the Clergie by opposition against S. VVilfride, which he exhorteth the two said Kings to suppresse, and then beginneth his narration thus: 
                     Malmesb. ibidem fol. 152. Wheras of late vnder Pope Agatho of Apostolicke memory, the Bishop VVilfryd had appealed to this holy Sea, for the



tryall of his cause &c.
The Bishops at that time gathered herein Rome from diuerse partes of the worlde, hauing examined the same, gaue the definition and sentence in his fauour, which was approued both by Pope Agatho and his Successours our predecessours &c.
and then sheweth he, how the same hauing succeeded in this his second appeale, he doth appoint Britwald Archbishop of Canterbury to call a Synod, and by all consents either restore him to his Archbishopricke, or to come and follow the cause at Rome against him; and whosoeuer did not soe, should be depriued of his Bishopricke: and then concluding with this speach to the King, he saith: Vestra proinde Regalis Sublimitas faciat concursum, 
                  The Decision and cōmaundement of Pope Iohn. 
                  vt ea qua Christo aspirante perspeximus, perueniant ad effectum. Quicumque autem cuiustibet persona audaci temeritate contempserit, non erit a Deo impunitus, neque sine damno calitus alligatus euadet. Wherefore doe your royall highnes concurre also to this our ordination, to the end that those things, which by the inspiration of Christ we haue iudged for conuenient, may come to their effect. And whosoeuer vpon the audacious temerity of any person whatsoeuer, shall contemne to doe this, shall not be vnpunished of God, neither shall he escape that hurte which those incurre, whose sinnes are bound from heauen. So he.
               53. And I haue thought good to alleadge this notorious example, somewhat more largely, for that it expresseth euidently, both the acknowledgement and exercise of the Popes authority in those dayes, as also the deuoute and prompt obedience of our Christian Kings and Prelates therevnto, in that holy time of our first primitiue Church. The humilitie & obedience of our Kings in those ancient dayes. For that of the two forenamed Kings Malmesbury wryteth, that Ethelredus of the Mercians receaued the Popes letters vpon his knees on the ground. And albeit that Alfryd of the Northumbers, somwhat stomaked the matter for a time, as done in his dishonour, yet soone after being strooken with deadly sicknes, sore repented the same, and appointed in his testament that S. VVilfryd should be restored; which testament the holy virgin Elfled his sister, S. Elflede. that stood by him when he dyed, brought forth and shewed before the whole Synod of Bishops, gathered togeather about that matter in Northumberland.
               
               57. And thus hauing byn longer than I purposed in this example of S. VVylfryds appeales, I will passe ouer as before I haue said, the other appeales aboue mentioned of Lambert and Athelard,

                     •
                   the example of Egbert Archbishop of Yorke, who by his appealing to Rome: multa Apostolici throni appellatione, saith Malmesbury, that is by frequent appellation to the Apostolicall throne, recouered againe the preheminence and dignity of his Archbishopricke, and Pontificall pall, vpon the yere 745. which had byn withdrawen from that Church, for many yeares togeather after Panlinus his departure. 
                     Malmesb. lib. 3. de gestis Pontif. anno. 745. And I may add further to this argument and consideration, not only that appellations were ordinarily made to the Sea of Rome, concerning Ecclesiasticall affaires, vpon any aggreiuances of particuler persons, Churches, or Societyes in those dayes, as appeareth by the examples alleadged; but also complaints of publicke defects, negligences, or abuses, if they concerned the said Ecclesiasticall affaires, were carried to Rome, and to the Bishops of that Sea, aswell against Bishops and Archbishops, as against the Kings themselues, where occasions were offered, which Bishops of Rome, tooke vpon them as lawfull iudges to haue power, to heare, determine, and punish the same, by acknowledgement also of the parties themselues, whereof we might alleadge many examples. But one only in this place shall serue for the present, which fell out in the tyme of King Edward the elder, vpon the yeare of Christ 894. (though others differ in the number of yeares) And the case fell out thus.
               57. The Bishop of Rome in those dayes, named Formosus the first, being aduertised that diuerse prouinces in England, especially that of the VVestsaxons, by the reason of Danish warrs, were much neglected and voyde of Bishops for diuerse yeares, the said Pope saith Malmesbury wrote sharpe letters into England: 
                     Malmesbu. de rebus ges
                           •
                        is Regum Anglor. lib. 2. 
                  Quibus dabat excommunicationem, & maledictionem Regi Edwardo, & omnibus subiectis eim à sede S. Petri, pro benedictione quam deder at Beatus Gregorius genti Anglorum. By which letters he sent excōmunication and malediction to King Edward, and all his subiects, from the Sea of S. Peter, in steed of the benediction which S. Gregory had giuen to the English-nation; wherof Malmesbury addeth this reason, that for full seauen yeares, the whole region of the VVest-saxons, had byn voyde of Bishops. And that King Edward hauing heard of the sentence of the Pope, presently caused a Synod of the Senatours



of the English nation to be gathered, in which sate as head, Pleam
                        •
                     ndus Archbishop of Canterbury, who interpreted vnto them strictly (saith Malmesbury) the wordes of this Apostolicall Legacy sent from Rome:
Wherupon the said King, and Bishops tooke vnto themselues wholesome counsaile, choosing and ordeyning particular Bishops in euery prouince of the Geuisses or westsaxons. 
                     Pope Formosus did excōmunicate K. Edvvard the first and hovv the matter vvas amended. And wheras the said prouince had but two Bishops in old time, now they deuided the same into fiue, and presently the Synod being ended, the said Archbishop was sent to Rome with honourable presents: Qui Papam (saith our Authour) cum magna humilitate placauit, Decretum Regis recitauit, quod Apostolico maximè placuit. He did with great humilitie endeauour to pacify the said Pope Formosus, reciting vnto him the decree that King Edward had made, for better furnishing the Countrey with more Bishops for the time to come, then euer had byn before, which most of all pleased the Apostolicall Pope. Wherfore the Archbishop retourning into England ordeyned in the Citty of Canterbury seaueu Bishops vpon one day, appointing them seuen distinct Bishoprickes: Atque hoc totum (saith he) Papa firmauit, vt damnaretur in perpetuum qui hoc decretum infirmaret. And the Pope (Formosus) did confirme this decree (of this distinction of Bishops in England) dāning him eternally which should goe about to infringe the same. So Malmesbury: and consider the authority here vsed.
               
               58. The same Pope also wrote a letter to the Bishopps of England by the said Archbishop Pleamond, in these wordes:
To our brethren and children in Christ, all the Bishopps of England, Formosus. We hauing heard of the wicked rytes of This he speaketh in respec

                   knowledge came to the Metropolitan of any Bishop dead, he should presently without delay cause another Canonically to be elected in his place, and himself to consecrate the same.
And moreouer he determineth that the Bishop of Canterbury, hath byn euer from ancient times held for chiefe Metropolitan of England, otdeyened so by S. Gregory himself, as in the Roman Registers was authenticall recorded, and therefore he confirmeth the same, threatning, that what man soeuer shall goe about to infringe this decree, shalbe separated perpetually from the body of Christ and his Church. So Malmesbury.
                  
               
               60. And in this example we see many points, expressing the sense of these ages, as first the vigilancy of the Pope Formosus ouer England, & the affaires therof (though far remote from him, and altogether embroyled with warrs) no lesse then ouer other Prouinces & Kingdomes of the world, The vigilancy of ancient Popes ouer England. which is conforme to that which S. Bede writeth of the like diligence of Pope Agatho aboue two hundred yeares before this of Formosus, that is to say, that he seing the heresie of Monethelites, that held but one only will in Christ, to spring vp and encrease in diuerse places of the world, sent one expressly from Rome into England, to learne what passed there.

the former example did, when presently vpon the threatning letters of Pope Formosus, he called forthwith a Councell, remedyed the fault that was committed, & sent the Archbishop Pleamond to Rome to giue satisfaction, and promise of amendment for the time to come, which is to be presumed that none of these Kings would haue done, if they had thought themselues iniured by this intermedling of the Pope, as an externall power; A consideration of moment. and that themselues had authority Ecclesiasticall deriued from their crownes, to dispose & order these things without any reference to the Sea Apostolike. And so much for this argument and demonstration, which openeth a window to see many things more, which by me of purpose are pretermitted, for that I couet not to be ouerlong.
            
            
               The sixt Demonstration.
               62. The sixt Argument may be deduced, VVhat Kings Archbishops & Bishops liued togeather, and vvhat lavves they vvere like to make. from an vniuersall contemplation of all the Kings, Archbishops, and Bishops that haue liued, and raigned togeather in all this tyme in England, and the seuerall Prouinces, and Kingdomes therof, before the Conquest, the Kings being in number aboue an hundred that were Christened, as often before hath byn mentioned, the Archbishops of Canterbury the spirituall heads of the English Church 32. from S. Augustine vnto Stigano, and other Bishops of far greater number, laying before our eyes, what manner of men all these were, what faith they beleeued and practised, what vnion and subordination they had in spirituall and temporall iurisdiction amongst them selues, both at home and abroad with the Sea Apostolike, which in great part hath byn declared by the precedent arguments and demonstrations. All which being layd togeather, we may inferre, that for so much as lawes are nothing else but ordinaunces and agreemenrs of the Prince and people, to the publicke good of euery Kingdome, State, and Countrey; we may inferre (I say) that according as we find the faith and religion of our Princes, Bishops, and people to haue byn in those dayes, so were also their lawes. For out of their religion, they made their lawes, and consequently it must needes follow, that they being all perfectly Catholike, according to the Roman vse, as by all the former arguments you haue seene, that they made



no lawes concerning Ecclesiasticall matters, nor admitted 
                     •
                  onceaued any from their ancestours, nor could not doe (they being also Catholike) that were repugnant or contrary to the Canonicall lawes of the vniuersall Church, and Sea of Rome, in those ages: wherof againe ensueth that M. Attorney that telleth vs so often of the ancient and most ancient Cōmon-lawes of England; cannot presume to haue any law for him, and his assertion within this compasse of 466. yeres before the Conquest: for that those that should make or leaue vnto vs these lawes, were all of a contrary iudgement, and religion vnto him, in the very point which he treateth of spiritual Iurisdiction. As for example.
               63. There raigned in Kent in the first age of our primitiue Church successiuely these Kings, to witt: Ethelbert, Eadbald, Ircombert, Egbert, Lotharius, Edrycus, and VVithredus; The concurrence of Kings and Bishops in Kent and London for the first age of English Christianity. 1 and their Archbishops of Canterbury, by whome they gouerned themselues in spirituall matters, were Augustine, Laurence, Mellitus, Iustus, Homrius, Deusdedit, Theodorus, and Britwaldus. And in London, Mellitus, Ceddus, VVyna, Erkenwald, VValdherus, and Ingualdus. And in the sea of Rochester, Iustus, Romanus, Paulinus, Thamarus, Damianus, Putta, Q
                        ••
                     
                     chelmus, Germundus, and Tobias. All these kings, with all these Bishops were of one, and the self same religion, and of one iudgement and sense in Ecclesiasticall matters, and so were all the rest of the Christian Kings, togeather with their Bishopps, in other Kingdomes of the land. And the like I might shew throughout all the other foure ages that ensue after this, first before the Conquest. And how then is it possible, that these Princes with these Bishops and Counsaylours, and with their people conforme to them in the same religion, should make or admit lawes contrary to the common sense of the Catholike vniuersall Church in those daies, concerning Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction? And this is a demonstration which morally conuinceth, and cannot by any reasonable man be denyed. A necessary inference. Whervnto I may adioyne, that if they had made any such law, cōtrary to the common sense of the generall Church in Church-matters, they would haue byn noted, and reprehended for it, or at leastwise some memory would haue byn left therof by historiographers, tradition, register, or some other monument, which is not found, nor euer will be. And this shalbe sufficient for this demonstration, wherby occasion is giuen to the ingenious reader to prosecute the same, and discourse further of himself, and to consider how metaphysicall



an imagination that of M. Attorney is, of auncient lawes made in the ayre, and no where extant, contrary to the sense, and iudgement, both of Prince and people in those tymes.
            
            
               The seuenth Demonstration.
               64. An other Demonstration not much vnlike vnto this, The concourse vvith other Kings, Princes, and Catholicke people abroade. may be taken from the view of externall Kingdomes, in this tyme before our English Conquest: to wit what they taught, what they beleeued, and what they practized in this point, concerning Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, whether they deriued it, or acknowledged the same, in, or from their temporall Kings, or from their Bishops and Sea Apostolike of Rome. For if they did the later, then is it most certaine that all the Kings, Kingdomes, and people of England did the like, for that otherwise they should haue byn noted, and taxed as hath byn said for some discrepance, diuision, disagreement, sedition, schisme, or singularity in this behalfe, which is not read of. Nor can M. Attorney, or any Attorney else whomesoeuer he can take vnto him for his helpe in this matter, euer shew me any one word of auncient testimony for proofe therof, and thervpon may we confidently conclude, that there was neuer any such thing.
               65. But now what was the doctrine, vse, and practise of all the rest of Christendome besides, concerning Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, deriued from the Sea Apostolike of Rome, 
                  The vniuersall authority of the Sea of Rome during the time of our Christian kings before the Conquest. as the head & fountaine therof, throughout all this tyme, wherof we speake before our Conquest, it shall be inough to cast our eyes only vpon the vniuersality of all writers in those dayes, whose volumes are full of narrations, apperteyning to this effect, as namely of Bishops made throughout all Kingdomes, by ordinaunce and authority of the Bishop of Rome: Of Churches, Abbyes, Monasteryes, Hospitalls confirmed, and priuiledged by the said authority: Of Kings, and Emperours also annoynted by them and their authority for the spirituall & temporall good of Christendome. And in this very tyme, wherof we talke, happened the mutation of the Kingdome of France from Chilpericus, to Pipinus and Charles his sonne: and of the Roman Empire from the Grecians vnto the said Charles; & of the said Empire from the French to the Germanes, by the authority of the Pope of Rome; and infinite other publike



testimonyes of supreme spirituall iurisdiction, exercised 
                     〈◊〉
                   where by that Sea, with the approbation of all the worlde. And no one example can be alleadged of any such power or iurisdiction pretended, or exercised by any Prince temporall whatsoeuer, throughout all the Christian world in this tyme by vs prescribed.
               66. And for so much as by this argument we presume, that our English Kings and Princes ran vnitedly in all points of religion with others abroade, for that they were neuer noted of any difference or opposition, as hath byn said, it followeth by good deduction and inference, that no such Common-law (as M. Attorney imagineth) could haue place among them, deriuing spirituall and Ecclesiastical iurisdiction from the right of Princes temporall Crownes, and excluding that of the Sea Apostolike. For in case that any such law had byn made, it would haue byn extant; either by writing or tradition; and if it had byn Common (as often here it is called) it would haue byn knowne by some one at least, Marke the consequence. besides M. Attorney, for that community importeth participation with many: how then could there be any such Common-lawes in those dayes, which no man knew, no man recorded, no man euer thought or dreamed of, as by all circumstances of those tymes, and men, and state of things, may be presumed? And if any such thing had byn deuised in those dayes it must needs haue byn reiected and impugned as singular, schismaticall or hereticall; for that it would haue byn contrary and contradictory to the common sense & iudgement, & whole current of that time. And let this suffice for this consideration.

                      Englād.67. The eight Demonstration in this matter, may be the extraordinary deuotion of our auncient Kings before the Conquest; towardes the Sea of Rome, in making their Kingdomes tributary thervnto, euen in temporall things also: which is a signe that they meant not to deny vnto that Sea, her spirituall iurisdiction, which from the beginning, had byn exercised by the same in our countrey, seeing voluntarily likewise they gaue her tēporall iurisdiction, in gathering and axacting this tribute of euery house throughout the Realme; which beginning from K. Inas (as all



our Authors doe agree) aboue 900. yeres gone, hath byn continued euer since, vnder the name of Peter-pence, for that they were first giuen to S. Peter, and to his Successours the Bishops of Rome, vntill the later part of K. Henry the eight his raigne, euen in the tyme of the Danes themselues, as presently shalbe shewed.
               68. And for breuities sake, it will be least perhaps to alleadge here the wordes of one that was skillfull in the matter, for that he had byn Collector or gatherer of this tribute for diuerse yeres togeather in England vnder the sayd King Henry, to whome also he dedicated his historie, to wit Polidor Virgil an Italian, Archdeacon of VVells, 
                  The beginning of Peter-pence. who out of al historiographers had gathered the grounds, and antiquities of this tribute: and in the life of King Inas of the VVest saxons, hauing shewed and declared first, togeather with all other auncient writers, how wise, valiant, and pious a King he was, and what singular monuments therof he had left behinde him, as among other the buylding of the Church of VVells, the Abbey of Glastenbury, & the like; he finally concludeth thus:

                  There are infinite good workes of this King related by Historiographers full of piety, and this among the first, that he made his Kingdome tributary to the Bishop of Rome, imposing vpon euery house a penny. And all England at this present time, doth pay this tribute for piety & religious sake to the Bishop of Rome, gathered from euery house of the whole Kingdome, and vulgarly they are called the pence of S. Peter, which the Pope gathereth vp by his officer, called Collectour, which office we for some yeres did exercise in that Kingdome, and for that cause went first of all thither. Thus Polidor.
                  
               
               69. Iohn Stow doth set downe many particularityes of the rich gifts of gold and siluer,

King Inas being exceeding desirous to amend, and establish the state of his Kingdome, and to instruct his subiects how to liue well and happily, did make most holy lawes, and left them to be obserued. But the wickednes of his posterity, hath by little and little worne out



the same.
And lastly after all this glory wherin he had raigned thirty seuen yeres, K. Inas his lavves in fauour of the Pope. he leauing voluntarily his Kingdome w

                     〈◊〉
                   whether any of these lawes made by King Inas were likely to be against the Popes spirituall iurisdiction, or in fauour therof; And if the later may with more reason be presumed, then haue we more auncient cōmon-lawes, that is to say temporall lawes, against M. Attorney, then he can alleadge any for himself, to the contrary.
               70. But to goe forward in shewing the continuance, confirmation, and encrease of this temporall tribute to the Pope of Rome, the said Polidor writing of King Offa, the most famous and valiant King of the Mercians, and shewing how wicked, & cruell he had byn first, and how godly he became afterward, hath these words: He built the magnificent Cathedrall Church of Hereford, and adorned the same with most ample gifts: he caused to be sought out the body of S.

                     . and placed the same in a monastery of S. Benedicts order built by himself; and further he builded the monastery of Bath.
                  And yet more for further satisfaction of his former synnes, he passed the Ocean sea, went to Rome, and there made tributary his Kingdome of Mercians, to Adrian the Pope, by imposing that tribute vpon euery house of his people, which was called Peter-pence: and this, as some thinke, by the imitation of King Inas, which had done the same some yeres before, in the Kingdome of the VVestsaxons. And this saith Polidor was done by Offa, vpon the yere 775. which was according to this accompt seuenty yeres after the other.

And about some fourscore yeres more or lesse, after this againe King Adelnulph, otherwise called Edelnulph, or Edelph, sonne and heire to King Egbert, the first great Monarch that gaue the name of Anglia, or England to our Countrey, hauing adioyned vnto his Kingdome of the VVest saxons fiue more, to wit, that of the

He went (saith Polidor) to Rome vpon a vow, and was most benignly receaued by Pope Leo the fourth, and there he made tributary vnto the Pope of Rome, such partes of the Iland, as King Egbert his father had adioyned vnto the Kingdome of the VVest-saxons, imitating herin his predecessour King Inas: and moreouer made a speciall law therof, that whosoeuer had thirty-pence rent in possessions by the yeare, or more houses then one, should pay yearely a penny for euery house, which they did inhabite,

So Polidor: adding that some doe attribute this law vnto King Alfred his sonne, when he came to raigne, but not truly, for that it was made by Adelnulph vpon the yeare of Christ 947.

And this penny of S. Peter shall be summoned, (or called for) vpon the solemnity and feast of S. Peter and Paul, and gathered vpon the feast of the Chaines os S. Peter, so as it shall not be deteyned beyond that day, &c. thus the Conquerour in confirmation of that which other English Kings had done before him, appointing also in the same place, that his Iustice should punish them, that refused to pay the said money, or paid it not at the due day appointed.
               
               75. And to conclude this matter, this tribute was continually paid, from the first institution therof, not only before the Conquest (as now you haue heard) but afterwards also by all the Norman Kings, & their Successours, vnto King Henry the 8. as out of Polidor we haue seene. 
                     Peter pence continued after the Conquest vntil K. Henry the eight. Anno Domini 1532. And the same King Henry himself duely paid the same in like manner, for more then twenty yeres togeather, vntill he brake from the Pope and Sea of Rome, vpon the causes which all men know. Wherevpon this our Demonstration inferreth, that all this while it is not likely (they paying so willingly, and deuourly this temporall tribute vnto the Popes of Rome) that they denyed his spirituall iurisdiction, or held him in that iealosie of competency, for vsurping therby vpon their Crownes, as now we doe. And lastly, that the supreme spirituall authority of Queene Elizabeth without any Act of Parlament, was warrantable by these Kings lawes, which is the mayne paradoxicall conclusion of M. Attorneys whole discourse, against which we haue yet a Demonstration or two more: & so an end.

               76. The nynth Demonstration then about this matter, The going of diuerse Kings and Princes to Rome, for deuotion to that Sea. shall be the consideration of our English Kings their singular, and extraordinary deuotion before the Conquest to the Sea of Rome; which was such as diuers of them left their Crownes, and Kingdomes (after many yeres that they had raigned, and ruled most gloriously at home) and went to liue, and dye in that citty: some in religions habit and profession of Monasticall life, as Kenredus, King of the Mercians, and Offa King of the East angles; some in secular weed, but of most religious, deuout, and exemplar conuersation: as Inas and Ceadwalla Kings of the VVest-saxons; some others went thither of deuotion with intention to retourne



againe, as the other great Offa King of the Mercians, Adelnulph alfred, and Canutus Monarches of all England: and lastly good King Edward the Confessor had determined, & vowed a iourney thither in pilgrimage, but that his Kingdome greatly repyninge therat, in respect of the daungerous tymes, two Popes

                   and Nicolas, decreed that he should not come (as  
                     Supra Demon. 3. before we haue touched) but rather bestow the charges of that voyage vpon some other good worke, namely the encrease of the Monastery of VVestminster.
               
               77. And here I might enlarge my self much, in the declaration of these particulers which we haue named, and of many others, that we haue omitted in this kind (I meane of English Kings) that leauing their temporall Crownes, haue submitted themselues to the sweet yoke of Christ in religious life. Iohn Fox in his Actes and Monuments doth recount nyne crowned Kings, Acts and Monumēts pag. 121 that became Monkes within the first two hundred yeres after Englands conuersion to Christian faith (though all of them went not to Rome) and some eighteene or twenty Queenes, or daughters to Kings or Queenes, that tooke the same course, contemning whatsoeuer pleasures or preferments the world could giue them. But of such Kings as went to Rome, 
                  
                     Beda lib. 4 histo. Augiscana cap. 29. and made themselues religious there, the foresaid Kenredus of the Mercians, and Offa of the Eastangles were the most famous, who agreeing togeather vpon the yere 708. (as Florentins after S. Bede doth recount the history) lest both their Kingdomes, wiues, children, honours, goods, and the like togeather. Relictis vxoribus, agris, cognatis, & patria propter Christum, &c. ad limina Apostolorum, in precibus, ieiunijs, elecmosynis, vsque ad diem vltimum permanserunt. They leauing their wyues, their possessions, their kynred, their countrey for Christ, went to Rome, and there neere vnto the Apostles bodyes, they perseuered in praying, fasting, and giuing almes vnto the end of their liues.
               78.
But S. Bede setteth forth this famous fact in other words, describing also the persons of these two noble Kings. Kenredus, (saith he) who for a tyme had most nobly gouerned the Kingdome of the Mercians, did much more nobly leaue the same, giuing ouer his scepter willingly to his nephew Celred, and went to Rome where he liued in prayer, The admirable

a young man of a most louely age and beauty, and most singularly desired by all his nation, that he would stay amongst them, & enioy his Kigdome; but he being led with the deuotion of his mynd, left his wife, his possessions, his kynred, and countrey for Christ and his ghospell, that he might receaue a hundred fold in this life, and in the world to come life euerlasting. Thus S. Bede, who was of a far different mynd from M. Attorney as you see.
               
               79. And Florentius addeth further to this history, that with these two Kings went to Rome as ghostly father, and spirituall directour of their iourney, the famous holy man S. Egwyn before mentioned, S. Egvvyn Bishop of VVorcester. third Bishop of VVorcester, and founder of the Monastery of Euesham, for which he obteyned priuiledges and exemptions of Pope Constantine then Bishops of Rome,

               80. As it was in like manner some twenty yeres after, according to the forsaid Florentius to see the great and potent King Inas of the VVest-saxons, to come thither with like resolution of mind, who hauing byn a famous warrier, for the space of seuen and thirty yeres, 
                     Floren. in Chron. anno 723. in the end leauing his Empyre (saith Florentius) and commending the same to noble Athelard that was of the line of Cerdicus first King of VVest-saxons,
                  he resolued to goe to the Churches of the Apostles in Rome, vnder Gregory the Pope, and there to end his life and this worldly peregrination on earth, neere to their bodyes, to the end that he might the more familiarly in heauen be receaued into their companyes. So he.

                  After triumphant victoryes, and spoyles of warre, after the degrees of many vertues obteyned, King Inas proposing to himself the highest toppe of perfection, went to Rome, and there least his conuersion might be glorious vnto him,

                     Ceadwalla King of the VVest saxons when he had gouerned his people with great fortitude for two yeres, leauing his scepter for Christ, and his euerlasting Kingdome, went to Rome, desiring to obteyne this singular glory to be baptized in the Church of the blessed Apostles, in which baptisme he had learned, that the only entraunce to heauen for mankind did consist, hoping most certeinly, that being once baptized, he should soone after dye, and be receaued into euerlasting glory: both which points by the help of our Lord were perfourmed vnto him, as in his mynd he had conceaued, and so comming thither (vpon the yere of Christ 689.) Sergius being Pope he was baptized on Easter eue, and soone after being yet in his white attyre (according to the custome of holy Church) he died vpon the 19. of Aprill immediattly ensuing, and was buried in S. Peters Church, whose name in baptisme he had taken, and from thence his soule passed to the ioyes of heauen.
Thus S. Bede; and touching this recourse & pilgrimage to Rome he addeth in the same place:

               84. Wherfore out of all these considerations and the like, it seemeth we may deduce, that for so much as our English Kings,



and people in those dayes were so singularly deuoted vnto the Sea of Rome, and Bishops therof, as they gaue themselues, their goods, their honours, their whole life therunto; An euidēt deduction out of the premiss

And much lesse can it be presumed, that they challenged to themselues, or made lawes in those dayes in fauour of their owne Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, in restraint of that of the Popes: and consequently M. Attorney I trow, will hardly proue by the most ancient lawes of those times, that Q. Elizabeth could iustify the supreme Ecclesiasticall authority, which she exercised in her dayes; if the statute of the first Parlament had not giuen the same vnto her, which had as good authority to giue it her, as she to vse the same, according to that which you haue seene declared in the former Chapters, whereunto we referre our selues for the proofes laid downe.

Attorney, about spirituall iurisdiction belonging to Kings, and temporall Princes, so as where the former demonstrations, are but deductions and inferrences, though clere and euident as you haue seene; this last is a plaine, and perspicuous asseueration of two such renowned Kings, as were most eminent for wisdome, learning, religion, and valour of all the ranke of those tymes.

consisted principally in this, that in the Kingdome of Christ which is his Church, he bare himself not as a King, but as a citizen, and that he should not arrogantly lift vp himself abou

For so much as our Lord hath exalted his mercy towardes vs, it is conuenient most Reuerend Fathers, that we endeauour to answere his innumerable benefitts, with dew workes on our behalfe; for that as the prophet saith, we doe not possesse this land by our owne sword, nor shall the strength of our arme saue vs, but the right hand, and holy arme of him, that hath vouchsafed to take vs to his fauour:
And therfore it is iust and right, that for so much, as he hath subiected all vnder our feete, that we subiect our soules vnto him, in such sort, as that we endeauour to bring them that he hath put vnder vs, to be subiect also vnto his lawes: and as for me, my part is to gouerne lay men by the law of equity, to doe iust iudgement betweene euery man and his neighbour, to punishe sacrilegious men, to represse rebells, to take the poore man out of the hand of his stronger, and deliuer the needy and impotent from such as oppresse and spoile them. It belongeth also to my solicitude, to prouide necessaries for Ministers of Gods Churches, couents of Monkes, cloysters of virgins, & to procure them peace and quietnes to serue God

of their manners, if they liue continently, if they behaue themselues decently, and with edification towards them that be in the world, if they be solicitous in seruing God, vigilant in teaching the people, sober in diet, moderate in habit, and the like. So he.
               
               88.
And then after a long complaint of many disorders in those dayes, crept into diuers of the Clergie, the good zealous King hath these words: These scandalous things are proclaimed euery where by souldiers, muttered by the people, sung by players, and will you (reuerend Fathers) neglect, dissemble, & spare them that so offend? where is the sword of Leui? where the zeale of Simeon? where is the spirit of Moyses? where the sword of Phinees the Priest? Yea, where is the spirit, and feruour of S. Peter wherby he so dreadfully punished both auarice and heresie? follow him, follow him ô you Priests: tempus faciendi contra eos qui dissipauerunt legem Dei: it is high tyme to punish those, that haue dissipated the law of God by their euill life: Tvvo svvordes of S. Peter and Constantine acknovvledged by K. Edgar. 
                     Ego Constantini, vos Petri gladium habetis in membus, iungamus dexteras, gladium gladio copulemus.
                  
I haue the sword of Constantine, you the sword of S. Peter in your hands, let vs ioyne our forces, and couple sword to sword: vt eijciantur extra castra leprosi, that leaprous and infectious people be cast out of the tents of God, &c.

               89. And now M. Attorney will see heere what accompt these two auncient Kings made of these two powers and swordes, spirituall and temporall, and of their distinction and subordination the one to the other. And it seemeth that this speach of King Edgar, was so memorable and famous to all his posterity, that VVilliam Conquerour also did imitate the very same,

And this was the opinion, sense, and iudgement of these Princes and tymes, wherin they made this difference & degree of these two swordes, without any such preiudice of taking away halfe their Monarchies from themselues, or other Princes therby, as M.

Now therfore (gentle Reader) by these ten demonstrations thou hast seene, what was the opinion, iudgement, and practise of all our ancient English Kings before the Conquest about this point of temporall and spirituall power and authority, and heare I thinke thou wilt not deny, but that my manner of proofe is, and hath byn according to the rule of the Fathers touched before in the answere to the preface, to wit, KATH'HOLON or secundum totum, bringing forth the whole body of this tyme; & that M. Attorneys proofe, if it had byn a proofe, that is to say, if he had proued that which he propounded, is secundum partem according to a part, he only alleadging two sole petite instances, out of all the ranke of aboue an hundred Kings, for the space almost of fiue hundred yeares; and these two also so weake and impertinent, as no waye they can subsist in the sense wherin he alleadgeth them. And herwithall in like manner, thou mayst pleas

And whether M. Attorney doe not follow the same spirit heere, in peeping forth with two little miserable mistaken instances, out of so great an army of plaine testimonyes to the contrary, you haue already seene, and out of your wisdome will easily iudge. The like or worse dealing will you find afterward, when we shall haue passed the Conquest, whervnto now we hasten, and for the euent I remit my self to the experience.
            
         
         
            OF THE KINGS AFTER THE CONQVEST VNTO OVR TYMES: And first of the Conquerour himself, whether he tooke spirituall iurisdiction vpon him, or no, by vertue of his Crowne, and temporall authority. CHAP. VII.
            HAVING pervsed what passed among our Kings before the Conquest, (to which pervse & veiw we were led by M. Attorneys induction of two instances of those dayes, as you haue seen) we are now to follow him also beneath the said Conquest, for tryall of our controversie, where albeit, as before I haue noted, the further wee goe from the origen of our English conuersion, and heate of that primitiue spirit of deuotion, that God gaue our Kings in those first ages of their said conuersion to Christian religion, the more coldnes we shall find in some cases, and more worldly and secular

Attorney and mee, about the acknowledgement of the Popes authority Ecclesiasticall, we shall find them in effect no lesse resolute, then the other, if you respect the substance of the thing it self, though in tendernesse of piety and deuotion, their different liues and courses (as after you shall se) be witnesses vnto vs of no small difference.
            2. And this is seen in none more then in K. VVilliam the first himself, the head & stocke of al the rest, who though in life & action, as a warryer and Conqueror, were rough, fierce, & boysterous, K. VVilliam boisterous, but truly Catholik. especially in the former years of his raigne ouer Englād, wherin vpō ielosy of his vnsetled state he did many things de facto which were not so iustifiable de Iure; for which Authors doe note, that he was greatly punished by God, both in himself & in his children and childrens children:

                yet in this point of true & substantiall obedience to the Church, when he was void of passion, and out of occasion of any cōstraining necessity, he all-wayes shewed himself dutifull, respectiue, & humble towards the said Church: according to his Oath taken at his Coronation before the Altar of S. Peter at VVestminster, se velle Sanctas Dei Ecclesias, ac rectores defendere (saith Florentius) that he would defend the holy Churches of God, and the gouernours therof, which to haue perfourmed he professed also at his death with teares, as Iohn Stow & more auncient writers then he, doe beare him witnes; & some are of opinion, that the long continuance of his line in the Crowne of England, considering how he entered, & how some of them haue gouerned after him, may principally be ascribed vnto this, that he would not take in hand the enterprice of England, but that first it should be consulted, and approued by the Sea Apostolike at at Rome, as presently you shall heare that it was, and for that himself so firmely relied vpon the same afterward, in all his greatest occasions, and recommended the same, especially to his sonnes on his death-bed, when he was free from these interests, which oftentimes before drew and wrested him to diuers actions, which in that last houre he approued not, but condemned and much bewayled.
            3. And of this later point many examples might be alleadged, both of much bloudshed in England, of spoiling and destroying the countrey, of casting downe many townes and Churches for



enlarging his hunting, of vexing and oppressing the English-nation, of ryfling and spoyling monasteryes and Churches, Boisterous actions of K. VVilliam. where the English had hidden some of their wealth to maintaine themselues withall, his detayning in prison all dayes of his life the Archbishop Stigand, and diuers other Bishops and Abbots, deposed in the Councell at VVinchester by Pope Alexander his legats, in the fourth yeare of his raigne, and of his brother Otho Bishop of Baion held in prison by him; albeit this, concerning Ecclesiasticall persons, he professed to doe by licence and commission of the Sea Apostolike: yet in truth the cheife cause was his owne vehement passion, and ielousie of his temporall estate; For I find a letter of Pope Gregory the seauenth, that succeeded Alexander the second, written vnto him vpon the yeare of Christ 1084. which was the 18. of K. VVilliams raigne, wherin the said Pope, though praising his religious zeale in other things (which he would neuer haue done, if he had byn opposite to his authority, and iurisdiction) yet doth he reprehend greatly this violent seuerity, towards Ecclesiasticall persons. 
                  Ex Registro. apud Bar. in Annal. anno. 1084. 
               One thing (saith he) among so many excellent monuments of your royall vertues, doth greatly mislike and afflict me, and contristate my louing heart towards you, that in the taking, and detayning prisoner your brother Otho Bishop of Baion, you had not that care which was conuenient of your Princely reputation, but did prefer the secular caution of your temporall state, before the law of God, in not bearing more reuerence vnto Priestly dignity. So he.
            4. And this very same violent nature of K. VVilliam, who had byn a souldiar, and borne armes, and brought vp in continuall bloud-shed, from eight years old (as himself testifieth) was that, which pious and learned Lanfranke (nominated & chosen Archbishop of Canterbury, after the deposition of the foresaid Stygand) did so much feare and mislike at his first comming into England; as may appeare by an epistle of his to Pope Alexander the second,

            5. So wrote the Archbishop Lanfrank. And that the most of this was meant in respect of difficulties with K. VVilliam himself, it may be gathered by that in the same letter, he desireth the Pope to pray for the said King VVilliam, and among other points, Vt cor eius ad amorem suum, & Sanctae Ecclesia spirituali semper deuotione compungat.

might seem to be an act of no very good Catholike man, & God stroke him for it presentlie) yet was not this of iudgement, Satisfaction. but of rage (to vse his owne word) and he sorely repented the same soone after, and sent a great summe of money (saith Stow) to the Cleargie of Meaux, 
               
                  Stovv ibid.
                that therby the Churches, which he had burned might be repayred.
            6. And the same might be shewed, by a like passionate accicident, that fell out on the 13. yeare of his raigne, and of Christ 1079. when hauing vpon ielousie of his estate, forbidden that anie of his Bishops should goe ouer the sea to Rome; Pope Gregorie the 7. wrote a sharpe reprehension therof, to be denounced vnto him, by Hubert his legat then residing in England, saying that it was, Irreuerentis & impudentis animi praesumptio &c. 
                  Greg. septimus lib. 7. epist. 1. the presumption of an irreuerent and immodest mind, to prohibite his Bishops to make recourse to the Sea Apostolike. A sharpe reprehension of Pope Gregory the 7. to the Conqueror. Ibidem. epist. 2

                  . Which reprehension made him so enter into himself, as he sent two Embassadours to Rome, in Company of the said Hubert when he returned to excuse the matter, and shewed himself afterward a most obedient, and faithfull child to the said Church, euen in that troublesome and tempestious time, when Henry the Emperour with all forces impugned the same, as appeareth by the letters, yet extant of the same Pope Gregorie vnto him.
            7. Wherfore hauing premissed this for K. VVilliam, and all his Successours, of the Norman, French & English race, in number aboue twentie, for the space well neere of 500. years, vntil K. Henry the 8. that whatsoeuer some particular actions of theirs vpon interest, anger, feare, preuention of imagined daungers, cōpetency, or some other such like motiue, may seeme to make doubtfull sometimes, and in some occasions, their iudgment or affection to the supreame Ecclesiasticall power and iurisdiction of the Sea Apostolike of Rome: yet were they indeed neuer of anie contrary opinion, faith, or iudgment; but held the very same in this point, which all their auncestors, the English Kings before the Conquest did, and all Christian Princes of the world besides in their dayes. And for K. VVilliam Conqueror in particular, the seueral reasons that doe ensue may easilie conuince the same.

                   he sent his whole cause to be considered of, examined, and iudged by Pope Alexander the second, shewing him the pretence he had by his affinity to K.

                   the perill of the Countrey by continuall warrs with the Danes and Scottes; the hurt of the Church by Harolds irreligious gouernment, but especially his contempt of the said Church & Sea Apostolike, in that he had taken the Crowne vpon him, saith Matthew VVestminster,

                     , quantis poterat facundiae verbis, allegabat. He did alleadge the equitie of his cause (vnto Pope Alexander) by all the force of eloquence that he could. Which Harold on the other side did omit (saith he) to doe, either that he was prowde by nature, or distrusted his owne cause; or for that he feared that his messengers might fall into VVilliam his hands, who had besett all the portes. Wherevpon Alexander the Pope, hauing weighed his reasons, sent vnto him a banner for the warre, in token of his consent, and Stow addeth these words. Stovv in the life of Harold. 
                  Duke VVilliam after he had got the victory sent his standard to the Pope, which was made after the shape and fashion of a man fighting, wrought by sumptuous art with gold and pretious stones. And further the said Stow, out of Malmesbury and Mathew VVestminster doth ad, that Duke VVilliam being arriued in England, and offering conditions of composition to Harold before the battaile, one was,



that he was content to stand to the iudgement of the Sea Apostolicke in that controuersie. All which, is likely he would neuer haue done, K. VVilliam offered to stād to the Popes iudgement for his Crovvne. if he had esteemed so little of the said Sea Apostolicke and authority therof, as M. Attorney doth; but rather would haue remitted the iustice of his cause to be examined & sentenced by the Emperour, or by some other tēporall tribunal. But he remitted it to the Sea Apostolicke, & it fell out wel for him, as you know.
               9. Secondly wheras K. VVilliam from his very first entrance had a desire to remoue Stigand from the Archbishoprick of Canterbury, partly perhaps for his demerits, and partly to haue a sure man in his place, that was not English, he dissembled the matter for three or foure yeares, and this, as some thinke, in regard that the same Stigand had byn a persuader to K. Edward the Confessor, to name Duke VVilliam for his Successor, for so the said Duke confesseth in his message sent to Harold before the battaile, as Stow relateth. But now vpon the year 1070. vnderstanding that Pope Alexander had cited to Rome certayne Archbishops of Germany, to wit that of Ments and Bamberge,

                        t. in Chron. anno 1076. Deposing of Stigand and other Bishops by authority of the Pope. to answere to certaine accusations laid against them of Simony, he thought good to take this occasion, to demaund also of the said Pope, iudgemēt against the foresaid Stigand and his brother Agelmare Bishop of the East-Angles, and certaine Abbots suspected of like crimes. Whervpon Pope Alexander sent three Cardinals into England for legats, one of them a Bishop, and the other two Priests, who gathering togeather a Synod at VVinchester, the forenamed persons were deposed by sentence of the said legats, wherof two returned to Rome, and one remained there: as both Malmesbury and other historiographers doe write. 
                     Malmesb. in vita Guliel. 1. Out of which case we doe inferre, that if K. VVilliam had thought his owne authority sufficient to haue depriued the foresaid Bishops, he would neuer haue sued to Rome for the matter, nor haue byn at the trouble and charge, to call from thence three Legats.
               10. As soone as Stigand was deposed, Lanfranke a most famous and learned Abbot of Normandy, was called for by K. VVilliam, and commaunded in the Popes name by the Legats, to accept the same (as before you haue heard) who obeying thervnto made afterward his recourse confidently to Rome, 
                  
                     In epist. Lanfranci apud Baronium in an. 1070. in all matters of importance that fell out, as namely in this very first yeare, he wrote a letter to Pope Alexander about a case concerning the Bishop of Lichfield in these words; Vniuersae Christi Ecclesiae summo Rectori Alexandro,



indignus Anglorum Archiepiscopus Lanfrancus, &c. Vnto Alexander the highest gouernour of the vniuersall Church of Christ, vnworthy Lanfranke Archbishop of English men, Lanfranke proposeth his doubts to the Pope. 
                  &c.
                  And proposing sundry busines & difficultyes vnto him, he saith among the rest; that in the forenamed Synod of VVinchester, the Bishop of Lichfield being cited thither, to answere to certaine crimes of incontinent life, layd and proued against him, and he refusing to appeare, was excommunicated and deposed by the said legates, & licence giuen to the King, to nominate another for that place. But afterward at the feast of Easter, he comming to the Court in tyme of Parlament, resigned vp his Bishopricke vnto the King that was sitting togeather with his Bishops and lay nobility. In which case, Ego tum nouus Anglus (saith he) rerumque Anglicarum, &c. I being but a new English man, and vnskillfull in English affaires, but what I learne of others, doe not presume, either to consecrate another Bishop in his place, nor yet to giue licence to other Bishops to consecrate any, quoadusque praeceptio vestra veniat, quae in tant

                         negotio quid oporte atfieri informare nos debeat; vntill your commaundment come, which in so great a busines must informe vs what we ought to doe.
So Lanfranke: who referreth these matters, as you see to the Pope, and not to the King (though he were the Kings fauorite) nor did he feare to iniure, or offend the King therby.
               11. And soone after this againe, to wit, the very next yeare following, which was the yeare of our Lord 1071. and 5. of K. VVilliams raigne, the said Lanfrancke, elected Bishop of Canterbury, & Thomas a Norman, chosen Bishop of Yorke, went both of them to Rome in person, to receiue their palls and confirmation, at the hands of Pope Alexander by K. VVilliams consent; The palls of Englād accustomed to be taken at Rome. albeit it was a very troublesome yeare in England, for that all the North-parte of England rebelled, to wit Edwyn Earle of Mercia, Morcar Earle of Northumberland, Eglewyne Bishop of Durham, the famous Captaine Sewardbran, & manie others; with whom ioyned the Scots & Danes against the Normans: and K. VVilliam had need of the presence of two such trustie chiefe men & principall Prelates, for staying the people at home. And therfore Embassadours were sent to obtaine, that their said palls might be sent to them into England. But it could not be obtained, for that Pope Alexander answered that it was an old custome, that Archbishops of England should come, & receiue their palls at Rome. And this answere was written to Lanfrancke

And also to heare againe, and define the cause of the Bishop of Chichester, deposed before by his legats. And finally he concludeth that he should beleiue Lanfranke; Vt nostrae dilectionis affectum plenius cognoscatis, & reliqua nostrae legationis verba attentius audiatis: that by him, you may more fully vnderstand the affection of our loue towards you, as also heare more attentiuely the rest of our legation committed vnto him, &c.

those dayes, but all conformity rather with the same.
               13. I might alleadge many other examples to this effect, as that which Stow writeth in the 17. yeare of the raigne of K. VVilliam and yeare of Christ 1083. 
                     Stovv an 1083. that VVilliam Bishop of Durham, by leaue of the King and nobles of the Realme, went to Rome, 
                  Charters frō Rome confirmed by the King. and obtained of Pope Gregory the 7. to bring the Monks from Tarrow and Yarmouth into the Cathedrall Church of Durham; where he gaue to them, lands, Churches, ornaments, &c. all which (saith he) K. VVilliam the Conqueror confirmed by his charter, in confirmation, no doubt, of the Popes Charter, which to procure he went to Rome, and he had licence thervnto from the King and nobles, that were sounders of that Church: which licence, they would neuer haue graunted if they had thought, that the matter had appertained only to the King at home in his owne countrey, and not to the Pope.
               14. And in the very same yeare K. VVilliam (as before we haue touched) being entred into great iealosie of the ambition, and aspiring mynd of his halfe-brother Otho Bishop of Baion & Earle of Kent least with his Councell and riches, he might assist his sonne Ro

                  15. This was one excuse vsed by the Conqueror. Another was, as Stow recordeth that he said, that wheras his brother was



both Bishops of Baion and Earle of Kent, he apprehended him as Earle of Kent, and not as Bishop of Baion, that is to say, as a lay-person, and not as an Ecclesiasticall. And yet further, when he was vrged about that matter by his owne Prelates, he was wont to say, (as Stow and others doe also note) that he did it by particular licence of the Pope, and not only by licence, but also by his decree and commaundement; and so he protested at his death. Wherby we see, how little opiniō he had of his owne spirituall iurisdiction in this behalfe.

Taking our beginning (saith he) from the lawes of our holy mother the Church, by which both King and Kingdome haue their sound fundament of subsisting, &c. And then followeth the first law with this title. De clericis & possessionibus corum. 
                  VVhat the peace of the church is. Of Clergie-men & their possessions: & the law it self is writen in these few words, but containing much substance. Omnis Clericus & etiam omnes Scholares, & omnes res & possessiones corum, vbicunque fuerint, pacem Dei & Sanctae Ecclesiae habeant.
                  Let euery Clergie-man, and all schollers, and all their goods and possessions whersoeuer they be, haue the peace of God, and of holy Church. And afterwards he declareth what this peace of the Church is, to wit, that neither their persons, nor their goods can be arested, molested, or made to pay tribute, or otherwise troubled by any secular iudge whatsoeuer.
               
               
                  17. And in the second law, which is intituled. De temporibus & diabus pacis Domini Regis. Of the times and daies of peace, and freedome of our Lord the King; he doth explicate that it belongeth to the King and his officers, to see these liberties of Ecclesiasticall peace, franquises, and freedome, be exactlie obserued to Ecclesiasticall persons, & especiallie to punish them double, which refuse to put in execution the Bishops sentence of iustice.

If anie man shall doe anie hurt to him (that hath the peace of the Church) let the Bishop doe him Iustice; but if anie man will bee arrogant & not make amends, according to the sentence of iustice giuen by the Bishop, let the Bishop make it knowne to the King (or his Courts) and the King shall constraine the malefactor, to make amends to him, vnto whom hee did the hurte, to wit, first vnto the Bishop, and then to the King, and so there shall bee two swords against malefactors, and the one sword shall help the other. And heere let be considered, what he saith of two swords, one in the Bishops hand, and the other in the Kings; and that this must assist that of the Bishops, as the principall & superiour; Tvvo svvordes the one subordinate to the other. which is conforme to the speach of K. Edgar (if you remember) whereof we made mention in the former Chapter and last demonstration therof. Wherby is made euident, that these auncient Kings beleeued not to any haue spirituall sword or authoritie, by right of their Crowns, but onlie the temporall to command & punish in temporall affaires, and to help and assist the others in causes belonging vnto them.
               18. The third law hath this Title. De Iustitia Sanctae Ecclesiae. Of the iustice of the holy Church and prerogatiue therof, which she is to receiue in temporall tribunals. In which law is determined in these words. Vbicunque Regis iustitia, vel cuiuscunque sit, placita tenuerit, si vllus Episcopus venerit illuc, & aperuerit causam Sanctae Ecclesiae, ipsa prius terminetur: Iustitia enim est, vt Deus vbique prae caeteris honoretur.

                  rsoeuer the Kings Iustice, or the Iustice of what other Lord soeuer, shall hold pleas (or keep courts) if any Bishop come thither, and open a cause of the holy Church, let that cause of all other be first determined: for it is iust that God be honoured



euery where before all other. Marke his reason, why the expedition of the Bishops cause, is to be preferred before that of the King; for that he holdeth the place of God, and thereafter must be respected.
               19. The fourth law hath this Title: De vniuersis tenentibus de Ecclesia. Of the priuiledges of all those that are any way tenants of the Church. Tenant
                        •
                      of the Church priuiledged. And then it followeth in the law. Quicunque de Ecclesia aliquid tenuerit, vel in fundo Ecclesiae mansionem habuerit, extra curiam Ecclesiasticam coactus, non placitabit, quamuis foris fecerit, nisi (quod absit) in Curia Ecclesiastica rectum defecerit. Whosoeuer doth hold any thing of the Church, or hath his mansion-house within the land of the Church, shall not be constrained to plead any matter of his, though he bee a malefactor, out of the spirituall courte, except (which God forbid) iustice could not be had in the said Ecclesiasticall court.
               20. These are the first lawes of all, that were made by King VVilliam, 
                  Diuer
                        •
                      other lavves. and after these doe ensue fiue more to the same effect of Churches priuiledges; wherof the first hath this Title. De reis ad Ecclesiam fugientibus. 
                  Sāctuary. Of malefactors, that fly to the Church, how they are to haue Sanctuary and protection. The second. Breakers of Priuiledges. 
                  De fractione pacis Ecclesiae. Of breaking the peace of the Church, that is to say of her priuiledges: the breakers wherof are appointed to be sharply punished, first by the Bishop, & then by the King, if he be arrogant. The third. De decimis Ecclesiae maioribus. Of the greater tythes belonging to the Church. Tythes. The fourth. De minut is decimis. Of lesser tythes; all which are commaunded to be payed exactly. And finally the fifth law, which is the tenth in order, hath this Title. De denario S. Petri, qui Anglicè dicitur Rome-scot. Of Peter-pence, Peterpēce. called in old English Rome-scot: wherin is appointed the order, how the said Peter-pence shall be gathered and made ready against the feast of S. Peter and S. Paul, or at the furthest, against the feast of S. Peters Chaines, as we haue seen also before ordeined by the law of K. Kanutus. By all which is vnderstood, and much to be considered, that neither K. VVilliam, nor any of his auncestors tooke vpon them to make any Ecclesiasticall law at all of spirituall matters, as of their owne; but only did second, and strenthen, and confirme the lawes of the Church, by their temporall lawes, by defending the same, and punishing the breakers therof. Which is a far different thing from the Ecclesiasticall power, which M. Attorney will needs haue vs beleeue to haue



byn in the auncient Kings of England, according to the meaning of the auncient Common-lawes therof, but produceth none. And I persuade my self, he will hardly alleadge me any so auncient as these, though he haue studied them, as he saith 35. years: but fiue hundred more were necessary to find out that which he affirmeth. And thus much of lawes for the present.
               21. There remaineth only one argument more, concerning K. VVilliam, which is the time of his death, and of what sense and iudgment he was in this point at that time, when commonly men doe se more cleerly the truth of matters (especially Princes) then before in their life, health, and prosperity, when passion, honour, or interest may oftentimes either blind, or byasse them. And albeit of K. VVilliam diuers ancient writers doe recorde, that notwithstanding in his anger, vnto secular men he was fierce & terrible; The Conquerors humility tovvards his Archbishop. yet vnto Ecclesiasticall persons, he bare still great respect, wherof among others, this example is recorded by Nubergensis, that when at a certaine time Archbishop Aldred of Yorke, that had crowned him, and was much reuerenced by him while he liued,

                         Anght. l. 1. c. 1 intreating him for a certaine pious worke, and not preuailing, turned his back and went away with shew of displeasure; the Conquerour tooke hold of him, and fell downe at his feet, promising to doe what he would haue him: and when the Nobles that stood round about, began to cry to the Arch-bishop, that he should take vp the King quickly from his knees, he answered let him alone, he doth but honour the feet, of S. Peter, in kneeling at myne. Which well declareth (saith Nubergensis) both what great reuerence, this fierce and warlike Prince did beare vnto this Prelate, as also how singular authority and confidence the good Archbishop had with him.
               22. But (as we haue said) his true sense & meaning will best be sene by owne his words & behauiour at his death when finding himself in great affliction and perplexity of mynd, with the

therof, that those things that had byn heaped vp by wicked deeds, The Conquerours last speech of his deuotiō tovvards the Church. might be disposed to holy vses of Saincts. And then turning his speach to Ecclesiasticall men he said; You remember how sweetly I haue euer loued you, and how strongly against all emulations defended you.
The Church of God which is our mother, I neuer violated, but in euery place (where reason required) did willingly honour; I haue not sold Ecclesiasticall dignityes, and Symony I allwayes detested; in the election of Pastors, I euer searched out the merits of his life, his learning and wisdome; and so neer as I could, committed the gouernment of the Church vnto the most worthy; this may be seen in Lanfranke Archbishop of Canterbury, and in Anselme Abbot of Becke, and others, &c. This course haue I followed from my first years; this I leaue vnto my heirs to be kept in all tymes; In this doe you (my Children) euer follow me, to the end that heerby you may please both God and man, &c.
                  
               
               23. And this was the last speach of the Conquerour to his children, and others standing by at the day of his death, which doth sufficiently declare, what his sense & iudgement was concerning this point of spirituall iurisdiction. And to impugne and ouerthrow all this our aduersary the Attorney had need to bring many and strong batterings, as you see. Let vs passe then to examine what they are.

                  25. This is the only one argument or instance, as hath bene said, which M. Attorney hath found in all the life of K. VVilliam the first, wherby to proue his principall Conclusion, which is, that K. VVilliam had as much Ecclesiasticall power and iurisdiction, by the auncient common lawes of England, as euer had Queene Elizabeth, and she as much, as euer anie Ecclesiasticall person had, or might haue in Englād. And yet you se, that if al were graū
                     ted, which heere is set downe, M. Attorneyes Instance of no force. it amounteth to no more, but that K. VVilliam did bestow a benefice with Cure, vpon an Ecclesiasticall person: which he might doe, either by nominating or presenting, as patrone of the benefice; or by some indult from the Pope, or Bishop of the diocesse in that behalfe; or vnder ratihabition (as before in Charters hath been declared) or finallie he might doe it De facto and not De Iure, as oftentimes it falleth out in such actions of Princes. And in all these senses, though we graunt whatsoeuer M. Attorney saith & setteth downe in this place, it commeth so far short to proue supreame Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction in K. VVilliam, as it proueth not anie spirituall iurisdiction at all; for that all he saith may be grauuted in any layman whatsoeuer: which wee shall endeauour to make cleere by explication and distinction of those things, which heere are set downe confusedly by M. Attorney.
                  
                  26. First then this instance consisteth of a Syllogisme, as you see; the Maior wherof is related out of the collection of some law booke, as may appeere by his quotation in the margent, though I haue not the booke by me: and we graunt the proposition to be true in his due sense, to wit, that no man can appropriate a Church or benefice with Cure, to an Ecclesiasticall man, but he that hath Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction. 
                     Povver vvaies by vvhich a lay man may Confer benefices. And then, we deny the Minor proposition, which

                      of M. Attorneys owne addition, to wit, that K. VVilliam did so appropriate, or bestow any benefice with Cure, vpon an Ecclesiasticall person, except it were in one of the fower manners before specified. And M. Attorney ought to haue proued his said Minor, if he had delt substantially.
                  27. And moreouer I find that he faltereth somewhat also 
                        〈◊〉
                     


                     
setting downe the very words of his Maior proposition, though much more in the true sense, as presently shall be declared. For wheras he beginneth.

                        It is agreed that no man can make any appropriation, &c. the latin words of this Report cited by himself are: Inter omnes conuenit, quod nemo possit appropriare, &c. which haue this sense: that it is a common receiued opinion (to wit from the Canon-law) that no man can appropriate, or bestow a Church with Cure, except he haue Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction. But M. Attorney by shutting out the word inter omnes, and translating the rest, it is agreed, would make his reader thinke, that it was an agreement or resolution only of the temporall Iudges in this case, in K. Edward the 3. his raigne, and that they first founded this Maxime about Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, wheras they related it only, as an auncient Maxime receaued in the Canon and Ciuill law, in this sense which presently we shall declare.
                  
                  28. And wheras he translateth the word appropriare Ecclesiam Ecclesiasticae personae. To make appropriation of any Church to an Ecclesiasticall person; this may haue two senses, & be meant either of appropriations, or collations of benefices, wherin there is little difference in respect of our controuersie; for that neither appropriation, nor collation can be truly and properly made, without spirituall iurisdiction, either ordinary or delegate. And as for appropriations, which consisted cōmonly in this, that the gleab-lands, and the better tithes were vnited to some religious houses, or Parsons, leauing the lesser tithes vnto their Vicars, Appropriation of Benefices. they could not be made nor graunted, but by the licence of the Sea Apostolicke; as neither in our daies they can, in Catholike countries; & vpō this pretence of a greater good to ensue therby vnto the Church and Countrey, where they are graunted: and consequently if K. VVilliam in his dayes, 
                        Sup. cap. 6. Demon. 4. did make any such appropriatiōs in this sense, it is to be vnderstood that the same was first allowed by the Sea Apostolicke, as before we haue shewed in the examples of Charters, for buylding & establishing of Churches, monasteryes, and other pious workes. And the same may be gathered also out of the Ordinances made about the said appropriations afterward in the 15. yeare of K. Richard the second, and 4. of K. Henry the fourth by Parlament, wherin the Bishops did fit as cheife in these affaires.
                  29. Collations also of benefices require spirituall power and iurisdiction in him, Collations of benefices, that doth giue or confer the same; though



in this there may be diuers degrees, which are declared 
                        〈…〉
                      Canon-law. And M. Attorney being so eminent in the common-law, ought not alltogeather to haue omitted them. For first, wheras the word Benefice, or Church with Cure, or Parish (for all these are vsed oftentimes for the same) doth comprehend as well a Bishopricke, as a lower benefice; if M. Attorney will vnderstand it heere of the former, that is to say, that no man can appropriate, or bestow a Bishoprick vpon any person, but he that hath Ecclesiastical iurisdiction, he must remember (if before he knew it) that three things doe concurre in making of a Bishop by diuine and Canon-law, 
                        Cap. Intet, & cap. Licet, extrau. de trāslat. epise. & extrau de electione, cap. Cum in cunctis. to wit Election, Confirmation, and Consecration, as may be seen by the places therof heere quoted in the margent, not to trouble the text therewith to vnskillfull Readers.
                  30. And albeit the first, to wit Election, 
                     
                        Extrau. de elect. cap. postquam & cap. Intet Canonicos. & cap. Scriptum est. when it is iustly made, doe giue right to the elected, to pretend the second and third, that is, confirmation and consecration, nor can they be denyed vnto him without iniury, except vpon iust cause, as the same law saith: yet can he not vpon his only Election, exercise any part of his office of a Bishop, either in iurisdiction or order. But when he hath the second parte, which is confirmation and induction to the benefice, which is properly called inuestiture; then hath he iurisdiction vpon those people, and may exercise the Acts therof by visiting, 
                        Ex capite, qualiter extrau. de elect. punishing, or the like; but not the Acts of Order, vntill he haue consecration also, that is to say, he cannot make Priests, nor administer the sacrament of confirmation, nor doe other such actions, as are peculiar to Episcopall Order.
                  
                  31. Now for these three things, the first (which is election or nomination) may be perfourmed by any Prince or lay-man, that hath lawfull authority therevnto, which diuers wayes he may haue, as after shallbe shewed; either by Ius patronatus of the benefice, or prerogatiue graunted him by the Church. The second which is confirmation and giuing of iurisdiction, Election confirmetion and consecration of a Bishop by vvhomel must only proceed from him that is the fountaine of all spirituall iurisdiction vnder Christ (which is the Bishop of Rome) or some Metropolitan or Bishop vnder him, that hath authority and commission from him. The third which is consecration, must be done according to the Canon-law, by three Bishops at the least. And by this also may wee vnderstand, what is necessary for the appropriating or conferring of any lower Benefice with Cure to an ordinary Priest, to wit, the two first, election or presentation, which may be done by



a secular man and confirmation or inuestiture, which allwayes must come, as hath byn said, either from the Sea Apostolicke, or some Bishop authorized vnder him; for that it giueth spirituall power and iurisdiction ouer soules, which no man can doe, but he that hath it in himself, & no man can haue it, but he that receaued it from those that had it immediatly from Christ, to wit S. Peter & the rest of the Apostles and their Successors, Gouernours of the Church, as before in the second Chapter of this Answere we haue declared.
                  32. And yet further it is to be noted, for more cleernes and distinction, that the first of these three to wit Election, is of foure distinct sortes in the Canon-law. The one called election properly or choise, by suffrages and voyces of such as haue to choose. 
                        Extrau. de postula one prelatorum, cap. pennl.
                      The second is termed Postulation, when one is offred that is not altogeather capable of the benefice, but hath need of dispensation. The third is called presentation, when he that is patron, 
                        Cap. vlt. extrau. de Iure patronatus. or hath the aduouson of any benefice, presenteth one by right of that Ius patronatus, the right of patronage. The fourth is called nomination, which hath diuers curious differences noted in the law, ouer long heer to be discussed.

But this is sufficient for our purpose, that all these foure wayes doe comprehend but only the first degree of appropriating a benefice to any incumbent. And albeit originally they doe all foure appertaine to Ecclesiasticall power, for that they concerne an Ecclesiasticall thinge; yet for many ages haue they byn imparted also by authority and commissiō of the Sea Apostolicke, or by right of patronage, to secular lay-men, both Princes and others: I meane to choose, postulate, present, and nominate fit persons, both for Bishops and Pastors. And this we see in vse now for many ages in all Catholike Countreys throughout Christendome; especially concerning Bishopricks, and greatest dignityes Ecclesiasticall. But yet no Prince taketh that authority, as descending from his Crowne, but as by commission, graunt, or indult of the Sea Apostolicke, which they hold to be the fountaine of all spirituall authority and iurisdiction.
                  33. All which being well vnderstood, it is easy to distinguish, and therby euacuate the argument of M. Attorney in this place: which is a plaine Sophisme, and deceitfull Syllogisme, hauing one sense in the Maior, & another in the minor. For if in the maior proposition, wherin he saith out of the Reporte of his law, that no



man can appropriate an ecclesiasticall benefice with Cure, but he that hath sp
                           •
                        
                        rituall iurisdiction. If he vnderstand (I say) the first degree only, which is to choose, postulate, present, or nominate; then the said maior is false, for that lay-men may doe it also by commission (as before we haue said) and then doe we graunt his minor proposition, that K. VVilliam did, or might so appropriate. But if he vnderstand in the second or third degree of confirmation and consecration of Bishops; then is the maior true, & the minor false. And so M. Attorneys syllogisme euery way is found faulty and guylfull, nor worthy of his place and credit.
                  34. And yet will I add one thing more for conclusion of this matter, which is, that as diuers secular Princes in former ages, and in ours also, haue had the first degree of approprition (as hath been declared, to wit, to nominate fit persons; so haue diuerse pretended, as well in our Countries as elswhere, to haue, in a certaine manner, the second from the Sea Apostolicke, that is to say, to giue the inuestitures in Bishopricks, Abbyes, and other chiefe benefices Per annuium & baculum, that is, by giuing them a ring & a staffe, Inuestitures desired by Princes but denyed by Popes. which are the ordinarie signes and markes of taking possession of their iurisdiction: which though the said Princes doe acknowledge, to bee a spirituall Act, and consequently not possible to descend from the right of their temporall Crowne (as M. Attorney would haue it) yet desired they to inioy it by Commission from the Sea Apostolicke, in respect of their greater authoritie amonge their Subiects, and for more breuitie of prouiding, and establishing incumbentes, when benefices of cure fell voide, and for other such reasons: wherof we may read in the liues of diuers of our Kings. And namelie of King Henrie the first this Conquerour his sonne, what earnest suite he made, to haue these inuestitures graunted him, which the Pope did flattly deny to doe; yea and the greatest causes of that wonderfull breach between the Popes Alexander the 2. and Gregorie the 7. and others of that age, with the Emperour Henrie and his Successours, were by the occasion of these inuestitures, which the said Popes would not graunt.

Albeit I find some ages after, that the great and famous Lawyer Baldus aboue two hundred years gone, recordeth that in his tyme, two Kings only had these priuiledges, graunted them from the Sea Apostolicke; The King of England to wit, and the King of Hungary, which perhaps was in regard that their Kingdomes lay so far of, as it might be preiudiciall to



their Churches, to expect allwayes the said Inuestitures from Rome; But yet he expresly saith, that it was by Commission and delegation of the Pope. Papa (saith he) committit spiritualia etiam mero laico, & ideo Rex Anglorum, & rex Hungaria conferunt in suis Reguis Praebendas ex priuilegio Papa. The pope may commit spirituall things to a meere lay-man (and this he proueth by diuers texts of law) and hence it is, that the King of England,

Wherby we vnderstand, that in Baldus his time, it was held for a pecular priuiledge of these two Kings, which fithence hath byn communicated to diuers other Christian Princes, who doe vse and exercise the same at this day; but yet none pretending it, as from the right of their Crownes. For they neuer pretended to giue benefice or Bishopricke, by their owne Kingly authority, but only to present and commend fit persons vnto the Sea Apostolicke, to be admitted and inuested therby, as all other Catholicke Princes at this day doe vse: yea, and that this right of presentation also, they tooke not, but by concession and approbation also of the foresaid Sea Apostolicke, as by the former examples may appeere.
                  35. And this is so much as I thinke cōuenient to saie in this place to M. Attorneys silly instance, and I haue been the longer theraout, for that this K. VVilliam is the head and roote of al the Kings following: and this which hath been answered to this obiection will giue much light to all other instances, that are to ensue. And if anie King should haue taken anie other course from this, established by the Conquerour (their head and origen) which yet none euer in any substantiall point did vntill King Henry the 8. you may see by all this discourse that the Conquerour might say of them, as S.

VVilliam Rufus a good King for a time. at the beginning of his raigne, as all our historiographers doe testifie, that is to say, so long as Archbishop Lanfranke liued, to whom he bare singular respect, loue and reuerence: but the said Archbishop deceasing in the second yeare of his raigne (which was about the 20. of his age) the young man, as thinking himself free from all respect to God or man, brake into those extreame disorders of life, which our historyes doe recount.
            2. And among others, or rather aboue others, in oppressing the Church, holding Bishopricks & Abbies in his hands, as they fell void, and not bestowing them afterward, but for bribes and Simony: And namely the Archbishopricke of Canterbury he held foure years in his hand after the death of Lanfranke, vntil at length falling greiuously sicke in the Citty of Glocester, and fearing to dy, made many promises of amending his life: as namely (saith Florentius) Ecclesias non amplius vendere, nec ad censum ponere, sed illas Regia tueri potestate, irrectas leges destruere, & rectas statuere Deo promisit.

And heervpon presently to begin withall, he nominated to the Archbishopricke of Canterbury, a great and worthy learned man named Anselmus Abbot of the monastery of Becke in Normandy who was then present in England; for that some moneth or two before, he bad byn intreated by the Earle of Chester Syr Hugh Lupus,

But this vnfortunate King was no sooner recouered (say the same Authours) but he repented himself sorely, that he had not solde the said Archbishopricke with other for more money; and therevpon tooke an occasion to picke a quarrell against the said Anselmus, and among other things, to let him, that he could not doe his office;

                   as all Archbishops of Canterbury were accustomed to doe, and the other greatly vrged to haue licence: But after a long combat, which he had had with the King & diuers other Bishops, that followed the Kings fauour, in a Synod at London vpō the third weeke in lent Anno Domini 1095. and eight yeare of King VVilliam his raigne, the said Archbishop being extreamly baited by the King & his followers, stood constant in his appeale to Rome.
               
            
            4. Which thing Rufus perceiuing (saith Malmesbury) he sent secretly certaine messengers to Rome, to intreat the Pope (which then was Vrban the second) to send the Pall of Canterbury vnto the King, to be giuen to whom he would.
Whervnto though the Pope would not yeeld; yet he sent back with his messengers for Legate, the Bishop of Albanum named VValta, with the said Pall, who shewed vnto the King so many reasons, why the Pope could not yeeld to his demaund, and intreated him so forceably to be content, that he might giue the said Pall from the Pope to Anselme with accustomed ceremonyes in the Church of Canterbury, 
               S. Anselm his pall brought him from Rome by the Popes Legat. as at length he obteyned the same, and made them freinds.
            5. But this frendship lasted not longe, for that the very next yeare after, the King continued his old manner of oppressing the Church.

                  S. Anselme went vnto him to VVinchester, and there first by intercessors, desired the King that he might haue licence to goe to Rome to conferr diuers difficultyes of his with Vrban the Pope. The King answered, that he would not giue him licence, for that he knew him to haue no such great sinnes, that it was needfull for him to goe to Rome for absolution; nor yet to be lesse learned then Pope Vrban, whose counsaile & direction he would aske.

And thervpon he concluded, that this licence could not be denyed him by a Christian King, and consequently he would goe. The King said he should carry out nothing with him. The Archbishop answered, he would goe naked and bare-foote. Which firme resolution the King perceiuing to be in him, vsed by messengers vnto him diuers intreatyes (saith VValsingham) and offered large promises of fauours

But the other would not, but departed the Realme, though he were searched and rifled by the Kings Officers at the port.
            6. By all which story it most euidently appeareth, that albeit this young disorderly and passionate King, were as well in this, as in other matters, headstronge and violent in pursuing his appetites & desires, as well in Ecclesiasticall, as Temporall affaires: yet did he neuer deny the Popes spirituall iurisdiction in England, but rather acknowledged the same, in sending to Rome to intreat that the pall might be sent to him, as also in going about to diuert S. Anselms recourse thither. But (alas) there passed not many years, but God punished seuerely these greiuous sinnes against his Church: For as both the foresaid Malmesbury & Edmerus that liued with him doe write, S. Anselms going to Rome & frō thence with Pope Vrban to a Councell of Bishops gathered togeather at Bary in Apulia, wherin among other things, all lay-men were excommunicated, that presumed to giue Ecclesiasticall Inuestitures, as also those that receiued them at lay-mens hands, which was thought principally to haue byn done in respect of King VVilliam; he returned againe some years after into France, and there passing his banishment with great quietnes of mind, he being one day with S. Hugh Abbot of Cluniaecke, 
               The pitifull death of K. Rufus.
                famous in those dayes for holines, the said Abbot told him in the hearing of diuers others, that the night before, he had seen King VVilliam called before God, and receiued the sorrowfull sentence of damnation; wherat all the hearers marueyling, the next newes they heard from England, was, that the said King was strangely slaine by an erring arrow of his familiar seruant Tyrrell, while he hunted in the New-forrest, and that being stroken, he fell downe dead without speaking any one word. And the same authors doe recount diuers other the like presages and prognostications, that happened as well to the King himself, as to other friends of his in England, portending this euent, but neglected by him.
            7. And this shall suffice for King VVilliam Rufus, who raigned thirteen years. And though he was naught to all kind of men, (saith Malmesbury) and pernicious in his actions, as well to secular as Clergy men; yet had he no other iudgement in matters of religion, then his father or auncestors; nor euer was he noted of any least difference therin: Nor doth Maister Attorney bring any instance at all out of this Kings Raigne: and therfore shall



wee passe to his younger brother that ensued him in the Kingdome.
            
               OF KING HENRY THE FIRST, VVhich was the third King after the Conquest. §. I.
                
                  K. Henry the first began his raigne an. 1100 and raigned 25 years vnto 1135.8. This was the third sonne of VVilliam the great surnamed the Conquerour, who finding the commodity by absence of his eldest brother Robert Duke of Normandy, tooke the Kingdome of England vpon him, hauing gained by faire promises, the good-wills of all or most of the Realme, and so was crowned by Maurice Bishop of London, for that S. Anselm Archbishop of Canterbury. was yet in exile, as before vnder Rufus you haue heard.
               9. What the said Henry did sweare and promise, and what he began, euen from the very day of his Coronation, to put in practice, Florentius that then liued, declareth in these words: Consecrationis suae die Sanctam Dei Ecclesiam, &c. 
                  
                     Florent, in Chron. an. 1100.
                  From the very day of his consecration, he set free the holy Church of God, which in his brothers dayes had byn sold and let to farme; The good beginning of K. Henry the first. he tooke away all euill customes, and remoued all vniust exactions, wherby the Kingdome had byn wrongfully oppressed before, & commaunded, that peace and freedome should be holden throughout the whole Realme. He restored the law of S. Edward to all men in common, with those additions or corrections which his Father had added thervnto, &c.
So Florentius. And what his Fathers additions were, and how greatly in fauour of the Church, and of Ecclesiasticall power, authority and libertyes, you haue heard before in his life and lawes. Wherby we may easily ghesse with what mind and iudgement this man entered vnto his crowne.
               10. And albeit in this point he neuer altered; yet there passed not two years of his gouernment, but partely vpon Kingly appetite to haue power in all things; and partly also by incitation of flatterers, that seeke to feed & nourish Princes humours in that behalfe; he began to lay his hands vpon Inuestitures of Bishops,



by giuing them Annalum & baculum for their induction to their benefices; saying that his Father and Brother before him, had vsed and exercised the same. But S. Anselme Archbishop of Canterbury newly retourned into England with other Bishops, opposed himself against the same, as a thing vnlawfull, and condemned by the Canons of the Church; and namely in the late Councell of Bary, where himself was present: (as before hath byn shewed) and this contention grew to be so stronge, as the next yeare after, being the third of K. Henryes raigne, the said holy man was forced againe to appeale to Rome to Pope Pascalis, and thervpon to leaue the land, and once more to goe into Banishment,

                   where he liued three years, going and returning often from Lions to Rome, (say Malmesbury, Florentius, and Houeden) about this matter. And the first of these three doth set downe diuers epistles of Pope Pascalis, both to Anselme the Archbishop, and to K. Henrie himself, wherin he telleth him first, why he could not graunt vnto him the authority of inuesting Bishops, which by his letters sent by Clarke VVilliam he had demaunded saying: Graue nobis est, quia id à nobis videris expetere, quod omnino praestare non possumus, &c. 
                  Pope Pascalis his letter to K. Henry the first. It greiueth vs much that you seeme to demaund at our hands, that which no wayes we can graunt; for if we should consent, or suffer inuestitures to be made by your Excellency, it would turne (no doubt) to the exceeding great daunger, both of you, and me before God, &c. Secondly he exhorteth him earnestly to admit S. Anselme to his Bishopricke and fauour againe. Prospice (fili Charissime) vtrum dedecus an decus tibi sit, quod sapientissimus & religiosissimus Episcopus Anselmus, propter hoc, tuo lateri adharere, tuo veretur in Reguo consistere. Qui tanta de te bonae hactenus audierant, quid de te sentiant, quid lequentur? &c. 
                  
                     Malmesb. li. 5. annal in vit. Hen. 1. Consider (my most deere child) whether this be an honour or dishonour vnto you, that so wise and religious a Bishop as Anselmus is, should feare for this cause to liue with you or to remaine in your Kingdome. What will men thinke or say of you, who hitherto haue heard so great good of your proceedings? Thus he, and much more (which for breuity I omit) from his pallace of Lateran vpon the 9. day before the Kalends of December.
               
               11. But not long after, to wit vpon the yeare 1106. which was the sixt of K. Henryes raigne, he being in some difficultyes in Normandy in respect of the warrs he had there against Duke Robert his brother, and many great men that tooke his parte, and perceiuing

All these things, (I say) being laid togeather, & God mouing his heart to turne to him for remedy, he thought best to goe to the monastery of Becke in Normandy, where Anselme remayned in continuall fasting and praying for his amendment. S. Anselm and the King reconciled. And there agreeing with him to stand no more in these matters of Inuestitures, or any other spirituall iurisdiction, he willed him to returne securely into England, to pray for him in his Archbishopricke, and so he did.
               12. And this being vpon the Assumption of our B. Lady to wit the 15. of August, the K. confident now of Gods fauour, as it seemeth vpon this agreement, gathered presentlie an armie against his enemies, & vpon the vigil of S.

And vpon this, he calling togeather vpon the first of August and 7. yeare of his raigne, all his Lords, both spirituall and temporal, consulted for three daies togeather with them, not admitting S. Anselme to that consultation, least his authoritie might seeme to haue ouer-borne the matter, what it was best to doe in that case of inuestitures, which he had before vsed; albeit diuers (saith Florentius) did exhorte him not to obey the Pope in this, but to retaine the vse, which both his Father and brother had practised, yet others alleadging the Censures both of Pope Vrbanus and Pascalis against the same, and that they left vnto the King all other priuiledges and regalityes: the King on the 4. day causing Anselmus to be present: Flo

The King with his Counsell did decree for that time forward; that no man in England should be inuested of any Bishopricke or Abbey, by the King, or by any lay mans hand or power, with giuing him the pastoral staffe or ring, as sometymes had byn accustomed. And this was done in obedience of the Canonicall constitution made in the Councell of Bary, against such inuestitures, as we haue declared.
               14. Aud thus was that controuersie ended, which was the only controuersie of importance, that this K. Henry had with the Sea of Rome during the tyme of his raigne,

Hen. 1. l. 3. which Malmesbury then liuinge, recounted as done of conscience saying; Inuestituras Ecclesiarum, post multas controuersias inter eum & Anselmum, Deo & & Sancto Petro remisit. Hee did release againe to God and to S. Peter, the Inuestitures of Churches after many controuersies had there about with Anselmus. 
                  Hovv K. Henry of cōscience resigned inuestitures. Which he did perfourme so syncerely from his heart, as afterward Anselme being dead, and he marrying his only daughter Maude to the Emperour Henry the 5. vpon the yeare 1114. he seemeth to haue induced his sonne-in-law the Emperour to remit also the said inuestitures to Pope Calixtus, for which his Father and grand-father had held so longe and scandalous broyles with the precedent Popes; yea and himself also, that is to say this Emperour Henry, not long before going to Rome with a mayne army, had taken prisoner, and held for certayne dayes Pope Paescalis that sate before Calixtus, therby to force him to graunt and confirme the said Inuestitures, which now vpon a better mynd he gaue ouer againe. For this I find recorded by Malmesbury and others of that time; that Calixtus being made Pope vpon the yeare 1119. and presently comming into France, and calling a Councell at Rhemes, K. Henry of England sent diuers Bishops at his commaundement vnto that Councell. And the next yeare after going to treat with the said Pope in person, at his Castell of Gesorse in Normandy: Acta sunt multae inter illos, &c. many things were treated between them (saith Houeden) as it was conuenient in the meeting of so great personages.

               16. And thus was ended that fierce and bloudy controuersie; that had lasted and troubled the whole Christian world aboue fifty yeares (saith Malmesbury) about the vse of Inuestitures, pretended by princes to be graunted vnto them and their auncestours by different Popes: But yet neuer challenged the same as incident to their Crowne or temporall iurisdiction, but as a priuiledge graunted by the Sea Apostolike, which might lawfully be done, as you haue heard by the former rule of Baldus the Lawyer, that the Pope may commit spirituall things, by priuiledge, in some cases, as the is, to a mere lay-man. And yet further if we seek the beginning of these inuestitures, how, and when, and to whome they were first graunted; we shall find the matter very vncertaine.

But howsoeuer this were, yet is it manifest heerby, that as well those princes which violently tooke these inuestitures vpon them, as others that might haue them perhaps graunted for a tyme; both of them (I say) did pretend to haue them from the Sea Apostolike, and therin acknowledged the Primacy and Supremacy of Ecclesiasticall power to be in that Sea, and not in themselues: Which is wholy against M.

               18. And now consider (good Reader) that if so great & potent an enemy of the Church of Rome, was so desirous to haue her graunt (albeit perforce) of such little peeces and raggs of Ecclesiasticall authority, as these were: how much more glad would he haue byn, to haue had all the Popes authority acknowledged to be in himself, if he could haue deriued it from the Title of his Crowne and Empire, A consideration of much moment. as Syr Edward Cooke would haue taught him, if he had byn his Attorney: and how easily might he haue procured such a Statute to haue byn made vnto him, by his people in Parlament, as was made vnto Queen Elizabeth, to giue her all supreame authority Ecclesiasticall, that euer any person had, or might haue, if he had listed, or if he had thought it had byn worth the procurement. And surely it had bin a much more

                   to haue gone to Rome with so mayne an army and extraordinary charges, labour, and daunger, as he did, to extort the same from the Pope; and yet not all his authority, but a small peece therof, as hath byn said.
               19. But now all was amended and accommodated againe, & as well the Emperour, as his Father-in-law K. Henry yelded vp all their pretended right in those inuestitures, as you haue heard. And as in the procuring and retaining them, by what manner soeuer, they acknowledged the spirituall power of the Sea of Rome; so much more in rendring them vp againe. And for so much, as both their acts are presumed principally to haue proceeded of our K. Henry, all men may therby see his deuotion to that Sea.
               20. And this deuotion and obedience he continued from that tyme forward vnto his death, which was some 15. years: in all which time I might shew diuers euident argumēts of this point, as of his often sending to Rome speciall Embassadours, the particular confidence that sundrie Popes had with him (as may appeare by their letters vnto him) his sending to Rome vpon the yeare 1123. VVilliam newlie elected Archbishop of Canterbury and Thurstyn of Yorke, to receiue their confirmation, and palls there, for more honour and deuotion of the place and Sea;

(in which yeare the foresaid Emperour Henry died, that had kept so much stir about inuestitures) there was a Synod celebrated in the Church of VVestminster, by order of Pope Honorius, his legat Cardinall Iohannes de Crema being present & President therof, wherin diuers Canons were decreed: Diuers proofes of K Henry acknovvledging the Popes Supremacy. and in the third; That no Clergie man should receiue anie benefice at the hands of aelaie-man &c. without the approbation of his Bishop; and if bee did, the donation should be void: Which the King tooke not to bee against himself, or anie way repined at that Councell, gathered by the Popes authoritie, neither at this Decree therof, that might concerne both him & his.

                  22. Heer I desire the prudent Reader to consider, how weake and feeble a battery M. Attorney bringeth forth, against so stronge and founded a bulwark, as before we haue set downe to the contrary; wherin hauing shewed and demonstrated by sundry sortes of euident proofe, that King Kenry, as in all other points of Catholicke doctrine, vsage, and practice; so in this speciall point of the Popes Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction was a perfect Catholicke Prince, acknowledging and yeelding vnto him, his due spiritual superiority and eminency in euery occasion as you haue heard. Now M. Attorney, from whome we expected some substantiall proofe to the contrary, VVeake and impertinent proofe. to wit, that he acknowledged not, nor practised the same, but held this supremacy to be in himself, as deriued from his Crowne, in as ample sorte, as Q. Elizabeth had, or might haue by the Statute of Parlament, that gaue her all power, that had byn, or might be in any



spirituall person whatsoeuer, &c. To proue all this (I say) he com

                      whereby the said King, as founder of the Abbey of Reading, doth assure the lands and temporall possessions, which he had giuen to the said Abbey, that neither Ecclesiasticall, nor Royall power shall take away, or distract the same vpon any occasion after the Abbots death; but that they shall remaine entyre and free, with all their rights, in the hands of the Couent, Prior, and Monks therof, vntill a new Abbot be Canonically elected, who shall haue no propriety in any parte therof, but all common with his brethren: in regard wherof he is willed to dispend the same religiously, according to the founders meaning and intention, as out of the words of the Charter it self you haue heard.

Ethelbert that of Canterbury: K. Offa that of S. Albans: K. Edward that of VVestminster, and others: that besides the ordinary power and priuiledges, which founders of pious works, Founders had authority to giue Charters. haue by the Canon-lawes (which are many and great) to dispose of their owne donations, and to assure the same according to their perpetuall intention: The Sea of Rome was wont also to graunt them authority oftentymes, to dispose and ordaine spirituall priuiledges, to be confirmed afterward by the same Sea, as out of diuers like Charters and Graunts you haue heard;

                   who was wont (saith Malmesbury) to begin many things, & goe through with few, to promise much and perfourme little: yet held he out for more then 18. years togeather, as I haue said. And in all this time though he had little leasure to attend peculiarly to Ecclesiasticall matters, and lesse will oftentymes, being wholy intangled in matters of warre: yet his whole course and race of life sheweth euidently, that in this point, either of beleife or practice, concerning Ecclesiasticall power, he did not differ or dissent from his auncestors, or from other Christian Catholike Princes, that liued round about him in those dayes. Nay, he was held for so religious in this behalfe, before he was King as the opinion therof did greatly further him to gaine the Kingdome. For that (saith Malmesbury) Henry Bishop of VVinchester,

                   which now was Legate of the Sea Apostolicke in England, that principally was the cause of his preferment to the Crowne, was induced therevnto by most certaine hope, that Stephen would follow the manners of his grand-father the Conquerour, in gouerning the Crowne, but especially in preseruing the discipline of Ecclesiasticall vigour; and vpon this hope, did the said Bishop interpose himself, as mediatour and pledge for Stephen, with VVilliam Archbishop of Canterbury, and the rest of the Bishops and nobility, exacting of him a strict oath De libertare reddenda Ecclesia, & conseruanda. For restoring and conseruing the liberty of the Church, which VVilliam Rufus by his loose gouernment, had much infringed.
               27. The same Malmesbury also that liued with him setteth downe the mutuall oathes,

he was particularly confirmed by Pope Innocentius, &c. And then it followeth: Ego Stephanus &c. respectu & amore Dei, Sanctam Ecclesiam liberam esse, &c.

And I doe confirme by these presents, and their, dignityes, priuiledges, and auncient customes to be inuiolably obserued, &c.

               29. One notable case fell out vpon the 4. yeare of his raigne, to wit in the yeare of our Lord 1139. when holding his Courte in the Citty of Oxford, and expecting dayly the comming out of Normandy of Robert Earle of Glocester, in fauour of Maude the Empresse, (I meane that famous Robert base sonne of K. Henry the first, most excellent in wisedome and feats of Armes, and a great fauourer of learned men, to whome both Malmesbury and Geffrey of Monmouth dedicated their books) the King being persuaded (I say) by certaine il Counselours and souldiars about him, to lay hands vpon the goods and Castles of two rich and potent Bishops, the one Roger of Salisbury that had byn Chaplaine to King Henry; and the other Alexander of Lincolne his nephew, A violent act of K. Stephen. and the Kings Chauncelour; he followed at length their counsaile, and caused both Bishops to be apprehended, and forced to deliuer vp the keyes of their Castles and treasures therein, pretending feare and doubt, least they would otherwise hape kept the same

                     〈◊〉
                   much misliked also by the Cleargie it self; yet seeing (saith Malmesbury) this violence to be vsed against the Canons, they admonished the King therof by diuers waies, especially by his brother Bishop of VVinchester, now also Legate of the Sea Apostolicke, a likewise by Theobald Archbishop of Canterbury that had succeeded William; who went so far, and were so earnest in this matter (saith Malmesbury then liuing):

and sedition to bee made between the Kingdome and Preisthood. Wherat (saith he) the King rising respectiuelie from his seate, albeit hee excused his fact by laying the ent

               31. Wherefore it seemed best to the said Legate and Archbishop to call a Synod at VVinchester, and to cite the King there vnto vnder paine of Censures to appeer therin, The K. cited to appeare before the Bishopps. and to giue the reason of this his violent fact against the foresaid two Bishops; for so much as if they had offended: Non esse Regis, sed Canonum in

This Ecclesiasticall Councell then being called togeather vpon the first of September, Non abnuente Rege, not altogeather against the Kings will (saith Malmesbury) who was present in the said Citty of Oxford, he sent two Earles for his proctors, with an excellent learned aduocate or Attorney called Albericus de V

                     〈◊〉
                   for that the self same Canons did forbid Bishops to buyld such



stronge Castells. And in this later point Hugh Archbishop of Rome being newly come to this Councell, did take the Kings parte; The kings plea by his Attourney before the Bishops. affirming that in so suspitious a tyme, the King might without breach of Church-canons, demaund the keyes of any Bishops Castle within his Realme. But the legate & Archbishop of Canterbury were of opinion, that first the violence of the fact should be remedied, and then the matter tried according to the said Canons: which the King refusing to doe, the two Bishops interessed appealed to Rome, whervnto the King answered by his Attorney Albericus in these words:
For as much as some of the Bishops had vsed threats, and were preparing to send some to Rome against the King; in this (said he) the King doth commend them for their appealinge:
but yet he would haue them know, that if any went against his will, K. Stephen grā
                     ted an appeale to Rome but doubteth the same. and against the honour of the Realme, his returne home should be harder then perhaps he imagined. Nay moreouer the King shewing himself greiued in this cause, did of his owne free-will and motion, appeale for himself to Rome. Which when the King, partly praising their appeale, & partely threatning (as you se) had vttered, all men vnderstood whitherto it tended, to wit that they should not carry the matter to Rome at all, but end it at home.
               33. This was the euent of that Councell; which I haue related somewhat more largely out of the writing of an eye-witnes, for that it expresseth manifestly what was then held and practised for truth in our controuersie. For that K. Stephen and his learned Councell, and Attorney did not stand vpon denyinge the Popes Ecclesiasticall authority, as our Attorney doth now, nor yet of the Bishops of his Realme in Ecclesiasticall matters, but is content to vnder-goe the same, defending only the reason and lawfullnes of his said fact; nor did he pretend by reason of Kingly Crowne to haue this iurisdiction, but allowed, as you haue heard, both their appeale to Rome, and appealed also himself. Differēce betvvixt K. Stephens Attourney and ours. Ibidem.
                   And surely if our Attorney and that Attorney should haue disputed about the plea that was to be held therin, they would greatly haue differed; & yet was that Attorney in Causaruns varietate exercitatus (saith Malmesbury) much exercised in all variety of causes: but his iudgemēt, learninge, & beleife, was different from that of ours, though he were foure hundred years elder. And so to returne to our Story againe, this was the successe of these affaires, and conforme to this was all the rest of his life and raigne: as for

               34. Another case also fell out of great moment, between Pope Eugenius the 3. that ensued Lucius, and K. Stephen, which was about VVilliam Archbishop of Yorke, called afterward S. VVilliam, who being Nephew vnto the said King, that is, borne of his sister Lady Emma,

               35. But now for the first time, notwithstanding all that King Stephen could doe or intreat for him, he was depriued, as hath byn said, and one Henry Murdat a learned man, Abbot of a monastery



of S. Bernards Order in VVells, who also had byn schollar in the monastery of Clare-vallis vnder the said S. Bernard, was promoted vnto the dignity, and proued a notable good Archbishop, though at the beginning he being contradicted by the King, had great difficulty to enter; the people also being against him, as well for feare of the said King, as for fauour and loue of the other good man deposed: and the Kings sonne Eustachius going to Yorke vpon that occasion, vsed great violence, and insolency (and some not to be named) against such as had opposed themselues against the election of the said deposed. But finally the sentence and iudgement of Pope Eugenius tooke place, and K. Stephen after a time permitted the other to liue quietly in his Bishopricke: whereby we may see, what power and iurisdiction the Pope had for such matters in England at that time. And that neither K. Stephen, nor his sonne Eustachius, nor any of his Counsell, went euer about to say for their pretence or excuse, that these things belonged to the Kings authority-Royall, & not to the Popes tribunall.
               36. All which points being laid togeather, and many other that for breuity I doe pretermit, it commeth to be manifest, that whatsoeuer actions this King, in those infinite troubles, fears, and suspicious of his, might sometymes vse for his gaine or interest, or vpon persuasion of others, against the Church or libertyes therof: yet was his will and iudgement truly Catholike in this point, nor was he euer noted for the contrary; nor doth M. Attorney alleadge any one instance out of him or his tyme, to that purpose. And therfore shall we passe to other Kings after him.
            
         
         
            
            OF THE RAIGNE OF KING HENRY THE SECOND Great Grand-child to the Conquerour: And of his two sonnes K. Richard and K. Iohn, and their conformityes in this controuersie. CHAP. IX.
            AS in the former Chapter for breuityes sake, we ioyned three Kings togeather; so shall we doe the like in this: especially for so much as M. Attorney hath no one instance out of any of them, whose raignes iudured for the space of aboue threescore years; and thereby sufficiently testifieth, that in this point of the Popes Ecclesiasticall authority, their beleife, iudgements, and actions were correspondent and vniforme to those of their progenitors and predecessors, as also were their lawes; & consequently (which allwayes is to be borne in mind) the common lawes of their dayes, could not be contrary to that iurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome, which they themselues euerywhere did acknowledge, professe and practise. For better declaration notwithstanding wherof, we shall not omit to set downe some particular and seuerall notes, as well of these Kings, and their successors, as we haue done of the former.

Stephen, & of the English-bloud only, by Maude the Empresse daughter to K. Henry the first, & neece to the Conquerour. He was sonne and heire to Geffrey Duke of Anioy and Poytoù, and a little before his inheritance of England, he had the rare fortune (as then it was thought) to marry with the young Queene Eleanor lately diuorced from K. Lewes the seauenth of France, vpon their falling out after their returne from Ierusalem, which Queene was daughter and heire to the Duke of Aquitaine; so as all those States of Gascoyne, Gwyan, Poytoù, Anioy and Normandy, were vnited togeather in this K. Henry, and by him conioyned to England. The Dukedome of Brittany also falling in his tyme to the inheritance of an only daughter of Duke Canon, 
                  K. Henry his temporall greatnes. King Henry procured to marry the same to his third sonne Geffrey, for he had foure by his said Queen that liued togeather, besides a fifth that died young. It was his chaunce also to haue an English Pope, named Adryan in his daies, by whose fauour and concession he got interest to Ireland, so as if we respect the greatnes and multitude of his dominions; he was the most puissant King of all, that euer had dominion ouer our nation vntill that day.

And to this effect was he punished and afflicted most in those things, wherin he had taken most delight, and for which he had most perhaps offended God; as first in the alluring of the said Q. Eleanor to make the foresaid diuorce from the King of France to marry him,

Henry the third, and giuing him in possession the States of Gascoyne and Gwyan; the second being Richard, he made Earle of Poitoù; the third which was Geffrey, he inuested (as hath byn said) in the Dukedome of Brittany; and the fourth named Iohn, for that he had no seuerall State as yet to giue him, K Henry punished in that vvherin he tooke most delight. he called in iest s

For first about the middest of his raigne, both the mother and the children banded themselues against him, with Lewes the K. of France, that had byn her former husband, wherof Petrus Blesensis, that was his latin Secretary, maketh mention in diuers epistles that are extant, as namely, in one written by two Archbishops that had byn his Embassadours to the said K. Lewes, to make peace, but could not; who discouered that both his Queene and children had all conspired against him.

               6. The like letter at the same time, wrote Richard Archbishop of Canterbury to K. Henry the sonne, persuading him by diuers earnest arguments, to returne into grace with his Father, and in the end threatned him, that if within fifteen dayes he perfourmed it not, he had expresse commaundement from the Pope to excommunicate him. But how this matter was afterward ended, or compounded rather for that present, you shall heare a little beneath, though againe vpon other occasions, matters brake forth & brought the afflicted King at last to the most miserable state of desolation in minde, that euer perhaps was read of in historyes. For that,

Henr. 2. as Stow out of auncient writers reporteth, he died cursing the day that euer he was borne, and giuing Gods curse and his to his sonnes, (which were only two liuing at that time) and that he would neuer release or goe backe in this, albeit he was intreated by diuers, both Bishops and other religious persons, euen vntill the very houre of his death. Wher vnto Nubergensis addeth this saying for some reason therof. Nondum (vti credo) satu defleuerat, &c.
                  He had not (as I beleeue) mourned or bewailed sufficiently the rigour of that most vnfortunate obstination of mind, 
                        Nuberg. l. 3. 6. 25. which he had vsed against the venerable Archbishop Thomas (in giuing the occasion of his murder) and therefore doe I thinke this great Prince to haue had so miserable an end in this world, that our Lord not sparing him heere, K. Henry his lamē
                        table end. might by his temporall punishment prepare him euerlasting mercy in the life to come. So Nubergensis.
                  
And this for his manners and conuersation, wherin otherwise the said Author doth much commend him for a good Iusticer and leuing Father to his people; a great Almes-man and founder of pious works; and for a principall defender and preseruer of Ecclesiasticall libertyes, &c. 
                  His vertues.
               
               7. But now if we consider the point of our controuersie about his religion, and particular iudgement in the matter of Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction; no King euer of our nation did make the matter more cleere for his obedience to the Sea of Rome in all occasions, wherof he had many in his dayes, & some of them neerly concerning himselfe, as that of Thomas Becket Archbishop of



                  Canterbury, who for opposing himself against certaine new Statutes and Ordinances of the said King, which in the heat of 
                     〈◊〉
                   greatnes and temporall fortune, he would haue made against the liberty of the Church, pretending them to haue byn of his Grand-father K. Henry the first (and if they had byn, Lavves attempted by King Henry against the Church. the antiquity was not great as you see) the said Archbishop incurred highly his heauy indignation, which cost him afterward his life, as is notorious. And these lawes were six in number, as the histories of that time doe sett them downe.  The first, that no appellation might be made to Rome without he Kings consent. 
                   The second, that no Bishop might goe out of the Realme without the Kings lic
                        •
                     nce, though he were called by the Pope himself. 
                   The third, that no Bishop may excommunicate any man that held of the King in capite, but by the Kings approbation. 
                   The fourth, that it shall not appertaine to the Bishop to punish men for periury, 
                        ••
                      violating their faith; but that it shall belonge to the Kings Courts. 
                   The fifth, that Clarks may be drawne to secular tribunals in certaine causes. 
                   The sixt, that the King and his lay-Iudges may determine controuersies about titbes or Churches.
               
               8. These were the lawes, for which K. Henry the second made so much adoe to haue them passe, as he enpawned his whole power therin, & moued, for so much as in him lay, both heauen and earth to effectuate them, euen by the Pope himself, but could not. And yet you see, that heere is not pretended any absolute spirituall iurisdiction, but only delegatory in certaine little peeces and parcels therof, or rather some little restraint of that supreme authority, which he acknowledged to be in the Sea of Rome. 
                  K. Henry vehement contentiō to haue these lavves take place. But yet for the good and peace of his land he pretended to haue them graunted, confirmed, & allowed vnto him, as he said they had byn to his Grand-father, but could not shew it. For as you haue heard in the life of K. Henry the first, the holy and learned prelate S. Anselme stood against him in such sorte, so as he preuailed not.
               9. It is heer also specially to be noted against M. Attorney, that this King pretended not (as hath byn said) to haue this iurisdiction against Clergie men by right of his Crowne, but by concession rather of his Bishops, and confirmation of the Pope himself. For so expresly affirmeth Houeden that liued at that tyme, that he required the seales of the said Bishops,

                     ford & Geffrey Ridell, to desire of Pope Alexander, that he would make his extraordinary Legat in England, Roger Archbishop of Yorke, an old emulator and enemy of S. Thomas. But the Pope perceiuing his drifte, which was to oppresse the said Archbishop of Canterbury, denyed the Kings petition in this behalfe, though at the request of the Kings said messengers, K. Henry the secōd made Legate of the Pope. 
                  Consessit Dominus Papa, vt Rexipse Legatus esset totius Angliae, it a tamen, quod ipse nullum grauamen facere posset Cantuariensi Archiepiscopo. The Pope graunted that K. Henry himself should be his Legat ouer all England; but yet so, as he should not be able, to lay any aggreiuaunce vpon the Archbishop of Canterbury: that is to say, should not preiudicate his ordinary iurisdiction, or haue any authority ouer him. Which point the King perceiuing, and that his whole intent of oppressing the said Archbishop was heerby preuented, he would not, through indignation (saith our Author) accept of the said legation, but sent back the Popes letters of that commission to him againe. Wherby you see, that he refused the said office, for that he thought the iurisdiction giuen him, was lesse then he would haue had, and not for that he did not acknowledge the whole to be in the Pope, and nothing in himself, as from the right of his Crowne.
               10. But to abbridge this matter, concerning his contention with S. Thomas, wherof afterward he sore repented himself, as you will heare; though he entred into the same with great heat and resolution, to goe through therin by his power and authority with the Pope: yet when he saw the said Pope to mislike his proceedings, and to stand constant against him, he amayned and and humbled himself presently, and this in respect of his conscience and feare of God, as himself caused to be written by his Bishops to the said Pope Alexander. For there is extant in Houeden a large epistle of all the Bishops Suffragans of Canterbury, that were subiects to Thomas the Archbishop, written vnto Pope Alexander in the Kings name, of his prompt obedience towards him, and the Sea of Rome in all things, saying: K. Henry his humility to the

               11. This then, was his disposition of mind in this behalfe, which he presently shewed in fact, by sending a most honorable Embassage to the Pope, to wit, the Archbishop of Yorke, & Bishops of VVinchester, London, Chichester and Excester, with the Earles, Arundell, the Gundauell de Sancto Valerico, and many others both gentlemen and Clarks. And as Houeden affirmeth; Appellauit pro se & regno suo, ad Praesentiam Summi Pontificis; K. Henry himselfe appealeth to the Pope. He appealed for himself and for his kingdome to the Pre

                  ence of the Pope; desiring that two Legats might be sent into England to iudge of the cause, between him & the Archbishop. And soone after when the Archbishop, vpon pacification made was returned, and within a few moneths after wikedly slaine in his owne Church of Canterbury; the same Pope Alexander taking vpon him, as lawfull Iudge, to examine & punish the fact vpon the person of K. Henry himself, sent two Cardinall-Legats for that purpose into Normandy,

And the same writer addeth in the same place, that the said King fearing also (notwithstanding his appeale) the seuerity of the Sea Apostolicke in this case, passed ouer presently into England, giuing straite order and commaundment, that no man should be permitted to enter with any Bull or Bre

Henry being then in Ireland, and cited to appeere came purposely to present himself in person, which notably signifieth his obedience. And there by his oath he purged himself, swearing first, that his intention was neuer to procure the said Archbishops death, and secondly promising diuers things by the same oath, to be performed in satisfaction of his fault, in hauing giuen some occasion therof by angry words against the same Archbishop Thomas.

               13. And amongst other six or seauen points, whervnto the King sware at this time, one is set downe in these words.
He sware also, that he would neither let, nor permit to be letted, any Appellations to be made in his Kingdome, to the Bishop of Rome in Ecclesiasticall causes, with this condition, that if any that doe appeale be suspected to the King, they should giue security, that they would not seeke, or procure any hurte to him or his Kingdome.
And so was that controuersie ended, and the lawes abolished, which the King would haue established against the liberty of the Church. Wherby we se cleerly what persuasion K. Henry had of the Popes supreame authority in Ecclesiasticall affaires, and his loyall obedience thervnto; which is so much the more to be esteemed, if we consider the circumstances of the tyme wherin he exhibited the same, which was such, as he might easily haue declined himself (if he would) from the force of Pope Alexander his authority, that pressed him so much, by adhering to some one of his enemyes the Antipopes, that by faction of a few were chosen & set vp against him, three or foure one after another, naming themselues, Victor the 4.

But our Kings of England obayed allwayes their true and lawfull Pastors of Gods Church, and were highly commended for it. And now K. Henry the 2. followed their vertues, wisedome, religion, and magnanimity in that behalfe; and found (no doubt) his reward in the life to come for it. And so much of this.
               14. But now to passe to another consideration about the same King, it seemeth to me, that nothing sheweth more this King

               15. Thus he wrote at that tyme with teares, as you haue heard, wherewith Pope Alexander being greatly moued, sent commaundement to Richard Archbishop of Canterbury, to write earnestly vnto K. Henry the sonne, to recall him from his rebellion vnder paine of excommunication, as before we haue shewed. And this confident recourse of K. Henry to the Pope in so great an affaire, declareth well the opinion he had of his authority. And conforme vnto this, were all the rest of his actions and doings, concerning Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, when he was out of passion and perturbation, acknowledging none at all in himself, but only from the Sea Apostolike. And heervpon he fouuded the security of all his hopes, by his first marriage with the Queen Eleanor, as hath byn said, whose diuorce from King Lewes was vpon the Popes sentence, declaringe the same to be inualide and no marriage at all, by reason that they were married within degrees of consanguinity prohibited by the Church.
               16. And soone after this againe, about the 6. yeare of his raigne the same King (as Stow relateth) procured dispensation of the said Pope by his Legat-Cardinalls,

Henry founded al his state vpon the Popes authority. that was yet but of three years old, which he would not haue done by all likelihood, with so manifest perill of his whole succession therby, if he had either doubted of the Popes authority therin, or presumed of his owne.
               17. And not many years after this againe, the said King being very desirous to remoue from the Church of VValtam in Essex certaine secular Chanons, that liued not with edification, and to place in their roome regular Chanons, presumed not to doe it of himself, or his owne authority (which yet might seeme a small matter) but by the authority of the Pope.

And the same VValsingham two years after that againe, doth record another iudiciall Act of the said Pope Alexander in England, which is, that he exempted from the obedience of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Roger, that was Prior of the monastery of S. Augustine in the same Citty, Di

               19. And finally to goe no further in this matter, of this Kings obedience and deuotion towards the Church, when he was out of choller and passion, and free from such other perturbations, as did draw him strōgly oftentimes to the doing of certaine things, which after he repented; I shall end with one shorte narration only of the foresaid VValsingham, or a strange extremity and aduersity of fortune, from which God deliuered him at one tyme, by means of his deuout mynd towards the blessed Martyr S. Thomas of Canterbury, vpon the year 1174. which was three yeares after his said martyrdome, at what time the Kings state was this, as partly before you haue heard. Lewys King of France cōioyning himself with Henry the third King of England, 
                  The straites vvhervnto King Henry vvas driuen. and the rest of his brethren against their Father, pressed him sore with great armies in Normandy, and other partes of his Dominions in France. And at the very same time, his wife Queen Eleanor in England conspiring with her said sonnes, incited by her example many other Princes and noblemen to doe the like, who raised diuers rebellions. And besides all the rest, VVilliam King of Scotland came in with a great Army on the North-side, and Philip Earle of Flaunders was entered with another on the South-side. At which time K. Henry seeing himself in these straites, and not well knowing what to doe, yet resolued at the length to passe from Normandy into England, and first to succour the principall parte.

Henry strangely deliuered. that saw his intention, to be mercifull vnto him, as his meaning and purpose was to seeke the peace both of the Clergy & people of England, &c. And God (saith our Author) admitted presently the prayer of this our humbled King, and brought him safe to Hampton-port with all his people; who from that day forward, giuing himself to pennaunce, vsed (saith he) a very thinne diet, to wit, bread and water only, and casting of



all temporall cares, nor entring into any one Citty, as he went by the way, neuer ceased vntill he came to Canterbury;
where the glorious body of Thomas the martyr lay, The earnest and

                      of King Henry. where with abundance of teares and sighes, going bare-foote, and casting himself prostrate on the ground, he did demaund pardon and mercie;
humbly beseeching first, that the Bishops there present would absolue him, and then that euery religious man would giue him three, or fiue strokes of a discipline (or whip) on his bare flesh; & then putting one his apparell againe, which in all their presence he had put of, he rose from the ground, and then gaue precious gifts to the said Martyr and his sepulcher; and among other forty pounds by the yeare of perpetuall rent for maintenance of lights at the said Sepulcher, and so giuing himself to waching, fasting, & prayer for three dayes togeather, it is not to be doubted (saith he) but that the said martyr being pleased with his repentaunce and deuotion, God also (by his intercession) tooke away the Kings sinne.
So VValsingham.
               
               20. And presently in token heerof he saith, that the verie same day, wherin the King was most deuout in humbling

                  imself and kissing the said martyrs Tombe in Canterbury, God deliuered into his hands VVilliam King of Scotland, who was taken prisoner by his Captaines: and that vpon the same day also, his rebellious sonne K. Henry the 3. hauing taken shipping to come with a great Nauye into England against him, was driuen back by tempest; the King himself going to London was receiued with extraordinary ioy of al his people, The vvonderfull successes of K. Hen. vpon his penance. by whose help he soone pacified and conquered all his rebells, and thence going presently ouer into Normandy with a great armie, and leading prisoner with him, the foresaid K. of Scotland, with diuers other enemies fallen into his hands, hee so terrified the King of France, and other his confederates that beseiged the Cittie of Roane, as they retired presentlie; and his sonnes Henry, Richard, & Geffrey so humbled themselues vnto him, as they were reconciled, and receiued to grace againe; all comming home togeather in one shipp (saith VValsingham) whom a little before it seemed, that the wide world could not containe.
               
               21. And this was the effect of K. Henries deuotion at that time, which Petrus Blesen

And this passed at that tyme, though afterward he committing his said Q Eleanor to prison, for diuers years before his death, and continuing his loose life with other women (as hath byn said) God for punishment, permitted, that albeit two of his sonnes Henry and Geffrey died before him; yet the other two remaining, Richard and Iohn, and falling from him againe, did so afflict and presse him, as they brought him to that desolate end, which before hath byn mentioned. Though some other doe ascribe the cause heerof, not so much to his loose life, as to his irreuerent dealing sometymes in Church-matters.

Henry the Father, we meane to be breefer (if it may be) in his children, who were only two that seruiued him, and raigned after him, to wit Richard, & Iohn; for that the two other Henry, that was crowned



and named by him K. Henry, and Geffrey Duke of Brittany, after their many tumultuations, conspiracies & disobediences against their said Father, died in his life tyme; and of these two that liued, he had little comforte, as before you haue heard.
               25. And yet proued this Richard no very euill King afterward, for the space of ten years that he raigned, though vnfortunate, both in warre and peace; which men ascribe (in great parte) to the demerit of his owne disobedience against his said Father. For punishment wherof both his owne brother Iohn conspired often against him, and K. Philip of France hir colleage and confederate, brake his faith with him, Misfortunes of K. Richard. and the Duke of Austria persidiously tooke and held him prisoner in his returne from Ierusalem, and Henry the Emperour laid him in fetters, and many other miseries followed, and fell vpon him, vntill at length he was disasterously slaine by a poisoned arrow, shot out of a Castle against him, as our histories doe testifie.
               24. But as for his religion, it was all wayes truly Catholicke, & in no point different from that of all Christendome in his dayes. And particularly in that which appertaineth to our controuersy, he was most obedient & deuout to the spiritual authority of the Sea Apostolicke in all his actions: King Richard deuout and obedient to the Church of Rome. which I may proue by the authority of a whole Synod of the Archbishop of Roane, and all his Bishops writing to Pope Celestinus the third, in recomendatiō of his cause when he was Captiue, sayinge: 
                     See Blesen. epist. 64. ad Celest. PP.
                  
                  Christianissimus Princeps Rex Angliae, illustrissimus Dominus noster, & deuotissimus Ecclesia Romanae filius, quem specialiter in suam protectionem susceperat in sua peregrinatione, &c.

               25. But if this testimony were not, yet all his other life and actions, as hath byn said, doe sufficiently testifie the same. For first, to goe in order, and name some few of many, it is registred by Houeden that liued at that tyme, and was present perhaps at his coronation, how religiously and humbly he receiued the same,

                      laid open the holy ghospells, aud the reliques of many Saints, according to the custome, and there he sware that all the dayes of his life, he would maintaine peace, honour, & reuerence to the holy Church, and all those that were ordained by the same.
                  He sware also to maintaine good iustice and equitie to the people, to take away euill lawes and customes, and to make good, &c. So Houeden.
                  
               
               26. And not many monethes after this, being called vpon, and intreated by Pope Clement the 3. to make hast in his preparations, for succouring of Ierusalem, which was now taken and held by Saladinus the great Prince of the Saracens; the said Pope sent soone after a speciall Legat into England, named Cardinall Iohn Anagnanus, 
                  King Richard goeth to Ierusalem by the Popes procurement. as well to hasten that iourney, and the iourney of K. Philip of France that was to goe in his compaine, as also to end certaine controuersies betweene Baldwin Archbishop of Canterbury, that was to goe with the King in his vioage, and Geffrey the Kings base brother nominated Archbishop of Yorke, & commended by the King (but not yet admitted hitherto by the Sea Apostolike) and other Bishops and principall persons. And when they were all met at Canterbury togeather, the King taking order and disposing many things, for the quiet and safty of his Kingdomes in his absence, which are set downe at large by the said Houeden, Nubergensis, Mathew Paris, and other authors; he thence began his iourney in the moneth of December, and first yeare of his raigne.
               27. But before this, as hath byn said, he did dispose of many things: as namely the setting at liberty of his mother Q. Eleanor, that had byn longe in prison in his Fathers dayes, restoring her to all former honours, and far greater then euer she had before, assigning to her the dowries, both of Q. Maude wife of K. Henry the first, The Kingdom commended to the Popes protectiō. and of Alyce wife of K. Stephen, and of the other Maude the Empresse mother of K. Henry the second. And to his brother Iohn Earle of Morton, besides all other States and Titles he had before, he gaue foure Earl-domes more, to gaine him withall and hold him content, to wit, of Cornwall, Deuonshyre, Dorcet and Somerset: but yet left to none of them the gouernment of his Realme, but to two Bishops to wit, Hugh Bishop of Durham, 
                  
                     See Houed. and math. Paris anno. 1190. for the North-partes, and to VVilliam Bishop of Ely, for the whole body of the Realme, making him his Chauncellour and supreme Iudge, and praying Pope Clement for his more authority, to make him also



his Legat à latere, and to take into his protection the whole Realme, and so he did: whereby appeareth what opinion K. Richard had of the Sea Apostolikes authority in his dayes.
               28. But the same appeareth yet more, by the many appellations that were made in the Kings owne presence, at the forsaid meeting at Canterbury vnto the Pope himself. For first Baldwin Archbishop of Canterbury (who, as I say, was to goe with K. Richard in his said iourney of Ierusalem) appealed against the foresaid Geffrey, the Kings brother, nominated by the King to the Archbishoprick of Yorke:
Appellauit ad Dominum Papam (saith Houeden) coram Rege, & vniuersis Episcopis, & Clero.
He appealed to the Pope, in presence of the King,

He would not obey the Kings commaundement in this point, but appealed in the controuersie to the Sea Apostolike: Diuers Appellations from the King to the Pope. which King Richard did no wayes let or deny. And againe in the same place, the King hauing giuen the Deanry of Yorke to one Henry, brother to the Lord Marshall of England, commended the man for his installing, to the Archbishop of Yorke; but he refusing said, that he could not doe it: Donec electio eius confirmata esset à Summo Pontifice: vntill his election were confirmed by the Bishop of Rome. 
                  
                     Houed. Ibid. fol. 376. Which answere the King tooke in good part, and therby well declared, what his opinion was of his owne Ecclesiasticall authority, as also of the Popes.
               29. Moreouer saith the same Author: Richardus Rex Angliae, missis nuncijs suis ad Clementem Papam, obtinuit ab eo literas Patentes, &c.
                  This Richard King of England sending his messengers to Pope Clement, obtained letters Patents of him, that whosoeuer he should send vnto any townes, lands or lordships of his, to keep, and defend the same in his absence, should be free from all oath, vow, or other obligation of going the voiage to Ierusalem: Vnde, ipse sibi inastimabilem acquisiuit pecuniam. Wherby he procured to himself an inestimable summe of money.
               
               30. And this before the Kings departure from England; but being entred into the iourney, and arriued in the Kingdome of Sicilie, he there marryed his new wife Berengaria, daughter to the King of Nauarre, conducted thither by sea, by Q. Eleanor his mother;

King Richard of England did send by his said mother, to the Pope, and humbly besought him, that he would confirme the election of the foresaid Geffrey to be Archbishop of Yorke. Which labour of going to Rome, it is like that he would neuer haue put his mother vnto, 
                     Houed. part 2. An. pag. 392. nor yet haue vsed so much humility of intreatinge the Pope, if he had thought his owne Ecclesiasticall authority to haue byn sufficient, as well for inuesting him, as for his nomination and presentation.
               31. And moreouer, when the said King had ended a certaine controuersie in the same porte & Citty of Messina, with Tancredra King of that Iland; he gaue account of all by a large letter, vnto the said Pope Clement, as to his deerest Father. Beatissimo Patri Clements, Dei gratia Sanctae sedis Apostolica Summo Pontifici: Richardus eadem gratia Rex Angliae, sincerae in Domino deuotionis affectum. And then presently he beginneth his epistle thus. Iustiorem exitum facta Principum sortiuntur, cum à Sede Apostolica robur & fauorem accipiunt, & Sancta Romanae Ecclesiae colloquio diriguntur, &c. The acts of Princes doe come to best end, 
                     Houeden. Ibid. fol. 326. when they receiue strength and fauour from the Sea Apostolicke, and are directed by the conference or communication of the Church of Rome. 
                  King Richardes letter to P. Clement the 3. And therefore we haue thought it conuenient to let your Holines vnderstand, what agreements haue byn made these dayes publikely, betweene the excellent Lord Tancred King of Sicilie, and vs. And then after recitall of all particularityes, he endeth thus: testibus nobisipsis, vndecimo die Nouembris apud Messanam. We our selues being witnesse of this agreement, the eleuenth day of Nouember at Messina.
               
               32. But when K. Richard soone after, departing thence was arriued in Asia, and had begun most prosperously his warrs against the Infidels, the Deuill enuying his good successe, stirred vp first seditiō in England, by means of Iohn the Kings brother, who perceiuing diuers to enuy the Greatnes of the Bishop of Ely, left gouernour by the King, and some Bishops also to be in faction against him, began to make great stirs. And on the otherside, the same enemy of mankind castinge ielousies betweene K. Philip of



                  France, and the said King Richard, did seperate them at last; whervpon ensued the returne of the said King Philip, with intention to inuade King Richards Dominions, and to set vp his brother Iohn in his place, as the sequele declareth.
               33. But Pope Celestinus the 3. that had succeeded in the place of Pope Clement lately deceased, Pope Celestines letter to the Realme of England. vnderstanding of the former conspiracie, and faction against the Bishop of Ely in England, wrote a vehement letter against the same, to all the Archbishops, Bishops, and Clergie of England, saying among the rest.

                     Cum dilectus in Christo filius noster Richardus, &c. wheras our deerly-beloued sōne in Christ Richard, noble King of England, when he resolued by taking vpon him the signe of the Holy crosse of Christ, to reuenge the iniury of his redeemer in the Holie land, left the tutele and care of his Kingdome, vnder the protection of the Sea Apostolicke, we that haue succeeded in that Sea, haue so much the more obligation to cōserue the State of the said Kingdome, the rights and honours of the same; by how much greater confidence he placed in our protection: and thervpon hath exposed his person, riches, and people, to greater perils for exaltation of holy Christian religion, &c. Wherfore vnderstanding of certaine troubles, lately moued by Iohn Earle of Morton, and certaine others combined with him, against your honourable Father VVilliam Bishop of Ely, Legat of the Sea Apostolicke, and Gouernour of your Realme.
                  Vniuersitati vestrae per Apostolica scripta mandamus, & in virtute obedientiae praecipimus, &c.
                  We doe by these Apostolicke writings, giue commaundement to your whole community & Realme, and charge the same in the vertue of obedience, that all men surcease from like practise of conspiration, turmoyle, or faction, &c. giuen at our pallace of Lateran, the 4. day before the Nones of December, in the first yeare of our Popedome.
And by this you may see what authority he tooke himself to haue ouer all England, and Bishops and Princes therof at that day.
               34. The which is yet more declared, by that which soone after ensued; for that the foresaid Earle Iohn, and other Lords and Bishops combininge themselues with him, hauinge proceeded yet further in that quarrell, & by cōmon consent of all the Realme (as it seemed) depriued the said Bishop of Ely of his office of Gouernour, imprisoned him, and driuen him out of England, and elected in his roome, VValter Archbishop of Roane, for gouernour of the Realme, they were no lesse carefull to send presently to



excuse, & iustifie the matter vnto Pope Celestinus, then they 
                     〈◊〉
                   to the King himself for his satisfaction. The Bishop of Ely fauored & defended by the Pope and the King. All which appeareth by a large letter written from Rome to the said Archbishop by his agents, that were there, who aduertized him, how euill the matter was taken by the said Pope Celestinus.
                  
                     Dominus Papa (say they) in restri depressione negotij, plurima indignanter, & cum amaritud
                           •
                        ne proponebat, &c. The Pope did propose very many things with indignation, and amaritude of mind to the depression of your affaire; iterating many tymes, that he knew the great affection & confidence of the King of England towards his Chauncelour and Gouernour the Bishop of Ely, and that he had seen many letters of the said King in his commendation, but none against him; & that at his earnest instance, the Sea Apostolike had made him also Legat à latere.
                  
And that finally, he absolued him from the sentence of excommunication, which the said Archbishop of Ro
                        ••
                     
                   had laid vpon him; and for the rest, he would expect the Kings inclination, who being soone after taken prisoner in Germany, sent presently for the said Chauncellour to come vnto him; and made great vse of him, for he was not only his interpreter betweene the Emperour and him, and other Princes, but he sent him also into England, not as Chauncellour or Gouernour, but as Bishop of Ely, to lay the plot for his ransome.
               35. And I might recount many other examples of the same iurisdiction, exercised in England by the same Pope without contradiction of any man, in the absence of the said King, though Earle Iohn the Kings brother was present, and very potent amōg them, and no great freind to the Pope, as by the former letter may be imagined; and who finally did driue out of England the said Bishop of Ely, but yet neuer obiected, or put doubt in the Popes authority, about any Ecclesiasticall matter that there fell out. As for example vpon the yeare 1191. which was the very next after the Kings departure, 
                     Nubergens. reiū Angl. l. 4. cap. 17. 
                  Nubergensis liuinge at that time, recounteth, how Geffrey the Kings base brother, hauing byn longe beyond the seas, suing at Rome to be admitted to the Archbishopricke of Yorke, and to haue his Pall, which Pope Cleme

                   would not graunt for diuers obiections, and appealles made against him, as well by Baldwyn Archbishop of Canterbury (as you haue heard) as also by others, and namely the Bishop of Ely that was Gouernour of the land, Geffrey the kinges brother by authority of the P. made Archbishop of Yorke. being much against him: yet now vpon King Richards commendation, and his owne many 
                     〈◊〉
                  


                  
promises, Pope Celestinus so much fauoured him (saith Nubergensis) as he gaue him his pall before he was consecrated, and sent him to be consecrated by the Archbishop of Towers in France, commaunding him, vt ei, non obstante vel appellatione, vel occasione qualibet, manus imponeret, that he should, by imposition of hands, cōsecrate him, notwithstanding any appellation, or other occasion whatsoeuer to the contrary. And so he did: and he came into England, and tooke possession of the said Archbishopricke, and enioyed the same by this authority of consecration and inuestiture from Pope Celestinus, notwithstanding all the contradiction and opposition of his potent aduersaryes, as in the same Author at large is set downe.
               36. And when not longe after this againe, the said Archbishop Geffrey requiring Canonicall profession of obedience to be made to him, and his Sea, accordinge to custome, at the hands of Hugh Bishop of Durham, who had purchased before of King Richard, an Earl-dome to be annexed to his said Bishopricke; 
                     Nubergens. Ibidem. cap. 25. and that the said Hugh refusing to doe the same, vpō pretence of many causes, appealed therein to the Sea of Rome; the Archbishop not admitting the same appeale, pronounced notwithstanding sentence of excommunication against him: Celestinus the Pope not only reuoked the said sentence, but exempted moreouer the said Bishop & Bishopricke, from the obedience of the said Archbishop and Archbishopricke of Yorke, as the same author relateth. So as in this he shewed his authority in England.
               
               37. But now let vs passe to K. Richard himself, who being valiantly occupied in the warres against the Infidels and enemies of God in Asia, had many crosses fell vpon him: First, the falling out and departure of K. Philip of France from that warre, as you haue heard; who returning into France, began to treat presently with Earle Iohn, to trouble the peace of his brothers territoryes; and the principall point that combined these two togeather against King Richard, 
                  King Richards fortunes letted by his brothers ambition, & enuy of the K of France. besides the enuy of the one, and ambition of the other, was, that both of them were afraid least Prince Arthure Earle of Brittany, sonne to Geffrey, Iohns elder brother, should succeed in the Kingdome of England, if any thing should happen to King Richard: (and so the Bishop of Ely had giuen out, that King Richard himself had written from Sicily) which point was much feared, as preiudiciall to them both. Whervpon they made a fast league, and began on both sides of the Sea to trouble the State;



which when K. Richard vnderstood, and that Pope Celestin

                   his letters, and other diligence could not stay them, and that 
                     〈◊〉
                   grew into sedition at home by partes-takinge, he was forced sorely to his greife, and to the publicke lamentation of all Christendome to leaue that warre, and to abandon the victorie, that was euen now almost in his hand, if he had stayed, as the euent also shewed; for that soone after dyed the Saladine, by whose death, there was no doubt, but that King Richard had recouered Ierusalem.
               
               38. But he returning for defence of his owne countrey, fel into great misery. For being taken, as hath byn said, by Duke Leopold of Austria, vpon pretence of certaine iniuries receiued from him & his people in the warres of Asia, he was deteined by him, King Richards captiuity in Austria. and by the Emperour Henry the 6. more then fifteen moneths prisoner, and forced to paie in the end, aboue two hundred thousand markes for his ransome, partly in present money, and partly in pawnes and pledges left for the same; And so after foure yeares absence, the said King returned.
               39. But in this tyme of his captiuity, his chiefest comforte and refuge was in the assistance of the said Pope Celestinus, as may well appeare by the sundry letters of many, written vnto the said Pope in his behalfe; but especially and aboue others, of the afflicted Lady and Queen his mother Eleanor, who wrote three large letters vnto him, by the pen of Petrus Blesensis Archdeacon then of London, 
                  
                     See Pet. Blesen epest. 144. ad Celest. PP.
                   that had byn Secretary to her husbād K. Henry the second: and she beginneth one, saying thus:
Sanè non multum ab insania differt dolor:
Sorrow truly doth not much differ from madnes: And then. Gentes diuulsae, populi lacerati, prouinciae desolatae in spiritu contrito & humiliato supplicant tibi, quem constituit Deus super Gentes & Regna in omni plenitudine Potestatis.

These nations heer deuided in their owne bowels, (by absence of their Prince) this people torne and broken in themselues, these desolate prouinces doe in a contrite and humbled spirit make supplication to you, whom God hath placed ouer Nations and Kingdomes in all fullnesse of power. And then againe. Moueat te (Summe Pontifex) etsi non huius peccatricis infalicissimae dolor, saltem clamor pauperum, compeditorum gemitu

that are heere slaine, with the spoyling of Churches therof ensuing, and with the generall oppression of all holy people. And yet further: Duo filij mihi supererant ad solatium, qui bodie (mihi misera & damnatae) supersunt ad supplicium. Rex Richardus tenetur in vinculis, Iohannes frater ipsius regnum Captiui depopulatur ferro & vastat incendijs. Two only children of many remained vnto me for my comforte, which now are vnto me (most miserable and damned woman) become a torment. King Richard is held captiue in chaines, and Iohn his brother doth spoile by sword and fire, the said captiues Kingdomes, and dominions.
               40. This and much more to the same lamentable effect, wrote this afflicted mother vnto Pope Celestinus in those dayes, requesting him by Ecclesiasticall censures, to compell both the Emperour and Duke of Austria, to set her sonne the King at liberty. And to this effect hath she many vehement speaches & exhortations vnto him; as for example.

And where is then the Zeale of Phinees? where is the authority of Peter, &c.

And why then doe you so negligently, yea cruelly, delay for so longe time to loose my sonne? or rather why dare you not to doe it? Perhaps you will say, that this power giuen you by God (of binding and loosing) is for soules, and not for bodies. Let it be so. Truely it is sufficient for vs, if you would bind the soules of those, that hold my sonnes body bound in prison. And finally I know, that it lyeth in your power to loose my sonne, if the feare of God may euacuate in you the feare of man.
               42. Thus wrote this afflicted Queene vnto Celestinus the Pope; and the same wrote diuers other great personages at the same tyme,

               43. And by this may appeare, what opinion men had in those dayes of the Popes authority: and let the Reader heer marke, as also M. Attorney, how vsuall a phrase it was at that tyme, to name two distinct swords, the one of Constantine, the other of Peter; th

                      10. And only this phrase of speach, and common beleife of all our Kings and Countrey from time to



time, that there were two distinct swords or powers, one temporall in the Prince, and the other spirituall in the Pope, 
                  A manifest inference vpō the premises against M Attorney. is sufficient to ouerthrow M. Attorneys whole Booke, though nothing els were said to it besides, the purporte therof being (as hath byn seen) to proue, that either no such distinction of swordes & powers is to be admitted, or that both are equally in the temporall Prince, and so vsed and exercised by our auncient Kings of England.

Richard: and many examples more might be alleadged during his raigne, after his returne againe to England, who meaning to euacuate the alienation of many thinges solde, lent, or empawned before, for his going to Ierusalem, caused himself to bee crowned againe in VVinchester; reducing all thinges to a new order, and among others he set downe, Capitula placitorum Corona Regis.

And Matthaeus Parisiensis speaking of the Church of Normandy vnder K.

It were ouer long to run ouer many other examples, which might be alleadged to this effect for proofe of King Richards true Catholicke deuotiō towards the Church; as also of his acknowledgement and obedience to the authority of the Sea of Rome, in all Ecclesiasticall affaires, during his life and raigne.

For which though he were the Kings brother; yet not making his appearance in Rome, nor lending his lawfull defence or purgation thither, he was suspended by the said Popes Bull: and the King was so far of, from taking it euill,

                  The said Pope Innocentius sent his letters to K. Richard of England, requesting and exhorting him, by Fatherly admonition, 
                        Ibid. fol. 176. that he would receiue into his loue and brotherly familiarity againe, the said Archbishop at his request, and suffer him in peace to returne to his Bishopricke, for that otherwise he should be forced, to vse Ecclesiasticall Censures against the said King and his Kingdome.

                   Bishops vnto the said Archbishop (whose names Houeden setteth downe.) In spiritu humilitatis postulantes ex parte Regis, vt ipse ratas haberet donationes, quas fecerat Rex in Eboracensi Ecclesia; & Dominus Rex redderet ei Archiepiscopatum suum cum omni integritate &c.
                  These Bishops were to demaund in the spirit of humulity on the Kings behalfe, Geffrey restored to his Bishopricke by Pope Innocentius. that the said Archbishop would ratifie, and make good all the donations or gifts, which the King had bestowed in the Church of Yorke (during the time he had with-held his Archbishopricke) & that there vpon the King would restore vnto him his Archbishopricke with all integrity. But the Archbishop demaunded first of these Bishops sent vnto him, whether they would vnder their hands and writings assure him, that he might doe it in conscience, but they refusing, he refused also to graunt



the Kings request, and therevpon appealed againe to Rome, and went thither in person; and the King, on his side, sent Proctors and Aduocats thither to plead for him, as Houeden at large declareth.
And moreouer to bridle him the more, he besought the Pope to make Hubert then Archbishop of Canterbury Legat of the Sea Apostolike ouer all England.
               
               47. And agayne, both this Author and Nubergensis doe declare, how the foresaid VValter Archbishop of Roane that had byn so great a friend of K. Richard euer since the beginning of his raigne, and had gone with him to Sicily, and returned againe to England, for pacifying of matters between the Bishop of Ely, that was Gouernour, the Earle Iohn; and moreouer had also byn Gouernour of England himself, & after King Richards Captiuitie had not onlie laboured for him, as you haue heard by his letter to the Pope, but went also in person to assist him in Germanie, and remained there in pledg for him: this man (I say) receiuing disgust at length from the said King, Disgust & appeale of the Archb. of Roane against K. Richard. for vsurping vpon certaine lands, and liberties of his in Normandy, he brake with him, appealed to the Pope, went to Rome against him; and the King was forced to send Embassadours to plead for himself there against the other, who pleaded so well (saith Nubergensis) alleadging the Kings necessitie for doing the same, as the Pope tooke the Kings parte, and tolde the Bishop openlie in publike Consistorie, that he ought to beare with the King in such a necessitie of warre, which being once past, matters might easilie be remedied. And thus much for the Popes authoritie acknowledged and practised, during the raigne of this King Richard the first, out of which M. Attorney found no probable instance at all, to be alleadged to the contrarie, and therfore made not so much as mention of any.
            
            
               
               OF THE RAIGNE OF KING IOHN, VVho was the seauenth King after the Conquest. §. III.
                
                  This King began his raigne an. 1199. and raigned 18. yeres vnto an. 1216.48. Of this King, being the last sonne of K. Henry the second, we haue heard much before, vnder the name of Earle of Mor

                   rage. This appeareth well by his many most vnnaturall and treasonable actions, against his kind and louing Father whilest he liued, wherby he shortened his said Fathers life, as before hath byn related. Variablenes of K. Iohn. And the same appeareth yet more in a certaine manner, by his like attempts against his owne brother, both when, and after he was in captiuity; which brother notwithstanding had so greatly aduaunced him, and giuen him so many rich States in England, as he seemed to haue made him a Tetrarch with him (say our English authors) that is to say, to haue giuen him the fourth parte of his Kingdome, which notwithstanding was not sufficient to make him faithfull vnto him.
               49. This man then succeeding his brother Richard, with whom he was beyond the seas when he died, laid hands presently on the Treasure and fortresses of his said brother, and by the help of two Archbishops especially, to wit VValter of Roane in Normandy, and Hubert of Canterbury in England, he drew the people and nobility to fauour him, and was crowned first, Duke of Normandy by the one, and then King of England by the other, when he was 34. yeares old, and held out in the said gouernmēt with great variety of state and fortune for 18. yeares old togeather. The first six with contentment & good liking of most men, the second six in continuall turmoile, vexation, and with mislike of all; and the thi

                  The pretences of the Dolphin of France to England. pretended to be next heire by his wife the Lady Blanche, daughter to the said K. Iohns sister, Queene of Castile, which brought K. Iohn to those straites, as he died with much affliction of mind, as after you shall heare.
               50. To say then somewhat of ech of these three distinctions of tyme, noting some points out of them all that appertaine to this our controuersie with M. Attorney: you haue heard in the end of K. Richards life, K. Iohns obeyng, the Sea Apostolick. how VValter Archbishop of Roane appealed to Pope Innocentius against the said King, for seasing vpon certaine lands of his, and namely the Towne of Deepe, which Innocentius commaunding to be restored, K. Iohn obayed, and made composition with the said Archbishop vpon the yeare of Christ 1200. which was the second yeare of his raigne, as Houeden reporteth; 
                     Houed. 2. part. Annal. fol. 458. restoring him Villam de Depa cum pertinentijs suis, The Towne of Deepe with the appurtenances: and diuers other things, which the said author setteth downe, shewing therby the obedience of K. Iohn to the Popes ordination.
               51. Moreouer there falling out a great controuersie between Geffrey Arcbishop of Yorke, K. Iohns brother, K. Iohn pretended no supremacy Ecclesiasticall. and the Deane and Chapter of the said Church, and both parties appealing to Rome, Pope Innocentius appointed the Bishop of Salisbury, and Abbot of Tewxbury to call them before them in Church of VVestminster, and determine the matter, & so they did, & made them freinds; the King not intermedling in any part therof, though the matter touched his brother, and concerned his owne Ecclesiasticall supremacy, if he had persuaded himself, that he had had any. And the verie same yeare the Bishop of Ely, and the Abbot of S. Edmunds-bury were appointed Iudges by the said Pope, in a great cause between the Archbishop, and monks of Canterbury, which they determined publikelie, Vt Iudices à Domino Papa constituti: (saith Houeden) as iudges appointed from the Pope, without any dependance of the King at all, though their cheife controuersie was about the priuiledges and proprieties of lands, lordships, and officers of theirs, to wit of the said Archbishop and Monkes.
               52. And wheras the foresaid Hubert Archbishop of Canterbury with the rest of the Bishops, summoned a generall Synod in England for ordaining many thinges, according to the neede or



necessitie of the English Church; and the King by euill 
                     〈◊〉
                   saile of some, went about to let the said Synod, forbidding the same by his supreame Iusticer (which was the highest power at that time vnder the King) the said Archbishop admitted not the prohibition: A councel h

                     ld against the kings prohibition. 
                  Archiepiscopus (saith Houeden) generale celebrauit Concilium Londonys apud VVestmonasterium, cōtra prohibitionem Gaufredi filij Petri Comitis de Essexia, tunc temporis Summi Iusticiarij Anglia. The Archbishop did celebrate a general Councell at VVestminster in London, against the prohibition of Geffrey the sonne of Peter Earle of Essex, which at that time, had the office of the cheife Iusticer of England. So as we see, that they followed not the Kings inclination in this spirituall affaire, but held their Councell, and finished the same, notwithstanding the former secular prohibition of the supreme Iusticer. And Houeden that was then liuing, setteth downe all the Canons and Ordinances at large of the said Councell, which had these words in the end of euery one seuerally repeated: Saluo in omnibus Sacrosanctae Romanae Ecclesiae honore & priuilegio: sauing in all points, the honour and priuiledge of the holy Church of Rome: Which was the sooner added for that the general Councell of Lateran in Rome, was shortely after to ensue, which might adde, take away, or alter whatsoeuer should seeme best to the Decrees of this Nationall Councell.
               53. Neither is there read any thing to haue byn done or said against this by the King, though it is like that some of his Counsell did egge him against it, as may appeare by the said prohibition of his Iusticer before mentioned. Nay, not only was K. Iohn obedient to the Church & her authority at this time; but otherwise also shewed himself very deuout & pious by many wayes: to which purpose among other things, it is recorded by this author, 
                     Houed. in vi

Iohn had not died at that very instant, in the heat of all the warre: not poisoned by a monke (as foolish Iohn Fox doth affirme, and set forth in many printed and painted pageants of his booke) but vpon greife of mind, See Fox & his pageants of the toade skinned to prepare the poisō, vvith other circūstances pag. 133. of his Acts and monuments. trauaile and disorder of diet, as all auncient authors by vniforme consent doe agree. And Iohn Stow citeth foure that liued in K. Iohns dayes, to wit? Mathew Paris, Roger VVyndouer, Raph Niger, and Raph Gogshall, in their histories of that tyme.
               66. Wherfore to conclude this Chapter of K. Henry the second, and of his two sonnes, wee see how firme they were all three in this beleife and acknowledgement of the Popes spirituall authority ouer all the world; and no lesse ouer England in those dayes; and how fully the same was in practise among them. And that albeit in some cases & causes, wherin they receiued some distast, they strugled sometimes about the particular execution therof, indeauoring to mak some restraint, especially when it seemed to strech indirectly also to temporall affaires; yet did they neuer so much as once deny the said Ecclesiasticall supremacy to be in the Sea of Rome, and much lesse did euer ascribe it to themselues: which so cleerly ouerthroweth M. Attorneys position, as I maruaile what he will say to these and like demonstrations.
               67. And for that his often repeated ground is, that Queen Elizabeth had her supreame authority in cases Ecclesiasticall, according to the auncient common lawes of England: hitherto he graunteth that there was no Statute-lawes at all by Parlament, All anciēt English lavves against M. Attorney.

               firme the same; wheras on the contrary side M. Attorney sheweth himself so poore, weake, needy, & naked in his proofes, as he hath alleadged only hitherto but foure instances or examples out of all these six hundred years, that may seem somewhat to fauour him, though indeed they doe nothing at all, as in their places hath byn declared. But now from this King downward we shall haue somewhat more store laid togeather by him out of peeces or raggs of Statutes, though as little effectuall to proue his purpose, as the other before recited and refuted.
            2. To begin then with young K. Henry, who was but entred into the tenth yeare of his age, when the scepter was deliuered vnto him, and raigned somewhat more then 56. years. He was crowned at Glocester after the death of his Father, by one parte of the Realme, that followed him, and this especially, as hath byn said, through the presence & authority of the forsaid VVallo Pope Innocentius his Legat, The coronation & beginning of King Henry the third. who earnestly persuaded and inuited all sortes of people, to follow and obey this young King, and to forsake Prince Lewes of France, that had London and the South-partes of England deliuered vnto him. And finally denounced excommunication vpon all those that resisted this K. Henry, & therby drew at length all the Lords and Barons of England in effect, to returne vnto him; and was cheife Gouernour, both of the said Kings person and Realme for a time, togeather with some of the English nobility, as before hath byn declared.
            3. Neither shall it be needfull heere to set downe the particulars of his said Coronation, with the ordinary oath, which all Kings tooke humbly vpon their knees, before the high Altar, and vpon the holy Euangelists, to maintaine the liberties of the Church, and to doe iustice to all sortes of men; which for me we hauing set downe in the life of K. Iohn this mans Father, & some other Kings before, may serue for an 
                  •
               xample of all the rest. Onlie there is to be noted, as particular in this mans coronation, that presentlie after his said oath, he added this clause, as Matthew Paris setteth it downe: 
                  Math. Paris in vit. Hen. 3. an. 1216. 
               Deinde fecit homagium Sancta Romanae Ecclesiae, Innocentio Papae, &c. Then he did homage to the holie Roman Church, Temporal homage done to the Sea Apostolick by King Henry the third. and to Innocentius the Pope therof, for his Kingdomes of England and Ireland, & sware that he would faithfullie paie euerie yeare those thousand markes of tribute, which his Father K. Iohn had giuen vnto the said Church, &c. Which is the first solemne homage that we read to haue been made by any



King for temporall obedience vnto the Church of Rome in their coronation. For albeit K. Henrie the 2. in his sorrowfull epistle before mentioned to Pope Alexander the 3. when he was in his greatest affliction, wrote, as Petrus Blesensis setteth it downe, 
                  Bles epist. 136. ad Alex. PP.
                who was his secretarie: Vestrae Iurisdictionis est Regnum Augliae, & quantem ad seudatorij iuris obligationem, vobis duntaxat obnoxius teneor & astringor. The Kingdome of England is of your iurisdiction, and to you onlie am I bound as subiect, for so much as appertaineth to the obligation of feudatorie right: yet is this by most men vnderstood, to be meant by that King, either in respect of that ancient voluntarie tribute before mentioned of Peter-pence, or els of some particular agreement made between the said Pope Alexander and him, vpon the controuersie about the death of S. Thomas of Canterbury.
            
            4. But we read no such thing continued by his sonnes after him, vntill K. Iohn vpon the occasions before specified, made this new couenant, as hath byn declared. Which yet afterward vpon the yeare of Christ 1245. and 29. of this Kings raigne, when a Generall Councell was gathered by Pope Innocentius the 4. at Li

Iohn, as a thing, that he could not doe without the consent of his whole Realme, for many reasons which they alleadged. And so we se, that in this very contradiction, what respect they bare,

                  sa deliberatione, that the thing required a long deliberation: and so left the matter in suspence for that time.
            5. But to returne to this yonge King againe, who being first, as hath byn said, vnder the Gouernment of the Popes Legat, & the Earle of Pen-broke, high Marshall of England, and after his death, K. Henry obtaineth of the P. to be accompted of ful age. which was vpon the 4. yeare of the said Kings raigne, & the Legats departure, he was wholy vnder the gouernment of Peter Bishop of VVinchester, vntill the yeare of Christ 12

               3. and y. of his raigne; at what tyme being 17. yeares old, and feeling in himself a great desire to gouerne (as young Princes are wont to doe) thought to obtaine the same by the Popes authority, and so



sent priuie messengers to Rome, to Pope Honorius the 3. (saith Mathew Paris) and requested at his hands, 
                  Paris in 
                        〈◊〉
                      Hen. 3. an. 122
                     •
                  . for many reasons, that he might be declared able to gouerne of himself, togeather with his counsell, and to receiue into his hands, all those castles & lands which diuers of his Barons did hold in his name, from the tyme of his Fathers death. Which thing was graunted him, and the Popes Bull sent to the Archbishops, Bishops & Barons about the same, with authority and commaundement, to compell them by Censures to doe the same, if any should refuse.
            6. And two yeares after this againe, when he was 19. yeares old, he calling a Parlament, did decree and publish the famous great Charter called Magna Chaerta, for the priuiledges of the Church, as also the Charter of Forrests, for the nobility and common people: and many other things did happen in this time of his youth and non-age, The beginning of the great Charter for church priuiledges. which doe euidently declare his dutifull respect vnto Ecclesiasticall power, and especially to that of the Sea Apostolike, not assuming to himself any peece or parcell therof. And this might we easily declare by many examples, wherin he proceeded as he was taught, both by the presidence of his auncestors, and by the common induction of religion, and practice of all Christian Princes in those dayes; and this as well after he came to full age, as before, and so continued vnto his dying day.
            7. And for that this mans raigne was large, and of many years, as hath byn said; and if I should stand vpon particular proofes, and examples of his acknowledgement of the supreme authority of the Sea of Rome, and practice therof, in all occasions, it would be ouerlong and tedious: & therfore it shall be sufficient for the indifferent Reader, to consider these points following.
            
                8. First, that we hauing proued the said acknowledgement in all former Kings; it is not like that this deflected, or went aside from their stepps; or if he had done, it would (at least) haue byn noted, wherin, and in what points, and some records remaine therof, as there doe of other points, which were any way singular in him.  Secondly we finde this King, much commended for pious deuotion by ancient writers, and namely by Thomas VValsingham,

                   an. 1274. who in the beginning of K. Edward the first his life, giueth a breife note of this King Henries life and death, saying first of his sicknes and death, that being at the Abbey of S. Edmunds-burie, and taken with a greiuous sicknes, there came



vnto him diuers Bishops, Barons, and noble men to assist him and be present at his death; The deuout behauiour of K. Henry 3. at what time he humblie confessed his sinnes (saith he) was absolued by a Prelate;
and then deuoutlie receauing the bodie of our Sauiour, asked all forgiuenes, and forgaue all; had extreme vnction; and so humbly imbracing the crosse, gaue vp his spirit to almightie God: adding further of his deuotion in his life; that euerie day he was accustomed to heare three masses sung; and more priuatelie besides, and that when the Priest did lift vp the hoast consecrated, he would goe himself and holde the Priests arme, and after kisse his hand, and so returne to his owne place againe.
            
            9. Hee telleth also of his familiaritie with S. Lewes K. of France, who raigning at the same time (though some few years yonger then K. Henry) conferred oftentimes with him about matters of deuotion; Conferēce betvvene K. Henry aud S. Levves K. of France. and once telling him, that he was delighted more to heare often preaching, then manie masses, K. Henry answered, that he was more delighted, to see his friend, than to heare another man talke of him, though neuer so eloquentlie.
            10. This then being so, and K. Henry both liuing and dying so Catholicklie, as both this man, and all Authors doe write of him; there can be no doubt, but that he agreed fullie in iudgment and sense, with all his predecessours, as well in this point of the Popes Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, as in all others. And for his obedience to the Sea of Rome, it was so notorious, as diuers of his owne people at that time, did thinke it to haue excesse: For that it was not only in spirituall matters, but in temporall affaires of his Kingdome also; Nihil enim (saith Matthew Paris) nisi ex consensu Papae, vel illius Legati facere voluit.

                  4 in vst. Hen. 3. Hee would doe nothing (especiallie in his later years) but either by the consent of the Pope or his Legat. And further in another place. Ipso quo

                  it. At that very time also the King, otherwise then was decent or expedient, did oblige himself and his Kingdome (which yet he could not, nor ought to doe) vnto Pope Innocentius the fourth vnder paine of disinheritage, &c. So he.
            11. And many times elswere is this complaint renewed; and yet on the otherside, we may vnderstand by the same Mathew Paris (who so much misliketh this ouer much subiection, as he calleth it, to the Sea of Rome) that diuers great commodityes ensued



often therby, both to him and the Realme. To the Realme, for that the Popes wrote heerby more confidently and effectually vnto him, The vtilities by our English Kinges deuotion to Rome. for amending certaine errors of his, then otherwise perhaps they would or could; yea threatned him also with excommunication, when need required: Wherof the said Paris writeth thus in one place. In those daies the Popes anger began to be heate against the K. of England, for that he kept not his promises, so oftentimes made to amend his accustomed excesses, and therefore at the instance of Lautence Bishop of Ely, and many other, that earnestly vrged him, he threatned after so many exhortations made vnto him without fruite, to excommunicate him, and interdict his Kindome, &c. 
               
                  Paris Ibid.
               
            
            12. But yet for all this, when after his Barons did rise against him, and held him diuers years in warre, Pope Vrban the 4. (saith Mathew Paris) sent his Legat, Cardinal Sabinian, as far as Bellen in France to pronounce there, and set vp the sentence of excommunication against the said Barons, who being in armes, permitted him not to enter the portes of England; but yet not long after by the said Vrban his meanes, and Pope Clement the 4. that succeeded him, peace followed againe in the said Realme, after many years of warre & ciuill commotion, with great variety of euents succeeding on both sides. For that sometymes the King himself, with his brother Richard surnamed King of the Romanes, and Edward the Prince, were taken by the Barons; and sometymes the Barons had the worse, and Simon Momfort Earle of Licester their cheife head and Captaine, The Ciuil vvarrs of England vnder K. Henry the third. was slaine in the field; and many miseryes, distresses, and calamityes ensued on both parts, as are accustomed in warlyke affaires; but especially of Kingdomes, which haue their waues and turmoiles, according as the winds of great mens humours and passions doe swell, stirr vp, or calme the same. But in all this time no question was of Catholike religion in England nor any doubt at all of the distinction and subordination, between temporall & spirituall power and gouernment; but that the one was acknowledged in the King, as cheife head of the Common-wealth, and the other in the Bishops, as subordinate to the Sea Apostolike.
            13. And if we consider the cheife, and most euident points, wherin this acknowledgement is seen, and to be obserued, they are these in effect.  First and principally for all points of saith and beleife; which points were not receiued in England, nor other wise, then they came authorized and allowed by the said Sea



Apostolike.  And secondly for matters of manners in like form, if any thing were decreed or ordained by the said Sea, The points vvherin the soueraignty of the Sea of Rome vvas seene. as to be obserued generally throughout all Christendome, England presently admitted the same; though in other matters, which were either particular, nationall, or seuerall to euery Common-wealth, England followed that which was most conuenient for her state, peace and quietnes.
            14. And as for Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction and libertyes of the Church, we se by the said Magna Charta, decreed and confirmed by this King (which is the very same in effect, that his Father K. Iohn, out of the Charter of K. Henry the first, graunted vpon the 16. yeare of his raigne) and confirmed againe, and published by K. Edward his sonne, and all his Catholike Successours; that it was wholy left vnto Clergy men, and to the Sea Apostolike, and not taken nor vsed by the Kings: as namely in all matters of Spirituall dispensations, elections, institutions, admissions, confirmation
                  •
                of Prelates, and the like; all gathering of Synods, making of Ecclesiasticall decrees, excommunications, absolutions, indulgences, iudging and determining of Church-causes; wherof M. Attorney, as before you haue seen, setteth downe a longe catalogue of such causes, as cannot be iudged by the temporal law, but must necessarily be remitted to spirituall Courts: all these things (I say) matters and affaires, were left, as fully and wholy in the hands of the Bishops and English-Clergy, The manner of Ecclesiastical elections vnder K. Henry 3. with their subordination to their head the Pope, by this K. Henry, as by any of his predecessours or successours, without the intermedling of any secular man therin, as iudge, or hauing authority Ecclesiasticall, as of him self, but only by way of intercession. And this may be proued by infinite examples, but none more apparant, then by the practice of elections, and promotions of Ecclesiasticall persons; wherin though since that time, by agreement of the Sea Apostolike, Catholike temporall Princes, haue for the most parte, denomination and presentation; yet then they had not
                  •
                but that all elections were free to the Chapters of Churches and monasteries; & the confirmation commonly was sought at Rome, and the King had no more parte therin, but only that the said elections must be made by his leaue, & so presented to the Pope for confirmation.
            15. And of this, & other like matters we might giue examples without end, for that euery day they fell out. As for example



vpon the yeare 1226. which was the tenth yeare of K. Henries raigne, the Bishop of Durham Richard being dead, the K. endeauoured greatly to bring in a certaine chaplaine of his, named Luke, into that dignity, & delt earnestly with the Prior & Couēt of that C

Henry being offended therewith, sent the Bishop of Chichester with another Prior, for his Embassadours to Rome, to contradict the said election; and thereby h

                  Paris in vit. Henr. 3. an. 1226. 1228. And the same yeare determined also that great controuersie (saith our Author) that had lasted diuers years, between the Prior and Couent of the Monks of Couentry, and the Deane and Chapter of the Chanons of Lichfield, which of them should choose their Bishop; and the said Popes determination was, that one parte should choose him one tyme, and the other the other; but yet so, as the Prior of Couentry should alwayes haue the first voice in both elections, neither did the King contradict this ordination.
            16. Moreouer in this verie same yeare of 1228, died Cardinall Stephen Langhton Archbishop of Canterbury, with whome, and against whom K. Iohn moued so great troubles (as before you haue heard) who being dead, and the monkes according to order, hauing obtained licence of the King to make their election of a new, An other example of the prouision of the Church of Canterbury. they chose a monke of their owne, called VValter Hemesham; but the King after some deliberation, not liking of him, began to laie diuers obiections against him, as may bee seen in our Author that liued in those daies. But hee appealing to the Pope, went to Rome; whervpon the King, setting downe his obiections in writing, sent the Bishops of Rochester and Chester, togeather with the Archdeacon of Bedford, for his Embassadours to contradict the same also: whome Pope Gregorie hauing heard, and considered for diuers moneths togeather, gaue sentence the next yeare after against him, and at the instance both of the King & Suffragan Bishops of Canterbury, elected of himself into

            17. For first this verie Archbishop Richard being procured, as you haue seen, with such diligence by the King, three years after his election, to witt, vpon the yeare of Christ 1231. when the King in a Parlament holden at VVestminster, exacted as well of the Clergie, as of the laitie, a certaine payment or contribution of money called Scutagium, not accustomed to be paied before, 
                  Ibidem.
                the said Archbishop with his Bishops audacter resistentes dixerunt, quod non tenerentur viri Ecclesiastici iudicio subijci laicorum; boldlie resisting said vnto the King, that Clergie-men were not boūd to be vnder the iudgment of Lai-men in the Parlament. And moreouer the said Archbishop going priuatelie afterward to the King, Richard of Canterbury appealeth to Rome against K. Henry. 3. complained much of his high Iusticer Hubert de Burgo Earle of Kent, for detaining certaine lands belonging to the Sea of Canterbury; and a little after not receauing satisfaction from the King, he pronounced excommunication against the said Hubert and other detainers, and all that should keepe them companie, except onlie the King himself; and hauing done this, he appealed to Rome, and went thither himself, Against whome the King sent one Roger de Cantelù and diuers other learned men, for his procurators, whome Pope Gregorie the nynth hauing heard, gaue sentence for the said Archbishop Richard against the King: 
                  Paris an. 1231. in vit. Henr. 3. 
               Proposuerunt autem in contrarium Clerici Regis (saith Matthew Paris) pro ipso Rege & Iusticiario, multa inaniter allegantes, sed parum vel nihil profecerunt, quia causa Archiepiscopi iusta erat & fauorabilis. The Kings Clarks and Procurators proposed manie thinges to the contrarie in fauour of the King and his Iusticer, but of no moment; and consequentlie they profited little or nothing with the Pope, for that the Archbishops cause was both iust and fauourable. See heer againe the Popes authoritie in practice.
            
               18. And when this good Archbishop Richard dying in his way homeward, left the Church void againe of a Pastor, the Prior and Couent of Canterbury chose for Archbishop, one Raph Ne
                     •
                  il Bishop of Chester, and Cauncelour of the Realme, wherat the King being verie glad, sent his messengers togeather with the partie chosen, and the monkes that accompanied him to Rome, for his confirmation. But Pope Gregorie vpon the information of one Simon de Langituna, 
               Tvvo elected Archbishops of Canterbury refused by the Pope. to whom the examination of the person was committed, did refuse him, as an vnlearned man, and a Courtyer, and vnapt to preach or teach; but indeed (as some suspected) least being a great lawyer, and of much authoritie in England (for that he was Chauncellour also of the Realme) he should goe about to vndoe that couenant of temporall subiection, which King Iohn had made to the Church of Rome, and his sonne King Henry hitherto continued. But howsoeuer this was, 
                  Paris anno. 1232. he was not admitted, but the Couent of Canterbury was commaunded by the Pope to choose an other, which they did the next yeare after, choosing the Prior of their owne Couent named Iohn, whom the King accepting, he was sent to Rome with recommendation of both their letters; & at the same time, the King sent also to Rome (saith our Author) a young knight named Robert Thynne of the North-countrey, that had fallen into the Popes excommunication, for a certaine excesse of his, to the end that he might be absolued: Deprecans obnixè, vt militem illius intuitu exaudiret, Desiring the Pope most earnestly, that for his sake, he would graunt the knight pardon and absolution in the thing he came for.
            19. And albeit we may presume, that the Pope absolued the same knight, at the Kings request; yet did he not admit for Archbishop, the elected Prior, but esteeming him to be ouer aged, commaunded the Prior and Couent of Canterbury, to choose a third, which was S. Edmund of Abingdon, canonized afterward by Pope Innocentius the 4. And at the same time, he wrote very sharpe letters vnto the King of England, reprehending him for suffering certaine violent excesses to be committed against Clergie-men; Non habens respectum ad sacramenta, quae iurauerat tempore Coronationis suae, de pace Ecclesiae mantenenda, &c. As not hauing regard of the oath, which he did sweare in the tyme of his coronation, to maintaine the peace of the Church: Mandans Regi, & firmiter praecipiens sub paena excommunicationis, &c.

To which commaundement the King obayed most promptly, and sent to Rome among others, the young knight before mentioned, with diuers of his seruaunts; which well proueth the opinion he had of the Popes authority, & how farr he acknowledged the same. And many hundred other such like examples might I alleadge out of the life and large raigne of K. Henry, if it were not ouer tedious, for that this course did he hold all his dayes.
            20. And albeit there began to be in his dayes, more then before, very great repining in the people, nobility, and Clergy, first against all strangers in generall, Cōplaints of English-men against strāgers

            21. And therefore first of all, vpon the yeare 1244. which was the 28. of his raigne, he wrote a letter to Pope Innocentius the 4. in these words.

            22. Thus wrote K. Henry vpon the foresaid yeare vnto Pope Innocentius the 4. and the next yeare after, which was 1245. there being held a generall Councell at Lions (as before hath byn said) the King and Realme tooke this resolution, to send certaine procurators thither, to cōplaine of the said greiuances & hurtes, which the Realme receiued by so many strangers, placed in benefices throughout England, 
               Cōplaints made to the Councell and Pope himselfe of abuses. who had neither language to preach and teach, nor mynd or meane to keep hospitality for the poore; and that the naturall subiects of the land were heerby depriued of that preferment, & the patrons of benefices debarred of their right, to nominate, & present incumbents, by the Popes prouisions made in Rome, or of his Legats in England: which complaints seeming reasonable, were fauourably receiued in the said Councell, as may appeare by diuers rescripts of the said Pope Innocētius, to the Archbishops and Bishops of England, about prouiding the benefices vnder their charge, with fit English men: Vniuersitatem vestram monemus, rogamus, & hortamur, &c.
               We doe warne, beseech & exhorte the whole body of your Realme, and doe commaund you by these our Apostolicall letters, that you haue great care of all the youthes of your Cittyes and Diocesses, that are Clergie men, or desire to be,

                  The popes seuerall orders for prouiding for Englishmen. And againe in another Breue to the said Archbishops and Bishops: VVe doe exhorte & commaund you, to bestow the Ecclesiasticall benefices belonging to your collation, when they shall fall void, vpon fit men of your nation, &c. And yet further in a third Breue: Volentos iura vestra illaefa ser

But yet the next yeare after, the King calling a generall Parlament at London, and the former greiuances not seeming to be sufficiently remedied, by the said recourse to the Councell, & answers and promises of the Pope; the same complaints were renewed againe with greater exasperation then before, and the said greiuances put downe in writing.

And so presently were written letters seuerally to be sent by the said messengers; Frist by the Archbishops and Bishops; Secondly by the Abbots, Priors, & religious men; Thirdly by the Earls, Barons, and communitie of the Parlament; Fourthly by the King himself, who wrote not only to the Pope, as the rest did, but a seueral letter also to the Cardinals, to further the suite, which letters are set downe by Mathew Paris at length, and are to long for this place.
            24, Yet one thing I cannot omit, that wheras the King wrote most deuoutly & humbly, both to the Pope & Cardinals, saying that he did make recourse in these complaints of his nobility and subiects, to the Church of Rome, Vt filius ad matrem, quem suis lactavit vberibus, as a sonne to his mother, whome she hath nourished with her teates of mylke:

            25. And by this we may se where the beginning was of those restraints, which afterward in the dayes of other ensuing Kings were made against prouisions from Rome, and benefices to be giuen to strangers: as also against appeals in certaine cases, & other such like ordinances, which seeme to containe some restraint of the execution of the Popes Ecclesiasticall authority in England. Which did not rise, as you see, vpon any change of former faith or iudgement in religion, The beginning & originall cause of al restraints. or calling in question the said Popes spirituall iurisdiction ouer soules; but only vpon temporall respects, reasons of state, and the like, which concerned nothing at all, faith, or beleife, or substance of religion.

Doth he alleadge any one Law or Statute of his? (for that he was the father and founder of our Statute-lawes, as he confesseth) doth he produce any one decree, wherby he declared, that he thought himself to haue supreme spirituall authority? or denyed, or called in question that of the Sea Apostolike, notwithstanding all the greiuances which before haue byn mentioned? No truly: no one word is alleadged therof, though otherwise as I said, this K. Henry made many Statutes, at sundry Parlaments; as for example vpon the 9. yeare of his raigne, he made the famous Charter wherof we haue spoken before, called Magna Charta, containing 37.

and shall haue all her holy rites and libertyes inuiolable.
So 
                     〈◊〉
                   first and most ancient Statute, and the cheifest liberty of the Church of England, is vnderstood to haue byn their free dependance of the Sea Apostolike, and their recourse therevnto without interruption, or intermedling of any secular power in their Ecclesiasticall affaires.
               27. Besides this, there was made by him in the same 9. yeare of his raigne, the other notorious Charter, named Charta de Foresta: cōtaining 16. Chapters or braūches; as also the other named Merton vpon the 20. yeare of the said Kings raigne, that hath six seuerall braunches or Statutes; as diuers others also made vpon the 51. year of the said Kings raigne, intituled vnder diuers particular titles; The statutes of K. Henry all in fauour of the Clergye. as Dies communes in Banco: Dies communes in dote: District
                        •••
                      Scaeccariae: Iudicium Collistrigij de compositione mensurarum, and the like. And finally the other booke of Statutes made vpon 52. yeare, called Marle-bridge, containing 16. braunches or statutes. In all which no one thing is found in fauour of M. Attorney or his assertion, but many for vs, if we would examine the partes and clauses of euery one. For that the religion of England in that tyme being perfectly Catholike, and agreeing in all things with it self, & with other Kingdomes of the world in one manner of beliefe, and acknowledgement of the dependance of Spirituall and Ecclesiasticall power from the Sea Apostolike; they could not make lawes, for ordering their temporall affaires, but must needs enterlace many things, that did testifie the conformitie and subordination therof to the spirituall. And if any temporall lawyer in England at this day, though of far inferiour account and place to M. Attorney, would take vpon him to write a booke, & alleadge all the lawes, both common and statute, and braunches therof, that doe confirme, allow, or strengthen the Catholike Religion, from most auncient tymes, wherin any memory is of our lawes; he might so far ouerbeare M. Attorney both in bulke and substance, and truth of his allegations, as S. Augustines volumes (for example) doe exceed in all these points Esops fables. And this will you see in parte, by that which we are now first to examine in this place I meane his first obiection, set downe out of King Henry, which shall goe in this owne words, as before we haue accustomed.
               
                  The Attorney.
                  In all the time of K. Henry the third, and his progenitours Kings



of England, and ouer sithence, if any man doe sue afore any Iudge Ecclesiasticall within this Realme, for any thing, 2. H. 3. tit. Prohibitiō 13. 4. H. 3. Ibidem. 15. 15. H. 3. tit. Prohibitiō 22. Regist. fol.
                      wherof that court, by allowance and custome, had not lawfull Conusaunce, the King did euer by his writ, vnder the great seale, prohibite them to proceed. And if the suggestion made to the King, whervpon the prohibition was grounded, were after found vntrue; then the King by his writ of consultation, vnder his great seale, did allow and permit them to proceed. Also in all the raigne of Henry the third, and his progenitours Kings of England, and euer sithence, if any issue were ioyned vpon the loyalty of marriage, generall bastardy, or such like, the King did euer write to the Bishop of that Diocesse, as mediate officer & minister to his courte, to certifie the loyalty of marriage, bastardy, or such like: all which doe apparantly proue, that those Ecclesiasticall Courts were vnder the Kings iurisdiction and commaundement, and that one of the Courts were so necessarily incident to the other, as the one without the other could not deliuer iustice to the parties, as well in these particular cases, as in a number of cases before specified, wherof the Kings Ecclesiasticall Courte hath iurisdiction. Now to commaund and to be obayed, belonge to soueraigne, and supreme gouernment, &c.
                  
               
               
                  The Catholike Deuine.
                  28. The conclusion or inference vpon this narration, must be noted by the Reader, to be M. Attorneys owne, and not to be taken out of any other lawyers booke, as the former parte of the narratiō is, that telleth vs, how the King appointeth, that ech Court, both spirituall and temporall, shall handle matters and causes, The explication of the lavv. proper and peculiar vnto them, and the one not to intrude it self into the affaires of the other; and to this effect are his vvrits appointed of prohibition, where matters are assumed, which ought not in that Courte to be treated, and of consultation to will them to proceed, when their right is knowne. All which maketh for vs, shewing that the King would haue the subordination between these two Courts to be obserued, and the spirituall to direct the temporall, where any one thing might belonge vnto them both. As for example, if any man were impeached of bastardy, & thervpon his inheritance were claimed by another, the Ecclesiasticall Court was first to giue sentence of the marriage, whether it were lawfull, or no; & then according to that sentēce was the tēporal Court to giue possession, or not, of the inheritāce.
                  
                     29. And that this was the true sincere meaning of the law at that time, intending therby to shew the excellency and prerogatiue of the Bishops spirituall Courts, aboue the Kings temporall; is plaine and euident by an other Statute of this maner (which M. Attorney would not see) made in the 9. yeare of King Henry the 6. where it is ordained in explication of the former, that when any such Plea of bastardie is held in any Courte of the Kings, the Iudges therof shall make proclamation once in their Courte, & the Chauncelour of England certified therof by them, shall cause to be made 3. seuerall proclamatiōs, in 3. seuerall moneths, in the Chaūcery: 
                        Stat. an. 9. 
                           
                              〈◊〉
                           . 6. cap. 11.
                     That al persons pretending any interest, to obiect against the party, shall sue to the Ordinary (or Bishop) to whom the writ of certificate from the said Iudge or Iudges, is, or shall be directed, to make their allegations, and obiections against the party, as the law of Holy Church requireth. And that without this forme obserued, al other processe shal be voide, &c. 30.
And by this we may see how carefull the auncient lawes were to haue the spirituall Courte, as the superiour, well informed according to the law of Holy Church; and how not only ordinary Iudges, but the Chauncellour of England himself, & his highest Court of Chauncery was appointed to serue vnto this: Spirituall co
                           ••
                        tes superior to the tē
                        porall. for that of the spirituall Courts iudgement, depended in all such causes, the iudgement of the temporall Courts. And by this you will se also, the vaine sleight of M. Attorney, in telling vs, that the King did euer write vnto the Bishop of that Diocesse, as mediate officer and minister to his Courte, to certifie the loyaltie of marriage, &c. For where doth he find in any ancient law at all, those words (as mediate officer and minister to his Courte) & in the latine, himself leaueth out the words, to his Courte; though in calling the Bishop mediate officer, or minister, which is as much to say, as superior officer, (for that in mediation and subordination of officers, and ministers that gouerne, the mediate hath the higher roome, in respect of the people and Court wherof he is officer) he includeth a contradiction against himselfe, for then is the said Bishop also aboue all immediate temporall Iudges, that must giue him certificate (wherof the Chauncellour we se is one) euen in the Kings temporall Courts themselues.
                  31. But the inference is much more subtile, when M. Attorney saith:
All which doe apparantly proue, that those Ecclesiasticall Courts, were vnder the Kings iurisdiction and cōmaundement.
But M. Attorney must



not so huddle vp iurisdiction and commaundement, for that no man will deny, but that all sortes of persons (as before hath byn said) are vnder the cōmaundement, & gouernement of the temporall Prince, whom he may commaund, ech one to doe their office & duty in the Cōmon-wealth. And so may he appoint Ecclesiastical Courts, to notifie their sentences, iudgements, & proceedings to his Courts, & his Courts to informe the Ecclesiastical Courts, for good & mutuall correspondence between them both, which we graunt also to be necessary in euery Common-wealth.
                  32. But iurisdiction, which M. Attorney craftely confoundeth heer and shuffleth vp with commaundement, is a far different thing, importing a higher authority in the same kinde: as if the temporall Prince haue iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall vpon Bishops and their spirituall Courtes; Hovv spirituall Courtes are the Kings courtes. then doth it follow that all their power in spirituall matters is subordinate to him, and deriued from him; and so were there no necessity of this distinction, and subordination of spirituall and temporall Courts. For that the Prince hauing both powers in himself, might giue the same vnto any temporal Iudge to decide Ecclesiastical matters also in his Court: which yet M. Attorney doth often deny, that the Common-lawes can take conusaunce of such affaires. And surely it is worth no lesse then laughter, to heare him repeat so often The Kings Ecclesiasticall Courte, as though this were sufficient to proue the Kings Ecclesiasticall authority in those Courts, for that all Courts are the Kings Courts, in that they are vnder his protection, gouernement, and direction, and to the vse, and profit of his people. And so were also the Ecclesiasticall Courts of King Henry the third in this sense, who yet chalenged no spirituall authority therin, as by our whole former discourse you haue seen.
                  33. But now let vs contemplate a little the last conclusion of M. Attorney vpon this narration.
Now to commaund (saith he) and to be obayed, belongeth to soueraigne and supreme gouernement:
which we deny not in the sense, wherin it may be true; that is, to commaund, and to be obaied in temporall matters, belongeth to soueraignty in that kinde; and to commaund, M. Attorneys inference hovv it holdeth and holdeth not. and be obaied in spirituall matters, belongeth to soueraignty in those affaires: wherof you haue heard many examples, concerning the Sea of Rome before alleadged. But for the King, and his temporall officers to demaund a certificate from the Bishops Court (for the Statute vsed not the word, of cōmaunding or obaying) to let them know thereby, what



the Bishops sentence and iudgement is, to the end they may frame theirs accordingly; this by M. Attorneys leaue is no commaunding in the iurisdiction it self of spirituall affaires; and consequently inferreth no Ecclesiasticall soueraignty. And if he be not satisfied by that which we haue already alleadged, out of the raigne of K. Henry the third, of spirituall soueraignty acknowledged by him, and all his Realme in the Sea of Rome, but would see further some examples in particular of the same soueraignty, or superiority at least, vsed and practised by the Bishops of England towards the King himself and Realme in that kind; let him consider these examples following besides the former.
                  34. When K. Henry the third vpon the 16. yeare of his raigne falling out with Hubert de Burgo Earle of Kent, that had byn his great fauourite, & high Iusticer for many former years, cast him into prison, and he escaping, fled to a certaine Chappel for Sanctuary, Diuers examples ouerthrovving M. Attorneys commentarye. from whence the King had caused him to be drawne forth; Roger Bishop of London (for that it was in his Diocesse) came vnto him, and said, that except he caused him to be restored to the place of Sanctuary againe, Ipse omnes huius violentiae authores excommunicationis sententia innodaret. He would bind all the authors of this violence vsed, by the sentence of excōmunication. And what followed of this? Did the King deny his authority? or say that he was not vnder his iurisdiction? or that himself had supreme authority and iurisdiction ouer the Bishop in that case? (as he might haue done according to M. Attorneys assertiō) No: For the words of Mathew Paris immediately following, are these: 
                        Paris anno. 1
                           •
                        32.
                     Rex autem licet inuitus, reatum suum intelligens, remisit Hubertum ad Capellain, & vbi captus suerit à militibus armatis, restituitur ab ijsdem, quint
                           •
                         Calendas Octobris.
The King, The King obeyed the Bishop of London in restoring Earle Hubert. though against his will, perceiuing his owne fault, sent backe Earle Hubert to the Chappell againe, where he was restored, vpon the fifth day before the Calends of October, by the same armed souldiars, that had drawne him from thence. And the same Author addeth, that the Kings anger was so great, as he commaunded the Earles of Hartford and Essex, to set souldiars about the said Chappell, that no meate might be giuen him, vntill he rendred himself. And not many dayes after this the said Earle Hubert being carried from that Chappel, vpon composition, vnto the castle of Vise in the Diocesse of Salisbury, he by help of two souldiars that kept him, escaping thence, got into a Parish Church neer by, out of which being taken by the Kings



officers, Robert Bishop of Salisbury, excommunicated them altogeather, with their aiders and defenders, and then went to the King in companie of other Bishops, to denounce vnto him the said sentence, who after much resistance, yeelded, saith our Author; 
                        Paris. Ibid.
                      
                     Et in eadem Ecclesia, concedente (sed inuito) Rege, remissus est 15. Calend. Nouemb. And so the said Earle Hubert was sent backe againe out of the said Castle, vnto the Church, the King yeelding thervnto, though against his will, vpon the 15. day before the Calends of Nouember in the yeare 1232.
                  35. The next yeare after this againe, the forsaid Roger Bishop of London, hauing been at Rome, & returned to Douer, found there VValter Bishop of Carleile in his iourney towards Rome, hauing appealed to the Pope against K. Henry, for certaine iniuries offered him, and to his Church, as he pretended; and albeit the King did not let or forbid his repaire to Rome, yet shewing himself much displeased therewith, his officers at the port handled him verie discourteouslie, and denied him passage without the Kings licence: which the said Bishop of London seeing, K Henry obeyed the B. of London in spirituall matters. excommunicated all the Kings officers, that had parte in that violence, and then going to Hereford, where the King at that time lay with a great army to inuade VVales, and taking certaine Bishops with him, they tolde his Maiesty of the abuse committed. Which, when the K. seemed not to care for, or not willing to redresse, they renewed there againe in the Kings presence, the sentence of excommunication against the said malefactors, and all those that assisted or fauoured them.
Non mediocriter Rege murmurante (saith our Author) & ne talem ferrent sententiam prohibente.
The King not a little repinning, and forbidding them to pronounce any such sentence; So as heere we see commaunding without obaying in spirituall matters, meeteth with M. Attorneys conclusion, that to commaunde, and to bee obaied, belongeth to soueraignty, and supreme gouernement.
                  
                  36. And yet further the next yeare ensuing, which was the 18. of K. Henries raigne, the King being highlie offended with the Earle Marshall of England, 
                     The Bishops refuse to excommunicate at the Kings appointment. for entring into a certaine Castle of his owne, by force:
Praecepit Episcopis cunctis, vt Mariscallum nominatim excommunicarent. Sed illi è contrae communiter dixerunt; Indignum esse, quia Castellum, quod suum fuit, occupauit.
The King commaunded all the Bishops (being gathered togeather in Parlament) to excommunicate by name, the Earle Marshall. But they answered



him with one voice to the contrarie; that hee deserued it not, for so much, as he had taken, but his owne Castle. And heere againe we see cōmaunding without obaying in spiritual affaires. And if the King had thought himself, to be supreme in Ecclesiasticall authoritie, he might haue excommunicated the Marshall himself, without depending of his Bishops.
                  37. And a few dayes after this againe vpon the yeare 1234. the holy man Edmund, that afterward was canonized for a Saint, being consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury, at which consecration, the King himself was present with his nobility, and 13. Bishops, (as our Author recounteth) the said Archbishop after his consecration, consulting with the said Bishops & nobility, about the pittifull State of the Realme, deuided in it self by the Kings euill gouernment, that followed the counsaile of Pictauians, 
                     
                        Paris. anno. 1234. and other strangers; the said Archbishop went to the King, laid the inconueniences before him, humbly besought him to take the true remedy, which was to dismisse those strangers, and if he would not, S. Edmōd Archb. of Canterbury threatneth excōmunication to the King if he obey him not. he should be forced to vse Ecclesiasticall Censures against them:
Et ipse in cōtinenti, cum omnibus, qui aderant, Praelatis, in ipsum regem sententiam serret excommunicationis:
He would out of hand, with all the Bishops there present, pronounce the sentence of excommunication against the King himself. Rex autem peris audicas, humiliter respondit; quod consilijs corum in omnibus obtemperaret, &c. And the pious King hearing this, did answere humbly, that he would in all things obay their counsailes. And so he did, and within few dayes after, he sent away Peter, Bishop of VVinchester from the Courte, which was the cheife of the said strangers that most defended them, and cast into prison another Peter surnamed De Rhicuallis, that had byn Treasurer, and diuers others. So as heere also we see the spirituall authority of Clergie-men aboue the King; not only in the Pope himself, but also in the Bishops of England, which otherwise were subiects to the said King in temporall affaires.
                  38. Yea, not only Bishops, but other Prelates also of lesser degree, haue exercised the same authority spirituall in England, euen against the King when occasion was offered. As for example, 
                        Paris anno. 1215. pag. 656. when this K. Henry had vsed very familiarly & intrinsecally, one Raph Briton, that had byn his Treasurer, he after falling out with him, banished him the Courte: and soone after that againe, the said Raph being a Clerke, and liuing at his Chanonry of S. Pauls,


                     
the Maior of London had commission to apprehend him, K. Henry obeyed the Deane of Paules in spirituall authority. and send him to the Tower, as he did: which Doctor Lusey Deane of Pauls vnderstāding, called his Chanons togeather (the Bishops of London being absent) & seeing the violence vsed to a Clergy-man, did put the Church of S. Paul vnder Interdict, & pronoūced sentence of excommunication against the doers, maintainers, and fauourers of this vnlawfull act. The King stood stiffe for a time (saith our Author) but at length, Rex dictum Ranulphum, licet inuitus, solui, & in pace dimitti praecepit. The King though against his will, did commaund the said Raph to be remitted peaceably vnto the place, whence he was taken.
                  39. Now then these examples and many more which for breuityes sake I pretermit, doe make another manner of proofe of Ecclesiastical soueraignty in Clergie-men, then doth M. Attorneys poore inferēce about the sending for a certificate to the Bishops Court, concerning matters to be tried therin, as before you haue heard. And by this also you may see, and consider the difference of substance, and substantiall dealing between vs. And so much to this first instance. Now let vs examine the second.
               
               
                  The Attorney.
                  
                     By the aūcient Canōs & decrees of the Church of Rome, the issue borne before solemnization of marriage is as lawfull & inheritable (marriage following) as the issue borne after marriage. But this was neuer allowed or appointed in England, and therfore was neuer of any force heere. And this appeareth by the Statute of Merton, 
                        The Statute of Merton. an. 20. Hen. 3. made in the 20. yeare of Henry the 3. where it is said to the Kings writ of bastardy: Whether one being borne afore matrimony, may inherit in like manner, as he that is borne after matrimony? All the Bishops answered, that they would not, nor could not answere to it, because it was directly against the common order of the Church: and all the Bishops instanted the Lords that they would consent, that all such as were borne before matrimony should be legitimate, as wel as they that be borne within matrimony, to the succession of inheritance; for so much as the Church accepteth such to be legitimate. And all the Earles and Barons with one voice answered, we will not change the lawes of England, which hitherto haue byn vsed, and approued.
                  
               
               
                  The Catholike Deuine.
                  40. This is the second instance of M. Attorney, taken out of this raigne of K. Henry; and we must imagine, that proofes goe hard



with him, when to seeme to say somwhat, he is driuen to bring forth such silly ware, as this is. For if all be graunted (as it may be) which heere is said, what can he inferre therof, but only, that the Lords and Barons of the Parlament, This instance proueth nothing. did not thinke good to alter or change the auncient laws, or customes of the Realme, about succession of their children, by legitimation, after matrimony contracted: notwithstanding the Church of Rome in certaine cases did allow them for legitimate and lawfull, in respect of taking holy orders, enioying benefices, and other like commodityes: what (I say) doth this import M. Attorneys conclusion, that K. Henry tooke vpon him supreme Ecclesiastical gouernmēt? For that this was free for the Realme to admitt, or not admit the said legitimation, to the effect of lawfull succession and inheritance. And so the Canons themselues doe expresly set downe.
                  41. For better vnderstanding wherof, wee must note, that wheras by the auncient Ciuill-law, great respect was had euer to children, borne out of wedlocke, if marriage afterward did ensue, notwithstanding they held marriage but only for a Ciuill cōtract: so afterward when Christian Emperours came to beare sway, more indulgence and fauour was shewed therin; as may appeer by the Constitutions, both of Constantine the first Christian Emperour, and Zeno that ensued him, and more yet by Iustinian, 
                     
                        See the Code l. 5. tit. 27. log. 1. Constant & lib. 5. Imper. Ze 1. & lib. 10. Imper. Iustin. & Nouell. constit. 89. de natural. liberis. §. Siquis igitur. &c. Lib. 4. Decret. tit. 17. cap. 6. which do most fully in diuers places, both of the Code, and Nouell Constitutions explicate the same. In conformity wherof the Canon-law also decreeth in this sorte:
Tanta est vis matrimonij, vt qui anteà sunt geniti, post contractum matrimonium legitimi habeantur.
So great is the force of matrimony (held for a Sacrament among Christians) as it maketh such to be legitimate after it is cōtracted, who were illegitimate before. But yet this is with some restrictions: as for example, that they must be borne, ex soluto & soluta: that is to say both the father, & mother must be vnmarried at the time when the said children are begotten. For if either of them were married at that time, then this priuiledge holdeth not, as  
                        Cap. Cō
                        questus est. appeareth in the same law.
                  42. Secondly this legitimation by ensuing marriage, is to bee vnderstood principallie, as before hath said, In spiritualibus: To enable men to Ecclesiasticall promotions, though in the Popes temporall dominions it may enable them also to temporall succession, but not in the States and dominions of other Princes. And this verie distinction or caution is set downe in like manner



by the  
                        Cap. 13. Per venerabilem. law it self; and heervpon is resolued also in a case touching the King of England, by Pope Alexander the 3. that albeit the Ecclesiasticall Iudge must determine of the lawfulnes of marriage it self; yet the question of temporall succession, or inheritance therevpon depending, must bee decided by the Iudges of the temporall Courte: 
                        Ilidom. Cap. 7. Causam quae.
                     Nos attendentes (saith Pope Alexander to the Bishops of London and VVorcester) quod ad Regem pertinet, non ad Ecclesiam de talibus possessionibus iudicare, Fraternitati vestrae mandamus, quatenus Regi possessionis iudicium relinquentes, de causa principali cognoscatis, eamque terminetis.
Wee considering that it belongeth to the King of England, and not to the Church to iudge of such possessions, as depend of legitimation; we commaund your brotherhoods, that leauing the iudgment of the said possessions to the King and his Courts, you examine onlie the principall cause, concerning the loialtie of the marriage it self, and determine the same.
                  43. Heerby then wee see first, that M. Attorney alleadging this instance, hath alleadged nothing at all against vs, or for himself. For that when the Earls and Barons refused to change the laws of England, concerning inheritance vpon legitimation, they said no more, then is allowed them by the Canon-law it self, as you haue heard. And how will M. Attorney inferre of this, that K. Henry the third, held himself to haue supreme authority ecclesiasticall; for that this must be his conclusion out of his instance, or els he saith nothing,
                  44. And it shall not be amisse to note by the way, how these men doe vse to ouer-lash in their asseueratiōs, to help their feeble cause thereby. M. Attorney mistaketh and mis-relateth the matter.
                     By the auncient Canons and Decrees of the Church of Rome (saith he) the issue borne before solemnization of marriage, is as lawfull and inheritable (marriage following) as the issue borne after marriage.
But this is not sincerely related: For the Canon-law, as you haue heard, putteth diuers restrictions, both in the persons to be legitimated, and in the ends and effects, whervnto they are legitimated; as also concerning the Countries & Kingdomes, wherin they are legitimated. Of all which variety of circumstances and considerations M. Attorney saying nothing, his intention therin may easily be ghessed at. And so much for this matter.
               
            
         
         
            
            OF THE LIVES AND RAIGNES OF KING EDVVARD The first, and second; Father, and sonne: And what arguments M. Attorney draweth from them, towards the prouing of his purpose. CHAP. XI.
            HAVING now come downe by orderly descent of seauen hundred yeares & more, of the raignes of our Christian English Kings, & shewed them all to haue byn of one, and the self same Catholicke Roman religion, & comforme also in the point of this our controuersie, about the acknowledgement and practise of the spirituall power, and authoritie of the Sea Apostolicke in England, concerning ecclesiasticall affaires: And hauing declared the same so largely, as you haue heard, in three Henries since the Conquest, of famous memory and authoritie aboue the rest, and the last of them author also, and parent of all Statute-law in our Realme; we are to examine now in order three Edwardes lineally succeeding the one to the other, and all three proceeding from this last named Henry. Vnder which Edwardes and their ofspring, M. Attorney pretēdeth more restraint to haue byn made in some points, of the Popes externall iurisdiction, then vnder former Kings; which though it be graunted vpon some such occasions (as after shalbe shewed) yet will you fynd the matter far shorte of that conclusion, which he pretendeth to maintayne, that hereby they tooke vpon them spirituall soueraingty in causes Ecclesiasticall. You shall see it by the triall.
            
               
               OF KING EDVVARD THE FIRST, VVhich vvas the nynth King after the Conquest. §. I.
               2. When King Henry the third dyed, This King began his raigne an. 1272. and raigned 35. yeares vntill 1307. his eldest sonne Prince Edward was occupied in the wars of the Holy land, being then of the age of thirty three yeares, who hearing of his Fathers death, retourned presently homeward, and passing by the Citty of Rome, found there newly made Pope, Gregory the tenth, called before Theobald, with whome in tymes past, he had familiarly byn acquainted, whiles he was Legate for his predecessor Vrbane the fourth, in the said warrs of the Holy-land; who receaued him with all honour and loue, 
                     Stovv in vita Edouards pr
                           •••
                        .
                  
                  and graunted vnto him (saith Stow) the tenth of all Ecclesiasticall benefices in England, as well temporall, as spirituall, for one yeare, & the like to his brother Edmund for an other, in recompence of their expences made in the Holy-land.
Whervpon, when the next yeare after, the said Gregory called a generall Councell at Lions in France (which was the second held in that place) of aboue fiue hundred Bishops, and a thousand other Prelates, King Edward sent also a most honourable embassage thither, both of Bishops and Noble-men.
               3. This King Edward beginning his raigne in the yeare of Christ 1272. continued the same for almost 35. yeares, King Edvvard surnamed Long-shanke. with variable euents. For as he was a tall, and goodly Prince in person, high in stature, and thereof surnamed Long-shanke; so was he in mynd also no lesse war-like, haughty, earnest, and much giuen to haue his owne will by any meanes whatsoeuer, when once he set himself theron: though yet when he was in calme, & out of passion, he shewed himself a most religious, and pious Prince.
               4. Of the later may be example among other things, his speciall deuotion to the Blessed Virgin mother of our Sauiour, which both Mathew VVestminster, 
                  Deuotion of K. Edvvard. and VValsingham doe recount from the very beginning of his raigne, & doe cōtinue the same throughout



his life, by occasion of many strange and miraculous 
                     〈◊〉
                   from imminent dangers, which himself ascribed to the said d
                     •
                  
                  uotion, and to our Blessed Ladies speciall protection. Wherevnto may be referred in like māner, the piety of the said King, shewed in diuers other occasions. As first of all, when in the first yeare of his raigne he voluntarily set forth, published, and confirmed the Great Charter made by his Father in fauour of the Church, saying as in the said Charter is to be read: 
                     Magna Charta.
                   
                  Pro salute animae nostrae, & animarum antecessorum & successorum nostroruus Regum Angliae, ad exaltationem Sanctae Ecclesiae, & emendationem Regni nostri, spontanea & bona reluntate nostra, dedimus & concessinius, &c. We haue giuen and graunted freely, & of our owne good will, this Charter, for the health of our soule, and of the soules, as well of our predecessours, as successours, Kings of England, to the exaltation of holy Church, and amendment of our Kidgdome, &c.
               
               5. And the like piety he shewed in many other occasions in like manner, as namely, when he being in his iourney with a great army towards Scotland, and his wife Q. Eleanor daughter to King Ferdinand the third of Spaine, surnamed the Saint, a most vertuous & religious Lady falling sicke, & dying neere the borders therof, he leauing his course, retourned backe with her dead body to London: 
                     VValsingam in vitae Edvvards p. anno. 1191. 
                  Cunctis diebus vitae suae eam plangebat (saith Walsingham) & Iesum benignum iugis precibus pro ea interpellabat, eleemosynarum largitiones, & Missarum celebrationes pro ea diuersis Regni locis ordinans in perpetuum & procurans. 
                  King Edvvard praied and gaue almes for his Queenes soule. The King did bewayle this Queenes death all the dayes of his life, and did by continual prayers, call vpon mercifull Iesus, to vse mercy towards her, ordeyning great store of almes to be giuen for her, as also procuring Masses to be said for her soule, in diuers partes of the Kingdome.
               6. And moreouer in all the places where the said body rested, as it came to London, he erected great goodly crosses in her memory: Vt à transeuntibus (saith VValsingham) pro eius anima deprecetur: that such as passed by, seing that crosse, might pray for her soule. And moreouer in particuler, Crosses erected. 
                  Stow out of auncient recordes doth affirme, the said King to haue bestowed two mannors, and nyne hamlets of land, vpon the monastery of VVestminster, for the keeping of yearely obits for the said Queene, and for money to be giuen to the poore in almes.
               7. I leaue to speake of many other such actions of his, as that he procured amongst other things, the solemne & most honourable



translations of the bodyes of three English saints, VVorkes of piety of King

                     dvvard. in his dayes, S. Richard Bishop of Chichester S. Hugh Bishop of Lincolne, and S. VVilliam Archbishop of Yorke: He consented also and concurred that Q Eleanor his mother, should leaue her Princely state and dignity, and to be veyled Nunne in the Monastery of Almesbury, and enioy her dowry (which was great) that she had in England all dayes of her life,

                   which was also confirmed to her by the Popes authority: (saith Mathew VVestminster) yea and soone after he consented in like manner, that his owne dearest daughter the Lady Mary also (to whom he had designed a great and high state by marriage) should follow the like profession of religions life in the same monastery, though in this later he had much more difficulty to wynne himself to consent thervnto, then in the former.
               8. And finally, this other act also may be added for a full complement of his piety, when he was in good tune, which is recorded by the said Mathew of VVestminster that liued at the same time, and perhaps was present; that in the yeare of Christ 1297. which was the tenth before he dyed, being to passe ouer the seas towards his warrs, and hauing extremely vexed his people, both spiritualty and temporalty, with heauy exactions for the same, and in particular broken grieuously with Robert VVinchelsey Archbishop of Canterbury, he being now ready to departe, called all the people togeather, vpon the 13. of Iuly, before the great hall of VVestminster, and there standing vp vpon a certayne scaffolde of timber, the said Archbishop of Canterbury, newly reconciled vnto him, remaining on the one side, and the Earle of VVarwicke on the other, and his little Prince Edward before him: 
                     Vestmonasteriensis anne 1197. A pious & patheticall speach of King Edvvard. 
                  Erumpentibus lachrymis (saith our Author) veniam de commissis humiliter postulauit, &c. the teares breaking forth, he did most humbly aske forgiuenes of his subiects, for all that he had committed against them, confessing that he had not gouerned them so well, and quietly as became a King to doe, but had taken their goods from them, &c. Adding further and saying:
Beholde I go now to expose my self, and my life to danger for you: wherefore I aske at your hands, that if I returne againe, you will receaue me in the place that now you hold me, and I shall restore vnto you againe all that I haue taken from you, and if I returne not, then take this my childe, and crowne him for your King. Whervnto the Archbishop weeping abundantly, answered that it should be so, and the people with crying out, and casting vp their armes, promised



fidelity, and obedience vnto his ordination. So Mathew VVestminster. And this for his piety.
               
                
                  King Edvvardes occasions of dealing in VVales and Scotland.
                  9. But of the other point of his peremptory and violent proceeding diuers times with his subiects, there want not also many examples, especially in exacting often, and great subsidies at their hands, for his warrs of France, Scotland, and VVales, wherin he was continually imployed; & was the first King in deed, that euer brought VVales to be wholy subiect to England, Lecline the last Prince therof being taken and slaine, and his brother Dauid likewise apprehended, and put to death in London by the same K. Edward.
               
               10. Alexander also King of Scotland being deceased, and all his issue extinguished, K. Edward as chiefe Lord, tooke vpon him to decide that controuersie for the succession, and in the end determined the matter in fauour of Iohn Baliol Earle of Galloway, against Robert Bruse Earle of Valenand, that pretended the same. And albeit the whole nobility, and people of Scotland bound themselues by obligation (which our historyes doe set downe) to stand to the iudgement of the said K. Edward: 
                  
                     VValsingam anno. 1292. in vita Edouards.
                   yet in the end they would not, but assisted the said Bruse, & made recourse to Pope Boniface the 8. to prohibite K. Edward to proceed in that matter, and to commaund him to surcease from his warrs against Scotland, which they pretended to be in the protection of the Sea of Rome: and finally after much bloudshed, and infinite expences, both in this Kings tyme and his successours, the of-spring of Bruse preuayled in that Countrey.
               11. But now (as I said) in respect of these warrs, and many necessityes theron depending, K. Edward was forced greatly to presse his people with exactions, and to make them forfaite, and buy againe their libertyes, especially that of Magna charta, 
                  King Edvvardes mutabilitie in keeping priuiledges. and of the Charter of Forrest, which as voluntarily, he set forth and published in the beginning of his raigne, as you haue heard: so afterward (the same not being obserued) vpon instant suites of his people and nobility, and contributions graunted him for the renouation therof, he confirmed it two or three tymes in his life, & as often reuoked the same againe, vntill he had more money. And last of all, 
                     Math. Vestmonast. & VValsingam anno. 1307. in the yeare 1307. which was the last of his raigne, he sued to the Pope for a dispensation of his oath, made in that behalfe to keepe the said Charters & priuiledges, affirming them to be made against his wil, & by force of his peoples importunity.
               
                  12. We reade also, that in the yeare 1278. and sixt of his raigne, 
                     Math. Vestmon. an. 1278. he did depriue many famous Monasteryes (saith Mathew of VVestminster) of their auncient accustomed libertyes, & namely among others, the Monastery of VVestminster, wherin he had receaued (saith he) both baptisme, confirmation, and coronation, and wherin his Fathers, and other his auncestours bodyes lay. And moreouer, in the yeare 1295. he vsed great violence to all Monkes and religious men, Violent proceeding of K. Edvvard. that were strangers, and had their Monasteryes buylded by straungers in England: for he tooke their Monasteries and goods from them, allowing only to euery Monke 18. pence a weeke for his mayntenaunce, for a tyme: & the next yeare after he commaunded vpon the suddaine all the Monasteryes of England to be searched, and all their treasure to be taken violently, and to be brought to London to his Exchequer, for the charges of his said warrs. And two yeares after this againe, the same King holding his Parlament at S. Edmunds-bury, and demaunding a great contribution of his people, the Clergy denyed it, pretending a new commaundement and constitution lately made by Pope Bonifacius the eight, wherby he did forbid vnder paine of excommunication, that any such exactions should be paid by Ecclesiasticall men, without consent of the Sea Apostolicke; wherat King Edward being offended, A sleight of K. Edvvard against the Clergie. though he would not contradicte the said constitution; yet he excluded the Clergy, that refused to pay, from his protection, and from the protection of the lawes; whereby they being abandoned, and exposed to all iniuryes, the most of them fell to composition with the King, & so bought out, and purchased their protection againe, more deerer then they might haue continued the same by their contribution.
               13. And as for the Archbishop of Canterbury that stood constant amongst the rest in that denyall: 
                     In anno. 1294. 
                  Omnia bona eius (saith Mathew of VVestminster) mobilia, & immobilia capta sunt in manu Regis. All his goods both moueable & vnmoueable were taken into the Kings hands. And the same Authour doth recount infinite other intollerable vexations, laid vpon them that would not agree to the Kings demaunds in those affaires, which were accompanyed with such threates and terrors, as the Deane of Paules in London, named VVilliam Mont-fort, comming one day before the King, to speake for his Chanons, was so terrifyed, as he became mute, and fell downe dead before him: which yet (saith out Author) moued



little the King, but that he persisted in his demaundes. And one day sending a knight, named Syr George Hauering, to the Monastery of VVestminster, when all the Monkes were there gathered togeather in their Refectory, or dyning-place, the said knight proposed in the Kings name, that they would graunt him halfe their reuenewes for his warrs, A Knight sent to force the Monkes of VVestminster to yelde by feare to the Kings vvill. and if any wil deny this demaund (saith he) let him stand vp, & shew himself, that he may be handled as one guilty of breaking the Kings peace: Whervpon all yeelded, saith Mathew of VVestminster, and no man would after, with so great daunger, contradicte the Kings will. And thus much of his violent māner of proceeding with the Church and Clergy, wherevnto I might adioyne many other things; as his dryuing out of the Realme the forsaid Robert Archbishop of Canterbury; his Statutes made in the last Parlament at Carleile the same yeare he dyed, in preiudice of Holy Churches liberty, which were the first that are read to haue bin made in that kind, and consequently are thought to haue byn a great cause of all the miseryes and calamityes, that fell vpon his posterity, as after you shall heare.
               14. But yet all this doth not proue, that King Edward denyed, or doubted of the Popes spirituall power, or tooke the same vpon himself, which is M. Attorneys case and conclusion. Nay rather they doe shew, and proue his acknowledgement of the said authority, if we consider them well, though in certayne points that seemed to extend themselues to temporall affaires, and might be preiudiciall vnto him, he sought to decline and auoyde the execution therof. In meere spirituall things the King neuer made difficulty to obey the Sea of Rome. But in things meerely spirituall, he neuer shewed difficulty. As for example: that his Bishops and Archbishops went to Rome to receaue their confirmation and inuestitures there, and sometymes were chosen also immediatly from thence: as when in the yeare 1278. Robert Kilwarby Archbishop of Canterbury was made Cardinall by Pope Nicholas the third, and the Monkes of Canterbury by request of the King, had chosen his Chancellour, the Pope would not admitt him, but appointed an other, to witt Iohn Peckam, Prouinciall of the Franciscan friers in England, who being admitted, held the said Archbishopricke for 13. yeres vntill he dyed. But as for confirmation and inuestitures, no doubt can be made, but all was to be had from Rome, as expresly you may reade of the admission and consecration of VVilliam Archbishop of Yorke: In Romana Curia cōsecratus (saith VValsingam)



who was consecrated in the Court of Rome in this same yeare of 1278. by Pope Martyn the fourth, 
                     VValsingam. eodem anno.
                   that succeeded to Nicolas. And the same Author affirmeth, that the foresaid Iohn Peckam, Archbishop of Canterbury being also consecrated in Rome, did some two yeares after, call a Councell at Reading, commaunding all his Suffragan Bishopps to obserue exactly the decrees of the late generall Councell held at Lyons by Pope Gregory the tenth; nor did King Edward mislike or repine any thing at this, as neither he did at another Councell called by the same Archbishop Peckam in the yeare 1281. wherin he endeauored to force all Abbots, and other exempted persons to come to the said Councell, but (saith Mathew VVestminster) the Abbotts of VVestminsters, S. Edmonds-Bury, S. Albanes, and of VValtham appealed from him to the Pope, without any mention of the King, which had beene iniurious vnto him, if he had taken himself to haue had authority, and that supreme, in Ecclesiasticall affaires.
               15. Furthermore in the yeare of Christ 1295. being the 22. of King Edwardes raigne, Diuers Bishopricks disposed of by Popes vnder K. Edvvard the first. when the foresaid Robert VVinchelsey was first chosen Archbishop of Canterbury, the sayd King sent him to Rome to be confirmed, and consecrated by Pope Celestinus the fifth, which soone after gaue ouer the popedome to Bonifacius the eight. And three yeares after that againe, to wit 1298. the Bishopricke of Ely being voyde, and the greater parte of the Monkes hauing chosen the Prior of their Couent for Bishop, the other party chose Iohn Langhton the Kings Chancellour, who going to Rome by the Kings fauour & cōmendatiō, to pleade his cause before Pope Boniface, could not preuaile, nor yet the Prior, but that the said Pope gaue the Bishopricke of Ely to the Bishop of Norwich, and the Bishopricke of Norwich to the Prior, and the Arch-deaconry of Canterbury to the Kings Chancellour.
               16. Moreouer in the yeare 1305. when Pope Clement the fifth a French-man, borne in the Diocese of Burdeaux, was made Pope, and came into France in person, first of all others translating the Sea of Rome to Auinion, where it continued seauenty yeares, King Edward sent Embassadours vnto him, the Bishops of Lichfield and VVorcester, togeather with the Earle of Lincolne, 
                  King Edvvardes deuotion tovvards the first Pope in Auinion. presenting vnto him: Singula vtensiliae (saith Mathew of VVestminster) quibus ministraretur ei in Camera, & in mensa, omnia ex auro purissimo. All necessary plate for the seruice of his chamber, and table of most pure gold. And at the same time he sent two new Bishops elected for Yorke,


                  
and London, to be confirmed by him: Quos dimisit ad propria cons
                        •••••
                     
                     tos: (saith our Authour) whome the said Pope Clement sent home againe with their confirmation. King Edvvard accused the Archb. of Canterbury vnto the Pope. And finally when not long after, the King fell out with the forsaid Archbishop of Canterbury Robert VVinchelsey, for that he had shewed himself againe not so forward to follow his will in all things: Dictum Robertum Cantuariensem (saith VValsingham) apud Dominum Papam accusauit Rex Anglia. The King of England did accuse the said Robert Archbishop of Canterbury, vnto Pope Clement the fifth, that he was combyned with his enemyes, &c. for the which the said Archbishop was cited to appeare before the Pope, and suspended from the execution of his office, quousque de sibi impositis legitimè se purgaret: vntill he should lawfully purge himselfe, of the imputations layd against him by the King. Whereby we see what authority this King did acknowledge to be in the Pope and Sea of Rome.
               
               17. We read also, that when in the yeare 1299. King Edward was passed ouer with a great army into Flanders, and did destroy that Countrey by fire and sword, Pope Boniface sent two Cardinall-Legates to entreat him, that he would be content to make truce for two yeares, 
                     VVestmonast. eodem anno.
                   to the intent that peace in the meane time might be concluded, adding further-more saith our Author: paenam excommunicationis, & interdicti terrarum suarum: the payne of excommunication and Interdict of his countreys, if he yeelded not therevnto: Sed Rex perpendens, &c. consensit in treguas indictas (saith he) the King considering well all circumstances, &c. did consent vnto the truce appointed by the Pope. And wheras the next yeare after, by other messengers sent vnto him in Canterb. the said Pope Boniface desired him to put at liberty Iohn King of Scotland, which he had in hold, assuring him that the King of England should le
                     •
                  se nothing by this: The great respect borne to the Sea of Rome by King Edvvarde. 
                  Eorum petitioni Rex condescendens, respondit, se ipsum loannem, tanquam seductorem, falsum, & periurum ad Papam missurum. The King condescending to their petition, made answere, that he would send the said Iohn, as a false, & periured deceauer, vnto the Pope to be punished by him. And so he did, and they caried him into France with them.
               18. And when afterward in the yeare 1301. King Edward was busily attent to his warrs in Scotland, and Pope Boniface enformed by the grieuous complaints of the Scottish-men, that K. Edward did them iniury, wrote and gaue in commission to the Archbishop of Canterbury, by an expresse messenger named Humbert, to



goe vnto the King, and will him to desiste, and to remit the iustice of the matter to be examined and tryed by the Sea Apostolicke; anyd though the said King for the present, tooke the matter very grieuously, and sware that he would prosecute his said enterprize to the vttermost: yet a little while after in the same yeare, he sent the Earle of Lincolne, 
                  An Embassadge sent by K. Edvvard to excuse himselfe to the Pope. and Syr Hugh Spencer to the said Sea Apostolicke, to shew the right of his cause, and what iniuries he had receaued at the Scots hands: Iusuper & Dominum Papam deprecarentur, ne mendacij fabricatoribus sinum aperiret: And that moreouer they should beseech the Pope, that he would not open his bosome (of beliefe) vnto the Scottish-men that deuised lyes; wherevnto the Pope hearkening, wished notwithstanding that the King for his cause would giue the truce, for a tyme, by him assigned, wherevnto the King yeelded.
               19. And when in the yeare following the said Pope Bonifacius vpon instance of the said Scottish-men, wrote more earnestly to K. Edward in this affayre, alleadging that Scotland was in the protection of the Sea Apostolicke, yea and that it apperteyned also to the temporal right of the Church (by submission belike of the Prince and inhabitants thereof at that tyme made) the King gathering a Parlament at Lincolne, determined therin first to write himself to the Pope about this matter, and then that the lay-nobility and people should write another letter somewhat more earnestly to the same effect. The Kings letter began thus: Sanctissimo in Christo Patri, Domino Bonifacio, 
                  Thomas VValsingam. in an. 1308. 
                  diuina prouidentia Sancta Romanae, & vniuersalis Ecclesiae summo Pontifici: Edwardus Dei gratia, Rex Angliae salutem & deuota pedum oscula beatorum. To the most holy father in Christ Boniface, by Gods prouidence supreme Bishop of the holy Romane, and vniuersall Church: Edward by the grace of God, King of England sendeth greeting and the deuout kissing of his blessed feete. By which title we may see, in what estimation he held the Pope at that day: The manner of vvriting of K Edvvard and his nobility to P. Bonifacius. & albeit in that letter he doth protest, that he doth not send this his iustification for his pretence to Scotland, in forme of iudgement, to haue it tryed by the Sea Apostolicke, as making any doubte therof, but only to enforme his Holines conscience: (which he doth very largely, beginning from the comming of Brutus himself into England) yet doth he conclude beseeching him, not to beleeue the informations of his aduersaryes, and emulators: Sed Statum nostrum & iura nostra Regia supradicta habere velitis, si placet, paternis affectibus commendata.

               20. But the Earles and Barons, and lay nobility of the land, that wrote a seuerall letter to the Pope, as before hath byn said, were more earnest in defence of the Kings title, saying: 
                     Math Vestmonaster. & Thom. Valsing in an. 1301. & 1302. 
                  Manu tenebimus cum toto posse, totisque viribus, &c. We will hold and defend the same, with all our power and forces, nor will we permit our King, though he would, to leaue of this title. Quocirca Sanctitati Vestrae reuerenter & humiliter supplicamus, &c.
                  Wherefore we doe reuerently, and humbly make supplication to your Holines, that you will defend our said King, that is a deuout sonne of the Catholicke Romane Church, as also his rightes, libertyes, customes, and lawes, and permit him to continew therin without diminution, or molestation, &c. Giuen at Lincolne 1301.
               
               21. And by all this now, we may perceaue the state of things in our countrey at that time, as also the sense and iudgement of K. Edward, and his realme about this our controuersie of spiritual, and Ecclesiasticall authority. And that if this King did vse sometymes, some rigorous dealing towards the Clergy, it was not for that he doubted of their spirituall authority, King Edvvards lavves in preiudice of the Clergy of England. or esteemed the same to be in himself; but partly vpon his forsaid necessity of warre, and partly for the emulation conceaued against them, by the laity for their wealth, and other such causes. And as for the lawes which he made in their preiudice, as that of Mort-main, wherby is prohibited that any thing shall passe ad manum mortuam: that is to say, to any of their communityes that pay not tribute to the King, without the Kings speciall licence, & some other lawes in like manner for restraint (as it seemed) of their externall iurisdiction, in certaine affaires; it proceeded of the same emulation, and complaints of the subiects, begun in the time of King Henry the third, as you haue heard, and continued in this mans dayes, as also in the dayes of diuers of his succesors. But this is nothing to our question in hand, though M. Attorney hath nothing else but such matter as this, as presently you shall see: for now shall we passe to his obiections vnder this King, which are foure of very small moment, as by handling will appeare.

                     In the raigne of K. Edward the first, a subiect brought in a Bull of excommunication, against another subiect of this Realme, and



published it to the Lord Treasurer of England,

                  The Catholicke Deuine.
                  22. This case related out of Brookes Reporte (if so it be there, for I haue not the booke) is but a particular case, and shewed only de facto, and not de iure: whereas M. Attorneys booke notwithstanding is intituled De iure, as often I haue, and must still put him in mynd. True it is, that he noteth here in the margent, that this was done by the Common-law of England, before any Statute made. But what reason can he bring, or any man imagine, why we should beleeue this, to wit, that this fact of bringing in a Bull of excommunication from Rome, against a subiect in those dayes, should be adiudged treason by the auncient Common-law of England. For a man may demaund, what is that Cōmon-law, or auncient Cōmon-law, not made by Statute, nor introduced by any common custome that can be proued? How was it made? By whome? where? at what time? vpon what occasion? For to auouch a Common-law, Cōmon-lavv must haue some birth or beginning and auncient common-law without beginning, author, cause, occasion, or recorde of the introduction therof, is a strange Metaphysicall contemplation; for that lawes doe not growe vp without beginning, but must needs be made or admitted by some Prince or people. And whereas we haue shewed from time to time, that all our English Princes & people, haue byn Catholicks from their first conuersion, vnto this Kings time, and vniforme also in this point of acknowledging the spirituall iurisdiction of the Sea of Rome, and nothing more ordinary among them, then censures, and excommunications from Rome, when necessity seemed to require; how could this auncient common-law come in vre among them, yea, and be auncient in K. Edward the first his tyme, contrary to the grounds, and practise of the religion then in vse and euer before, and no mention euer made therof in all antiquity, till

                  23. Moreouer we read in Mathew of VVestminster, that when this King Edward was in his most heat against the Clergy, for denying him the halfe of their rents and goods, as before hath byn said,



which they did vpon the prohibition of Pope Bonifacius, he fearing least some men might bring in an excōmunication against himself, and them of the Clergy that yelded to pay the same, and therby had bought his protection againe; he only forbad: 
                        VVestmonasteriensis an. 1197. 
                     Subpaena incarcerationis, ne quis contra ipsum Regem, & ces qui iampridem suam protectionem quaesiêrant, excommunicationis sententiam promulgaret, prouocatione sacta pro se ad Romanam Curiam, & pro ipsis. He prohibited vnder paine of imprisonment, A cleere ouerthrovv of M. Attorneys assertion. that no man should publish my sentence of excommunication against the King himself, or those that had newly sought his protection; yea his Maiesty made a prouocation, or appeale also, as well for himselfe, as for them that stood on his side, to the Courte of Rome. So as if the King, by speciall decree of his owne, appointed only the paine of imprisonment, for such as should publish any sentence of excommunication against himself, & for himself also appealed to Rome; it is not likely, that the auncient Common-lawes of England had made it treason before, against the King, his crowne, and dignity, to publish an excommunication against a subiect, that was a thing most vsuall in those dayes.
                  24. Well, it may be that for repressing the vnquiet spiritts of some particular subiects (that vpon light occasions and false suggestions, would procure Bulls of excommunication from Rome) some order might be taken at that tyme, for seuere punishment of them, that rashly without shewing the same to Iudges appointed for that purpose, should publish the said Bulls in England, 
                     In vvhat sense the publishing of a Bul might be punished in K. Edvvards dayes. as we see also at this d

And that some like order might be at this time in England, may appeere in parte, by another obiection, which M. Attorney hath afterward in the life of K. Edward the 3. saying: that in an attachement vpon a prohibitiō, the defendant pleading the Popes Bull of excōmunication of the plaintiffe; the Iudges demaunded of the defendāt, if he had not the certificate of some Bishop within the realme, testifying the excōmunicatiō, &c.

                     25. But howsoeuer this be, it is euident by this very Reporte of M. Attorneys text of Common-law cited by himself out of the one and thirtith yeare of King Edward the third (which was many yeares after this other case) that the bringing in, or seruing of a Bull of excommunication against a particular subiect, was not held for treason in those dayes. Neither did the iudges, make any such inference, which is like they would haue done, if it had byn treason against the King, his Crowne, and dignity, by the ancient Common-lawes of England in the tyme of K. Edward the first, aboue fifty yeares before the later case fell out. And thus much for law; though it might be, that de facto in those dayes of suspition, when K. Edward feared excommunication, as you haue heard, some man, ad terrorem, might be so sentenced by some chief Iusticer, or Iudge, as would be ready to pleasure the King in all things, as most of them were, though yet the party were not executed, as here is confessed; or else that there was some other particular aggrauant circumstance in this facte, which here is not set downe, though it may be also, that the Reader shall find somewhat therof in M. Brookes booke if he looke it ouer, out of whome this obiection without all circumstance is so barely cited. And thus much of this first instance: Now let vs contemplate the second, as wise (no doubt) as the former.
               
               
                  The Attorney.
                  The said King Edward the first presented his Clerke to a benefice, 
                        
                           •
                         instance within the prouince of Yorke, who was refused by the Archbishop for that the Pope by way of prouision, had conferred it on another. The King thervpon brought a Quare non admisit. 
                     15. Edouar. tit. Quare non admisit. 7.
                     The Archbishop pleaded that the Bishop of Rome had long time before prouided to the same Church, 
                           Vide 39. Edou. 3. 20. as one, hauing supreme authority in that case, and that he durst not, nor had power to put him out, which was by the Popes Bull in possession. For which his high, contempt against the King, his Crowne and dignity, in refusing to execute his Soueraignes commaundement, fearing to doe it against the Popes prouision, by iudgement of the Common-law, the lands of his whole Bishopricke were seased into the Kings handes, and lost during his life, which iudgement was before any Statute, Note. or Act of Parlament was made in that case. And there it is said that for the like offence, the Archbishop of Canterbury had byn in worse case, by the iudgement of the



Sages of the law, then to be punished for a contempt, if the King had not extended grace and fauour to him.
                  
               
               
                  The Catholicke Deuine.
                   
                     1. ansvvere.26. Here againe is another case or two de facto, wherof M. Attorney wil needs inferre de iure. The Archbishop of Yorke his lands, (saith he) were seased by the King, and lost during his life, for that he admitted not to a benefice, within his Diocesse, a Clerke presented by the King, whereas the same benefice had an incumbent before put in by the Popes prouision, according to the custome of those dayes, which incumbent the said Archbishop pleaded, that he could not put out: and for this high contempt against the King, his crowne, and dignity, in refusing to execute his soueraignes commaundement (saith M. Attorney) by iudgement of the Common-law, he lost the landes of his whole Bishopricke; But here I would aske M. Attorney, what high contempt could this be against the King, his crowne, and dignity, if the Archbishop pleaded that he could not doe it, eyther in right, or in power? Not in right, for that nothing was more receaued at that tyme in England, then for the Bishop of Rome to prouide certayne benefices in England, and not only benefices, but also Bishopricks, and Archbishopricks, as before in the life of this King, and his ancestours hath byn declared. And as for power, no maruaile if the Archbishop durst not vse violence in those dayes, against the Popes prouisions, wherby he might incurre excommunication; for so much as the King himself so greatly respected the same, and made such diligent premunition, least my such excommunication should come against him, as in the answere to the former instance hath byn declared.
                  17. And besides this, if the Archbishop did put the matter in plea to be trayed, and to the Kings writt of Quare non admisit, did yeelde so reasonable a cause, Cōmon-lavves imagined but not extant. as is here touched, & that the King himself had admitted diuers Bishops and Archbishops by like prouision of Popes: how, and with what reason can M. Attorney call this answere of the Archbishop, so high a contempt against the King, his crowne, and dignitie? Or how could the Common-law condemne the same with so great a punishment? And still I must demaund what is this Common-law? by whome was it made? how came it in? where is it founded, either in reason, vse, consent of the people, or authority of law-giuers? For if it consist in none of these, but only in the particular will and iudgement of



the Prince himself, neuer so passionate, and in the approbation & execution of these Sages, which here M. Attorney mentioneth; then any thing that displeased the said Prince, may be called high contempt against his person, crowne, and dignity. And so may be iustified all the most passionate actions, not only of this King Edward before recited, but of all other Kings whosoeuer. And by the same meanes M. Attorney maketh his auncient Cōmon-law, (which often he calleth our birth-right, and best birth-right) to be nothing else in effect, but the Princes pleasure frō time to time, and the execution of his Sages, which commonly in those auncient times (for I will speake nothing of our dayes) were to wise and Sage, to withstand the Princes will in any thing.
                  28. Sure I am, that in this particular fact of seasing Bishops lands and temporalityes, vpon any offence or displeasure taken by the King; as it hath byn vsed by some English Princes in their anger, so hath it bin condemned also in diuers Parlaments, lawes, and Statutes: as in the first yeare of King Edward the third where it is thus expressed.

                  29. And to the end that M. Attorney may not say, that this case of his is excepted; it followeth in an other Statute in the 25. yeare of the same King, saying: VVhereas the temporalities of Archbishops and Bishops, haue beene oftentimes taken into the Kings hand, for contempt done to him vpon writts of Quare non admisit, and for diuers other causes &c. The King willeth and graunteth in the said Parlament, that all Iustices shall from henceforth receaue for the contempt so iudged, reasonable fyne of the party so condemned, according to the quantity of the trespasse, and after the quality of the contempt, &c. 
                     Hovv Bishops might be punished for not admitting the Kings iust presentatiō. Which last words may be thought to be added, for that the King had right to present to diuers benefices at that tyme, as particular patrone therof ex iure patronatus, for that the said benefices were fouuded, or erected by himself, or his auncestors: and in those cases, the Bishops not admitting such Clerkes, as he presented, might doe some iniury or



trespasse against him, and therin shew contempt, worthy some fyne, or for-faite, which the law doth here appoint; especially for so much, as it is be ore recorded that Pope Innocentius the 4. presently vpon the first Councell of Lyons, wrote, as you haue heard in the life of K. Henry the third, that he would not let by his prouision, 
                        Supra cap. praeced.
                      the right of any patrone in presenting to any benefice, wherof he had the aduowson, or Ius patronatus.
                  
                  30. And as for the other example alleadged heere by M. Attorney, for strengthning his instance, of the Archbishop of Canterbury, saying: that for the like offence the Archbishop of Canterbury had byn in worse case, by the iudgement of the Sages of the law, then to be punished for a contempte, if the King had not extended grace, and fauour to him. If he vnderstand the displeasure taken against Archbishop VVinchelsey before mentioned, by K. Edward, for resisting his demaund of the one halfe of all Ecclesiasticall rents, for which before we haue heard out of Mathew of VVestminster, that all his lands and goods were seased into the Kings hands: you haue heard also, how the same King afterward repented both that, and other like facts of his, and asked pardon publikly with teares. But if he meane the other offence againe after this, when he accused the said Archbishop VVinchelsey to the Pope, and caused him to be called to Rome, and to be suspended from his office, as before we haue declared: then doth this case make directly against M. Attorneys conclusion. For that the King acknowledged the Pope to be a superiour Iudge, The Archbishop of Canterbury depriued of his spiritual iurisdiction by Q Elizabeth: anno. 1580. ouer English Bishops aboue himself; and then was the iudgement of those Sages named by M. Attorney, that thought him so deepely to haue offended in acknowledging the Popes authority, farre from the purpose. And howsoeuer it were, cleere it is, that the King seased only vpon temporalityes of the Bishops, and tooke not vpon him to depriue them of their spirituall iurisdictions, as Queene Elizabeth did, when shee fell out with M. Grindall her Primate and Archbishop of Canterbury whome she by her Ecclesiasticall authority depriued of his iurisdiction, and appointed Commissaryes of her owne in diuers Countryes, to execute the same iurisdiction as immediate from her self, which this K. Edward did not, nor any of his Predecessors or Successours, vntil K. Henry the 8. and therby shewed, that they pretended nothing of their spirituall authority: & so this example, or instance of seasing vpon tēporalties, either by right or wrong, proueth nothing for M. Attorney his purpose. Let vs passe then to his 3. instāce.

                  31. About this instance, taken out of a Statute made in the 4. yeare of K. Edward the first, it is first to be noted: that albeit, mention be made heere only of the late constitution of the Councell of Lyons vnder Pope Gregorie the tenth concerning Bigamies, or those that are twise married; yet is the thing it self of more antiquity in the Catholicke Church, as may appeare throughout the whole title De Bigamis non ordinandis, in the first booke of Decretalls, 
                        Lib. 1. Decretalium Gregorie. tit. 21. that is to say, that such as haue byn twise married may not take holy orders. But yet for that there was a doubt, whether such men hauing primam tonsuram, or minores ordines, and therby made Clerkes, might enioy the priuiledges of Clergy-men, for their persons, The Decree against Bigamy. and goods, suites in law, and the like, which could not be decided but by Ecclesiasticall Iudges: this controuersie (I say) which included many braunches & consequences, especially for England, was defined in the said Councell of Lyons, and the definitiue sentence, or decision was in these words:

coming forth, presently there arose a doubt in England, whether such Bigamies, as had borne that attyre, and tonsure before that tyme, and were now in present necessity, to vse the priuiledge of the Clergy, The true state of the case and doubt risen in England. for deliuering themselues out of the secular iustice hand, ought to haue the same or no; for that it might be presumed, that the Councell meant only of these Bigamyes, that should beare the habit afterward. Vnto which opinion, as to the more pious and pittifull, the Bishops inclining, demaunded to haue deliuered vnto them, as Clerkes, all such fellons, as had bin Clerkes or taken for Clerkes before the Councell. But the King, and his Counsell were of an other opinion, to wit, that Pope Gregory his decision was in generall tearmes, and excepted none, neyther before, nor after, and thereby vnderstood and meant to exclude all.
                  33. This is the case, and this is the decision thereof. And now let the discreet Reader iudge, whether this example maketh more for M. Attorneys purpose, or against him; for that here the King & his Counsell doe stand more strictly to the obseruaunce of the Popes decree as it lyeth, then those Bishops themselues, (who would haue had these Bigamyes deliuered vnto them as Clerkes) and therefore vrge to haue it punctually and exactly obserued. And for that men of reason might meruaile, why M. Attorney, a man of such accompt in the law, hath brought in such an instance, so impertinent to his purpose, he seeketh to remedy the matter, by this note in the margent: Obserue (saith he) how the King by the aduise of his Counsell, expounded how the said Councell of Lyon should be vnderstood, and in what sense it should be receaued, and allowed heere. 
                     A poore commentary and shifte of M. Attorney. And why is all this diligent commentary thinke you? Forsooth to the end, that you may imagine, that the King and his Counsell tooke themselues to be aboue the Pope, and generall Councell of Lyons, for that they tooke vpon them to expound, & admit the said Councells decree. By which argument M. Attorney, may proue also, that Archbishop Peckam of Canterbury calling a Sinod (as before you haue heard) of his Bishops Suffragans, and other Prelates, for receauing, publishing, and obseruing the said decrees of the same Pope and Councell, the very next yeare after it was held, did thinke themselues to be aboue the said Pope and Councell, and to haue authority ouer them, for that they receaued, allowed, and expounded the same decrees. And doth not euery man see the folly of this kind of reasoning?
                  
                     34. And yet you must note further, that for better bringing in of this argument, M. Attorney, straineth the text extremely in three or foure things, to make place for this his note. For whereas in the latin text of the Statute (for K. Edward the first put forth in latin, and so is it extant vntill this day) it is said: Quidam Praelati s
                           ••
                        quam Clericos exigerunt sibi liberandos, &c. Certaine Prelates did require, or exact, to haue such Bigamies deliuered freely vnto them as Clerkes, which were made Bigannies before the said constitution; M. Attorney saith: Certaine Prelates haue prayed to haue them deliuered: whereas betwene exigere and rogare, to exacte, and pray, is a great difference in this case.
                  35. And againe where it is written in latin: Concordatum est & declaratum, coram Rege & Consilio suo, quod constitutio illa intelligenda fit, quod siuè effecti fuerunt Bigami ante praedictam constitutionem, siuè post, de catero non liberentur Praelatis, imò fiat de ijs iustitia sicut de Laicis: M. Attorney to aggrauate the Kings accorde and declaration, Hovv M. Attorney straineth the 
                           •
                        ext to helpe himself. ouer that of the generall Councell, putterh it downe thus: It is agreed and declared, before the King and his Counsell, that the same constitution shalbe vnderstood in this wise. Whereas the Latin speaketh in the present tense, It is to be vnderstood, nor hath it the words, in this wise. And where M. Attorney saith: They shall not from hence forth be deliuered, but iustice shall be executed vpon them, as vpon other lay men: those shalls b
                        •
                      not in the Latin, but rather that they may, or must not be deliuered vnto Prelates, but that iustice be done vpon them, as vpon lay men. So that herby you see the labour that M. Attorney taketh to draw a little water to his mill, and yet that nothing commeth but puddle, that driueth not but choaketh the same. Let vs see his fourth instance, whether it be of any more weight or moment than the rest.
               
               
                  The Attorney.
                  In an acte made at the Parlament holden at Carleile in the 25. 4 instance. yeare of the said King Edward the first, It is declared, that the holy Church of England was founded in the state of Prelacy, within the Realme of England, by the King and his progenitors, &c.

And the said Kings in tymes past, were wont to haue their aduise, & counsaile for the safe-guarde of the Realme, when they had need of such Prelates and Clerkes so aduaunced. The Bishop of Rome vsurping the signories of such benefices; did giue, & graunt



the same benefices to Aliens, Nota. The first attēpte vvas to vsurpe vpon such Ecclesiasticall things as appertayned to the Clergy of England, vvho at that tyme stood in great avve of the church of Rome.

                  The Catholike Deuine.
                  36. This Parlament of Carliele which M. Attorney ascribeth to the 25. yeare of King Edwardes raigne, The ansvvere to the fourth Instance of M Attorney. both in his latin and English columns, I doe imagine to be an error, in place of the 35. for that I fynde no Parlament held vpon the fiue and twentith, in which yeare King Edward was partely in Scotland, and partely in Flanders, and there kept his Christmasse in the City of Gaunt. But vpon the 35. yeare, which was the last of King Edwardes raigne, there was a Parlament helde at Carliel vpon the Octaues of S. Hilary. In which Parlament there was such a declaration, and complaint made, as here it set downe: that the Bishopricks and benefices being often giuen to strangers by the Popes prouisions, who residing not in England, nor keeping hospitality, nor being able to preach, or teach, for that they wanted the English language, the Church of England, Incōueniences by promoting strangers in England. 
                     and poore people therof did suffer much inconuenience therby, and for that the Bishopricks and Prelacyes of the said Church, were founded ordinarily by Kings and Princes of the said land, they said it was reason, that they, as Patrones, should present English men to the same.
                  
                  37. And these complaints which now we haue heard, began in diuerse former Kings dayes, especially vnder King Henry the third, and were continued vnder this man, and his Successours; but most of all vrged vnder King Edward the third, and King Richard the second, by whome greater restraints were made, vntill the Sea Apostolicke and our Kings came to a certaine forme of agreement, as in other countreys and Kingdomes also they did, though in different sortes, how benefices should be prouided, to wit, Diuers agreemēts for prouision of Benefices. by election of the Deane & Chapter in some, and by Kings and Princes nominations in others, as also by prouisions of Bishops in lesser preferments: Wherein notwithstanding the said



Sea Apostolicke retained diuers gifts to it self, as in sundry countryes is seene at this day, by vse and practice.
                  38. Well then the States of England at this time said & decreed, that the abuses of bestowing English benefices vpon strangers, were not to be suffered; especially such as had byn newly brought in by one VVilliam Testaw, sent thither out of France by Pope Clement the fifth, 
                        VVest monast. anno. 1307. for so testifyeth Mathew VVestminster that was then liuing, whose words are these:
The King held a Parlament at Carliele, wherein greater complains, then euer before, were made of the oppression of Churches and Monasteries, and many extorsions vsed by one Maister VVilliam Testaw the Popes Clerke, Remedy sought from the Pope himselfe. to whome commaundement was giuen by the assent of the Earles and Barons, that he should not vse like extorsion for the tyme to come. And moreouer it was ordeyned that for obteyning remedy, 
                           VValsing. Ibidem.
                         certaine messengers there assigned should be sent to the Pope.
And the very self-same thing writeth Thomas VValsingam. And this is all the remedy, mentioned by these men to haue byn taken at that tyme, to wit, supplication to the Pope himself, that he would put thervnto conuenient redresse, which well declareth the respect borne to that Sea.
                  39. And albeit this Statute here mentioned by M. Attorney may be supposed also to haue passed at that tyme; yet may it appeare by the words of other Statutes after, in the tyme of King Edward the third, 
                        See statute anno. 25. Edouards. 3. that the same was not put in vre vntill his dayes, as in his life we shall shew more particularly. And what maketh all this now for M. Attorney? or what rather doth it not make against him? For here the whole Parlament of Carliele acknowledginge the Popes spirituall authority, The statute of Carleile maketh nothing for M. Attourney. as appeareth by their manner of writing vnto him, complained of certaine abuses, or excesses, streching themselues in a certaine sorte, as they pretended, to temporall commodityes, and sought remedy therof from himself. And can any thing be more cleere against M. Attorney then this? Surely at the barre, he durst not for his credits sake pleade in this manner, & much lesse should he doe it in a booke, wherin the speaches remaine longer to the view of the reader, then doe fleeting words to the hearer at the barre. But inough of this. M. Attorney pleadeth well where he hath truth and substance for him; in this cause both doe faile him: and what then can he doe, but cast shaddowes, as here you see that he doth?
               
            
            
               
               OF KING EDVVARD THE SECOND, VVhich vvas the tenth King after the Conquest. §. 11.
                
                  This King began his raigne an. 1307. and raigned 19. yeres to vvitt, vntill 1326.40. Much lesse is needfull to be said of this King, then of the former, both for that his raigne was shorter, and much more troublesome in temporall affaires, which gaue lesse place to spirituall: and now also our Authors, that were wonte to note more diligently such matters, doe in great parte faile vs. For that Mathew of VVestminster endeth with King Edward the first, as the other Mathew Paris before him, did with this mans father K. Henry the third; and Roger Houeden before him againe with K. Iohn; and VVilliam Nubergensis & Petrus Blesensis before them, with K. Richard

Stephen, and partly vnder K. Henry the first: so as now downe-ward from this King Edward the second, we shall only haue Raynulph of Chester, and Thomas VValsingam for the most ancient writers of this time that doth ensue, who yet are nothing so copious or diligent, as diuers of the former.
               41. This Edward therefore second of that name, and surnamed of Carnaruan, for that he was borne in that towne of VVales, when his Father lay with an army in those partes, to reduce that countrey to subiection, as he did, who being of the age of twenty three yeares, when his father dyed vpon the borders of Scotland in the yeare 1307. & receauing two speciall things in charge (saith VValsingam) from his Father, vnder paine of his curse:

The first, that the should prosecute presently and end the enterprize began against Scotland, before he went to London or procured to be crowned: the second that he should not touche or waste, but send to the holy land, a certaine summe of money, which his said Father had layed togeather for the assistance of that warr, to the which he had purposed to goe himself in person, if he had liued,

charged him on his curse, that he should not presume to call home Pierce of Gaueston, by common decree banished, without common consent &c.) Notwithstanding all these admonitions and threats, this careles young Prince performed no one thing of the three, but got himself presently into France, and there was married in Bullen,

For that shee being the only daughter and heire, as hath byn said, to the King of France, her sonne Edward the third, in her title began first the said warrs, which brought finally the losse, not only of that which was gotten of new, but of all the rest, that we had before in France, and shee taking a deepe disgust with her said husband for his disordinate affection to Pierce Gaueston (whome presently after his fathers death he recalled from banishment) the two Spencers and others misliked by her, and the greater parte of the Realme: shee finally after many troubles, warrs, insurrections, and great store of Noble-men cut of and destroyed on both partes, preuailed against the said King her husband; and hauing on her side the authority of her young sonne the Prince, and all his followers, did put downe the said King, depriued him of his crowne, sett vp her young sonne in his place, committed the other to prison, where soone after he was pitifully murthered. And these are the varietyes of worldly fortunes, these the frailtyes and vncerteintyes of earthly Greatnes; And where King Edward placed all his pleasure, from the same spring issued forth the beginning and progresse of all his miserie.
               42. But as for his religion and iudgement therein, notwithstanding all other his errours in life and behauiour, that it was constantly Catholicke, according to that which he had receaued and inherited from his Ancestours, no doubt can be made at all. For that the whole State of his realme, touching Ecclesiasticall affaires, remained as he found it, and as it had continued in the tymes of his progenitours; and that the Bishops of Rome, had generall authority ouer England in his dayes, not only in meere spirituall iurisdiction: (which all the Bishops of England


                  
professed to receaue from him) but also in externall disposing, when he would, of Bishoprickes and other Prelacies, notwithstanding all the complaints made in his Fathers, and Grand-fathers tymes about that matter, may be made euident by many examples.
               43. For first we reade that in the yeare 1311. when Pope Clement the fifth in a Councell at Vienna in France, vpon many graue and vrgent causes, The suppression of the Knights of the Temple. as was pretended & alleadged, did put downe the whole order of knights called Templarij (for that their first institution was, to haue care to defend the Temple of Ierusalem against infidells) and did appoint their lands (which were many and great) to be giuen to an other newer order which then begun, named Hospitalary, for that they had the care of the hospitals, wherein Pilgrims were receaued; (which now are the knights of S. Iohn of Malta) & albeit this matter were of such importance and consequence, for that the persons were many, and of nobility, and their possessions great, as hath byn said: yet was that Decree obeyed in England without resistance, and the persons depriued, and put to perpetuall pennance in a Councell at London anno 1311. and their said lands and goods giuen to the other sorte of knights, and confirmed by Parlament in London 13. yeares after,

               44. Againe we reade that in the yeare 1319. which was the 12. of this Kings raigne, great warre being betwene England & Scotland, King Edward had procured that Pope Iohn the 22. should send two Cardinall-Legates into England, to examine the matter how it stood, and to punish by Ecclesiasticall Censures, that party, that should be found stubborne and repugnant to reason: Wher vpon finally, hauing heard both sides, and finding Robert Bruse King of Scotland, to haue offered iniuryes to the King of England, 
                  Recourse made to the Pope by Englād and Scotland in their greatest controuersies VValsing. anno. 1319. & 1323. they pronounced sentence of excommunication against him, and put the whole Kingdome vnder interdict: For releasing wherof the said King Robert, and the State of Scotland 4. yeares after, sent a solemn embassage to the Pope, to wit, the Bishop of Glasco & Earle of Murray, which being vnderstood by King Edward, he sent also a messenger on his behalfe, to contradicte the same. And albeit him Embassadour (saith our Story) in dignity were but a simple Priest, yet so many reasons, and accusations he alleadged against



them

               45. But as for priuate matters of England, especially the disposing of Bishoprickes, confirmation, & inuestitures of all Bishops, 
                     〈◊〉
                   notorious, and might be declared by infinite examples, that 
                     •
                   remained now, as before vnder all other Catholicke Princes. For among other points we reade, that when in the yeare of Christ 1312. Robert VVinchelsey Archbishop of Canterbury dyed, the Monkes of that place according to the custome, chose by the liking and procuration of the King, one Thomas Cobham, a man of eminent learning and vertue, who going to Auinion in France, The 
                        •
                     . of Canterbury made by the Popes prouision. where Pope Clement the fifth lay at that tyme, to receaue his confirmation and inuestiture, as the manner was in those dayes, the said Pope told him, that long before in the other Archbishops life, he had reserued the collation of that Archbishopricke to himself, for that tyme, and therevpon pronounced that election to be voyde, adding further this cōsideration; that England being 
                     ••
                   that day in great troubles and disgust, for that many Lords & Barons had shewed their mislike against the King, and the King against them: it was needfull to haue in that place of Canterbury, a man of great credit and experience in such affaires; and therefore named one VVilliam Reynoldes Bishop of VVorcester, and Chancellour of the Realme at that day, and presently sent him both his inuestiture, and pall; wherewith the King and Queene being greatly contented, were present at his consecration, and so he liued and gouerned 19. yeares after in that Sea, with great commendation. So as we see that the restraint of Papall prouisions made at Carliele vnder this mans father was not yet put in practice.
               46. And the like reseruatiō we read that Pope Iohn the 22. made of the Bishopricke of VVinchester afterward in the yeare 1320. and therby did disanull the election made by the Monkes of that place, with consent of the King, and placed another of his owne choice, which the King also after some time admitted; So as this was very ordinary in those dayes. We reade likewise that in the yeare 1324. a Parlament being called at London, and King Edward growing now, by euill counsaile of the Spencers and others, into great disorder, he caused one Adam Bishop of Hereford, that fauoured not his proceedings, to be arrested of treason, & brought



forth publickely to be tryed, laying to his charge that he had 
                     ••
                  
                  ceaued, and fauoured diuerse of those Barons, which had taken armes against him. But the forsaid Archbishop of Canterbury, and his brethren Bishops seeing this disorder, made first humble supplication to the King, that he might be tryed according to his place & degree, and that not preuayling, they required the same by law, according to the liberties and priuiledges of the Church, The Bishop of Hereford taken frō the barre by Ecclesiasticall authority. confirmed by Magna charta, & other lawes of the Realme. Whervpon he was deliuered to the custody of the said Archbishop of Canterbury: but afterward he being called for againe, by the instigation of such as were his enemyes, and carryed to the barre, the said Archbishop of Canterbury, and the other of Yorke, with ten other Bishops went thither in iudiciall māner, with their crosses borne before them, commaunding vnder paine of excommunication, that no man should stay him, or lay hands on him, and so tooke him away to the Archbishops custody againe. Whereby we may see, in what vigour Ecclesiasticall power was at this day in England. And albeit the King being in passion, did storme greatly thereat, and seased presently vpon all the said Bishops goods and lands, as he had done vpon those of the Bishop of Lincolne, and of others before: yet could he not deny, but that this was law & iustice, which the Bishops did, according to the Ecclesiasticall priuiledges of the Realme, whervnto the King himself, and all his ancestours in their coronations, had solemnely sworne. For breaking wherof it may be presumed, that so great a punishment fell vpon him, as soone after ensued, to the horror of the whole world, by depriuation both of his Kingdome, and life. And so much of him. Now let vs see what instance M. Attorney can draw from him to his purpose. It is but one, and thus it runneth in his owne words.

                  48. If a man would aske M. Attorney in this place, why he hath brought in this instance, and what he would proue therby, I thinke verily he would be much graueled in answering, especially if we respecte his principall Conclusion, that by this and like presidence Q. Elizabeth might take vpon her supreme authority Ecclesiasticall: for that by this narration, nothing else is declared, but that a certaine abuse being crept in, that when any externall matter, seeming any way to belong to temporalityes, was handled in Ecclesiasticall Courtes, and by Ecclesiasticall Iudges, the party that feared, or suspected his owne cause, would informe the Kings Courtes, that the matter belonged to them, and therevpon would get out a prohibition from the Chauncery, to sursease in that cause, vntill it were tryed, to which Court it belonged. By which deceytfull, and malitions proceeding of some, much trouble was procured, and many causes rested indetermined, both in the one, and the other Courte: 
                        Statut. de Consult. editum an. 24. E. 1. The explication & true meaning of the former prouision. for so saith the Statute it self made in the time of King Edward the first this mans Father, in these words: VVhereas Ecclesiasticall Iudges haue oftentymes surceased, to proceed in cases moued before them, by force of the Kings writ of prohibition, &c. to the great damage of many, as the King hath byn aduertised by the grieuous complaints of his subiects, &c. For this cause many orders and Statutes were made, vnder all three Edwards for remedying of this abuse; as for example vnder Edward the first,



the foresaid Statute hath this determination: That the 
                           〈◊〉
                         or chief Iustice of the King for the tyme being, if they see that the case

                         be redressed by any writ out of the Chauncery, but that the spirituall 
                           〈◊〉
                         ought to determine the matters; that then they shall write to the Ecclesiasticall Iudges, before whome the case was first moued, to proceed therin, notwithstanding the Kings prohibition vnto them before.
                  
                  49. And to like effect is this other ordination here mentioned by M. Attorney of Circumspectè agatis: wherby is ordeyned that temporall Iudges shall vse themselues circumspectly in medling with causes that belong to spirituall courtes.

And to the same effect is this Statute here alleadged vnder King Edward the second, as also this other set downe in these words: They that purchase prohibition, and attachement against the Ordinaryes, of a thing that belongeth not to the lay Court, shall yeeld damages to the Ordinaryes, by the award of the Iustices. And yet further to the same effect, it was decreed by King Edward the third after this manner:

                        . cap. 5. 
                     That no prohibition goe out of the Chauncery, but in case where we haue the conusaunce, and of right ought to haue.
                  
                  50. And finally to passe no further in this, the Statute made in the 9. yeare of this King intituled: Articuli Cleri: Articles of the Clergy, conteyning sixteene braunches, doe apperteyne to this affaire, to shew, Different Courtes shevv different origen of authorityes. and declare what causes doe belong to the spirituall courte, and what to the temporall, and wherof both the one and the other may take conusaunce; and consequently in what matters, the Kings prohibition may goe forth, or not: all which is cleerly against M. Attorney his purpose. For if the temporall Prince, were properly head of the one and the other courte, and fountaine both of the one and other lawe, and iurisdiction; this adoe needed not, but that the King might indifferently dispose of all.
                  51. But consider I pray you, M. Attorneys note, or commentary in the margent, wherby he would seeme to answere our former demaund, why he bringeth in this instance.
By these statutes (saith he) the iurisdiction of the Ecclesiasticall Courtes, is allowed and warranted by consent of Parlament, in all cases wherein they haue iurisdiction: so as these lawes may be iustly called the Kings Ecclesiasticall lawes, or the Ecclesiastical lawes of England.
So he. And you will easily see herby, how much he delighteth himself in this new witty inuention of his owne, so often repeated by him, wherby he would make the Popes Canon-lawes, to be the King of Englands lawes, for that they are



admitted and obeyed in England
                     
                        •
                      of which sylly consequence, I haue oftentymes made mention before, M. Attorneys common refuge refuted. shewing the weakenes and incongruity therof. For that by this reason the self same Canon-lawes receaued, & admitted by all particular states of Christendome, may be said to be the peculiar lawes of euery particular state. And if this be a superiority, as M. Attorney would inferre, to admit, and allow another Princes lawes, then is euery particular state of Christendome aboue the Pope & Generall Councells, which made these lawes. Wherfore as well in this, as in all the rest, we see the weakenes of M. Attorneys cause: and so we shall passe to other Princes, that doe follow, leauing this disasterous K. Edward the second, who soone after fell into a pitifull plight of calamity, being depriued both of his Crowne, and life for his ill gouernment, and his young sonne placed in his roome, as our historyes at large doe declare.
               
            
         
         
            OF K. EDWARD THE THIRD, And K. Richard the second his Nephevv, and Successour: And vvhat instances or arguments M. Attorney draweth from their two raignes, which continued betweene them for seauenty yeares. CHAP. XII.
            THESE two are the Kings, aboue all the rest, from the beginning vnto K. Henry the 8. vnder whose gouernment, M. Attorney gathereth and layeth togeather most obiections, to proue the small respect they had, or vsed in certaine cases and occasions, and at some times, towards the



Sea Apostolicke, and Ecclesiasticall power therof; for that they made most restrictions by penall lawes, These 2. Kings made most restraints. and punishments against the practice and vse therof, in certaine cases mixt, as they presumed, and conioyned with temporalityes, or affaires of the State, and so not meerly Ecclesiasticall.
            2. For albeit before this, there had byn great murmurings and complaints, as you haue seen, from the tyme of K. Henry the 3. and his father King Iohn, against some parte of the exercise of the Popes authority, in bestowing benefices and Bishopricks vpon strāgers; as also of the often reseruing the collations of the cheife to himself, and his Court, of demaunding, and graunting tithes, & contributions vpon the English Clergy, as well for his owne, as other publike necessityes: yet find we not hitherto, any expresse penall law put in vre and practice (though mention be found of one made at Carleile vnder K. Edward the first, the 2. yeare of his raigne) to this effect, for restrayning prouisions, and other ordinances from the Court of Rome, and the execution thereof by English subiects, vntill vnder these two Kings, Edward the 3. and Richard the 2. and not by the former, vntill after many yeares of his raigne, when by his continuall warrs with France and Scotland, his temporall necessityes and other respects drew him therevnto. And some men doe note that the lamentable ends of both these Kings (wherof the worst seemed to some to be that of King Edward, though he died in his bed) togeather with infinite bloudshed afterward by their successours, deuided in their owne bowells, vpon the controuersie of Lancaster and Yorke, did easily shew how vngratefull to all mighty God this breach of theirs, The punishment of these tvvo Princes and their posterity for their violence vsed tovvards the church and violence vsed with their Mother the holy Church was, though it might seeme to them, and some others also, that it was either in temporall matters, or in Ecclesiasticall conioyned (as hath byn said) with temporalities; and that besides, they were vrged therevnto by important clamours of their people, partly vpon emulation against the Clergy, and partly vpon some abuses and aggreiuances, as they pretended in their supplications and declarations to the Popes themselues about these affaires, pretending to hold still (as no doubt they did) their inward faith, beliefe, deuotion, and obedience to the Sea Apostolicke, though outwardly they were forced to take the way of redresse, against some excesses; which they did.
            3. And now wee haue already heard, the foresaid complaints



oftentymes iterated in the liues of the former Kings; but especially vnder Henry the third, and the two precedent Edwards, that 
                  ••
               sued him, which being continued vnder this third of the same name, he being a warriour, & hauing therby all wayes commonly great need of money, was induced at length for increasing his owne temporall wealth, to lay hands vpon the spiritual; especially such as was wont to goe out of the Realme to the Court of Rome, or accrew to strangers that had benefices, or Ecclesiasticall liuings within the Realme, both religious and other. To which consideration he had these particular motiues peculiar to his time and state, that he hauing for some yeares before proclaimed himself King of France, and taken the Armes and Title of that Kingdome vpon him, as due vnto him by succession, for that he was next heire male in bloud to King Philip the 4. surnamed the faire, that by his mother Queen Isabel was his Grandfather, and all the Popes at that time being French-men, Particular motiues of K. Edvvard 3. for proceeding as he had. and lying at Auinion in France for seauenty yeares togeather, and the most parte of the Cardinals and Courte being in like manner of the same natiō, that were ordinarily prouided by the Popes of benefices and Bishopricks in England, and therby not fit, as was pretended, to teach, preach, or reside there: King Edward, besides the regard of other inconueniences, entred into ielousie also of state, thinking that these men were enemyes to his pretences in France, and therevpon was the more pricked, to make the prohibitions and lawes, which he did.
            4. But yet writing first therof to the Pope himself in most humble, and dutifull manner, requesting redresse and remedy immediately from that Sea, as by his letters yet extant doth appeare;

            7. Heere we see with what respect to the Sea Apostolicke, King Edward pretended to make the restraints, which he made of prouisions from Rome: and to shew more his confidence and acknowledgement toward the said Sea, he sent soone after the very same yeare, vnto the said Clement the 6. a most honourable Embassage by Henry Earle of Lancaster and Derby, 
               King Edvvardes great embassage vnto the Pope. as also the Earls, Spenser, and Stafford, togeather with the Bishop of Oxford, to treat with the said Pope, and lay before him the right which he pretended to the Crowne of France, though not in forme of iudgement, or to put the matter in triall (saith VValsingham) but as to a father and friend; he hauing 4. yeares before that, written largly of the ground of his said right, vnto this mans predecessour Pope Benedictus the 11. and to the whole Colledge of Cardinals, himself being then at Antwerpe, vpon the 16. of Iuly. Anno Domini 1339. and 13. of his Raigne.
            8. His epistle to the Pope had the same title, which the other before; and that to the Cardinals; Amabilium Deo patrum Sacrosancta Romana Ecclesiae Cardinalium Collegio venerando, &c. In the prosecution of which letter to the Pope after a large demonstration of his title, he hath these words.

And albeit he was neuer wholy deuoid of the ielousies & suspicions before mentioned, that those French Popes did fauour more his enemies the Kings of France, then himself; and did assist them also oftentymes with graunts of great pecuniary succours, vpon the Clergy, as himself in some letters doth complaine: yet did he neuer for this, loose any inward respect, reuerēce or obedience to the said Sea Apostolicke: No, nor did the said Sea cease for many years after, to vse her auncient custome of prouiding Bishopricks, and Prelacies in England, though commonly they were English-men only. As for example, the very next yeare after, to wit, 1344. and 18. of King Edwards raigne, The contin

Pope Vrbanus the fifth made Bishop of Lincolne by his prouision, one Iohn Buckingham, and of Chichester one VVilliam Lynne, and King Edward admitted the same without resistance. And foure years after that againe, the same Pope, vpon the death of Simon Islep Archbishop of Canterbury gaue that Bishopricke by his prouision to Simon Langtham, that was Bishop of Ely, and translated Iohn Barnet Bishop of Bath from that Sea, to Ely, and one M. Iohn Harwell, being commended greatly by Prince Edward of VVales to the said Pope, was admitted by him, to the said Bishoprick of Bath; as also VVilliam VVickham, bearer of the Kings priuy signet,

            10. And two yeares after this againe, in the yeare 1368. we read, that the foresaid Simon Langtham, being made Cardinall by Pope Vrbanus, and therevpon resigning his Archbishopricke of Canterbury, the Pope by his prouision, gaue the same to VVilliam VVriothesley Bishop of VVorcester; and the foresaid Lynne Bishop of Chichester, he translated vnto the Bishopricke of VVorcester; and vnto the Church of Chichester, 
               Diuers other examples. he promoted one VVilliam Roade. In all which wee read not, that K. Edward made any difficulty. And the very next yeare after this againe, wee find registred, that the



same Pope prouided the Churches of Norwich, Hereford, and Exce

                of Bishops by his owne prouision; only it is said of the later of the three, quod Thomas Brangthingham fauore literarum Domini Regis Edwardi, ad Exoniensem Ecclesiam promotus est. Thomas Brangthingham was promoted by the Pope, to the Church of Excester, through fauour of the letters of K. Edward.
            
            11. And finally this matter went on in this manner, vntill towards the later end of K. Edwards raigne, when he growing old and feeble, as well in iudgement, as in body, and matters depending most vpon his sonne Iohn of Gaunt, who was a disorderly man in those dayes, and much cried out vpon, by all the Common-wealth, as may appeare by that he was afterward deposed by Parlament from al gouernment (though it lasted not long) & shewed himself enemy to the State of the Clergy, as soone after he well declared, by the imprisoning of VVilliam VVickham Bishop of VVinchester, assayling Courtney Bishop of London, fauoring the famous hereticke Iohn VVickcliffe at his beginning publickly, and other such signes and demonstrations: at this time (I say) being the 47. of the raigne of K. Edward, 
               The lavve of premunire. according to VValsingham, or 49. according to Polidor, (though the booke of Statutes doth appoint in the 25. and 27. years of the said Kings raigne) were the Statutes made (or perhaps begun to be put in execution) against recourse to Rome, except in causes of appellation, and against prouisions of benefices to be gotten or procured from thence, & not at home, by the patrons thereof. Rex Edwardus (saith Polidor) primus omnium de Consilij sententia, indixit immanem illis paenam, qui in posterum impetrarent vbiuis gentium Anglicana sacerdotia à Romano Pontifice, aut causas, nisi per appellat tonem, ad eundem deferrent, &c. 
               
                  Polidor. hist. Angl. lib. 19. 
               Lex prouisionis siue de Praemoneri vocitatur.
               King Edward first of all other Kings, by the sentence of his Counsell, did decree most horrible punishment vnto those, that for the time to come, should in any parte of the world, obtaine English benefices from the Pope of Rome, or should carry any causes vnto him, but only by appellation. The law is called the law of Prouision, or Praemunire.
               
            
            12. And the same Author addeth further, that Pope Gregory the 11. hearing of this law, tooke the matter greiuously, and wrote to King Edward for the reuocation therof: but there ensuing presently a great schisme in the Church of Rome, which endured allmost 50. years, vntill the tyme of Martin the 5. King Edward also not liuing many years after, and the disordinate gouernment



of his Nephew K. Richard the 2. with the tumultuation of the VVickcliffians succeeding, nothing was done therin. And yet doth it appeare by VValsingham, that vpō that very same yeare of 1374. which was the 48. of K. Edwards raigne, A concordate betvvene the Pope and K. Edvv. for prouisions. there was a treaty begun in the moneth of August, at Bruges in Flaunders, between Embassadors sent both from the sorsaid Pope Gregory, and King Edward, to treat of these points, and that the said treaty endured almost two yeares:
Et tandem (saith he) concordatum est inter eos, quod Papa de catero, reseruationibus beneficiorum minimè vteretur; & quod Rex beneficia per literas (Quare impedit) vlterius non conferret.
               At length it was agreed between them, that the Pope for the time to come, should not vse reseruations of benefices to himself; and that the King should no more bestow benefices by his writ of Quare impedit.
               
            
            13. Thus much writeth VValsingham, and toucheth no other points; which yet probably may be presumed, to haue byn treated at that time, & namely that the Kings for the time to come, should haue the nominations of Bishops, and the Pope only the confirmation and inuestiture, except in certaine cases, as afterward we haue seen practised, not only in England, but in most Catholicke Kingdomes round about: but this by concession and agreement of the Sea Apostolicke it self, without any least intention in the said Princes, to deny the supreme spirituall power, & authority of the said Sea; & much lesse to take it vpon themselues, as M. Attorney would inferre that they did, out of these peeces of Statutes, which he alleadgeth for that purpose. Whervnto now we shall answere breifly, as they ly in this booke.

                  The Catholicke Deuine.
                  15. This assertion I doe not see how it can be admitted for true, as it lieth; for so much as no author maketh mention, 1. Ansvvere. that K. Edward did euer deny absolutely the Popes authority, to excommunicate by himself, or by his Legats in England, especially vpon the 16. yeare of his raigne, as heere it is noted in the margent, when he was most deuout to the Sea Apostolicke, & wrote the humble letter before mentioned, the next yeare after, according to the date of the said letter, as you haue heard: only there might be this accorde between them, for more authority of the said Archbishop, and peace of the Realme; that when he had giuen forth any excommunication, no annullation therof from the Pope (which might perhaps be procured by false suggestion) should be admitted or executed, vntill the Pope were informed of the truth, & this is vsed also in other Catholicke Kingdomes, at this day.
                  16. And it were to much simplicity, to imagine that English men in those dayes, admitting the Archbishops excommunication, as heer they doe (and for confirmation therof we doe read in VValsingham that vpon the yeare 1340. 
                        VValsing. in vita Edou. 3. anno. 1340. and 14. of King Edwards raigne, Iohn Stratford Archbishop of Canterbury, threatned the said King to excommunicate all his counsell, if he amended not certaine points, wherin they offered iniury to Clergy men) it were simplicity (I say) to thinke that the said Archbishops excommunication, could not be controlled by that of the Pope, from whom they acknowledged the said Archbishop at that time to haue his spirituall authority, if he had any at all. For frō whence should they imagine him to haue it? for that the Kings, as we haue seen, had not so much as the nomination or presentation



of Archbishops in that season, but only the Popes, & much lesse their induction, confirmation, or inuestiture. Whervpon it must needs follow, that he which gaue them spirituall iurisdiction, had greater & higher iurisdiction himself, though in some cases by agreement, not to be vsed, as before hath byn said.
               
               
                  The Attorney.
                   
                     
                        
                           •
                         instance.
                     It is often resolued,
that all the Bishopricks within England, were founded by the Kings progenitours, and therfore the aduowsons of them all belong to the King, and at the first they were donatiue: In the Raigne of Ed. 3. and that if an incumbent of any Church with Cure dy, if the Patron present not within six moneths, the Bishop of that Diocesse ought to collate, to the end the Cure may not be destitute of a Pastor. If he be negligent by the space of six moneths, the Metropolitan of that Diocesse shall confer one to that Church: and if he also leaue the Church destitute by the space of six moneths, then the Common-law giueth to the King, as to the supreme within his owne Kingdome, and not to the Bishop of Rome, power to prouide a competent pastor for that Church.
                  
               
               
                  The Catholicke Deuine.
                   
                     
                        
                           •
                         Ansvvere.17. Is it be true which M. Attorney hath so often repeated before, that the Conusaunce, and deciding of Ecclesiasticall causes, doe not appertaine to the Common-law, and that the prouision or induction of Clerks to benefices, and giuing them spirituall iurisdiction ouer the soules of those that be within the compasse of that benefice, be of the number of those causes, which I take to be set downe in like manner by M. Attorneys owne pen before, vnder the names of admissions and institutions of Clerks: 
                        Snpr
                              •
                           . fol 9. then how can it be true, which heere is said, that the Common-law giueth to the King, as to the supreme, to prouide competent Pastors for that, or those Churches, that within the space of a yeare and halfe, are not prouided by the particular patron, Diocesian, or metropolitan? Or where is this Common-law? How, or when did it begin (as often elswhere I haue demaunded)? Either by vse, or statute, or common agreement between the Prince and people? For none of these haue we heard of hitherto, vnder former Kings, though for presenting and nomination to benefices, we haue oftentymes said, that there is no difficulty, but that the temporall Prince, may present in such benefices, or Bishopricks, as he is patron of, either founding the said benefices,



or by particular concession of the Sea Apostolicke vnto him; as we haue shewed more largly before in the life of K. VVilliam the Conquerour, and before him againe vnder K. Edward the Confessor, to whom the Sea of Rome in those dayes, gaue spirituall iurisdiction also, in some cases, ouer the Abbey of VVestminster, & some other places of his Realme.
                  18. But that the Common-law should dispose of these things, The common lavv cannot determine vvho shall giue cure of benefices vvith spirituall authority belonging therevnto. and especially giue spiritual iurisdiction to the King ouer benefices; (for so must the meaning of M. Attorney be, if he delude not his Reader with equiuocation of words) this (I say) is both contrary to his owne rule before set downe, and much more to reason. For that to giue Ecclesiasticall iurisdictiom, is much more, then to haue the conusaunce of Ecclesiasticall causes: which he denying to his Common-law, in diuers places of his booke, as before we haue seen, cānot in reasō ascribe to th'other.
                  19. Wherefore though we graunt this graduation heer set dovvne, as good and conueuient, that if the particular patron doe not present within six moneths, nor the Ordinary, or Metropolitan within their tymes prescribed, the Prince as supreme gouernour of the Common-wealth to see all things done in due order, may present, as if he were patron, to the said benefice; yet first this cannot come originally from the Common-law, for the reasons alleadged. Secondly this proueth no spirituall iurisdiction at all in any presentor, but only power of presentation, which may be in any man that hath Ius patronatus allowed by the Church and head therof, as before hath byn said. This instance maketh against M. Attorney himselfe. Thirdly much lesse doth this proue supreme authority spirituall in the Prince, as M. Attorney would inferre, which is euident among other reasons by this: For that the Prince when he doth present in this manner, by lapse of tyme, or omission of others, is the last in power of presentation, after the Metropolitans and Bishops; which yet should be first, if he were supreme in that sorte of authority, and that the matter went by rigour of law, & not by composition & agreemēt. And finally for that the Prince in this case cannot put in a Pastor immediatly from himself, giuing him spiritual iurisdiction ouer soules; but must present him to the Bishop or Metropolitan, to be induced by him, & indued with that iurisdiction: which he should not doe, if his owne authority spirituall were greater then the said Bishops or Archbishops. And so we see that M. Attorney proueth nothing by this allegation against vs, but rather against himself.

                        Supra cap. 2. & 3. which must be by ordination, commission, & descent from th'Apostles, to whom it was giuen in Capite, as before we haue declared to descend downe by succession, and the said ordination and imposition of hands to the worlds end vpon Bishops, Prelates and Pastores, by lawful subordination the one vnto the other: which cannot fall vpon any lay Princes, that haue not this ordination Ecclesiasticall, as euery man of iudgement, and void of passion, will easily see and discerne. And the example before alleadged of the great Christian Emperour Valentinian the elder, The saying of the Emp. Valentin. Supra cap. 4. that professed himself to be vnum de populo & non de Clero, one of the lay people, and not of the Clergy, and consequently not to haue authority to iudge among them (and much lesse to giue or exercise spirituall iurisdiction) doth shew what the faith and practice of the Catholicke Church was in this point, aboue twelue hūdred years gone.
                  21. Heerby then it is euident how those religious houses, wherof King Edward was founder, 
                        Supra cap. 6. & namely the Abbey of Bury (which is the 3. obiection) were exempted by the Kings Charter from Episcopall iurisdiction, to wit, the King procured the same first from the Sea Apostolicke, & then confirmed it by his Charter, as by many examples you haue seen diuers precedent Chapters of this Booke, and namely vnder King Edward the Confessor, King Edgar, King Kenulph, and King Inas before the Conquest.
                  
                  22. If one was condemned to perpetuall imprisonment for disturbing the Kings presentation by the Popes Bulles, it is a question de facto, as you see, & not de iure: and such might the Kings anger or offence be, as he might also be put to death for it (some Iudges neuer wanting to be ready to satisfie Princes pleasures in such affaires) & yet this doth not proue the lawfulnes of the fact. And we haue seen before, that this King Edward the 3. vpon the 48. yeare of his raigne, promised the Pope that he would neuer vse more that manner of proceeding by his writts of Quare impedit, wherby it is like, this man was so greiuously punished.
                  23. The instance of tithes allotted to the King for maintenance of a Pastor, To the 4. in places without the compasse of any parish is a very poore and triflying instance. First, for that those places, that



are out of all Parishes, are to be presumed to be very few; and secondly what great matter is it, if so small a thing be left in depossto with the King, for vse of the incumbent that is to ensue. We haue seen in our dayes, that tithes and rents of the Archbishopricke of Toledo (for example in Spaine) being valued at three hundred thousand Crownes by the yeare, Trifling obiectiōs. were depositated many years togeather in the Kings hands that last dyed, whiles the Archbishop Carança was called to Rome, & imprisoned there, vpon accusations of heresie, and other crimes laid against him: and in the end sentence being giuen, a great parte of that money was graunted to the said King by the Sea Apostolicke, for his wars against Infidels. And yet doth not this proue that the King of Spaine had this by any spirituall iurisdiction of his owne, but by concession of the Sea Apostolicke.
                   
                     To the 5.24. And wheras M. Attorney saith heere, that by the common laws of England it is euident, that no man vnlesse he be Ecclesiasticall or haue Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, can haue inheritance of tithes. I would aske him first, how he proueth that the King of England had these tithes by inheritance, and not by ordination, agreement, or conuention. And secondly how his Common law can determine, that no man may enioy tithes, but he that hath Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction: wheras before in the 9. leafe of his booke, he maketh tithes to be an Ecclesiasticall cause, and out of the Conusaunce of the said Common-law.
                  
                   
                     To the sixth25. And finally his last inference, that for so much as the King is to present to his free Chappels in default of the Deane, by lapse, that this is done in respect of his supreme Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, is altogeather childish. For that first, to present, includeth no Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction at all, and much lesse supreme; and may be exercised by meer laymen, 
                        Supra cap. 7. as before hath byn declared at large vnder King VVilliam the Conquerour. Secondly for the King to present to his free Chappels, was as much to say in those dayes, as that those Chappels being made free, and exempted by priuiledges and franquises frō the Sea Apostolicke (for otherwise they could not be freed from iurisdiction of their Ordinary) the King presented vnto them, by vertue of the Canon-law, and commission of the said Sea Apostolicke, as founder therof.
                  26. And thirdly, that he presented after the Deane, and by lapse only, and not in the first place, signifieth plainely, that his iurisdiction in that point (if presentation may be called iurisdiction, as in



some sense it may) was lesse then that of the Deane. And so Fitzherberts words are to be vnderstood, that in that particular case the King presēted by lapse, as ordinary, that is to say, wheras in other benefices, when the patron, or partie to whom the election, nomination, or presentation first & cheifly appertaineth, presenteth not within such a tyme, the Ordinary may present, as hauing (by composition) the second right, M. Attorneys case plaine against himself. or power in that case, and after him the Metropolitan, and last of all the King. Heer in the case of Free Chappels (wherof the King is presumed to be founder) after the Deane, which hath the first right (and this by no other meanes, then by cōcession of the Sea Apostolicke in those dayes) the King by priuiledge of the same Sea, had right to enter in the second place insteed of the Bishop, which proueth the quite contrary to M. Attorneys conclusion: for it sheweth that the King had not supreme Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction in the case proposed, but secondary, and subordinate to that of the Deane. But let vs see further.
               
               
                  The Attorney.
                  An excommunication vnder the Popes Bul is of no force to disable any man within England, and the Iudges said, The 4. Instance. 30. E. 3. l. ass. pl. 19. 32. H. 4. 16 14 H. 4. 14. 8.

                         6. that he that pleadeth such Buls, though they concerne the excommunication of a subiect, were in a hard case, if the King would extend his iustice against him. If excommunication, being the extreme and finall end of any suite in the Court at Rome, be not to be allowed within England; it consequently followeth that by the ancient Common-laws of England, no suite for any cause, though it be spirituall, rising within this Realme, ought to be determined in the Court of Rome; Quia frustra expectatur euentus, cuis effectus nullus sequitur: and that the Bishops of England are the immediate officers and ministers to the Kings Courts.
                  In an attachment vpon a prohibition, the defendant pleaded the Popes Bull of excommunication of the Plaintife: the Iudges demaunded of the defendāt, if he had not the certificate of some Bishop within the Realme, testifying this excommunication; to whom the Counsell of the defendant answered, that he had not, neither was it, as he supposed, necessary; for that the Buls of the Pope vnder lead were notorious inough:
but it was adiudged that they were not sufficient, for that the Courte ought not to haue regard to any excommunication out of the Realme:



and therefore by the rule of the Courte, 31

                  The Catholicke Deuine.
                  27. All that is heere said against the acceptance, or admittance of the Popes Bulls for excommunication in England (for of this only as speach in this place) if it be meant of this K. Edwards time only (as according to the argument it must, The Ansvvere. and we haue seen that vnder former Kings the contrary was allwayes in practice) how then doth M. Attorney talke heere againe of his auncient Common-lawes? For if it began first vnder this King, then was it a new law, and not auncient: and if further wee find no Decree or Statute therof at all in this Kings life, as hitherto we haue not, nor doth M. Attorney cite, or quote any, then might it be a matter only de facto of some Iudges, who according to the current of that time, and as they should see the King affected, pleased or displeased with the Popes of those dayes, would reiect, or admit their Buls at their discretion. And then doe you see, vpon what goodly ground, M. Attorney inferreth his conclusion; that if the Popes Buls of excōmunication were not respected in those dayes, it consequently followeth, that by the auncient common laws of England, no suite for any cause, though it be spirituall, rising within this Realme, might be determined in the Courte of Rome. And why so? For that the Popes excommunication was not obayed in England.
                  
                  28. But I would aske him whether no sentence could be giuen, without excommunication? Or whether to such as beleeued the Popes authority in those dayes, it were sufficient in conscience, that the said excommunications were not admitted by some Iudges in their tribunals? Or at least-wise no iudiciall notice taken of them, except they came notified also from some Bishop, as the second Case heer set downe doth touch, & therby insinuateth the solution of the whole riddle, to wit, that Iudges were not bound vnder this K. Edward, to take publicke and Iudiciall notice of anie Bull of excommunication come from abroad, 
                     Bulls from Rome not admitted except they come certifyed frō some Prelate at home. 
                     and presented by any priuate person, except the same came notified from some Bishop in authoritie within the Realme. Which caution is vsed also at this day, in diuers other Catholicke Countreys round about vs, for auoiding trouble, deceit, and confusion, to wit that Bulls and other authenticall writings from Rome, must be seen, and certified by some persons of authority within the Realme, before they can be pleaded in Courte, or admitted generally.
                  
                     29. To the last instance, that Kings annointed with sacred oyle, are capable of spirituall iurisdiction, 
                     
                        S
                              ••
                            Sup. cap. 7. we denie it not, but graunt with the great Ciuill-lawyer Baldus before mentioned, and all Canonists, that diuers cases of spirituall iurisdiction, may be graunted by the Sea Apostolicke vnto annoynted Kings, and so often it hath been done; especially to Kings of England, as former examples, haue declared, namelie of K. Edward the Confessor. Kings are capable of ecclesiasticall iurisdiction by commission. But this assertion of capacitie, & abilitie, to receiue some sorte of spirituall iurisdiction, if it be committed vnto them; doth not proue that they had the said iurisdiction in themselues, or of themselues, by vertue of their Crownes, or annoynting, as M. Attorney would haue men beleeue. But let vs heare further.
               
               
                  The Attorney.
                  Where a Prior is the Kings debitor, and ought to haue tithes of another spirituall person; The

                        . Instance. 38. ass. pl. 30.
                     he may choose either to sue for subtraction of his tithes in the Ecclesiasticall Courte, or in the Exchequer, and yet the persons, and matter also was Ecclesiasticall. For seing the matter, by a meane, concerneth the King, hee may sue for them in the Exchequer, as well, as in the Ecclesiasticall Courte, and there shall the right of tithes bee determined. And Fitzh. in his Nat. Br. fol. 30. holdeth, that before the Statute of the 18. of E. 3. cap. 7. that right of tithes were determinable in the tē
                        porall Courts, 
                           See the stat. of 15. E. t. c. 4. 31. E.

                           . c. 11. at the election of the partie. And by that Statute assigned to be determined in the Ecclesiasticall Court, and the temporall Courte excluded therof. And the Courts of diuers manners of the Kings, and of other Lords in auncient times, had the probates of last wills and testaments; and it appeareth by the 11. Hen. 7. fol. 12. that the probate of testaments did not appertaine to the Ecclesiasticall Courte, but that of late time they were determinable there: so as, of such causes, and in such manner, as the Kings of the Realme, by generall consent and allowance haue assigned to their Ecclesiasticall Courts, they haue iurisdiction by force of such allowance.
                  
                  The King did by his Charter translate Canons secular into regular, 38. Ass. pl. 22. and religious persons, which hee did by his Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, and could not doe it, vnlesse he had iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall.
                  The Abbot of VValtham died in the 45. yeare E. 3. and one Nicholas merrit was elected Abbot, 46. E.

for that the Abbey was



exempt from ordinarie iurisdiction, was sent to Rome to be confirmed by the Pope. And because the Pope by his constitutions had reserued all such collations to himself, he did recite by his Bull, that he hauing no regard to the election of the said Nicolas, gaue to him the said Abbey, and the spiritualties and temporalties belonging to the same, of his spirituall grace, and at the request (as he fained) of the King of England This Bull was read, and considered of in Councell, that is, before all the Iudges of England; and it was resolued by them all that this Bull was against the laws of England, and that the Abbot for obtaining the same, was fallen into the Kings mercie, whervpon all his possessions were seased into the Kings hands, as more at large by the said Case appeareth.
                  
                  
                     Where the Abbot of VVestminster had a Prior & Couent, who were regular, 49. E. 3. l. Ass. pl. 8. and mort in law; yet the King by his Charter did deuide that corporation, and made the Prior and Couent a distinct and capable bodie, to sue, and be sued by themselues.
                  
               
               
                  The Catholicke Deuine.
                  30. The first case of this instance about tithes and probates of testaments, The Ansvvere. is a verie trifling thing to proue M. Attorneys great cōclusion, of supreme authoritie Ecclesiasticall to be in the temporall Prince & his Courts. For as these things, and like other, are in parte belonging to spirituall iurisdiction, in that they concerne benefices; the willes and ordinations of dead men for the benefit of their soules, & the like, partlie also belonging to temporall, Some things may belōg to differēt courtes in different respects. in that they include temporalities & worldly substance, they may in different respects appertaine also to differēt Courts, and so they doe in other Catholicke Countreys at this day: and namelie for probates of testaments, in no other Countrey (perhaps) besides England, are they limited onlie to the Bishops spirituall Courts. About which wee haue the foresaid Statutes of Circumspectè agatis vnder K. Edward the first, and of Articuli Cleri vnder K. Edward the 2. and diuers other Ordinations vnder this King Edward the 3. But how proueth all this M. Attorneys principall conclusion? And how far of is this from inferring supreme Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction to be in the temporall Prince? Is it not strange, that such a man as M. Attorney, would alleadge such toyes? But let vs goe forward.
                  31. If K. Edward did translate by his Charter, the Canons secular



into regular, as heere is said, wee must presume he did it (as before you haue heard K. Henry the 2. to haue done it at VValtham) by authority of the Popes Br
                        •
                     ue, confirmed by his Charter, 
                     
                        Supra in 
                              〈◊〉
                           . 
                        
                           •
                        . and not otherwise. For as well could K. Henry the 2. haue do
                        •
                     e it of his owne authoritie, if it had been annexed to his Crowne, at this K. Edward the 3. And therefore seing the other obserued the Canons of the Church, and presumed not to doe it of himself, but by the Popes licence and Charter, and ratified by his owne, it may be presumed that this King did the same, for so much as the same Canon-law stood still in force. And so it may be suspected, that this case hath somewhat omitted couertly that should appertaine to the full declaration therof.
                  32. The other case also of Nicolas Morris chosen Abbot of VValtham, that went to Rome and got his inuestiture there, by reseruation of the Pope, and not by his election in England, 
                     VVhy the Abbot of VValtam vvas seuerely punished. fell out at that verie time, as heere is noted, when the contention was most in heat between the King and French Popes, about reseruation of benefices, to wit, vpon the 4. of the Kings raigne, the said Popes agreeing soone after to vse no more the said reseruations. So as no great maruaile of the Iudges of those dayes, did moue the King to make some demonstration of speciall offence against this man, the controuersie being then in handling: but this is an instance de facto and not de iure.
                  
                  33. Lastlie the case of the Abbot of VVestminster made, by the Kings Charter, a distinct bodie, capable to sue, and to be sued, was a temporal priueledge, which any Prince might giue to a Couent, if it vvere commodious for them, and they willing to accept thereof: and if not, they would haue reclaimed in those daies, and haue appealed to the Sea Apostolicke for remedie, as the vse and right was at that time, and as oy diuers examples appeareth of Appellatiōs made against the King himself, during his raigne; as namelie that of the Bishop of Ely, recounted at large by VValsingham in the yeare 1348. and others.
                  34. The six instance consisteth of certaine Statutes, The 
                           •
                        . Instance. made in the 25. 27. 28. and 38. yeares in the raigne of K. Edward the 3. against prouisious and prouisers from Rome, reseruations of Bishopricks and benefices by the said Sea, vndue appellations, vniust citations, infamations or molestations of men by Censures from thence. All which I thinke not good to set downe at large as they lie in the Statute booke, for that they are ouerlonge,



but breiflie rather to alleadge the summe therof, which is sufficient for the point it self of our controuersie. First then it is said:
That in consideration of the manie inconueniences and hurtes, that seemed to ensue to the Common-wealth, as well Clergie-men, as secular, by such as went to Rome, and there by false suggestions, and other such procurements, vnworthilie got vnto themselues benefices, they being either strangers, not able to preach, and teach, or els, if English-men, yet vnfit for their learning, or manners, and that therby particular patrons were depriued of their right of presenting, &c? The summe of the first restraint about Prouisions.
                     
It was ordained vpon the 25. yeare of this Kings raigne, to punish the persons, that being subiect to the King, should attempt, or doe this without the Kings licence, or knowledge of the Realme. And so the decree of Parlament was, that whosoeuer hereafter should attempt, or procure any such prouisions, 
                     
                        Stat. 25. E. 3. de prouisoribus.
                      
                     he should be out of the Kings protection, whereby euerie man might lawfullie kill him, &c.
                  
                  35. And in the same Parlament, the like, and many other inconueniences are represented against reseruations of benefices, by the said Sea Apostolicke, and Bishops therof, whervpon it is decreed, by the King, and his great men, and Commons, that the said reseruations shall not bee suffered, or admitted for the time to come, as a thing not due to the Sea Apostolicke; But that all Archbishops, Bishops, and other dignities, and benefices Electorie in England, shall bee permitted to free election, as they were graunted by the Kings progenitours, founders therof, and the auncestors of other Lords, that had founded any such benefices, and might haue reserued to themselues, as Patrons, and founders, the presentations there vnto.
                  
                  36. Moreouer Complaint being made by diuers of the Kings people, that many were greatlie troubled, and drawne out oftentimes of the Realme, by vnquiet and litigious people, that made appeals to Rome, to answere to things, wherof the Conusaunce pertained to the Kings Court, &c. It was assented, and accorded by the King, and by the great men, and Commons, that whosoeuer should draw any man out of the Realme, in plea, wherof the Conusaunce pertained to the Kings Courts, should incurre the daunger of Praemunire. And finallie:
that no man presume to cite, sue, vex, molest any by Censures procured from the Popes Courte, against any, for obseruing these laws, and like other ordinances, vpon paine of seuere punishment, &c.
                  
                  37. To all which we answere, The Ansvvere. that diuers circumstances may bee considered about these Statutes, Ordinances, and Decrees, as well of the times, and persons, as of the occasions, causes, and manner of doing. And to begin first with the last; it may bee,



that either all, or some parte of these restrictions might be made by some kind of consent or toleration of the Popes themselnes, vpon the often representing of the inconueniences, which we haue seen before made by diuers Princes, from K. Henry the 3. down-ward, and the answers as well of Innocentius the 4. as other Popes, that the said inconueniences should be remedied. And to the same effect putteth downe VValsingham this K. Edwards letters, Agreemēt betvvene the King and Pope about prouisiōs. at seuerall times, to sundry Popes for that end. And vpon the yeare 1373. 
                        •
                     hich was the 47. of his raigne (long after the making of these Statutes) he sent againe to Gregory the 11. to intreat his consent, and good will to the same.

                           •
                        m, &c.
                     The same yeare K. Edward sent Embassadours to the Pope, praying him, that he would be content to surcease from prouiding benefices in England, & that Clerks might enioy their rights to Ecclesiasticall dignities by elections, as in old time they were accustomed. So as heere we see,

                     For VValsingham addeth: super quibus articulis nuncij à Papa certa recepêre responsa, &c. vpon which articles the Kings messengers receiued from the Pope certaine answers, of which they should informe him at their returne, & that nothing should be determined, vntill the King had written againe his mind more fully vnto the said Pope. And then in the next yeare after he saith, as before you haue heard, that the Pope, and the King were agreed vpon these, and like points.
                     
                  
                  38. And if this were so at this time, then may it be presumed also, that before vpon the 25. yeare of his raigne, when he first made those Statutes of restraint, he had also some secret consent, or conniuency of Pope Clement the 6. or Innocentius the 6. that immediately ensued him, to the same effect: at least wise, for the ceasing of prouisions and reseruations, except only vpon great and weighty causes, (for in such cases we find, that they were vsed also afterward) and that ambitious, busie, and troublesome people, that should deceitfully procure such prouisions, or rashly and vniustly appeale, or molest men with Citations, Censures, and the like, should be punished.

                      And this was a thing so needful oftentymes, as S. Bernard himself, that liued vnder King Henry the first, and writing to Pope Eugenius, that had byn his scholler, of the great abuses of troublesome appellatiōs in his dayes, wisheth



him, as on the one side to admit all due appellations, which of right were made vnto him, and to his tribunall, from all partes of the world; so on the other side, to punish them that made them vniustly.
                  39. All which being considered, togeather with the time before noted, wherin K. Edward made these restraints, to wit, when he had great warrs in France for challenge of the Crowne, and no small iealousie with the Popes, Cardinals, and Roman Court, as being all, or the most parte French at that day, and residing in Auinion in France; the continuall clamours also of his people, much exaspered by certaine particular abuses, and excesses of some Ecclesiasticall officers: Of the reasons & manner of cōcluding these restraints by K. E. the 3. the maruaile is not so great, if he tooke some such resolution, as this de facto, at least for satisfying especially of the laity, who were most instant in the matter; Yea & by whom only, it seemeth to haue byn done. For that in none of these Statutes is mentioned expressly the consent of the Lords spirituall; but of the King, and Great men (Magnatum in Latin) and of the Communalty, which is repeated in euery of the forsaid Statutes, except one, where is said. The King by the assent, and expresse will, and concord of the Dukes, Earles, Barrons, and the Commons of this Realme did determine, &c not mencioning at al the Bishops, Archbishops, Abbots, and other Ecclesiasticall Prelates, that had right of suffrage in those Parlaments; and consequently, how far this probation de facto doth proue also de Iure, I leaue to the Reader to consider.
                  40. Only we conclude, that howsoeuer this was, either by right or wrong, for the manner of determining; certaine it is, that King Edward did not therby diminish any way his opinion, or iudgment of the Popes spirituall authority: King Edvvards restraints diminished not his devv respect to the church as may appeare by al his other actions writings to the same Sea afterwards, and of his respectiue carriage and behauiour, not only towards the Popes, but to his owne Clergy also in England, in all matters belonging to their superiority Ecclesiasticall. In proofe wherof, vpon the very selfsame 25. yeare of his raigne, wherin the former Statutes of restraint were decreed against such of his subiects as should offend therein; he made another Statute intituled. A confirmation of all libertyes, graunted the Clergy.

                           •
                        he libertyes of the Church confirmed. So as all the former restraints, were pretended for particular cases only, mixt with temporaltyes, and for remedy of some excesses and inconueniences, without detraction of any thinge from the acknowledged supreme power of the Pope and Sea Apostolicke, in meere spirituall matters.
                  41. And how far then, is all this that is alleadged here by M. Attorney, from prouing that K. Edward the 3. did hold himself for supreme head of the Church, euen in spirituall and Ecclesiasticall matters? Or that his restraints before made in the cases set downe, might bee a president, or warrant, either de facto, or de iure to Q. Elizabeth, to K. Henrie the 8. or K. Edward that followed him, to denie wholy the Popes authoritie, and take it to themselues? And so much of this K. Edward the 3. whose religion & iudgmēt, though it were euer Catholicke, as hath been said; yet was his life and actions manie times disordinate and violent, The disordinate life of K. Edvvard the third. as of a souldiar & warrier; and this not onlie against the liberties of the Church, but against the precepts of good life and gouernmēt also. The first appeareth by a longe reprehension written vnto him, with threatning likewise of excommunication from Iohn Stratford Archbishop of Canterburie, vpon the yeare 1340. wherin he doth sett downe the manie greiuances, 
                        VValsing. in vita Edouardi 3. an. 1340. which he did laie vpon the Church vniustlie. And for the second, it maie bee vnderstood, as wel by the same narration of the foresaid Archbishop, wherin he said to the king, admonishing him of his fathers miserable end: Ferè corda populo terra amisistis. You haue almost lost the hearts of all the people of the land. As also the same is euidēt by the generall testimonie of our historiographers, who make the later parte of his raigne to haue been very much disordered, & thereby also vnfortunate & miserable, as maie appeer by these words of VValsingham, who hauing much commended other graces in him, saith:
Luxus tamē & motus suae carnis lubricos, etiam in aetate senili non cohibuit, &c.
he did not euen in his old age, restraine the luxurious and fraile motiōs of his owne flesh; being much allured hereunto, as is said; by the incitation of a certaine dishonest woman, named Alice Pierce, that was with him vnto the end of his life, and was cause of hastening the same. And it is greatlie to bee noted, as in the former parte of his raigne, all things went prosperously with him; so



towards the later end in his old age, through the demerit of his synnes, all fell out contrarie, &c.
               
            
            
               OF KING RICHARD THE SECOND, The tweluth King after the Conquest. § I.
                
                  This King raigned 12 years frō 1377. to 1399.42. Next after the death of K. Edward succeded his Nephew K. Richard the 2. for 22. years, sonne of Prince Edward surnamed the Black Prince, who died not long before his father. The child was but an eleuen yeares old when he tooke the Crowne, and of verie great expectation, but that youth wealth, and commaundrie in that age, with adulation, and peruerse counsaile of licencious people, The causes of K. Richardes disorders. that are wont to accompanie that state and condition of Princes, drew him aside to his owne pittifull ruine in the end; and would God, in his life, conuersation, & gouernment, he had as well held the stepps and wisedome of his auncestors, as he did in the outward maintenance of their religion, and obediēce towards the Sea Apostolicke: for that (probably) it would haue preserued him frō the miseries whereunto hee fell; though it bee true also, that dissolution of life, doth commonlie bring with it contēpt or neglect, or lesse estimation of religion: whervnto this man, and some that were about him, had the more occasion giuen them, by the prophane, and wicked doctrine of VVi

                        •
                     liffe & his fellows, that preuailed much in these daies, and brought many of the Common people to such fury & contempt of all religion, as their strange tumults, and raging rebellions, vnder their Captaines, wat Tyler, Iack Straw, and other like vnruly rulers, doe well declare.
               43. But yet the externall face of religion, and practice therof, receiued and established from the times of all former Kings, was continued also by him; & in particular, it is to be noted, that no one King, did euer more often confirme and ratifie the liberties of the Church, then he, which is as much to say, as to establish the opposite negatiue proposition against M. Attorney, professing



heerby, that he had not supreme authority in causes Ecclesiasticall, King Richard often confirmed the libertyes of the church. for so much as the libertyes of the English Church did expressly consist in this, that Church-men, and Church-matters, and all spirituall and ecclesiasticall affaires, were a distinct gouernment from the temporall, and subordinate only among themselues, the one degree to the other, and all mediately to the Sea Apostolicke, and Bishops therof.
               44. For proofe then of this, that King Richard did confirme and maintaine, all the dayes of his raigne, these libertyes, franquises, and priuiledges of the Church, and of Clergy-men, appeareth by his owne Statutes: As for example, by the first Statute made in his first yeare, with this title. A confirmation of the libertyes of the Church: and the second Statute made in his second yeare hath the same title, and subiect; as also hath the first Statute of his third yeare, and first of his 5. and first of his 6. and first of his seauenth yeare. And so in like manner shall we find the very first Statutes of his 12. and 21. years, to containe the same confirmation.
               45. And if I should stand vpon the enumeration of particular examples, The practice of Church-libertyes by Clergy-men vnder K. Richard the second. of the practice of these libertyes in Clergy-men of those dayes, it would be ouerlonge, as namely, how all Bishops, Archbishops, Abbots, and other Prelates, elected according to the agreement before taken, repaired to the Bishop of Rome for their confirmations, and could not exercise any parte of their offices, vntill they had the same. And albeit according to the former decrees of the 25. and 27. yeares of K. Edward the 3. confirmed also in the 13. and 16. yeares of the raigne of this King, reseruations of benefices, or prouisions immediately from the Court of Rome were not admitted (which little importeth our controuersie with M. Attorney) yet this, which includeth the maine ground & substantiall foūdation of all acknowledgement of supreme spirituall power, remained still vntouched, to wit, that no Bishop, Archbishop, or other Prelate, by whomsoeuer he was presented, chosen, or nominated, could, or can at this day, haue spirituall iurisdiction, but either mediaté or immediatè from the Pastor of the Sea Apostolicke. And this point did K. Richard maintaine and defend all dayes of his life, which is the principal point, as hath byn said, of acknowledging the soueraigne authority of the Sea Apostolicke in spirituall affaires, for that other things are but dependance of this, as annexed sequels.
               46. And I might alleadge heere diuers particular examples of



King Kichards respectiue proceedings towards both the Sea of Rome and Clergy of his Countrey: as namely in the first, wheras Pope Vrban the 6. being truly, Respect borne by King Richard to the true Pope. and Canonically elected Pope in Rome, & afterward against him, the Archbishop of Arles in France being chosen for Anti-Pope by a faction of French-Cardinals, that named him Clement the 7. King Richard stood zealously with the said true Pope, and not only made a Statute in Parlament, that whosoeuer should be obedient to any other person, as Pope, but only to Pope Vrban, 
                  2. Rich. 2. cap. 7. 
                  should be out of the Kings protection, and his goods seased, as the words of the Statute are; but also some yeares after that againe when the said Pope Vrban had appointed Henry Bishop of Norwich, to be his Captaine general, to passe ouer into Flanders, and by force, to constraine the said schismaticall Pope to surcease that diuision; the said King not only allowed, but assisted also that enterprise.
               47. And as for the Clergy of his Realme, and their spirituall iurisdiction, how much he respected it, appeareth by that the Archbishop of Canterbury, 
                  King Richard obeyed the Censures of the Church. and some other Bishops, that assisted him; hauing publikely pronounced the sentence of excommunication, vpon the yeare 1379. against certaine persons, that had broken the priuiledges of Sanctuary in the Church and Monastery of VVestminster, and shed bloud therin, for taking out a certaine person in the Kings name; the said King albeit, he was thought to haue byn the abetter 
                     •
                  hereof, yet did he finally obay the said Censures, and soone after in the same yeare at his Parlament of London, it was ordained (saith VValsingham). Quod immunitates, & priuilegia Ecclesia VVestmonasteriensis illibata manerent: that the libertyes, 
                     VValsing. an. 1379. & priuiledges of the Church of VVestminster should remaine whole and inuiolate.
               48. Wherefore now to answere the instance or obiectiō which M. Attorney alleadgeth out of the foresaid Statute of the 16. yeare of this King, M. Attorneys Instance out of this K. Raigne. 
                  where the law of Premunire, the losse of goods, and lands, & other punishments are appointed for such, as doe procure processe, and sentences of excōmunicatiō, which touched the king their Lord, against him, his crowne, and his regalitie, &c. as larglie you maie see it set downe in the whole Statute out of M. Attorneys booke. The crovvne of Englād not subiect to any in temporalityes. I answere that whosoeuer shall attentiuelie read the whole contexture of this Statute, with that which before wee haue sett downe, both in this, & in the precedent kings life, he shall see that this Statute doth rather make against M. Attorneys purpose of supreme spirituall iurisdiction,


                  
then anie waie for him. For that first of all, the verie proposition to the Parlament doth concerne temporal power, and not spirituall, saying: that the Crowne of England hath been at all times free, and onlie subiect to God immediatlie, and to none other, and that the same ought not in anie thing, touching the maiesty or regalitie of the same Crowne, bee submitted to the Bishop of Rome, nor the laws and Statutes thereof to bee taken away or mablect by him, &c.
               
               49. This then being the proposition of the Commons, which is euidently to bee vnderstood of temporall regalitie, and thinges thereunto belonging, the temporall Lords assented absolutelie vnto it.
But the Archbishop, Bishops, Abbots, and other Ecclesiasticall Prelates, that made the cheife, and highest parte of the Parlament, distinguished; yea made protestations (as the Statute saith) that it was neuer their meaning (to witt either in K. Edwards daies or now) to saie that the Bishop of Rome might not excommunicate Bishops, or make translation of Prelates from one Sea to another, after the law of holie Church: yet if this should bee done at anie time, in great preiudice of the King or his realme, as that sage men, or Counsellours should therby be drawne from him, without his knowledge, or against his will; or that the substance, and treasurie of his Realme, should bee in daunger to be destroyed, by sending out money or giuing it to his aduersaries, or other like inconueniences ensue against the Kings state and realme indeed; then they did graunt, that this might bee esteemed against the Kings regalitie, &c. whereby wee see in what sense,
and with what limitation, they did yeeld to such like Statutes in those daies, In vvhat sense the Bishop yelded to the statute of Premunire. pressed by the importunitie of the laie partie, but yet far from the meaning of M. Attorney, who would haue men thinke, that heerby they confessed K. Richard to bee Head of the Church, which himself expresly denieth in his forenamed Statute in fauour of Pope Vrban, whom hee calleth the onlie true head of the Church, and for such commaundeth him to bee obaied and respected, vnder the paines before mencioned. And so much of K. Richard, who not long after fell into great misery, & lost both his commaundry and life, and came to a pitifull end, full of affliction and desolation, as our histories doe testify and set forth at large.

Richard the 2. entred and ensued in the Crowne three Henries of the line of Lancaster, who had variable successe in their liues and temporall affaires, though in religion, and particularly in this point of our controuersie, about spirituall power and iurisdiction, they were all one.
             
               
                  K. Henr. 4. raigned 13. yeares, from 1399. to 1412.2. King Henrie the 4. being Duke of Lancaster, and sonne of the often fore named Iohn of Gaunt, that was the fourth sonne of K. Edward the 3. seing the disorderly gouernment of K. Richard the 2. his Cosen germā, & the auersion of his peoples affection, from him for the same cause, came out of France, where he liued in banishement, raised powers against him, pursued and tooke his person, caused him to be deposed by Parlament, and himself chosen in his place with great applause of the people, which yet turning away from him soone after againe, he was forced for



his safetie & defence not onlie to make away the same K. Richard in Pomfret Castle, but also to take armes, suppresse, and cut of the greatest and cheifest men, that had aided and assisted him to gaine the said Kingdome. 
                  Stovv in Kent. 4. And finallie after a troublesome raigne of 13. yeres, he died, vsing these words before his death, as they are registred by Stow, and others: I sore repent mee, that euer I charged my self with the Crowne of this Realme, &c.
            
            3. King Henry the 5. his eldest sonne succeeded him, for the space of ten years;

               Richard Earle of Cambridg Henry lord Scroope treasurer. Edmond Earle of March &c.
                but his owne nobility also, kinred, and cheife officers, conspiring against him, and seeking his ouerthrow. And finally, when he was in the very middest, and heat of his wars and Conquest, and his life and health most desired, both by himself & others, he died with much affliction of mind in France, leauing a little child of his owne name, that was but eight moneths old, to preserue, and defend that which he had gotten, but could not, as the euent proued.
            4. This young infant then, borne as it were a King, 
                  H. 6. raigned 18 yeres from 1422. to 146

was neuer effected, nor that good motion put in execution.
            5. But yet that all these three Kings of the house of Lancaster were perfectly, and zealously Catholicke, no man can deny; and infinite arguments are extant therof, yea and of this point also in particular, of their acknowledgment and reuerence of the soueraigne spiritual authority of the Bishop of Rome in the Church of Christ. And therfore King Henry the fourth, considering the great hurtes and scandals, that had ensued for many yeres togeather by schisme of Anti-Popes in the Sea Apostolicke, was so carefull, and diligent, to procure and assist the Generall Councell indicted at Pisa in Italy, for the extinguishing therof; as not only he sent learned Prelates vpon his charges thither, to help & assist the said Councell, as namely Robert Bishop of Salisbury, and other learned men, but wrote very pious letters also both to Gregory the 12. that was the true Pope, and to all his Cardinals, by a speciall Embassadge of his owne, persuading the said Pope by diuers godly and prudent reasons, to persist in his mind and promise of giuing ouer the Popedome, as the other Anti-pope called Benedictus the 13. had in like manner promised. Of which his letter to the said Pope he making mention in another to the foresaid Cardinals saith: 
                  VValsing. in vita Henriei 4. an. 1490. 
               Cupientes ostendere quem zelum habuimus, & habemus, vt pax detur Ecclesiae, &c. we desiring to shew what zeale we haue had, and haue, that peace be giuen to the Church,
we haue by consent of the States of our Kingdome sent our letters vnto his Holines, &c.
               
            
            6. And when this Councell of Pisa tooke no great effect vntill fiue yeares after, when in the tyme of his sonne K. Henry the 5. the generall Councell of Constance in Germany was appointed for the same effect, the said sonne K. Henry the 5. following his Fathers piety heerin, caused the Archbishop of Canterbury, Henry Chychley, to call 
                  ••••
               t a Councell in England, to choose fit English Prelates to be sent to that Councell; and so were chosen, not onlie the foresaid Bishop of Salysburie sent before to Pisa, 
               English Prelates sent to the Councell of Cōstance. but Bath and Hereford also, togeather with the Abbot of VVestminster, Prior of VVorcester, and other famous learned men, to whom the King added for his Embassadour, the Earle of VVarwycke to accompany them thither, where the said schisme being extinguished, by the deposition of three that pretended to be Popes, and Martyn the 5. being established in that seate,



the whole Christian world was put in peace thereby.
            7. And for that in the same Councell, the heresies of VVickcliffians and Lollards were especially condemned and anathematized, the same decrees were presently admitted, and put in execution in England, by the zealous commaundement of the said K Henry the 5. though his father K. Henry the 4. and the whole State had preuented that decree, by making temporall laws, in confirmation of the Canonicall and Churches laws, for the punishment of the said Lollards and VVickcliffians that denyed the Popes Supremacy, Lavves for executing of Lollard and vvicklifists. and caused manie of them to bee burneed; and so did K. Henrie the 6. also, during all the time of his raigne: whereby as by infinite other thinges that might bee alleadged, their beleife and iudgment in that behalfe is sufficiently declared; though in respect of some temporall inconueniences, and the inclination of their people, vpon former complaints, they recalled not the said restraints, laws, or ordinances made by their progenitors, wherof now we shall speake more particularly, in answering the instances alleadged by M. Attorney our of their raignes.

                  8. It is resolued that the Popes Collectors, First Instance. though they haue the Popes Buls for that purpose, haue no iurisdiction within this Realme: and there the Archbishops, and Bishops, &c. of this" Realme, are called the Kings spirituall Iudges. 2.

                  It is to bee considered who resolued this, and vpō what ground, The Ansvvere. for it maie bee there was some agreement taken between the Pope and the Realme in that behalfe, concerning the Collectors authoritie, as in other Catholicke Countreys also at this daie, wee see there is: Neither had the said Collector by his office, anie ordinarie iurisdictiō, but extraordinarie onlie by particular commission. Hovv Bishops may be called the Kings spirituall Iudges. And commonly those collections were made cum



beneplacito Principis, with the good liking of the Prince, where they are made. Archbishops & Bishops maie bee called the Kings spirituall Iudges, for that they are his subiects, as Peers and principall members of the Realme (as before hath been declared) and doe liue vnder his protection,

But let vs see his second Instance.

                           . 269.9. By the auncient lawes Ecclesiasticall of this Realme, no man could be conuicted of heresie,
being high treason against the allmighty, but by the Archbishop and all the Clergy of that prouince, and after abiured therevpon, and after that newly conuicted, and condemned by the Clergy of that prouince in their generall Councell of Conuocation.
                     
But the Statute of 2. H. 4. cap. 15. doth giue the Bishop in his Diocesse, 
                        This had a resemblance to an. Attainder of treason,

Wherby it appeareth that the King by consent of Parlament, directed the proceedings in the Ecclesiasticall Courte, in case of heresie, and other matters more spirituall.

He cannot with any probability. And as for the matter heere touched, that no man could be conuicted of heresie, but by the Archbishop,

                     and all the Clergie of that Prouince, and after abiured, and then newly conuicted, and condemned againe by a generall Councell of Conuocation, &c In some points he hitteth right, but in other not. For when any new heresie is discouered, it must be iudged and condemned by some such Synod or Councell, as heer is mentioned, if the head of the Church haue not condemned it before. But when the heresie is condemned, it was neuer necessary to call



such Synods or Councell, for conuicting of euery particular man, that shall be accused of that heresie: and much lesse was it needfull, that there should be two seuerall conuictions, the one before abiuration, the other after: (except in such as were relapsed) for what if the hereticke should stand stiffely to it, vpon his first conuiction, and would not abiure, but defend his heresie? did the anncient laws Ecclesiasticall of England (thinke you) forbid him in this case to be punished? I thinke not.
                  10. But M. Attorney hath a note in the margent, wherat I cannot but maruaile, for that he hearing in this place, out of the old sense of our ancient lawes, heresie to be held for high treason against God, and that (as he supposeth) it must be twise conuicted, which is only true in relapse, saith in the margent. This had a resemblance to an Attainder of treason, wherin there must be first an indictment by one Iury, and a conuiction by another. But I deny this resemblance to be of any moment for the forme of proceeding, though for the thing, I graunt, that heresie is truly treason against God; but this double conuiction heer mentioned by two Iuries, M. Attorneys marginal note reproued. hath little or no similitude with the other of relapsed heresie, where the party is first permitted to abiure his first fault and not punished, except he offend the second time in the same: Which yet I persuade my self M. Attorney will not allow in humane treasons against the Prince, that he must twise iterate his fault, before he can be punished, and so the parity or similitude holdeth not.
                  11. But now to the principall point; where the Attorney saieth that the Statute of K. Henry the 4. doth giue the Bishop in his Diocesse, power to condemne an hereticke, and that before that Statute, he could not be committed to the secular power to be punished, vntill he had once abiured, and was againe relapsed, &c. and that heerby it appeareth, that the King directed Ecclesiasticall proceedings &c. Diuerse errors are heere couched togeather, and then if ignorance be the inseperable twynne of euery error (as M. Attorney in his Preface holdeth) you know what will ensue.
                  12. First then it is presumed in this assertion, that no hereticke could be put to death in old tyme, except he were relapsed, that is to say, had once (at least) abiured his heresie, and fallen vnto it againe: 
                        In Cod. l. Manicheos l. Arriani l. Quicunque & apud Paul. Diacon. l. 14. & 16. which is false. For that albeit such people were most of all to be punished, for their periury, and inconstancy; yet other also that neuer abiured, if they stood obstinate, might by ancient laws, as well Ciuill, as Canonicall be punished by death; as in the Ciuill is auerred by the particular laws, and ordinations of



                     Theodosius, Valentinian, Martian, Iustinian, and other Christian Emperours, extant in the Code. And in the  
                        See cap. ad abolendum, & cap. excō
                        municamus extra. de haeret. & in 6. de heret. cap. Super co. Canon law in like manner, is determined by diuers definitions there to be seen, that incorrigible hereticks are to be deliuered ouer to the secular power, to be punished by them, whether they be relapsed or not relapsed, though more the relapsed. And all this was before the Statute of K. Henry the 4. which did nothing els, but allow, and confirme the vse, and exercise of the said laws. For so it appertained vnto him, as King of the Realme, to consider whether the exercise of these Ecclesiasticall laws, haue any incōuenience against the State, or no.
                  13. And moreouer, where it is heer said, that the Statute of K. Henry giueth the Bishop, power in his Diocesse to condemne an hereticke, as though before he had it not by Canon-law, is another grosse error. For that this fact of K. Henry was nothing els but an approbation of a more auncient decree made before, by Pope Gregory the 9. extant in the Decretals of the Canon-law in these words.

                     Quoniam Episcoporum numerus, &c.
                     For that the number of Bishops appointed by auncient Canons, for the degradation of Clergymen, cannot alwayes so easily come togeather, we graunt vnto you (Archbishop of Rhemes) that when any Priest, or Clerke, being within holy Orders, is either to be giuen ouer to the secular Courte, to be punished for heresie, or perpetually to be walled vp, you calling togeather the Abbots, and other Prelates, and religious persons, and learned men of your Diocesse, which you shall thinke good, may alone degrade him in their presence, you being his Bishop, &c.
                     
                  
                   
                     
                        An. 1227.14. This was the Decree of Pope Gregory, aboue two hundred yeares before King Henryes Statute, for giuing licence to euery Bishop within his Diocesse alone, with the help of his learned counsell, and other assistance heer mentioned, to condemne, degrade and deliuer ouer to secular power any obstinate hereticke relapsed, or not relapsed: Decree of Pope Gregory the nynth about proceeding against heretickes. (though such as were not relapsed, and acknowledged their faultes, might be dealt withall more mildly, as by walling or shutting them vp, as heer is mentioned) And that this Decree of Pope Gregory was an exception, or priuiledged forme of proceeding from the auncient Canons, that appointed a certaine precise number of Bishops to be called togeather for the deposition of Deacons, Priests, and Bishops, appeareth by the words thereof, that doe mention the said Canons,



which you may see in the body of the Canon-law, cited out of the Councell of Carthage, 
                     
                        Causa. 15. q. 7. c. Si quia tumidus. ex con. 1. Carthag.
                      aboue twelue hundred years past. So as M. Attorneys inference, that heerby K. Henry tooke vpon him to direct the proceedings of the Ecclesiasticall Courte in cases of heresie, hath no substance in it at all, for so much as you see it was directed by the Canon law long before K. Henry was borne.
                  15. Wherefore to his last instance, that the Pope cannot alter the laws of England: I answere it is true, touching temporall laws, for they are to be made, or altered by the English Prince and Parlament: but Ecclesiasticall laws of the Church, if they be positiue, & not deuine, he might in all those auncient times, vpon iust causes alter, as I thinke M. Attorney will not deny; and then by good consequence, if it be true, which euery where he striueth to proue that Ecclesiasticall laws, though made by the Pope, are laws also of England, and may be called English lawes, when they are admitted in England; Hovv the Pope in old time might alter English lavves. it followeth (I say) against himself in this assertion, that the Pope might alter the lawes of England, in that he might alter those Canon-lawes, that were admitted in England, & thereby made English lawes.

                     1. The Iudges say, 3 Instance 1. H. 4. fol. 69. 76.
that the Statutes which restraine the Popes prouisions to the benefices of the aduowsons of spirituall men, were made, for that the spiritualty durst not in their iust cause, say against the Popes prouisions; so as those Statutes were made, but in affirmance of the common laws.

                     Ansvvere to the first.16. I haue conioyned three or foure obiections togeather, for that indeed all make not the due waight of one. Wherfore to the first I answere, that little it importeth to our controuersie, what those Iudges said, why the Statutes were made against the Popes prouisions in affirmance of the Common-laws: for this may be said of euery new Statute whatsoeuer, that it is made in affirmance of ancient Common-law; albeit the said law (supposed to be common) no where appeare, nor any reason, proofe, or probability be alleadged why it should be Common-law, before that fact or Statute appeared: So as this Common-law, is now by M. Attorney made so common, as it cometh to be Ens transcendens, embracing all that is, or can be deuised by any of his Iudges, or Reuerend Sages, or rather he maketh it Ens rationis, or a meere Chymera, that (as Logitians hold) hath no essence or being at all à parte rei, but only in imagination. For seing that the Popes prouisions had endured in England for so many ages before, as all doe, and must graunt: how may the common law be presumed all that while, to haue byn against the same, & yet no mention euer made therof; These are morall impossibilityes, to say no more.
                   
                     To the second.17. The second point doth answere it self, and we haue touched the same before, that by agreement in England, the Popes Buls of Excommunication, when they were sent, should not be admitted ordinarily, but by the certificate of some Bishop of England, for preuenting the fraudes, or false suggestions, which particular men might vse therein. VVhence Bishops courtes haue their authority. And wheras M. Attorney heere againe saith, that the Bishops are by the Common lawes, the immediate officers and ministers to the Kings Courtes in causes Ecclesiasticall, he runneth againe to his old Chymera of imaginary Common lawes. For where is this Common-law, that maketh Bishops to be officers, and ministers to the Kings Courts in causes Ecclesiasticall? For if the Common-law or Iudges thereof cannot so much as heare, or take conusaunce of any spiritual causes belonging to Bishops Courts, as  
                        R
                              •
                           portes fol. 8. & 9. often M. Attorney affirmeth in this his booke; how much lesse can it, or they by vertue therof, appoint Iudges, or make them officers in those spirituall Courts, which haue their authority from the Canon and not Common lawes?
                   
                     To the third.18. To the third obiection little answere is needfull: For who seeth not but that euery King in his Kingdome, may commaund



all 
                        •••
                     es of people to doe their duty, & to surcease from wrong. And so, if a Bishop for a cause not belonging vnto him, should excommunicate any, the Prince may commaund him to absolue 
                        〈◊〉
                      party, whome vniustly he hath excommunicated, if the iniustice bee so apparant, as heere is presumed. But M. Attorney should haue proued, that the King himself might haue absolued him, as in truth he might, if he had Superiour authority to the Bishop in Ecclesiasticall causes: The King may commaund the Bishop to doe his duty. as he may absolue immediately by himself, all that are censured, or sentenced, adiudged, or condemned by his Chauncellour, lay Iudges, or temporall officers, and ministers: nor hath he need to send the party, to be assoiled by them, or to will them to doe it, as heer he doth the Bishop; but might doe it himself, or by some other, giuing him authority thervnto, which yet neuer King of England did attempt before King Henry the 8.
                  19. To the 4. braunch is answered, To the fourth. that by good reason it was agreed, that no religious man, hauing made his vow of obediēce in England, should seeke to Rome for exemption therof, without proposing his causes first in England it self; for that otherwise, vpon false informations & suggestions of the party against his Superiours, many troubles and inconueniences might follow by such exemptions: and this is that which is touched in the Statute it self here alleadged, affirming; that no man shall goe to Rome for that which may be determined in England, &c. And now consider (I pray you) what all these foure instances laid togeather, doe weigh in poyse of good reason. But let vs see further.
                  20. A fourth instance of M. Attorneys is taken out of a Statute of the 6. yeare of K. Henry the 4. Instance. where the commons doe againe make complaint of other new aggreiuances by the Courte of Rome, to wit, that such as are to be preferred to Bishopricks, Archbishopricks and other Prelacyes, cannot be admitted, vntill they haue compounded with the Popes Chamber, 
                        Stat. 6. H. 4. 1. for paying of the first fruites of the said benefices, and other dutyes required;
vvhervpon the King (saith the Statute) by the aduise, and assent of the Great men of his Realme in Parlament (and note that he nameth not heer the spirituall Lords) did ordaine, that whosoeuer should pay heerafter to the said Chamber, or otherwise for such fruites, and seruices, greater summes of money, then had byn accustomed in time past, should incurre the forfaiture of as much, as they may forfaite towards the King &c.
So saith the Statute.
                  
                      
                     The Ansvvere.21. And now heere I would aske the discreet Reader, whether M. Attorney ouerthroweth not himself, by alleadging such matters as these are? For heere King Henry alloweth manifestly the repaire to Rome of Bishops, Archbishops, Abbots, & other Prelates, for their induction & admittance to their dignityes, which he would neuer doe, if he had taken himself to haue supreme authority Ecclesiasticall in that behalfe, of giuing them spirituall iurisdiction immediately from himself. And albeit he doe binde them to pay at Rome no more then the ordinary accustomed paiments, for such their admittance: (therby perhaps to induce the said Courte of Rome, 
                     Against brybing in Rome and other like abuses. to aske no more of them, when they should vnderstand that it was forbidden vnto them to pay it) yet doth he allow not only their recourse to Rome in such affaires, but to make likewise the ordinary payments, which were accustomed to be paid in old times past, according to the words of the Statute; which is sufficient to proue our purpose, and ouer-throw M. Attorneys. And thus much for the tyme of K. Henry the 4. For as for an other instance alleadged by M. Attorney conteyning a prohibition, that Buls for exemption of tythes from Parish Churches, should not be put in execution, for that the effect therof is repeated againe in the next obiection out of the raigne of K. Henry the fifth, one answere shall serue for them both.

And if any feele himself greiued, molested, or inquieted in any wise, from thenceforth by any, by colour of such prouisions, licences, pardons, or acceptations; that the same molestors, greiuers, or inquieters, & euery of them, haue and incurre the paines & punishments contained in the Statutes of Prouisors before that tyme made, as by the said Act appeareth.

                  22. This Statute maketh as little for M. Attorneys purpose, of supreme authoritie spirituall, 
                     The Ansvvere. as anie of the former: and I haue set it downe at large, to the end you maie see, what smal store of stuffe he hath to furnish his booke, when he filleth paper with such impertinencyes: for that the whole subiect of this Statute tendeth onlie to the reforme of certaine abuses in some quarreling and troublesome people, who meaning to molest others, that were in quiet possession of their benefices, went to Rome, and there framing manie complaints, calumniatiōs, and accusations against them, and against the lawfullnes of their hauing those benefices, and pretending that the due collation thereof appertained to the Sea Apostolicke for diuers respects, This statute maketh nothing for M. Attorney.
                      demaunded onlie that the same Sea would giue her right vnto them, and so got out prouisions oftentimes to that effect: which prouisions it seemeth by the words of this statute, that K. Henry the 4. was content they should runne, and gaue royall licences for the



same, and that the title should be tried, not withstāding the prohibitions of such prouisions made vnder K. Edward, and King Richard, as you haue heard (and all this maketh against M. Attorney.) But now K. Henry the 5. being informed of the inconueniences, that ensued therof, and that diuers incumbents were therby excluded of their benefices, and the patrons spirituall of their presentatiōs; ordained, that for the time to come, no such incumbents, or patrons, should bee disquieted, or molested, by colour of such prouisions from the Pope of benefices, that are not actually voide, or by vertue of licences from the King for prosecuting the same. This is the Statute, and you see how little helpe M. Attorney getteth by it. But let vs see another instance out of this Kings raigne, as wisely alleadged as the former.

                     The Ansvvere. which before he promised vs in his Preface. For out of the later example, that Ordinaries are appointed to inquire of the foundation, execution, and gouernment of Hospitals, what can be deduced for M. Attorneys purpose, or against vs? For so much as the foundation, erection, and gouernment of Hospitals were for the most part meere temporall things, except some priuiledges graunted vnto them by the Sea Apostolicke.

And that in the former example, Iustices of peace and assise were commaunded by the King to inquire after Lollards, VVickcliffians, and such other hereticks, it was to apprehend, and imprison their persons, and not to iudge of their heresies, which belonged to their Bishops and Ordinaries, as you haue heard. And some cause might be also of this speciall commission for Iudges, and Iustices to assist Bishops (and so no doubt it was) for that the said Lollards,

Lollardy (saith he) is of lolio, which signifieth Cockle, for as Clockle is the destruction of the corne, so is heresie of true religion,
and then doth he bring in two seuerall verses, the one of Virgil, and the other of Ouid about lolium, 
                     VVhence the name of Lollards vvas taken. shewing himself thereby a good grammarian, though yet in the thing it self he was much deceiued. For that Lollards and Lollardy being a particular sect of hereticks, are not deriued from the latin word Lolium, signifying cockle or darnel, as the verie deriuation it self might easily shew; but of the first author therof named Gualter Lolhard a German, about the yeare of Christ 1315. as Tritemius in his Cronicle declareth: and is larglie shewed in a booke some yeares past set forth in our English tongue by a Catholike writer, The three conuersions of Englād. part. 2.

From which also, I maruaile, that his affectiō to the men, had not somewhat with-held him, for that they were of his religion, & not cockle, but good corne, if wee beleiue his great historiographer, and deuine, Iohn Fox, who setteth them out not onlie for good Christians, but for Saints and martyrs in his bookes of Martyrologe, Acts, and Monuments.

                     To the first.27. To the first hath been answered diuers times before, that it appeareth to haue been an agreement at that tyme in England, that the Popes Bulls of excommunication should not bee published by particular men, but with the certificate of some Bishop for more authoritie, &c. as it is now also vsed in diuers Catholicke Coūtries, Bull
                           •
                         could not be promulgated vvithout the certificate of a Bishop. for auoiding the fraudes and practice of particular inquiet people, that by false suggestions get Buls, &c. But that this was by the auncient Commō laws before anie Statute made, hath no probabilitie at all, as by the whole Course of our auncient Catholicke Kings hath been declared. And it groweth now somewhat loathsome and ridiculous, to see M. Attorney runne so often to this common Chymera of auncient Common-lawes, without shewing any, or any likeli-hood, that any such were, or could bee in auncient tymes amongst our auncestors, for that their religion, deuotion, sense, and iudgement ran wholy to the contrary in those dayes. Whervpon it followeth, as often we



haue said, that if a Common-law could not be made, admitted, or authorized without some common consent of Prince and people; it is vnpossible, that such common laws should then bee, as M. Attorney doth frame heer to his fansie, vpon euery occasion that pleaseth him.
                  28. That the King onlie maie graunt licence to found a spirituall incorporatiō, maie bee vnderstood in two sortes. First that the said incorporation, To the second. cannot bee made, or erected within his dominions, or founded with lands, goods, or rents, without his leaue, and licence, and this wee denie not. Secondlie that the said spiritual incorporation should haue her spiritualtie from the King, that is to saie, her spirituall and ecclesiasticall priuiledges of being such an incorporation belonging to the Church: And this wee haue seen by the practice of all times in England both before, and after the Conquest to haue been euer sought and receiued from the Sea Apostolicke, 
                        See Supra cap. 6. wherof wee haue a particuler demonstration set downe before in the 6. Chapter of this our Answere.
                  
                  29. The last which he obiecteth of the fact of Humfrey Duke of Glocester, 
                     to the third.
                     that cast (as he saith) the Popes letters into the fire for their safe-Keeping,
is rather a iest than an argument. And I maruaile M. Attorney, a man of his degree, would bring it forth, and print it also for an argument, whether the thing be true or false. For if it fell out, as heer is noted in the margent, vpon the first yeare of King Henry the 6. his raigne, when the King was but eight moneths old, and the said Duke his vncle Gouernour of the Land; and in his cheifest ruffe, who afterward came thereby to soe pittifull a ruine, both of himself, his freinds, and the Realme; euerie man maie see what force this iest maie haue, which yet I haue not read in anie other author besydes M. Attorney, and so to him I leaue it.
               
            
         
         
            
            OF THE RAIGNE OF FOVRE ENSVING KINGS, TO VVIT, Edward the fourth, Edward the fifth, Richard the third, and Henry the seauenth: And how conforme they were vnto their auncestours in this point of controuersie, which we haue in hand. CHAP. XIIII.
            THe line of Lancaster being put downe, and remoued from the Crowne, by the depriuation and death of K. Henry the 6. and his sonne, as before you haue heard; there entred the howse of Yorke, 
               
                  K. Ed. 4. raigned .12. yeres, from 1460. to 1483. with no lesse violēce of armes, and effusion of bloud, but rather more, then the other familie had done before by taking to it self the Crowne from the head of K. Richard the 2. For that Edward Duke of Yorke, by dint of sword, inuesting himself of the scepter, by the same maintained it, though with much trouble, feares, & iealousies, for the space of 22. yeares, and then thinking to leaue it quietlie to his sonne Edward the 5. (though with protestation and oath at his death, as Syr Thomas More recordeth, 
                  Syr Thom. More in

               that if he could as well haue forseene the vanitie of that ambition, as now with his more paine then pleasure he had proued, he would neuer haue wonne the curtesie of mens knees, with the losse of so manie heads) the same was taken from him soone after, togeather with his life, by the cruell ambition of Richard Duke of Glocester, brother to the deceased King; so little motion made his oration and protestation against ambition at his death, in the heart of him, that was so furiouslie set vpon the same, and desired to bee in his place.
            
               2. This man entring then, with such boisterous and vnnaturall iniquitie of the slaughter of two of his Nephews, Richard 3. raigned from 14
                     •
                  3. to 1485. continued that violent gouernment, for two yeares and some what more, though with many afflictiōs, both inward, and outward, and finallie lost it againe with the losse of his life; and proued with a shorter experiēce, then his brother King Edward had done before him, how much more paine then pleasure, that place brought to the violent possessor, especiallie if iniustice goe with it, which is the cheife origen, and fountaine of all disasterous small successe.
            3. This man therefore being taken away by the sword of Henrie Earle of Richmond, called afterward King Henrie the seauenth, he held the same for 24. yeares, K Henry the seuēth raigned from 1485. to 1509. to vvit 24. yeres. with different successe in different times: for that the former parte of his raigne wanted not waues and sourges, and some troublesome motions, as in reason it could not, so manie great tempests, and fierce stormes hauing inquieted the sea before. But the later parte of his raigne was more calme, milde, and sweet, hee hauing partlie by his ofspring and linage, and partlie by his marriage stopped that great breach, and inundation of miseries, that brake into our Realme, by the diuision of the two howses of Lancaster and Yorke, and partlie also by his prudent moderation, and gouernment of the Crowne, so calmed and quieted mens minds, humours, and passions, as they tooke delight to liue in peace; and in this state he left his Realme to his heire, and successor King Henrie the eight.
            4. These foure Princes then, succeeding ech one the other in the Crowne of England, and holding the same between them for the space of 50. yeares togeather, excepting one or two, though one of them were not crowned, but ought to haue byn, which was King Edward the fifth, All fovver Princes agree in our controuersy. & another was crowned that should not haue byn, to wit King Richard the third; howsoeuer otherwise in regard of linage, family, faction, pretention, or succession they were opposite or different one from another in affection, iudgement, or action, for temporall affaires: yet in profession of religion, were they all one; all, and euery one of them professing the same faith, and holding the same forme of Christian Catholicke religion, which all their auncestors had done, both before and after the Conquest. And this not only in other matters, but in the very point also of our controuersie, concerning the practice and acknowledgement of the soueraigne spirituall



authority of the Church & Sea Apostolicke of Rome; which may breifly, besides all other means, be demonstrated by these reasons following.
             
               The first proofe.5. First for that none of them was euer noted for the contrary, which they would haue byn, eyther by freinds or aduersaryes, if any such occasion had byn giuen by them; especially in that great and bloudy contention, between the two houses of Yorke, and Lancaster, wherin both partes did desire to haue the fauour and approbation of the Sea Apostolicke, and good opinion of the Clergy at home. And if any least signe, or signification had byn giuen by any of these Princes, of different iudgment or affection in this behalfe; their aduersaryes would haue vrged the same presently, to their preiudice and disgrace, which we read not to haue byn done.
             
               The secōd proofe.6. Secondly the practice of the said authority and iurisdiction of the Sea Apostolicke vsed vnder these Kings, as vnder all former, except only the manner of execution in two or three particular cases, before mentioned, that were conioyned with temporalityes, doth euidently conuince the same: as namely that all English Bishops, Archbishops, and other Prelates, being elected or nominated to any dignity, had euer their Buls and confirmation from Rome, and the Metropolitans their palls. The Archbishops also of Canterbury, that liued with these Kings, Thomas Bewser, Iohn Morton, Henry Deane, and VVilliam VVarham (who was the last Catholicke Archbishop that held that Sea immediatly before Thomas Cranmer.) All these (I say) besides other points of testifying their obedience, and subordination to the said Sea, did according to the auncient stile of their Catholicke predecessours, write themselues Legats of the Sea Apostolicke, as may be seen in Fox, 
               Fox in his acts and Monuments. and other Protestant-writers, in relating their commissions, in sitting vpon hereticks, &c.
            7. Thirdly the said Iohn Fox doth sett downe in his storie of Acts and Monuments more wickcliffian Sectaries and Lollards to haue been condemned and burned vnder these Princes, The third proofe. then commonly vnder anie other before; which Sectaries (as is knowne) did principallie impugne the spirituall authoritie of the Sea of Rome; 
                  Foxie vita Edonar .4. 
                     
                        •
                     uhar. 3. & Honrisi 7. which thinge it is likely the said Princes would not haue done, or permitted, if they had been euill affected themselues that waie. And the said Fox in the end of King Henry the 7. his life, doth set forth many painted and printed pageants of



the Popes Greatnes in those daies, more then euer before.
            8. And finally not to labour more in a matter so manifest, The fourth proofe. and cleere of it self; there was neuer more intercourse between England and Rome for spirituall affaires, then vnder these Princes, to witt for inductions, and inuestitures to all spirituall iurisdiction, as hath been said, for dispensations, indulgences, interpretations in doubtfull matters, priuiledges, franquises, & Charters for confirmation of Churches, Chappels, Colledges, or Monasteries that were buylded: diuers Embassages also were sent to Rome, and speciall Legats were sent to England vpon particular vrgent occasions. And as these kings had allwaies their Orators, ledgers in that Court, so had the Popes of that time their ordinarie Nunci
                     •
                  s, yea and Collectors also of their temporall commodities in England, as wee may read in Polidor,

Henry the 8. This then maie bee sufficiēt, for some generall notes and proofes of this truth: for that to prosecute particulars in this Kind, were ouer tedious. Now then shall wee passe to peruse and answere briefly the instances, which M. Attorney citeth out of the raignes of these Kings, as little to his purpose as the former.

H. 7.20. to haue Sanctuarie within his Priorie, and this was pleaded and claimed by the Prior; but it was resolued by the Iudges, that the Pope had no power to graunt anie Sanctuarie within this Realme, and therefore by iudgment of law the same was disallowed.
                  
               
               
                  The Catholicke Deuine.
                  
                     M. Attorney repeateth still the word Law, to shew thereby that he is a lawyer, The ansvvere. and delighteth in the word that hath byn so beneficiall vnto him; but yet alleadgeth here no law at all, nor can



he doe. For what law is that, by iugment wherof the Sanctuarie of S. Iohns Church in London graūted by the Pope, was disalowed, for so much as all other Sanctuaries had, and haue from that Sea, their franquises, and liberties? Was it Common-law, or Canon and Ecclesiasticall? Not Ecclesiasticall. For that all such law dependeth from thence, and consequently cannot be supposed to haue disanulled the Popes authority in graunting Sanctuary. Common law if it were, it must appeare how it came in, by whom it was admitted, by what right it came to haue conusaūce of this Ecclesiasticall cause, which M. Attorney so often hath denyed before to apperteyne to his Common-law, wherof ensueth that eyther those temporall Iudges exceeded their limites in handling this cause, or that there was some temporall circumstance therein that brought it into that Courte.
                  10. And surely it may bee that this Sanctuarie pretended by the Prior of the Knights of S. Iohns in London, might not onlie bee the ordinary Sanctuarie of their Church and appurtenances thereunto (which all Churches haue by Canon law more or lesse) but also of some greater circuite, Hovv the cause of Sanctuary might be handled by temporall Iudges. round about their said Church and habitatiō; which (they being Knights and souldiars) might importe some inconueniences to the common wealth by occasion of contentions, fights, & brawles that might there fall out, the temporall officers hauing no accesse by reason of the said pretended Sanctuary. And so this case not being meere spirituall, but mixt also with temporall interest of the Common-wealth, the common Iudges, vntill the matter were better discussed and resolued in ecclesiasticall right, might put difficultie about the admission or execution of the said priuiledges, without the Kings expresse consent. And this is answered, according to M. Attorneys allegation (supposing it to bee sincere) not hauing by me the bookes, as before I haue said, out of which he hath taken the same, the view whereof no doubt would discouer more, therfore I recommend the examination to the Reader, that may haue commoditie to see, and read the places. But let vs see another Instance of two more of his, out of this Kinges raigne.
               
               
                  The Attorney.
                   
                     The secōd Instance 9. E. 4

                     There it appeareth that the opinion of the Kings-bench had been oftentimes, that if one spirituall person, sue another spirituall man in the Courte of Rome, for a matter spirituall, where he



might haue remedy before his Ordinary, that is the Bishop of that Diocesse within the Realme; Quia trabit ipsum in placitum extraregnum, 
                     
                        Na. Br. fol. 44. H. agreeing heervvith. Note incurreth the daūger of a Premunire, a hainons offence, being contra legiantiae suae debitum, in contemptum Domini Regis, & contra 
                           •
                        oronam, & dignitatem suas.
                     By which it appeareth how greiuous an offence it was, against the King, his Crowne, and dignity, if any subiect, although both the persons, & cause were spirituall, did seeke for iustice out of the Realme, as though either there wanted iurisdiction, or iustice was not executed in the Ecclesiastical Courts within the same, which as it hath byn said, was an high offence contra Regem, Coronam, & dignitatem suas.
                     
                  
               
               
                  The Catholicke Deuine.
                  By this instance a man may greatly suspect, that M. Attorney dealeth not sincerely, but amplifieth and exaggerateth matters to his purpose. The Ansvvere. But howsoeuer this bee, cleere it is, that he dealeth not substantially. For heere only the note alleadged, saith that the opinion of the Kings-bench had byn oftentymes, that if one spirituall, or Ecclesiasticall person, should sue another in the Courte of Rome, when he might haue remedy before his Ordinary at home, he incurreth the daunger of a Premunire; for that he draweth a Plea out of the Kingdome without necessity. Well then: this is but the opinion of some temporall lawyers of the Kings-bench, that a man that should doe this, should be in daunger of a Premunire, for that he draweth a Plea out of the Kingdome, when he might haue sufficient remedy by his spirituall Iudge at home. And this is according to the Statutes before made, vnder King Edward the third, and Richard the second, as you haue heard, that matters may not be carryed to Rome, at the first instance, but by way of appellation, when they cannot haue iustice at home. And this taketh not away the Popes authority, as you see, but rather confirmeth the same, and punisheth only disorderly people, that will vex, and trouble men, with citing them to Rome without necessitie.
                  12. Which being so, you will see, how friuolous M Attorneys exaggeration is heer, in painting out vnto vs with so great an hyperbole of words this haynons offence, against the duty of loyalty, in contempt of the King our Lord, and contrary to his crowne and dignity, &c. And why is all this adoe?
For that (saith he) a subiect of the realme doth seeke for iustice out of the Realme in spirituall causes, as though there wanted iurisdiction or iustice within the Realme, which is an high offence


                     
contra Regem, coronam, & dignitatem suas. Whereto I aunswere, that what high offence it may be against suas (here twise repeated in the English, but corrected by the Latyn Interpreter) I know not, but sure I am, that against King, Crowne or Royall dignity it can be none, no more in England then in other Catholicke Kingdomes round about vs. And the reason here alleadged by M. Attorney excludeth all appellations betwene subordinate Courts, as wel within the Realme, as without, if it should be admitted and taken for good. Wherefore when he writeth in the margent, Note, as though some great argument were alleadged for his purpose, It is a note that he hath small store of substance to note, when he standeth so much vpon such a toy.
               
               
                  The Attorney.
                   
                     The third Instance.
                     In the Kings Courts of Record, where felonies are determined, the Bishop or his deputy ought to giue his attendance, to the end that yf any, that is indicted, and arraigned for felony, doe demaund the benefit of his Clergy, 9 E. 4.28. that the Ordinary may informe the Court of his sufficiency, or insufficiency, that is, whether he can read, as a Clarke, or not, wherof notwithstanding the Ordinary is not to Iudge, but is a minister to the Kings Court, & the Iudges of that Court, are to Iudge of the sufficiency, or insufficiency of the party, whatsoeuer the Ordinary doe informe them, and vpon due examination of the party, may giue iudgement against the Ordinaryes information: For the Kings Iudges, are Iudges of the cause.

                     The ansvvere.13. I am content to admitt anie iudges in this cause, whether it be not impertinent to M. Attorneys purpose, to bring in this instance. For howsoeuer he goeth about in words to dazel this case, yet is it euident, that for so much, as the Church by her priuiledge of Superioritie, taketh out of the hands of temporall iustice, men condemned to dy for felony, onlie for that they can read like Clerkes, though they bee no Clarkes indeed (for if they were, and had but so much as primam tonsuram, 
                     VV
                           •
                        o must iudge vvhether a fellon deserue the benefit of Clergie. they could not bee held, nor iudged by that Court as often before hath byn shewed) it is euident where the eminencie of authoritie laie in those daies, to wit, in the spiritualtie, aboue the temporaltie: & vayne it is to stand vpon other trifling circumstances, whether the Bishops deputie sent to demaund the liberty of those felons by



law, did giue attendance vpon the Kings Courts, or no; or whether he, or the Iudges that were lay-men, must iudge of this sufficiēcy or insufficiency; whether the fellon did read as a Clarke, or not. For if the temporall Iudges must discerne therof, as M. Attorney auerreth, then in vaine was the Bishops Deputy called thither, without whom it might haue byn done by the Iudges alone. But if he were of necessity to be called thither, and vpon his oath, to pronounce, si legit vt Clericus, and that vpon his verdict, the Iudge must giue sentence to admit the fellon to the benefit of Clergy, and thervpon to haue pardon of his life, and to be deliuered vnto the Bishops prison, as of higher authority: then is it manifest, that this instance impugneth rather, then helpeth M. Attorneys assertion, as commonly doe all the rest, when they are well examined.

                  The Popes excommunication is of no force within the Realme of England. 
                     The 4 Instance.
                  
                  
                     In the raigne of King Edward the 4. a Legat from the Pope came to Calles, to haue come into England, 
                        12. E 4. fol. 16. but the King and his Counsell would not suffer him to come within England, vntill he had taken an oath, that he should attempt nothing against the King or his Crowne; and so the like was done in his raigne to another of the Popes Legats, & this is so reported in 1. H. 7. fol. 10.

                  14. The first parte of this instance, about the validitie of the Popes excōmunication, hath oftentimes been answered before, The ansvvere. what circumstance, and conditions were agreed vpon, to bee obserued in the execution thereof, for auoiding inconueniences, that came by false suggestions of some troublesome people, and among other,

                           . 22. as before hath been shewed out of the 3. yeare of K. Edward the 3. & hath appeared also before out of King Richards Statute, where all the Bishops expounded themselues, that it was not meant to derogate by that Statute from the Popes authoritie, to excōmunicate, &c. And in this very place, and next words after this present instance, hath M. Attorney another instance out of King Richard the 3. in these words. It is resolued by the Iudges, that the iudgment of excommunication in the Courte of Rome, should not bind, or preiudice anie man within England at the Common-law.


                     
Wherby is cleerly declared the meaning of the former cause, to wit, that the popes excommunication, which is a spirituall sentence, or punishement for spirituall affaires, may not preiudice temporall all suites at the Common-law in temporall matters; and it is not much sinceritie in M. Attorney, to alleadg these parcells of his Iudges determinations so nakedly, as he doth, without distinction, or explication, to the end his simple Reader may be put in error therby.
                  15. The other instance of the Popes Legate staied at Calles, and not suffered to come into England, vntill he had taken an oath to attempt nothing against the King, or his Crowne; sheweth that King Edward rather doubted, and feared his authoritie, then contemned or denied the same; especially he being in that controuersy about the Crowne, as then hee was, and the Pope interposing his spirituall authoritie, between K. Henry the 6. and him. And as well he might alleadge the example of the Popes messenger detained in Calles, by commaundement of King Phillip, and Q. Marie, when he brought the Cardinals hat, from Paulus 4. to Friar Peto, 
                     VVhy Catholick Kings somtymes prohibited the entrance of the Popes Legates. for that the said Princes would not suffer him to come into the Realme, vntill they had otherwise informed the said Pope by their Embassadours in Rome, that the same was not expedient. And yet did not this proue, that they either contemned the Popes authoritie, or thought this soueraigntie of spirituall iurisdiction to bee in themselues. And it is a case, that often falleth out in the affaires of Catholicke Princes with Popes, when they doubt anie thing will proceed against them from the said Sea Apostolicke, to keep off the execution, or notification therof by what means they can, vntill matters bee compounded. And we haue had many examples therof before, namely in the raignes of K. Henry the 2. K. Iohn. K. Henry the 3. and two King Edwards following him, who fearing excommunication, were vigilant in prohibiting, that no messenger from Rome should enter the Realme without their licence, which was an argument rather of their esteeme, then disesteeme of that place, and power.

                  In the raigne of K. Henry the 7. the pope had excommunicated all such persons whatsoeuer, The fifth Instance. 1. Henr. 7.10. as had bought alume of the Florentines, and it was resolued by all the Iudges of England, that the Popes excommunication ought not to bee obaied, or to bee put in execution, within the Realme of England.
                  
               
               
                  In a parlament holden in the first yeare of King Henry the 7. for the more sure, & like reformation of Priests, Clerks, & religious men culpable,

And that none of the said Archbishops, Bishops, or Ordinaries aforesaid bee therof chargeable, of, to, or vpon anie action of false or wrongfull imprisonment, but that they be vtterly therof discharged in anie of the Cases aforesaid, by vertue of this Act.

                  By the Ecclesiasticall laws allowed within this Realme, a Priest cannot haue two benefices, or a bastard can bee a Priest, 11. H. 7. 12 but the King may by his Ecclesiasticall power, and iurisdiction, dispense with both of these, because they be Mala prohibita, and not Mala per se.
                  
               
               
                  
                  The Catholicke Deuyne.
                   
                     The Ansvvere. To the first point.16. Heere are three or foure instances, for breuityes sake layed togeather in one, as also, for that they are of so small substance, as they deserue not to be handled a part. For as to the first, concerning the buying of alume of the Florentines, who doth not see, but that it is a temporall case, wherin the Realme of England, or Marchants therof being interessed, the State might pretend iust cause to differre the admission, or execution of the Popes sentence of excommunication, touching that affaire, vntill they had better informed him of the truth, or iustice of the cause in their behalfe: For this is vsed ordinarily by all Catholicke Princes and States euen at this day.
                   
                     To the secōd point.17. The second obiection about the punishment of Priests and Clergy-men, by their Bishops and Archbishops, hath nothing in it at all, that may make for M. Attorneys purpose. For that heere is not giuen by Parlament, any new spirituall iurisdiction to Bishops & Archbishops, but some temporall enlargement is graunted to the same. As for example, that they may not only suspend, and excommunicate, and punish by their spirituall censures, such licentious persons of life; but may corporally punish them also, by imprisonment and other wayes, as heere is set downe. And least any in such cases might make recourse vnto the temporall magistrate, saying that they were imprisoned wrongfully, and contrary to the common secular laws of the Realme, this refuge is cut of by this Statute, and absolute power giuen to Bishops & Archbishops, The great authority of English Prelates. to punish in such cases, as well corporally, as spiritually: wherby also appeareth that such delicts of Clergy-men, were in those dayes to be inquired of, and punished only in the Bishops Courts, and not in the temporall, which was a dignity, and no small preheminence of the Prelates of England, aboue many other Countreys, who neither then, nor now, haue the like absolute preheminence in all things, as before hath byn shewed. For that diuers cases, and causes doe appertaine only to spirituall Courts in England, which are handled also by secular magistrates in sundry other countreys; as namely that of Testaments, and the like. And this is to be ascribed to the speciall piety, & deuotion of our Catholicke Kings and Countrey.
                   
                     To the thirde point.18. As for the third point wherin M. Attorney saith: Rex est persona mixta, adding this reason, because he hath Ecclesiasticall and temporall iurisdiction;



Whosoeuer maketh this instance, either M. Attorney, or some other author of his, he little seemeth to vnderstand what is needfull to induce Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction; wherof he may need more at large in the second Chapter of this booke. And as for the person of a King, Hovv a King is persona mixta.
                      it may be named mixt in some other respects; as namely for that a King is annointed, and therby hath somewhat of a Clergy-man also, though absolutely he be a lay-man, as you haue heard before the great Christian Emperour Valentinian professe of him self, Quod erat vnus de populo: that he was a lay-man, and not a Clergie-man. 
                     
                        Supra
                              •
                            cap. 4. He is likewise head of the whole Common-wealth, wherin are members, both Clergy, and lay-men, as before hath byn said; and in that respect, is he head of both partes, and consequently mixt, or common to them both. But all this induceth not necessity of spirituall iurisdiction, except it be committed vnto him, 
                        Supra cap. 2. from the Church, and Prelates therof, in whome originally it is, as in the forenamed place we haue abundantly declared.
                  19. And the like wee answere finally to the fourth and last obiection, To the fourth point. wherin it is said, that the King maie dispense with a bastard to bee made Priest, and with a Priest to haue two benefices, and this by his Ecclesiasticall power and iurisdiction. The matter must bee distinguished, that the King maie dispense, or giue his consent in these cases, for so much as toucheth the Common wealth, or maie bee hurtfull vnto it, and no otherwise; which is to say, so far forth as it maie importe, or preiudice the Commō-wealth, that bastards not inheritable should be Priests, Bastardy a lett to priesthoode. or one Priest hold manie benefices. But then this dispensation is not by anie iurisdiction spirituall, as M. Attorney would inferre, but temporall onlie of the Prince, as hee is head of the Common wealth. For as concerning spirituall dispensation appertaining to conscience, for so much as the prohibition that Bastards shall not bee ordained Priests, was not made first by temporall Princes, but by the auncient  
                        Dist. 56. cap. 1. &c. 1. & vl

                  20. And by the same reason (for that spirituall iurisdiction ouer soules, which is the iurisdiction of him that hath a benefice, cannot bee truely giuen, or deliuered to anie man, but by him that hath it in himself, to wit, some Prelate of the Church, that hath it from the fountaine of succession from the Apostles, 
                        Supra.

                         2.


                     
as before hath been declared) it followeth that none which hath not this iurisdiction, VVho can dispense vvith plurality of benefices. by this means in himself, can giue anie benefice to anie man, and much lesse two, or manie benefices, that is to saie, spirituall iurisdiction ouer manie flocks to one man, except hee onlie, that hath superior and mediate spirituall iurisdiction ouer the said flocks, and their soules. And heerby wee see, that standing in the principles, and grownds before set downe, and manifestly proued, M. Attorneys instance is to no purpose at all, to the effect and sense wherin hee would haue it vnderstood.
                  21. And this shall suffice for this place, and for the raignes and liues of all Christian Princes of our Realme, that liued in vnion, and conformitie of one religion, and acknowledgment of one supreme authoritie spiritual of the Sea Apostolicke of Rome, from the first to the last, that is to saie, from King Ethelbert, that receiued the first grace of our conuersion to the Christian Catholicke Roman religion, vnto King Henry the 7. inclusiuè, who being the last, and neerest English auncestour to his Maiesty that now is, K. Henry the 7 dyed and liued in the religion of all his ancestours. and succeeding after aboue a hundred and twenty English Kings of the same religion, ended happely also his life & raigne therein, without any change or alteration. And if this sonne had followed the same course, and held it out to the end, as he did for two partes of three of his raigne, he had byn thrice happy; but Gods prouidence, for his, and our sinnes permitted otherwise: We shall therfore see breifly the manner, means, occasions, motiues, and euents therof in the ensuing Chapter.
               
            
         
         
            
            OF THE RAIGNE OF K. HENRY THE EIGHT, And of his three children, King Edward, Queene Mary, and Queene Elizabeth: And how the first innovation about Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, was made, and continued in their dayes. CHAP. XV.
            NOVV are we come vnto the time wherin great change indeed, and alteration was made in our Countrey by particular Statutes, and Nationall laws (so far forth as a perpetuall, and vniuersall receiued truth by nationall and temporall decrees could be altered) in the foresaid point of spirituall and Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction. For that K. Henry the eight, after two partes of three, of his raigne, wherin he had not only acknowledged and practised, according to the vse of all his predecessours, but singularly also defended, and propugned by publicke writing, the Catholicke consent of all Christendome, concerning the Soueraignty of the Sea of Rome therin; did at length vpon certaine occasions of particular distast, anger, and exasperation, falling out betweene Pope Clement the 7. and him, about the diuorce of his wife Queen Catherine, daughter of Spaine, 
               The causes of alteratiō in the time of K. Henry the 8. and the marriage of Lady Anne Bullen in in her place (to neither of which the said Pope would consent) make strange innouations by little & little, as first threatning and the said Pope, then substracting some of his authority, and giuing it to others, and finally taking all vnto himself. Which deuise being once begun, was continued after his death, by the



gouernours of his young sonne King Edward, though with lesse probability and apparance of truth, as before hath byn noted, & then reiected againe by his daughter Queene Mary, who restored the same whence it was taken, but reassumed, though in a different deuise of words, 
                  Supra. 6. 2. & 3. by his second daughter Q. Elizabeth, that least of all was capable of it, as in precedent chapters hath byn declared. So as heere, though M. Attorney doth euery where talke of auncient laws, and common consent, there is neither anquity, vnity, conformity, consent, or continuance of anie moment to bee found; which will better appeare by that wee haue briefly to touch of ech one of these Princes raignes in particular.
            
               Of King Henry the eyght, who was the twentith King after the Conquest. §. I.
                
                  K. Henry the 8. raigned from the yere 1509. to 1546. to vvit 3
                        •
                     . yeares.2. This Prince succeeding his father King Henry the 7. in the flower of his youth, when he was but 18. yeares of age, but adorned with many rare graces, both of mind and body, tooke the scepter in hand with as great expectation of his people, & neighbours round about him, as euer did Prince of our land before, or after him: and for the space of more then 20. yeares performed the same in all points of an excellent Prince, both in peace, and warre, vntill he fell into that vnfortunate, & fatall breach with his wife, and Queene, and disordinate appetite of the other, that succeeded her; whervpon ensued all those strange and vnexpected mutations which afterward were seene, one thing giuing occasion, and making way to the other, as the euents declared.
               3. But among all other points of Catholicke doctrine, no one was more obserued by this King, while he remained in his auncient peace of mind, then that of his due acknowledgment, subordination, and respectiue correspondence with the Sea Apostolicke; which being in his dayes begun to be impugned, togeather with many other points of Christian religion, by Martyn Luther an Apostata Friar of Germany, and his followers: K. Henries booke against Luther. anno Domini 1521. King Henry out of his great zeale and feruour towards the said religion, and Sea Apostolicke, tooke vpō him to write a special learned booke in defence therof against the said Luther, which booke he sent to



                  Rome, presenting it to Pope Leo the tenth, subscribed by his owne 
                     •
                  and (which I haue seen) by a speciall Embassadour for that purpose, Doctor Clerke Bishop of Bath and VVells, that made an earnest speach and eloquent oration at the deliuery therof, in protestation and commendation of his Kings high and resolute zeale in this behalfe; all which being extant in print, I remit the Reader thervnto, for his better satisfaction.
               4. Only I cannot pretermit to recite in this place, some of his words which he vseth in that booke in defence of the Popes Ecclesiasticall Supremacy, which himself afterward vpon new passions rising, so greatly impugned. Thus then he wrote against Luther in those dayes: Non tam iniurius ero Pontifici, vt anxiè & sollicitè de eius Iure disceptem, tanquam res haberetur pro dubia, &c. 
                  
                     Henr. 8. in defens. Sacram. contr. Mart. Luther.
                   I will not offer so much iniury vnto the Pope, as earnestly and carefully to dispute heere of his right, as though the matter might be held in doubt:
it is sufficient for that which now we haue in hand, that his enemy (Luther) sheweth himself so much to be carried away with passion and fury, as he taketh all faith and credit from his owne sayings, cleerly declaring his malice to be such, as it suffereth him neither to agree with himself, nor to consider what he saith. So be.
                  
               
               5. And then after a large confutation of Luthers fond opinion, and furious assertion, that the pope neither by diuine or humane law, but onlie by vsurpation and Tyrannie, had gotten the headshipp of the Church, K. Henry vseth two stong reasons and arguments against him, among other, to represse his maddnes therein. The first of generall consent from antiquitie, saying:

                     Negare non potest, &c. Luther cannot deny, 
                        Henr. ibid.
                      but that all the faithfull Christian Churches at this daie, doe acknowledge and reuerence the holie Sea of Rome, as their mother and Primate, &c. And if this acknowledgment is grounded neither in diuine nor humane right, how hath it taken so great and generall roote? How was it admitted so vniuersally by all Christendome? When began it? how grew it to bee so great? And wheras humane consent, is sufficient to giue humane right at least, how can Luther saie, that heer is neither diuine nor humane right, where there is, and hath been for time out of minde, so vniuersall humane consent? &c. K. Henryes argument of antiquity and consent of the Popes supremacy 
                     Certe si quis rerum gestarum monumenta reuoluat, inueniet iam olim, protinùs post pacatum orb
                           •
                        m pleras
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         omnes Christiani Orbis Ecclesias obtemperasse Romana, &c. Truly if a man will looke ouer the monuments of things, and times



past, he shall find that prefently after the world was pacified (from persecution) the most parte of Christian Churches did obay the Roman: yea and the Greeke Church also, though the Empire were passed to that parte, wee shall find, that shee acknowledged the Primacy of the same Romane Church, but only whē shee was in Schisme. And as for S. Hierome though he were no Roman; yet did hee in his daies ascribe so much authoritie and preheminence to the Roman Church, as he affirmed that in matters of great doubt, it was sufficient for his faith, to bee allowed, and approued by the Pope of Rome, &c.
This is the first argument vrged by King Henry of antiquitie and consent.
               6. Another hee alleadgeth of impossibilitie, for the Pope to haue attained by force and Tyrannie, to so great authoritie, as he had, according to Luthers calumniation; the effect is this.

                     Cum Lutherus tam impudenter pronunciet, &c. Whereas Luther so impudētly doth affirme, that the Pope hath his Primacie by no right, neither diuine, nor humane, but onlie by force and Tyrannie, I doe wonder how the mad fellow could hope to find his Readers so simple, or blockish, as to beleiue that the Bishop of Rome, 
                     K. Henries argument of impossibility. being a Priest, vnarmed, alone, without temporall force, or right either diuine or humane (as he supposed) should bee able to get authoritie ouer so manie other Bishops his equals, throughout so manie and different nations, so far off from him, and so little fearing his temporall power: or that so manie People, Citties, Kingdomes, Common-wealths, Prouinces, and Nations would bee so prodigall of their owne libertie, as to subiect themselues to a forraine Priest (as now so manie ages they haue done) or to giue him such authoritie ouer thēselues, if he had no right therevnto at all.
               
               7. But what shall I stand to dispute with Luther in this matter? Or what importeth it, what he saieth or beleeueth therin, for so much as through anger, and enuie, he knoweth not himself what he thinketh or saith, but declareth well the saying of the Apostle to be true in himself: Cor ipsius insipiens obscuratum, itaditum
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      in reprobum sensum; 
                  1. Cor. 13. That his foolish heart is darkned, and deliuered ouer vnto a reprobate sense. So King Henry, pronouncing, as you see, a heauy iudgment against Luther now, and himself afterwarde, when he fell into the same darknes, and not only obscuritie of vnderstanding, but inconstancie also of proceeding, which heer so eagerly hee obiecteth to Luther, for this he writeth



of him.

                     Quis non eius miretur inconstantiam, &c. who will not wonder at Luthers inconstancie, for a little before, he wrote in his bookes, that the Papaltie, though it were not by diuine right, yet was it by humane, to witt by humane consent for the publik good of the Church, and therevpon condemned and detested the sect of the Hussites in Bohemia, for that they had cut themselues off from the obedience of the Roman Sea, affirming that they sinned damnably, whosoeuer obaied not the Pope. K. Henryes innectiue against the incōstancy of Luther.
                      This he wrote verie lately (since his fall from Catholicke religion) but now he is run into that, which then he so much detested. And like inconstancy he hath shewed in another point also, which is; that hauing preached of late in a certaine Sermon to the people, that the Popes excommunication was to bee obaied, and patiently be borne, as a medecine in a disease. Whē himself afterwards was most worthily excommunicated, he tooke that sentence of the Pope so impotently, as seeming to be mad, or fallen into rage, he brake forth into such contumelious speaches, and blasphemies, as no Christian eares can abide to heare the same: so as by his furie he hath made it euident: Eos qui pelluntur gremio matris Ecclesia, statim furijs corripi, at
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         agitari daemonibus. That those which are cast out from the lap of their mother the Church, are taken presently with suries, and vexed with diuells.
Thus far K. Henry, and much more to this effect, which for breuityes sake I pretermit.
               8. And now let vs with greife of mind, & some terror of conscience, looke ouer, and reflect vpon that which happened afterward vnto this King himself, and into what extremes of passion and choller he fell in his writings and Statutes against this very Supremacy of the Pope (when he was excommunicated by him) which heere he defendeth against Luther, though in other points of doctrine he remained still opposite to Luther, euen vnto his dying day.
               9. It is worthy the noting also, what mutability and inconstancy he vsed, not only in the whole thing (to wit, in d
                     •••
                  ing the Popes Supremacy) but in the very manner also of falling into that extremity. For first, for many yeares after the writing of this his booke, which was in the yeare of Christ 1521. he continued so deuout and obedient to the said Sea of Rome, as no King in Christendome more, as may appeare by the mutuall good offices of loue, & friendship, that passed between them. 
                     An. 1527. And when six yeares after this againe, Rome was spoiled by the army of the



                  Duke of Burbon, & Pope Clement the seauenth held as besieged in the Castle of S. Angelo, no King or Prince of Christendome was more forward in the ayd of the said Pope, then K. Henry of England; Good offices of K. Henry cō
                     tinued to the Pope after the vvriting of his booke. as may appeare by his great, and famous Embassadge sent that very yeare into France by Cardinall VVolsey about that matter, in the yeare 1527. to draw the King of France into the association of that aid and help.
               10. And when againe the next yeare after, King Henry began to moue his doubt or question about the lawfullnes of his marriage with Queene Catherine, he referred the whole matter to Rome, and procured Iudges to be sent from thence, as namely Cardinall Campegius, that was directed from Rome the selfsame yeare into England for Legat, with like commission for Cardinall VVolsey to be ioyned with him, as deputyes from Pope Clement, to heare, and iudge the matter, before whome sitting in iudgment, both K. Henry and Queen Catherine being cited personally to appeare, they made their appearance in the Church of the Black-Friars in London, in the moneth of Aprill anno Domini 1529. which was the one and twentith of King Henryes raigne. And albeit King Henry being offended, that by this means of these two Legats (the Pope accepting of the Appeal of Queen Catherine, & recalling the matter to himself) he could not haue his wil, did put from his fauour soone after Cardinall VVolsey, when the other was departed, and brought him to the miserable end which is well knowne, By vvhat degrees K. Henry fell to breach vvith the Sea of Rome. yea & condemned for his sake, the whole Clergy of England, in a Premunire, that is to say, the losse of all their goods, which afterward they redeemed with a submission, and payment of a hundred thousand pounds, for that they had acknowledged the said Cardinals Legantine authority, which himself had procured from Rome; yet did not he for this, surcease to send other Embassadours to continue the solicitation of the same suite of diuorce, in the said Court of Rome: and namely among others, Doctor Stephen Gard
                        •••
                     , the Kings chiefe Secretary, soone after made Bishop of VVinchester, who was sent thither (as Stow and others doe testifie) presently after the departure of Cardinall Campegius in the same yeare 1529. Neither did King Henry leaue of to hold his Embassadours, Lawyers, and Procurators there about this matter, for two or three yeares after this againe, vntill he saw there was no hope to get his diuorce by that means; and on the otherside was resolued to marry the Lady Anne Bullen whatsoeuer came of it,



and so did in the yeare 1533. and 24. of his raigne.
               11. Thus then you see the beginning and progresse of the cause of King Henryes breach with the Sea Apostolicke, which probably would neuer haue byn, if he could haue obtained his will that way; but falling into despaire therof, tooke resolution to cut the knot, which otherwise he could not vndoe. But the manner of his proceeding may be best seen by two Acts of Parlament set downe heer by M. Attorney the one of the 24. the other of the 25. yeare of King Henryes raigne: The first breach with Rome. for that in the former, which was in the yeare of his marriage with Lady Anne Bullen, as hath byn said, 
                     Reports fol. 28. he prohibited all appeals in causes Ecclesiasticall to the Court of Rome, reducing all spirituall authority of determining the same vnto the body spirituall of the English Clergy; for so the words of the statute are: The body spirituall of the English Church (saith he) hauing power, when any cause of the law diuine happened to come in question, or of spirituall learning. &c. to declare, and determine all such doubts, & to administer al such offices, & duties, as to their roomes spiritual did appertaine, without the intermedling of any exteriour person, or persons, &c. 
                  
                     Stat. de. 2
                        •
                     . H. 8. All committed to the body of the English Clergy. Wherby it appeareth, that by this Statute he reduceth all spirituall power to a certaine community of the Ecclesiasticall body of England; but in the second Statute, that followed in the yeare after, against suing for licences, dispensations, facultyes, graunts, rescripts, or delegacyes to Rome, he seemeth to establish all authority in the Archbishop of Canterbury, that was then Thomas Cranmer, newly made by himself for allowing of his marriage with Lady Anne Bullen; for so he saith in the statute: That the Archbishop of Canterbury for the tyme being and his successours, shall haue power and authority from tyme, to tyme, by their discretions, to giue, graunt, and dispose, by an instrument vnder the seale of the said Archbishop, vnto the King, and vnto his heirs & successours Kings of this Realme, as well, all māner of such licences, dispensations, 
                  All committed to the Archb. of Canterbury. 
                  compositions, facultyes, graunts, rescrips, delegacyes, instruments, and other writings for causes not being contrary, or repugnant to the holy scriptures, and lawes of God, as heertofore had byn vsed, and accustomed to be had, and obtained by the King, or any his most noble progenitors, or any of his, or their subiects at the Sea of Rome, or any person, or persons by authority of the same, &c.
               
               12. Lo heer King Henry giueth authority to the Archbishop of Canterbury, to giue vnto him (to wit, to King Henry himself, and his successors Kings of England, and their subiects) all dispensations, which they were wont to 
                     ••
                  ke, and obtaine at the Popes



hand: so as heer, he acknowledgeth, that in former times, that authority belonged to the Pope, K. Henry subiected himselfe to the Archb. of Canterbury. and that his auncestors and progenitors were of that opinion; but that now he being offended with him, he would take it from him, and bestow it vpon the Archbishop of Canterbury, subiecting himself and his inheritours, to aske, and obtaine the said dispensations at his hands, and his successours, which was (as you see) to make Archbishop Cranmer Pope, and not himself for this yeare, as the whole body of the English Clergy was for the yeare past.
               13. And wheras it is euident that King Henry gaue this authority to Cranmer for dispensing &c. to the end he should dispense with him for marrying of the said Lady Anne Bullen; it seemeth strange, that he would vse this so ridiculous circuyt, as first to giue authority by Parlament to Cranmer, to be able to dispense with him (to wit with King Henry the giuer) and would not take immediatly, either by himself, or by Parlament, authority to himself, to dispense with himself. The gradation vsed by K. Henry is assuning the supremacy. But it is well seen, that he had some remorse, or shame-fastnes therin at the first beginning, though the very next yeare after he amended the matter, or rather made it worse by assuming it to himself. For calling another Parlament vpon the 26. of his raigne, he made the first Statute of all, with this Title: An act concerning the Kings Highnes to be Supreme head of the Church of England, and to haue authority to reforme, and redresse all errors, heresies, and abuses in the same. Wherby you may see, what gradation was vsed in this matter, or rather mistery, giuing this power first to the Community of the English Clergy, secondly to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and thirdly to himself; and all this in three distinct yeares immediately following one the other.
               14. And now, if mens euerlasting saluation must depend vpon these mutations of spirituall iurisdiction, as no doubt they did in thousands of our Countrey at that tyme; and if the eternall wisdome of our Sauiour Christ hath left no more certainty, A confideration of importance. for direction of our soules, by spirituall gouernement and authority, then this of our English Parlament, which changeth so often and easely, as you haue heard, vpon euery Princes particuler inclination; then are we (doubtlesse) in a pittifull plight: for that (as hath byn declared before) of the certainty of this spirituall power, for binding or loosing of our sinnes, for Sacramēts, instructions, directions, and all other spirituall helps, and assistance



in this life, dependeth the surety of our euerlasting saluation, or damnation in the life to come.
               15. But to goe forward a little further in this matter, now we haue King Henry head of the Church, and M. Attorney, no doubt, is glad therof for helping of his cause, though it help it but little or nothing at all, it being the first example that euer could be giuen therof in England, or elswhere throughout the Christian world, and so much the more to be misliked, if we beleiue Iohn Caluin in his sharp reproofe of this attempt, 
                     Caluin. cō
                        ment. in cap. 6. Amos.
                   which he calleth Tyrannicall, & Anti-Christian. But M. Attorney (perhaps) will not care for Caluin or Beza, or any of their followers in this point, for that it maketh not to his purpose. Well then, he must notwithstanding graunt this in all reason, that if this supreme authoritie spirituall was wel and rightly, and by gods direction, spirit, and allowance taken vpon himself, by King Henry; then is it likely, that he was guided also by the same spirit afterward in making his decrees, laws, and ordinances for directing, and gouerning the English Church by that authority, and especially for reforming, K. Henry as supreme head condemned the Protestāts religion for heresy. and redressing of all errors, heresies, and abuses therin, according to the speciall title of his said authority before set down; wherof it followeth, that when vpon the 31. yeare of his raigne, which was fiue after the said authoritie giuen him, hee calling a Parlament, determined six mayne and principall articles of protestant religion to bee heresies, to witt: 
                     See statut. an. 31. H. 
                     
                        •
                     . cap. 14. 
                  The deniall of the reall presence: of the communion vnder one kind only: That Priests may marrie: That vowes of chastitie may bee broken: That priuate masses are not lawfull: That sacramentall, or auricular confession is not necessarie; appointing them that should hould any of these heresies (so cōdēned by him) to be burned as notorious hereticks: it followeth (I say) that this was decreed by him out of the same spirit, and direction of god; for that otherwise, his Ecclesiasticall supremacy had byn to small purpose, if there were no certainty in his determinations, or that God would permit him to erre so grosly in so importāt a busines as this was for the whole Church of England, so soone after he had ginen him his said supreme authoritie Ecclesiasticall.
               16. And that this was done by him against the Protestants with great deliberation, consultation, aduise, & maturity in the fullnes of his power Ecclesiasticall, appeareth well by the words of the Statute, which are these: VVhere the Kings most excellent Maiesty, is by gods law, supreme head immediatly vnder him, of his whole Church



of England, intending the conseruation of the same Church, in a true, sincere, and vniforme doctrine of Christs religion, calling also, to his blessed, and most gratious remembrance, 
                  VVith vvhat mature deliberation K. Henry as head of the church condemned the Protestāts. 
                  the innumerable commodities which ensue of concord, and vnity in religion, &c. hath therfore commaunded this his most high Court of Parlament to be summoned, as also a Synod of all the Archbishops, Bishops, and other learned men, to bee assembled, &c. for a full, and persect resolution of certaine Articles proposed (which are the former six); his Maiesty also most gratiously vouchsafing in his owne Princly person, to descend, and come into his said high Courte, and Councell, and there like a Prince of most high prudence, and no lesse learning, opened and declared manie thinges of high learning & great knowledge touching the said Articles, matters, & questions; whervpon after great, and longe deliberate disputation and consultation, had, and made; it was finally resolued, as before, &c.
               
               17. Thus you see, how maturely this matter was done, and resolued by the new head of the English Church, and his Counsell: which resolution not withstanding, I presume, M. Attorney and those of his religion will not well allow à parte rei; though for his authoritie, they may not denie it, according to their owne grounds, in that he did contradict therin the Popes: and so in this respect they seem to bee but in pittifull plight, for that neither the one, nor the other head serueth well their turnes. And with this wee shall leaue King Henry the 8. who in all the rest of his raigne (which, as hath byn said, was but the third parte after his spirituall headship, of that he had raigned before, in acknowledgment of the Popes Supremacie) his Decrees, Ordinances, and actions though they were inconstant & variable; yet were they all (except this only controuersie of the Popes authoritie) against Protestants, and their religion, as appeareth both by his solemne condemning and burning of Iohn Lambert for denying the Reall presence, the next yeare after this Statute was made; 
                     An. 1540. as also of Anne Ascue and others, vpon the last yeare of his life, 
                     An. 1546. for the same heresie, and of manie others for other Protestant-opinions; so as I doe not see how M. Attorney can much glorie in this first headshipp of his Church of England, 
                  The headship of K. Henry fitteth not M. Attorney. especially that being true, which Bishop Gardiner preached, and protested publikely at Pauls Grosse in Queen Maries time, that K. Henry dealt with him a little before his death for reconcyling himself to the Pope, by restoring to him his authority againe, if with his honour it might bee brought to passe, but before this could bee treated he died, and thereby was frustrated of his good purpose therin.
            
            
               
               The answere to certaine Instances of M. Attorney out of this raigne of K. Henry the eight. §. II.

His doubt is, that for so much as K. Henry was now declared head of the Church, and all Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction taken from the Pope in England, and in English affaires; what shal become of the Canons, or Canon law, togeather with the Constitutions and Ecclesiasticall Ordinances depending of the Church of Rome,

                     If it bee demaunded (saith hee) what Canons, Constitutions, Ordinances, and Synodals Prouinciall are still in force within this Realme? I answere, that it is resolued, and enacted by authoritie of Parlament; that such as haue been allowed by generall consent, and custome within the Realme, and are not contrariant or repugnant to the Laws, Statutes, and Customes of this Realme, nor to the damage or hurte of the Kings prerogatiue Royall, are still in force within this Realme, 
                           This appeareth by the resolution of all the Iudges in 7. H.

                               K. Henry 8. as the Kings Ecclesiasticall laws of the same. Now, as Consent, and Custome hath allowed those Canons; so no doubt by generall consent of the whole Kealme, anie of the same maie bee corrected, enlarged, explained, or abrogated. For example, there is a decree, that all Clerkes that haue receiued anie manner of Orders, greater or smaller, should bee exempt pro causis criminalibus before the temporall Iudges. This decree had neuer anie force within England. First, for that it was neuer approued, and allowed of by generall consent within the Realme: Secondly it was against the laws of the Realme, as it doth appeare by infinite presidents. Thirdly it was against the prerogatiue and soueraigntie of the King, that



any subiect within this Realme, should not bee subiect to the laws of this Realme.
                  
               
               
                  The Catholicke Deuine.
                  19. Heere you see two points touched in this answere: First the resolution it self, and then the confirmation therof by a speciall example. The resolution is very ambiguous, doubtfull, and vncertaine, if you consider it. For he saith,
that such Canonicall laws are to bee still in force, as were allowed by generall consent, not contrariant to the laws, statutes, and customes of this Realme, nor importe anie dammage to the Kings prerogatiue Royall. Ecclesiasticall lavves made subiect to euery particular mans calumniation.
                     
And what are these thinke you? And how vncertaine a rule is this prescribed for laws, whereby matters of conscience must be determined? Who may not say in his owne case, or others; this Canon, or Constitution, though it be of neuer so auncient Councels, or Decrees of the Church, (for of such consisteth the Canon-law) was neuer allowed by generall consent of England; this is contrariant to some Statute or Custome; this importeth dammage to the Kings prerogatiue Royall: and so indeed by establishing this new headship, the whole body of Ecclesiasticall regimēt was ouerthrowne, though M. Attorney to salue the matter, saith;
that the said Canonicall lawes should remaine still in force (with the restrictiōs aforesaid) as the Kings Ecclesiasticall lawes;
which is as much to say, as that these Canon-lawes that were made by generall Councels, Nationall or Prouinciall Synods, and by the Popes of Rome themselues, shall not remaine as their lawes, but as the Kings lawes, for that he retaineth them: of which poore refuge I haue spoken often before, how weake and idle it is.
                  20. But now for his particular example, chosen out to proue that the generall Canonicall lawes of the whole Church receiued throughout Christendome, may be corrected, and enlarged, explaned & abrogated by a particular Countrey (which is contrary to the common Maxime, 
                     A great vntruth that Clerkes vvere not exempted from temporall Iudges. 
                     that no law can be abrogated, but by the same authority, by which it was made and allowed, or greater) I cannot but maruaile, that he would insist vpō the exemption of Clerks from secular tribunals, no one thing in all the libertyes and priuiledges of the Church and Church-men, being more ordinary, not vsuall, nor generally receiued, then this; though M. Attorney presumeth to affirme heere, that this Decree had neuer any force within England, which seemeth to me so manifest an vntruth, as I marueile he would affirme it so flattly. For, to let passe all that



I haue said before in the second Chapter of this our confutation, for the confirmation of the exemptions of Clerks, their persons, and goods, out of the Decrees of auncient Christian Emperours, that ratified the Church-Canons in that behalfe, and the conformity therevnto of our Christian Kings before the Conquest, handled in the 5. & 6. Chapters of this booke; besides this (I say) the assertion of M. Attorney may euidently be ouerthrowne by all the laws, vse, and custome since the said Conquest; and namely, and expressly by the laws of the Conquerour himself, recited before by me in the 7. Chapter of this answere, which were continued by all the said Conquerours posterity, vntill the tyme of King Henry the 3. when written Statutes had first their beginning & namely that of Magna Charta, by which lawes and Statutes the said priuiledge and exemption was often and ordinarily ratified and confirmed.
                  21. As for example, in the third yeare of King Edward the first, sonne to the said King Henry, the Statute speaketh thus: 
                        VVestmon. 1. cap. 2. an. 3. Ed. 
                        
                           •
                        . 
                     when a Clerke is taken for guylte of felony, and is demaunded by the Ordinary, he shall be deliuered to him, according to the priuiledge of holy Church, on such perill, as belongeth to it, after the custome aforetymes vsed, &c. Behold the contradictory words to M. Attorneys, that said this decree had neuer any force, nor was approued in England. The instance also of Bigamyes alleadged before by M. Attorney, 
                     Tvvo instances against M. Attorney vnder K. Edvvard the first. and answered by vs in the 11. Chapter of this booke, vnder the raigne of this King Edward the first, doth euidently confirme that which we say, and refuteth M. Attorney. For that the Kings Counsell refusing there to deliuer certaine felons demaunded by the Prelates, in respect only that they were Bigamyes, or had byn twice marryed, & therby were excluded, by the generall Councell of Lions, from the priuiledge of Clergy-men; this (I say) doth shew, that before that Councell, Bigamyes also had that priuiledge by the Latin words of the law, wherin it is said: Praelati tanquam Clericos exig
                           •
                        runt sibi liberandos: 
                        Statut. de bigamis cap. 5. an. 4. Ed. 1. These prelates or Bishops did exact, or require those felons to be set free vnto them, as Clerks; & doth manifestly declare, that they demaunded it by the knowne law of the land, generally receiued in those dayes.
                  22. And conforme to this, vnder King Edward the second, sonne to the former Edward, 
                     
                        Articuli Cleri cap. 15. an. 9. Ed. 
                        
                           •
                        . we find the law to speake in these words,
A Clerke flying to the Church for felony, to obtaine the priuiledge of the Church, if he affirme himself to be a Clerke, shall not be compelled to abiure



the Realme, but yeelding himself to the law of the Realme, shall enioy the priuiledges of the Church, according to the laudable customes of the Realme heeretofore vsed.
So there; where you see that this was no new thing in those dayes.
                  23. And I might ad to this, diuers other like Decrees of the succeeding Kings, as namely of King Edward the third, in the 18. and 25. yeares of his raigne, 18. Ed. 3. pro Cler. cap. 2. & 25. F. 3. pro Clero cap. 4. & 5. & 4. H. 4. cap 2. and of King Henry the 4. in the 4. yeare of his raigne, vnder whome it is written in the records of Canterbury Church, that the Archbishop Arundel seeing this ancient priuiledge of the Clergy to haue byn somwhat weakned by former Kings, he dealt with the said King Henry effectually, and obtained, saith the Register, vt vetus Cleri praerogatiua, per Regem renouaretur, ne Clerici ad Regium tribunal raperentur. That the auncient prerogatiue of Clergy-men might be renewed by the King,

                      that Clerks should not be drawne to the Kings tribunall. And this was a point so notoriously knowne in England in those dayes, as when vpon the yeare 1405. in the said King Henry the fourth his raigne, the Archbishop of Yorke Richard Scroope, togeather with some others of the nobility, had risen in armes against him, and the King in his choller would needs haue him condemned and executed (as he was) Gaston the cheife Iustice (as Harpesfield noteth out of the said Bishops life, and the addition of Poli-chronicon) Gaston chief Iustice refuted to sit in iudgement vpō an Archbishop. knowing that by the law, he could not be condemned by a secular Iudge, refused to sit vpon him, and so he was condemned by Syr Raph Euers, and Syr VVilliam Fulthrop knights, authorized therevnto by the Kings armed commission; wherof the Clergy greatly complaining, Pope Innocentius the seauenth excommunicated the doers, and denounced to K. Henry, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, that he would proceed in like manner against himself, if he gaue not good satisfaction in that behalfe, but he dying soone after, and a great schisme thervpon ensuing in the Roman Church, nothing was done.
                  24. But much auncienter then this, wee might alleadge diuers examples out of the raignes of King Henry the 3. and Edward the 3. wherof wee haue made mention also in parte before, treating of their times, as of one Peter Ri

I ought not to bee imprisoned, nor to bee kept vnder the custody of Laie-men. The King answered. Te, vt laicum hactenûs ges

                        isti, à te igitur, vt à laico, cui meum commisi thesaurum, exigo. 
                     Clerkes deliuered from secular Iudges in King Henry the third his time. Thou hast borne thy self hitherto as a laie-man, and therefore, as of a laie-man, to whom I committed my treasure, I exact an account of the same. And for that he was found with armour vnder his Clergie attyre, both for this, & because the Archbishop of Canterburie there present, seemed not willing to answere for him, he was sent to the Tower, yet after two daies (saith our author) he was deliuered againe thence by the said Archbishop, and carried to VVinchester, and there left in the Cathedrall Church.
                  25. And some fiue yeares after that againe, one Raph Briton, a Clerke and Cha

                        Idem. An. 1239. being accused to the said King of diuers crimes touching treason, and by his commission to the Maior of London, apprehended and sent to the Tower, was by the instance of the Clergie, vrging their said priuiledge, dismissed. Rex dictum Ranulsum (saith Paris) licet inuitus, solui, & in pace dimitti praecepit; the King though vnwilling, commaunded the said Raph to bee let forth of prison, and peaceably dismissed. So as this exemption was no new thing at that time, as M. Attorney would haue it seeme. And of King Edward the third, aboue a hundred yeares after that againe, Thomas VValsingham alleadgeth this confirmation of the said priuiledge in his time: 
                        VValsing. in vita Edouardi tertij an. 1344.

That no Clerk maie bee arraygned before the Kings Iustices, at the suite of the said King, or of anie other party, yf the said Clerk doe submitt himself to his Clergie, affirming, that hee being a member of holy Church, ought not to answere to the said Iustices. So VValsingham. And this shall bee sufficient to meete with the assertion of M. Attorney to the contrary:
and herewith shall we end our speach of King Henry the eight.
               
            
            
               
               Of King Edvvard the sixt, the one and twentith King after the Conquest. §. III.
                
                  King Edvvard the sixt raigned six yeares frō 1547. vnto 1553.26. This younge Prince being but a child of 9. yeares old, when his father King Henry died (as often hath been said) was by his Tutors and Gouernours, especially his Vncle Earle of Hartford (after made Duke of Somerset) and some others that followed his appetite in the desire of innouation about matters of religion, declared Head of the Church, vnder the same stile, as his father had been before, and by that headship and pretence therof, they took to thēselues authoritie to make that change, which after ensued, partly to the opinions of Luther, & partly of Zuinglius (for Caluin was not yet so famous, or forward in credit for some years after) and to ouerthrow and alter in effect all that King Henry by his headship had ordained, and established before, concerning religion, as may appeare by the seuerall and particular repeals of the most parte of all his Statutes, touching that affaire, 
                     See statut. an. 1. & 2. Edouardi sexts.
                   except only this of his departure from the Pope, and obedience of the Sea Apostolicke.
               27. But yet one principall declaration, and important constitution they added in this matter (as before hath been touched) 
                     Supra Cap. 3. aboue that of King Henry (according to the saying, facile est inuentis addere) and this is, that whereas the Father K. Henry taking from the Pope his accustomed iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, did transferre it vnto his Clergie of England, and afterward declaring himself Spirituall head of that Clergie, did consequentlie inferre, he was head of the English Church also in spirituall matters, yet did he not explaine from what origen properly, this spirituall power did flow: which point the said Gouernours of the child-King Edward did interprete and decide, Spirituall iurisdictiō could not be deriued from the child-king shewing that all spirituall iurisdiction, power, and authority ouer soules, by loosing or binding of sinnes, or other spirituall actions, in Bishops, Prelates, and Priests, proceeded, and was deriued from this young child, who yet notwithstanding, as ech man may consider, was not of yeares to haue perfect vse of reason for disposing so much as temporall matters, and how much lesse in spirituall.



For so affirmeth plainly S. Paul to the Galathians. 
                     Galat. 4. 
                  Quanto tempore haeres par
                        •
                     ulus est, nihil differt à seruo, cum sit Dominus omnium, sed sub tutoribus, & actoribus est, vsque ad praefinitum tempus à Patre. All the time that the heire is young, or vnder age, though he be Lord of all by inheritance, yet doth he differ nothing from a seruant or bound-man (in subiection) but is vnder Tutors, and Administrators, vntill the tyme of his age appointed by his Father. So the Apostle.
               28. And if then this young King had not yet authority, as of himself, to dispose of any temporall affaires, which are of much lesse moment; we may easily consider, what may be thought of spirituall, and Ecclesiasticall, that require more the vse of reason, and iudgement, for exercising of iurisdiction therin, then doth the other. But you will say (perhaps) that the same Tutors, and Administrators, that gouerned him in secular, & Ciuill affaires, might take vpon them also iurisdiction in the spirituall likewise: An eu
                        •
                     siō refuted. and so the Duke of Somerset (for example) with his assistants, might be secondary or Vicar-heads of the Church of England vnder him for the tyme, to absolue, or bind sinnes, determine of heresies, dispose of Sacraments, and the like.
               29. But to this 
                     •
                  s easily answered, according to the principles set downe in the secōd Chapter of this booke, that for so much, as all temporall power is giuen first of all by God, in the law of Nature vnto the people or multitude, who thereby haue authority to transferre the same to what manner of gouernement they like, either Monarchie, or other; it followeth also, that the Common-wealth that had authority to choose, or appoint the state of Kings to raigne ouer them, had, and hath power to giue sufficient authority in like manner, to Tutors and Administrators, Different origens of tēporall and spirituall anthority. to gouerne the said Common-wealth in temporall affaires, during the tyme of their Kings minority or non-age: But that the origen of spirituall power comming not by this way of the people, nor being giuen to them at all, but immediatly by Christ our Sauiour to his Apostles, and their Successours, Bishops and Prelates, by lawfull Ordination and Succession of Priesthood, and imposition of hands to the end of the world; no temporall Tutors, or Administrators could rightly get into this authority, except they were first made Priests, and this also by Caluins opinion and assertion, as well as ours, as  
                     See Supra cap. 2. & 3. before hath byn declared.

                  30. By this then wee see, how; and by what assurance this headship of the Church, and supreme Ecclesiasticall authoritie therof, passed from the Father to the sonne, which was such, as it liked not M. Attorney to alleadge anie one Statute of this mans time against vs, though all in deed were made against vs, and against the said Father, as maie bee easily imagined, considering the Current of that time.

                     e without mentioning her at all; so could I haue done also, but that my purpose is to passe through the raignes of all our Princes, without ouerpassing of anie. And it maie serue also to our purpose, to consider therby the broken and interrupted succession of this new headshipp in the Father, sonne, and daughters. For as the Father by his Act, had contradicted all his auncestors Kings of England before him, from the beginning of their Conuersion vnto his daies; so his sonne, though succeeding him in



the participation of that act, yet contradicted him in all the rest that hee decreed, touching matters of religion, Queene Mary restored all to the ancient vse againe. by vertue of that headshipp after him: & then came th'elder daughter, who cōtradicted them both, and restored all to the auncient state againe, wherin it had cōtinued throughout the race of al her auncestors progenitors of England and Spaine, for a thousand yeares and more. So as heer M. Attorneys prescription can bee verie small, for so much as his whole thrid therof was broken and cut of by Q. Marie, and consequently he must begin againe with Q. Elizabeths raigne, as the fountaine of all his deduction.
               32. And for so much as Queen Marie hauing, as a deuout, obedient, and Catholicke Princesse, returned al things belonging to religion, to their auncient state and cōdition, wherin her Father found them, and her Grand-father left them, shee repealed, and mortified all such Statutes of innouations and new deuises, as shee found to haue been made vpō anie occasion, or fansie what soeuer, during the time of her said Father and brother, reducing her self in obsequium fidei, to the humble obedience of that only faith, which had been held, and practised in Christs vniuersall Church, and namely also in England, from the beginning vnto her said Fathers daies; punishing likewise diuers of the heads and authors of those new innouations and alterations, that had been made: and mamely and aboue others, the chiefe author and instrument of all, Thomas Cranmer Archbishop of Canterburie, 
                  Thomas Cranmer the first hereticall Archb. of Canterbury. who entring Catholikly, as was thought, into that dignity, was the first Archbishop that euer failed, or dissented in his faith frō the rest, or from the obedience, and subordination to the Sea Apostolicke, and so by gods iudgmēt, came to bee a stange example of a miserable end, to bee burned publikly for his heresies; and for that in particular, against which his noble and learned predecessours, Lanfrancus, Anselmus, and other Archbishops of Canterburie, had foughten most famously, aboue other learned men, when it first sprang vp in Berengarius, the first author and inuentor therof, in the daies of VVilliam the Conquerour; I meane, the deniall of the Reall presence in the blessed Sacrament, which of all other heresies, was most hatefull vnto him, for whose sake, Cranmer first of all declined to schisme and heresie, I meane King Henry the eight; yea and to himself also for a tyme, after the others death, as may appeare by the foresaid first Statute, made cheifly by his authority, in the first yeare of King Edwards raigne,



in fauour of the said Reall presence against the Sacramentaryes.
               
               33. All which being so, euery man may behold what ground, or certainty there was in those dayes, or is now, for men to leave the Catholicke knowne religion, and cast the saluation of their soules vpon such alterations, as these were. For that after Queen Mary, who had restored all to the auncient state, as hath byn said, came her younger sister Queen Elizabeth, a Lady of some fiue and twenty yeares of age, who by little and little altered all againe, agreeing in all points neither with the one, nor with the other, neither with them that had made the former alterations, but brought in a new and distinct forme and fashion of beleiuing & worshipping God, peculiar to it self in diuers points, and differing from all in some. Of which innouation by the said younger sister against the elder (they being the only two Queens that euer haue raigned in their owne right within our land, since the beginning of Christianity) we shall now passe to speake a few words, and so end this whole discourse of our English Princes, and their religion.

                  Q. Elizab. raigned 45. yeres from 1558. vnto 1603.34. This Lady being the daughter of King Henry and Queene Anne Bullen, comming to raigne after the foresaid Queen Mary her sister, was persuaded to resume, and take to her self that supreme spirituall power and iurisdiction, which Queen Mary her elder sister had refused, and caused to be restored to the place and persons, from whom it was taken by her Father and brother. And I say she was persuaded therevnto, for that it is the opinion of many men that knew her, VVhat moued Q. Elizabeth to make a nevv change. and conuersed with her, both before and after her entrance to the Crowne, that she had neither great desire to take it at the beginning, nor opinion that she might doe it; but only that she was told, it was necessary to her present state at that time, in regard of diuers Popes sentences past against her legitimation, Pope Clement 7. & Paulu

For remedy of all which, it was made a matter necessary, that she should take the said authority Ecclesiasticall from the Pope and Sea of Rome, and place it in her self, especially when by negociation of some that desired the change, it was brought about, that the Parlamēt should offer it vnto her vnder this plausi

                  Adulatory speeches for imbarking the Queene. and that the same was conforme to the auncient laws of England, acknowledged, and practised by all her auncestors, Kings of the same, and that the difference of her sex, as they had qualified the matter, and couched their words, did hinder nothing at all the acceptance of this authority; shee was content to lett it passe, & admitt therof for the time, though I haue beene most credibly informed, by such as I cannot but beleiue therein, considering also her forsaid sharpenes and pregnancie of witt, that vpon diuers occasions (especially for some yeares after the beginning of her raigne) she would in a certaine manner of pleasantnes iest thereat herself, saying: Looke what a head of the Church they haue made mee.

And to the end that no man may imagine, that these things, & some other, which heer I am to touch of the good dispositiō, this deceased Princesse had of her self, towards Catholicke religion at the beginning of her raigne, and for diuers yeares after, if she might haue been permitted to her owne inclination, are fayned; I doe affirme vpon my conscience, in the sight of him that is author of all truth, and seuere reuenger of all false-hood, that nothing hereof is inuented, or framed by mee, but sincerely related vpon the vndoubted testimonies of such as reported the same, out of their owne knowledge.

               39. Which relation of this noble man is much consirmed by that which was written to the said Queene herself, some six or seauen yeares after, 
                     Doct. Harding in his epistle to the Queene. an, 1565. by Doctor Harding in his dedicatory epistle before the confutation of the English Apologie of the Church of England, vpon the yeare 1565. wherin he commendeth her liking of her more sober preachers: both allwayes heertofore (saith he) and specially on Good-friday last openly by words of thanks, declared, when one of a more temperate nature then the rest, in his sermon before your maiesty, confessed the Reall Presence. So he. And that this opinion, and affection staied and perseuered with her, euen vnto her old age by her owne confession, I haue for witnes another Worshipfull knight yet aliue, who vpon the truth of his conscience hath often protested vnto me, that hauing occasion to walke, & talke with her, and to discourse somewhat largely of forraine matters (for that he was newly come frō beyond the seas) in her garden at VVhitehall, not aboue fiue or six yeres before her death, & relating vnto her among other things, An other protestation of Q. Elizabeth about the Reall presence. the iudgment and speaches of other Princes concerning her excellent partes, of learning, wisedome, bewty, affability, variety of languages, and the like; but especially the speaches of certaine great Ladies to this effect, vpon viewing of her picture; the said knight seeing her to take much contentment therein, and to demaund still greedily what more was said of her, he thought good (asking first pardon) to ad the exception that was made by the said Ladies, to wit, how great pitty it was, that so rare a Princesse should be stained with heresie, wherat her Grace being much moued, as it seemeth, answered: And doe they hold me for an heretick? God knoweth what I am, if they would let me alone; and so auouched vnto him in particular, that she beleiued the Reall presence in the Sacrament, with other like protestations to that effect.
               40. And sundry yeares before this againe, there being sent into



                  England from France, one Monsieur Lansacke of the French King Counsell, that was Steward in like manner of the Queen-mothers houshould (as before hath byn mētioned) he was wont to recount, Q. Elizab. conferēce vvith Mōsieur Lansack.
                   & testifie after his returne, with great asseueration, that hauing had confident speach with the Queen of England, about matters of religion, she told him plainely that which before we touched about her spirituall Supremacy, to wit, that she knew well inough that it belonged not to her, but to S. Peter, and his Successours, but that the people, and Parlament had layed it vpon her, and would needs haue her to take, and beare it. Adding moreouer her Catholicke opinion about other points in controuersie also, and namely about Praying to Saints, affirming that euery day she prayed herself to our Blessed Lady. And so far forth had she persuaded this to be true to this French Counsellour, as he did not only beleiue it, and reporte it againe with great confidence, but was wont to be angry also, with such as should seeme to make doubt of the truth therof: among whome, for one, was a worshipfull gentleman of our owne Countrey yet liuing, that resided then in that Court, and had often conference with the said Monsieur Lansacke about the matter.
               41. And by all this we may see, that the said Queen was drawne to many things against her owne inclination, & much resistance she made at the beginning, for diuers dayes, to admit any change of religion; and therevpon presently euen before her Coronation, she caused proclamation to be made, that none should preach (saith Stow) but such as should be appointed; & that no rites, or ceremonies vsed in the Church should be altered, but as it was in her owne Chappell; and this, to preuent such innouators, as she knew would presently be doing, if they were not preuented: against whom she would often speake bitterly and contemptuously in secret with certaine  To the old L.

And all this I haue thought good (omitting many other things to this effect) to mention in this place, for some parte of excuse (if it may be) of the many and greiuous afflictions laid vpon her Catholicke subiects afterward by her authority, for profession of the said faith and religion, which herself at the beginning seemed not to mislike. And surely her example may be a dreadfull president, how far, and daungerously Princes may be led by arte, and importunity of others, if they be not wachfull to resiste them at the beginning.

               43. And of this, let the multiplicity of statutes extant against them be witnes, the death of so many Priests, and others of that religion, yea of her deerest and neerest in bloud, that then was liuing, togeather with the imprisonments, vexations, and tribulations of innumerable good subiects for that cause; which brought her finally, after many troubles and terrours, distrusts and iealousies, to that melancholike afflicted state of mind, wherin she died. All which had byn auoided, if (to vse her owne phrase) they would haue let her alone, and left her to her owne disposition, and mylde inclination; but now the accoumpt must remaine vnto herself.
               44. And so to conclude, for so much as these Statutes, which M. Attorney doth mention heer to haue byn made by her against Catholickes, and principally against the spirituall iurisdiction of the Sea of Rome, and braunches therof, did not so much proceed of her owne proper inclination and disposition, if we beleife the former testimonies, as of other mens instigation; or if they did, they were made in defence of her owne Ecclesiasticall Supremacy newly taken, or laid vpon her: it shall to be needfull for me to answere them so particularly, as I haue done the rest before



cited, sauing only to certaine erroneous assertions, and iniurions asseuerations added by M. Attorney himself in his enumeration and declaration therof, which we shall performe in the next ensuing Chapter, and conclusion of this whole worke.

            ALbeit in the beginning and first entrance of this my answere, I promised (and so I presume hath been perfourmed) to hold a milde, and respectiue course of temperate writing throughout the same; yet drawing now towards an end, and finding M. Attorney to imitate the motion of naturall bodies, who the neerer they come to their Center, the more vehemently they mooue, that is to saie, to bee so much the more bitter, eager, and iniurious to Catholicks, as he draweth neerer to the vpshot of his Worke, and designed Center of their dammage, hurte, and preiudice; M. Attorneyes iniurious conclusiō

I am forced in this place, somewhat also to sharpen my pen, for repelling so manie, manifest, & vndeserued iniuries; which craftely he goeth about in his last cōclusion to couch vpon them: but yet retaining still our former measure of moderation & friendly dealing, so far as the nature & circumstance of the busines may beare & permit; intituling this Chapter, rather of Expostulations, then accusations on our behalfe, which for that they concerne diuers sortes of men, wee shall handle distinctly, vnder the seuerall ensuing Paragraphes.
            
               
               THE FIRST EXPOSTVLATION, In the behalfe of Recusant Catholicks of England greiuously iniured by the Attorney. §. I.
               2. To the end you may better iudge of the equity of this our first expostulation, I thinke it best to set downe the iniquitie of the Attorneys false charge in his owne words, which are these, in the 34. and 35. leaues of this his 5. parte of Reportes, wholy directed to their hurte, and preiudice.
From the first vntill the eleuenth yeare (saith he) of the late Queen Elizabeths raigne, no person of what persuasion of Christian religion soeuer, at anie time refused to come to the publike diuine seruice celebrated in the Church of England, A false

                        he Attorney. being euidently grounded vpon the sacred and infallible VVord of almightie God, and established by publicke authoritie within this Realme. But after the Bul of Pius Quintus was published against her Maiesty in the said 11. yeare of her raigne, &c. all they that depended on the Pope, obaied the Bull, disobaied their gratious and natural Soueraigne, and vpon this occasion refused to come to the Church, &c.
               
               3. Heer you see two things boldly affirmed: First that in 11. yeares after Queen Elizabeths comming to her Crowne, no person of what persuasion soeuer in Christian religion, did at anie time refuse to goe to Church, vntill the Bul of Pius Quintus came forth against her. The secōd, that vpon this occasion, Catholicks not holding the Queen for their lawfull Princesse (for so afterward he often expoundeth himself) refused to come to Church. Both which points, if wee can shew to bee most manifestly false, and the second also calumnious, what shall wee saie of M. Attorney in this behalfe, that presumeth so confidentlie to put such open vntruths in print?
               4. First then, for the former point, not onlie many Catholicks in the first eleuen yeares by him prescribed, did refuse publikely to come to the Protestants Church, but many Puritans also, from the verie first entrance of Queen Elizabeth to her Crowne, and so is it testified by publike authoritie of diuers books, set forth by order and approbation of the Bishops of England themselues these years past against the said Puritans, recounting the beginning, ofspring,



and progresse of that Sect, and faction, one of them wri

But yet you shall heare it affirmed plainly and distinctly out of the same Author quite opposite to M. Attorneys asseveration, though hee bee of his religion, if yet he haue made his choise.
               
                  5. For the first ten or eleuen yeares of her Maiestyes raigne (saith hee) through the peeuish frowardnes,

Cart-wright within a while after tooke vpon him in a sorte to defend, &c.
So hee. The first recusancy of Puritanes. And thus much for Puritanes, whome if M. Attorney will graunt to bee of anie perswasion what soeuer in Christian religion: he then must needs graunt also, that hee was much o

                  ershott in this his first so generall a Proposition, affirming, that none of what persuasion soeuer, did at anie time refuse within that compasse to goe to Church. But lett vs see, how wee can ouerthrow the same in like manner, concerning Catholickes, of whom principally hee meant it.
               6. Hee that shall but cast backe the eye of his memorie, vpon the beginning of Queen Elizabeths raigne, and shall consider how many Archbishops, Bishops, Deans, Archdeacons, Heads of Colledges, Chanons, Priests, Schollers, Religious persons of diuers sortes, and sexes, Gentle-men, Gentle-weomen, and others,



did refufe openly to conforme themselues to that new change of Religion then made, and published by authority of the said Queen, at the beginning of her raigne; will maruaile how, and in what sense, and whether in iest or earnest, sleeping or waking, M. Attorney set downe in writing so generall a negatiue assertion. For that he shall see so many conuictions therof, as there be particular witnesses of credit against him in that behalfe. And truly, it seemeth, that either he was an infant, or vnborne at that time, and hath vnderstood little of those affaires since, or els forgot himself much now, in affirming so resolutely a proposition refutable by so infinite testimonyes.
               7. For if he looke but vpon Doctor Sanders Monarchy in latin in his 7. booke, where he handleth the matters that fell out vpon the first change of religion in Queen Elizabeths dayes, he shall find 14. Bishops at least of England only, besides ten more of Ireland and Scotland, 
                  Ho
                        •
                      many Catholicks vvere Recusants from the beginning togeather with Doctor Fecknam Abbot of VVestminster, Father Maurice Chasey, and VVilson Priors of the Carthusians, 13. Deans of Cathedrall churches, 14. Archdeacons, 15. heads of Colledges, almost 50. Chanons of Cathedrall churches, aboue eightscore other Priests, wherof diuers were Doctors, or Bachlers of diuinity, Ciuill, and Canon-law, depriued from their liuings, and offering themselues, either to voluntary banishment abroad, or to imprisonment and disgrace at home, for maintenance of Catholicke religion, to omit all the rest of the lay sort, both of the Nobility, Gentry, and others, that stood openly to the defence of the same Religion: All which did refuse to goe to the Protestant-seruice, euen in those first dayes; which is testimony inough, to conuince the open, and notorious falsity of M. Attorneys assertion, that no person of what persuasion soeuer in Christian religion, did at any time refuse to goe to Church: though I deny not, but that many other besides these, throughout the Realme, though otherwise Catholickes in heart (as most then were) did at that tyme and after, as also now, either vpon feare, or lacke of better instruction, or both, repaire to Protestant-Churches; the case being then not so fully discussed by learned men, as after it was, whether a man with good conscience may goe to the Church and seruice of a different Religion from his owne, which releiueth little M. Attorneys affirmation. And so this shall suffice for the first point.
               8. In the second point, being no lesse notoriously vntrue then the first, he offereth the said Catholickes much more iniury, in



affirming, that vpon this occasion of the Bul of Pius quintus against Q. Elizabeth they first refused to goe to the Church, as not holding her for true and lawfull Queene: insinuating therby another consequence also, much more false and malicious then this, to wit, that the same may be said and vnderstood of Recusant Catholickes at this day, in respect of his Maiesty that now is. But the vntruth of this assertion is most manifest, both by that we haue shewed before, that great multitudes of Catholickes refused euen from the beginning to goe to Protestant-Churches, 
                     See the booke intituled Reasōs of Refusall.
                   though then the matter was not much vrged against them; as also by this other reason, for that their holding the Queene, for true, or vnlawfull, was, and is impertinent to the matter of going to Church: Nay, their holding her for not Queen (if any so did) did rather disoblige, then oblige them to this recusancy.
               9. The reason heerof is, for that one principall cause binding them in conscience not to goe to the seruice of a different, or opposite religion to their owne, was the precept and commaundement giuen by the said Queene, that all should repaire to the said seruice, to shew their conformity &c. For that the obeying of this precept in matters of religiō (they offering themselues otherwise to goe to any Church for temporall matters) was a kind of publike denying their owne faith: As for example; if in Persia at this day, or other places of differēt Religion, Christians liuing there should of their owne curiosity goe sometimes to the Churches or Moscies of that Coūtrey, to heare & see only what is there done, though not to pray or worship; or (which is lesse) should carry or weare their Turbant or Mahometan habit, it were not so great a matter of offence; but if the King, or Emperour should commaund the same to be done in attestation of their conformity of religion, Consider vvell this reason. now this precept doth make it much more vnlawful, though yet if he were not true King indeed, nor true magistrate that should make such a precept, but some priuate man of his owne authority; euery man seeth, that it would rather diminish, then encrease the obligation of recusancy, And so M. Attorney, when he affirmeth that Catholickes first began their recusancy of going to Church, vpon this persuasion that Queen Elizabeth was not lawfull Queene, he alleadgeth circstumāce that might rather, in some sort, facilitate their going, then encrease their obligation to the same recusancy. For that her precept and commaundement binding them not at all,



as not Queene, they were freed thereby of that obligation, as before hath byn said, springing of this head of Royall commaundement.
               10. This then is the first great iniury, which M. Attorney offereth vnto Recusant Catholickes, interpreting their recusancy to be of malice and treasonable hearts, rather then of band of conscience, Reportes 
                        
                           •
                        ol. 37. which iniury he often iterateth in the current of his discourse, saying after many other accusations heaped togeather, in this sorte: False and Iniurious calumniations. 
                  In all this tyme, no law was either made, or attempted against them for their recusancy, though it were grounded vpon so disloyall a cause, as hath byn said. And againe a little after talking of the penall laws, made against them for the same recusancy, he saith:
That it was a milde, aud mercifull law, considering their former conformity, and the cause of their reuolt.
But I hauing shewed now, that there was no such generall conformity before, and consequently no reuolt, and much lesse any such cause of reuolt, as he faineth to himself; the vntruth of these charges, and the wrong done therby to innocent men, is made euident and manifest.
               11. Neither doth M. Attorneys exorbitant humour containe it self heer, but being once entred into the field of insolent inuectiues and exaggerations against the said recusant Catholickes, hee vaunteth, and triumpheth, as though he had them vnder him at the barre readie to bee condemned, where no man must speake in their behalfe, but himself onlie against them without replie, or contradiction. And therfore after a longe enumeration of matters both impertinent, and little important to the cause in hand, he writeth thus: 
                     fol. 3
                        •
                     .
                  
                     And there vpon Campian, Sherwyn, and manie other Romish Priests being apprehended and confessing that they came into England to make a partie for the Catholicke cause, when need should require, Manifest slaunderous vntruthes. were in the 21. yeare of the said late Queens raigne, by the auncient Common-laws of England, indicted, arraygned, tried, adiudged, and executed for high treason, &c. 
                        fol. 39. 
                     And againe not longe after he maketh this conclusion: By this, and by all the Records of indictments, it appeareth that these Iesuites and Priests are not condemned, and executed for their Priest-hood and profession, but for their treasonable, and damnable persuasions and practices, against the Crownes and dignities of Monarches, and absolute Princes. &c. Thus hee.
                  
               
               12. But heer I would aske, may not a man of his calling bee ashamed, to put in print so manifest vntruths, euen then, when



there are so manie hundreds yet aliue, The protestations M. Campian. Shervvyn and others at theire deathes. that were at the said arraignments, trials, condemnations, & deaths of the said Blessed men, Campian, Sherwyn, & the rest, who not only protested on their soules, and euerlasting saluation at their last houre, to bee guyltlesse in all accusations laid against them, except only their Orders of Priest-hood, and profession of faith, but vpon racks also stood therevnto, and defended the same so cleerly at the barre, with manie reasons, proofes, and demonstrations, as most of those that stood round about, and heard their Pleas, yea Protestants also by name, did think certainly, when the Iury went forth to consult (and did offer likewise to lay wagers theron) that at least Father Campian, and his companie, the first day should haue been quitted.
               13. And as for the auncient common laws of England, wherby M. Attorney saith they were condemned, wee haue shewed now often before, that this is but a word of Course with him, & that there bee no such Commō-laws extant, not euer were, or could bee vnder Catholicke Princes against Priests, before the breach of King Henry the 8. and that this is but an Idaea Platonica of the Attorneys inuention, M. Attorneys Idaea Plat

Hee maie leaue that charge to his Auncients, especially to him, that had his office at that time, who being yet liuing (as I suppose) hath both that, and many other such heauy reckonings to answere for, at the time appointed by the common Iudge of all, whome I beseech most humbly to facilitate that account vnto him, and others interessed therin; as this also of calumniating Recusant-Catholickes to M. Attorney, they being the only people of that profession, that most ought to be pittied, and charitably delt withall; for that they suffer only for not dissembling in their consciences: which if they would doe, as the sinne were damnable to themselues, so were it nothing profitable or auailable to the State, or Prince, to haue externall conformity, without inward consent, iudgement, will, or loue. And so much of the ground of this first expostulation, pretermitting many other things, which might be complained of, in this boysterous streame, and torrent of M. Attorneys accusations against them.
               
                  14. And yet one thing more I may not pretermit, which is, to admonish his conscience, if it haue aures audiendi, hearing eares (which by our Sauiours speach appeareth that diuers cōsciences haue not) to looke to one speciall obligation aboue the rest; which is, that hauing ended, and put in print this his Booke, & presented the same in person to his Maiesty, A scruple

And in this point I will remit me to the iudgement, and censure of the best, & most learned Deuines of all Christendome at this day, either Protestants or Catholickes, whether restitution of fame, iustice, or innocency violated by him, be not in this case necessarily to be made: Quia non dimittitur peccatum, nisi restituatur ablatum.
               
               15. As for example, if M. Attorney in presenting his booke to his Maiestie, & laying open the same, did say, Lo Syr, heer is all this ranke of English laws, to proue that the Kings of this land, did, and might from tyme to tyme, take vpon them Supreme spirituall iurisdiction, no lesse then Queen Elizabeth did by peculiar Act of Parlament, in the first yeare of her raigne: yf he vsed this or the like speach (as I haue byn informed that he did) and that now it be proued, Vntrue informations of M. Attorney vnto his Maiesty. that no one of those laws nor al put togeather, doe proue that Conclusion: and if he affirmed moreouer, that by the said auncient English-laws, whosoeuer did not ascribe Supreme spirituall authority to Queen Elizabeth, did deny the perfection of temporall Monarchy in her, and consequently were guilty of treason, or Laesae Maiestatis, which no auncient English-law euer spake, or meant, but all the contrary.
               16. If in like manner he told his Maiestie (as he did) and made him beleiue that it was true, that no person, of what persuasion soeuer in religion, did refuse at any tyme, for the first eleuen yeares of the Queens raigne, to goe to the Church, and that, then their motiue was, for that they



held her not for Queen: If these suggestions (I say) & assertions were then made, and lest imprinted in the royall mind and memory of his maiestie, & now are proued to be far otherwise, I am cōtent, as I said, to remit my self to any learned Deuine whatsoeuer, that knoweth what cases of Conscience doe meane, to determine what M. Attorneys obligation of restitution is in this behalfe.
               17. Neither may he solace himself (as I thinke he will not) in this point, thinking that these are but veniall sinnes for Purgatory, 
                     August. in Enchiridio c. 67. 68. & 69. Lib. de fide & operibus c. 14. 15. 16. & Lib. 21. de Ciuit. De

                   and to be purged in the transitory fire, if he omit these restitutions: for that S. Augustine in many places expresly excepteth and excludeth the same, and saith that sinnes of this quality (committed against charity) are for hell-fire, and not for the transitory purging fire, if they be not amended and satisfied for in this life: and to that sense interpreteth he the place of S. Paul 1 Cor. 3. If any man buyld vpon the foundation, which is Christ, not gold and siluer, but wood, straw, and chaffe, his works shall burne, &c. And thus much of this first expostulation.
            
            
               THE SECOND EXPOSTVLATION In the behalfe of all English Catholickes in generall. §. II.
               18. As the former expostulation was in the name of Recusant-Catholickes especially, for that the charge most concerned them in particular; so now am I to adioyne some few lines more in behoofe of all Catholickes in generall, that prosesse, or defend the said religion by word, or pen, either at home, or abroade, whome M. Attorney accuseth in his Preface not only of Error, and of her inseparable twynn, Ignorance: (to vse his phrase) but of intollerable, and miserable malice also, if it were true, as it is not, to wit, 
                     Supra in Praefat.
                   
                  that they impugne the knowne truth against their owne consciences, and this either vpon discontentment for not attaining their ambitious and vniust desires, or for deserued punishments and disgraces, iustly laid vpon them by the State for their vices and wickednes. 
                  False causes deuised of Catholicks constancy. To which vniust & vncharitable charge, though I haue answered somewhat before in the Preface, and first Chapter of this booke; yet doe I remember to haue made



promisse also in that place to say somewhat more in this, for giuing satisfaction in that behalfe to all charitable & indifferent people, especially in this point, that our standing out against the current of the present time (to vse M. Attorneys phrase) is not either of so gr
                        •
                     sse ignorance and lacke of instruction, as hee would haue men to beleiue by his often repetition therof (and so I presume will in parte appeare by this our answere to his Booke) or of ambitious desires frustrated, which Catholicke English men of all other sortes of people, can best bee content, and haue best learned by theyr sufferings in these our daies to moderate, & laie aside, so that i

                   other points their consciences were not racked, galled, and molested: and finally much lesse of punishments, and disgraces receiued from the Sate for their vices, and wickednes: in which Kind it may bee auerred (I weene) by good records, that fewer haue been, and are punished for those causes, then of anie other sorte of men, or religion whatsoeuer.
               19. Wherefore laying aside all passion, and animositie of part-taking and sincerely to ioyne franke issue with M. Attorney in this point; wee say and affirme, out of the testimonie of a good conscience in the sight of him that seeth all hearts and cogitations, that his accusations and charges are false in this behalfe, and that our only staie and stopp from not running with him, and others, in this their prosperous Current of the present time, is the barre of conscience only, Only conscience stayeth Catholicks from follovving M. Attorneys current. which if wee could remoue, or hee for vs, who would not bee glad to take parte of so faire and pleasing fortunes, as hee and others enioy by that Current. And wee might also, euery man in his degree and ranke, according to the merit, qualitie, talent, and industrie of ech one of vs, enioy our partes therof, yf this obstacle of conscience were not: or if the onlie feare, and dread of allmightie God, and his iudgment, did not terrifie vs from breaking through the same by violence of will, against the testimonie of our said consciences and iudgment.
               20. The same God also doth know, how great a greife it hath been, and is vnto vs in respect of the world, that wee haue not been able to conforme our selues in these externall things, concerning the profession of our religion, vnto the iudgment, tast, and will of our temporall Prince and State, being withholden and terrified from it, by those two knowne threats of our Sauiour, and his Apostle; the one telling vs, Luc. 12. Rom. 2. 
                  that if wee denie, wee shall bee denied; the other, that our consciences must bee the sole wittnesses to



condemne, or deliuer vs at the last daie, which consciences wee finding to repine and resist, are forced to hearken vnto them now, to the end they may stand for vs and not against vs at that day.
               21. And if the iudgment of auncient Christian writers, and Fathers, and namelie Eusebius in the life of our Constantine the Great,

                   that liued with him, was good in commending so highly his Father Cōstātius, for that being yet a Pagan, he more esteemed those Christians throughout his gouernment, The iudgment of Constantius touching such as dissembled in religion. that professed freely their religion, and refused to doe against the same at his commaundement, then hee did the other that dissembled, & obaied, and thereupon he reiected the one, and fauoured the other, as more sincere people, and more to bee trusted by him, that were so trustie, and faithfull to their God, and his religion: yf this (I saie) were a good censure and iudgment, I doe not see, how this other of M. Attorney can stand vpon anie ground of reason, or Christian charitie, that qualifieth so greiuously, or rather calumniateth so egregiously the religious standing of Catholicke people, in the moderate defence, and excuse of their said consciences.
               22. But heere perhaps hee may demaund, or some body for him, what great reasons wee haue for this obstacle of our iudgment, for not conforming it to his, and others in this behalfe. Wherunto, though sufficientlie hath been alleadged before in the Answere to his Preface; yet now may some two or three points, or considerations bee further added in confirmation therof, among almost infinite that might bee produced. Some points of consideration. And the first may bee that which hitherto wee haue treated in this book with M. Attorney, concerning the continuance of that religion for which wee stand, throughout the whole race, and course of our Christian English-Princes, State, and Realme, from the beginning of our first conuersion, vnto our time. All which Kings and Queens, Counsellors, Nobilitie, Archbishops, Bishops, Doctors, Vniuersities, Lawyers, and Sages of all sortes, were for so manie ages by one, and the self-same religion, profession, and beleife, directed and saued, if anie were saued: that is to say, by the selfsame means, doctrine and Sacraments of our auncient Catholicke English Church continuing vntill K. Henry 8. tyme which Church professed the very same faith and beliefe in like maner, as in another special  The booke of three cō
                     uersions. booke hath been declared, wherby all other Christian nations had been directed and saued, for



those other ages, which went before our English conuersion after Christs assension.
               23. New then this being so, I would aske anie reasonable indifferent English-man, whether wee haue iust cause to stand in, and for this religion or not, and whether if himself were now readie to die (for that is the time, when men doe iudge with lesse passion) and had laid before his eyes the euerlasting ioyes of heauen on the one side, and the eternall paines of hell on the other, to bee lost, or gayned, by his election; whether (I saie) hee would aduenture rather to goe in companie and ioyne himself with this large, and venerable bodie of old English Catholickes, among whome there are recorded by histories to haue been so manie admirable men, both for learning, An important deliberation., wisdome and sanctitye of life; or leauing these to take parte, and receiue his portion with such later people of the same nation, as haue deuided themselues from the other. And when M. Attorney in good probabilitie of reason, shall substantiallie answere mee this demaund, it may doubtlesse bee a great motiue vnto mee, and others to draw vs to the current of this present time; but in the meane space wee must stand fast, least wee fall into the torrent of brimstone, if wee goe against our consciences, by which wee must bee iudged, and euery man damned, or saued thereby, as out of the Apostles testimonie before hath been declared. Rom. 2.
               
               24. And thus much for standing in our old religion. Now for passing to a new, there is another obstacle also, that greatlie withholdeth vs, and this is, that when wee shall haue left this old religion, so begun, so established, so confirmed, so promised by God to endure to the worlds end, so generallie receiued, so vniuersalli-continued, as hath been declared, wee cannot tell to what othe

                   sorte, sect, or parte of religion to passe with anie probable securitie, or certeynty at all, why wee should rather adhere to one sect then to another. For when once wee lea

As for example, if to a man that vpon anie offence, disgust, scandall, error, anger, interest, leuity, or the like, (for these are the ordinary motiues of changes) breaketh from the auncient Catholicke Romain religion; there should represent themselues



vnto him fiue or six of the principall newest sects, and sortes, that professe different religions in our time (all vnder the name of the Ghospell) as namelie of Lutheranes, either ridged or soft, of Anabaptists, Trinitarians, new Arrians, Zwinglians, Cal

               25. Wheras then, no ground at all can bee yeelded by anie reason, witt, or learning of man, why wee should bee rather of one new profession then another, after wee haue left the old receiued throughout Christendome, and that in the old, wee stand not ech-man vpon his particular iudgment to beleiue this or that, No groūd or stay in sects or nevv opinions. but vpon the generall testimonie, tradition, voice, vse, and authoritie of the vniuersall Christian Church called Catholicke, (as

Attorneys new Current, or anie other, that hath no staie, but maie carry vs further with the streame, then wee can



staie our selues afterward, when wee would. And thus much of this consideration.
               26. A third is (which also shall bee the last in this place) that terrifieth vs no lesse, then anie of the former two, and this is the name and dreadfull voice of heresie, sect, or schisme, so common now in these our daies, & so ordinarie in everie mans mouth; as ech one of different opiniōs, esteemeth the other for Hereticke, Sectarie, or Schismatike; which notwithstanding, if wee consider the course, and sacred sense of holie scripture, especiallie for the new testament, as also the iudgment, feeling and meaning of all auncient Fathers, Hovve great and grieuous the sinne of heresye is. and of the whole primitiue Christian Church in their daies; wee shall find to bee the most greiuous accusation, most odious, daungerous, and damnable imputation to be accoumpted an hereticke or sectary, that can possibly be imagined or laid vpon any Christian in this life; yea that all other crimes laid togeather, which by mans malice, or diabolicall induction can bee committed, are not equall to this onlie crime of heresie: for so doe all learned Catholicke Deuines hold and determine in their generall positions of this matter, as may bee seen in one for all, in the Summe of S.

                     Tit. 4. as that of S. Paul to Titus: that an hereticall man is subuerted & damned by his owne iudgment, and other such places. It is sufficient for setling our dread and feare in this behalfe, that the whole consent of Schoole-Doctors, vpon this alleadged article of S. Thomas., doe agree, that it is more daungerous and damnable to fall into heresie, then to bee a Iew, or Pagan.
               27. With which seueritie of Censure, doe concurre also fullie the auncient Fathers of the Primitiue Christian Church, whose sentences were o
                     •

a shorte view thereof gathered togeather vpon another occasion, in a certaine  In the beginning of both the Examens of Fox his Calendar. booke lately set forth, where the consenting woords of the most principall said auncient Doctors are laid togeather, affirming that who soeuer by schisme or heresie is cut of frō the faith & cōmmuniō of the generall knowne Catholicke Church, is most certainly to bee damned, and cannot bee saued, though hee should otherwise liue neuer so well, praie neuer so much, giue neuer so great almes, haue neuer so god intētiō other wise; yea though hee should offer his life, shed his bloud & suffer neuer so manie torments for Christ, his name, loue, and religion.
               28. This then being so and adioyning yet further to this consideration, another generall position of our said learned Deuines which is, as the foresaid renowned Doctor S. Thomas setteth it downe, that whosoeuer in anie one least article of Catholicke religiō, doth run into heresie, or beleiueth not the said article, as hee should doe, 
                     D. Thom. 22. quast. 5. art. 3. but obstinately rather impugneth the same, he leeseth his whole faith not, onlie in that point which hee discrediteth, but in all other points also, which hee beleiued before, and persuadeth himself to beleiue still: this (I saie) being so, which the said learned Schole-Doctor proueth by euident arguments, & demonstratiue groundes to bee true, M. Attorney may imagine, what stay and repugnance wee may haue out of the feare of our consciences in this behalfe, easilie to make new choice, or changes of religion in these daies. For as if a learned, & experiēced Phisition should come, & shew out of aunciēt reading, that there were a Kind of most deadly, & dreadfull sorte of plague, or Epidemia to bee feared, and fled aboue all the rest when it cometh, for that no hope of life, or escape can be giuen from it; A similitude to be vveighed and considered. & that withall hee should affirme, that now the said plague, begā to be cōmon in such and such places, yea so cōmon, as many men did contemne it and make it but a iest, though all perished with it that fel into it; as in this case (I saie) wise-mē would looke about them, hearing that so pestilent & perilous infectiō were on foote in their daies: so much more in this other infection of the soule, leading most certainly to euerlasting death & dānation (as al the most learned spirituall Phisitions of Christs holy Church haue euer taught vs) haue we reason to bee carefull, timerous & vigilant what we doe, & what change we make, whither we goe, & frō whence we departe, the saying of S: Athanasius being so dreadfull, in his Creed,

Attorney and vs, wee haue shewed his opinions and assertions to bee so different from those of all our English Christian Commonwealth, from the beginning vnto our times, which wee on the other side haue shewed to be trulie Catholicke, and common to the whole Christian world besides; all men of indifferencie wil cōsider, what reasō we haue in making such stay as we doe, from passing lightlie to his Current, & how little reason he hath, or had to charge vs so deeplie and iniuriouslie, that our stay was vpon so euill and odious causes, as before he charged vs. And thus much of this second expostulation.
            
            
               
               THE THIRD EXPOSTVLATION, In the name of all moderate and peace-louing subiects whatsoeuer. §. III.
               31. My third complaint or expostulation with M. Attorney is yet more generall, as concerning not onlie all sortes of Catholickes whatsoeuer, but other men in like manner of any profession in Christian religion that are wise, moderate, peaceable, and desirous of the tranquillitie of the Prince and State where they liue, who out of their prudence, easilie doe foresee, cannot but incurre danger of perturbation by immoderate exasperation of minds, The perils that arise by the insolency of some priuate men. when particular men (otherwise not loued but rather hated, or enuyed for their extraordinarie fortunes, riches, and aduauncements) doe passe to such insolencie of speach and beuauiour, as they seeke to drawe whole multitudes into disgrace and daunger, by vniust oppresion. We know, and may remember out of our histories, what general exulceratiō of hartes haue risen in former years against Huberts de Burgo, Gauestons, Spēcers, Mortimers, Veares, Scroops, Catesbies, Ratcliffes, Louels, Empsons, Dudleys, and other vpon like occasions, for that they were thought, or suspected to incite the Prince vnder whome they liued, to the vndeserued hurts and ruines of many others.
               32. And surelie what M. Attorney hath perfourmed, or attempted in this behalfe, partlie by his iniurious speaches at the barrs where he pleadeth, partlie by this his Booke, and other means, against so great a multitude of his Maiesties Subiects, as the Catholicke partie and their well-willers are, both at home and abroad; is not heard to consider: for so much, as he maketh their verie beleife, or act of vnderstanding, Men brought into despaire forget all reason and duty. which lyeth not in their handes to alter at their pleasure, to bee disloialtie and treason (as before hath byn shewed) and consequentlie that against their wills they must be traitors. Wherof ensueth againe another consequence worse then this, which is, that when men see themselues



vrged, egged, and pressed in matters that lie not in their owne hands to remedie, & this also as they persuade themselues, not so much by the inclination of the Prince, as by the importunitie & insolencie of others, that being wanton with wealth, delight themselues in other mens vexations; this perswasion (I say) when once it entereth into the head of multitudes in any common-wealth, driueth men to extreme impatience, and vtter despaire of redresse; the only remedy wherof, is none other, but to preuent the occasion it selfe.
               33. And (truly) it may be probably hervpon inferred (and so it is also thought of diuers at home and abroad) that this Booke of Reportes of M. Attorneys comming forth at the time when it did, and beating to the end, which before we haue seen, presented also particularlie to his Maiesty, The exul

                      M. Attorneys booke. as hath byn said, & much praised by the same, accompanied also at that time with no small multitude of other afflictions laid vpon the Catholicke people, throughout all partes of our Realme, and many more threatned, and expected dailie by them: this (I say) togeather with the circumstance of the authorsperson, eyed greatly for his extraordinarie wealth and ouerflowing fortunes, might bee some cause of furthering of this late most dangerous and lamentable attempt in our owne Countrey, so greatly noysed, and talked of at his day, throughout the Christian world.
               34. Wherfore the summe of this my expostulation with M. Attorney is, that hee being otherwise a wise, and learned man (as in his profession I take him to bee, by his preferments) and not insolent, or cruell by nature (as willinglie I incline to beleiue) would at such a time, as he saw so great a multitude of Catholike people greiuously afflicted for their religion, come forth with so odious and new drift against them, A pro

Which thinge, albeit some other lighter companions, leuioris armaturae milites, ministers (to witt) of diuers sortes, haue not sticked iniuriously to cast out: yet for a man of M. Attorneys place and ranke, to affirme it so seriously, and to promise also Demonstratiue proofs therof, by the auncient Common-laws of our Realme, was a matter of farre more impression, and must needs worke more daungerous,
