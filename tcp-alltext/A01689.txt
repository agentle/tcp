                        IT is proportion that beautifies euery thing, this whole Vniuerſe conſiſts of it, and Muſicke is meaſured by it, which I haue endeauoured to obſerue in the compoſition of theſe few Ayres, but cannot in their Dedication: for when I compare your many fauours with my demerits, your curious Eare with theſe harſh Notes, there appeares ſo plaine a diſproportion betweene them, that I am afraid, leaſt in offring to your Patronage Songs in ſome tune, my action heerein ſhould be out of all tune; yet haue I made bould to honour them with your Name, that the world may take notice, rather of my want of abilitie, then good-will to be gratefull. By which little outward demonſtration, you may eaſily gueſſe at the greatneſſe of my inward affection, as skilfull Geometricians doe obſerue the true ſtature of the whole body by ſight of the foote onely. Experience tels vs that Songs of this Nature are vſually eſteemed as they are well or ill performed, which excellent grace I am ſure your vnequalled loue vnto Muſicke will not ſuffer them to want, that the Author (whom you no leſſe loue) may be free from diſgrace. They were most of them compoſed in your owne houſe, and doe therefore properly belong vnto you, as Lord of the Soile; the language they ſpeake you prouided them, I onely furniſhed them with Tongues to vtter the ſame: they are like young Schollers newly entred, that at firſt ſing very fearefully, it requires your Patience therefore to beare with their imperfections: they were taught to ſing onely to delight you, and if you ſhall take any pleaſure in them, they haue their end, and I my wiſh, a full recompence for my paſſed labours, and a greater encouragement to preſent you with ſome future things more worthy your Patronage; till which opportunity, I reſt

By which little outward demonſtration, you may eaſily gueſſe at the greatneſſe of my inward affection, as skilfull Geometricians doe obſerue the true ſtature of the whole body by ſight of the foote onely. Experience tels vs that Songs of this Nature are vſually eſteemed as they are well or ill performed, which excellent grace I am ſure your vnequalled loue vnto Muſicke will not ſuffer them to want, that the Author (whom you no leſſe loue) may be free from diſgrace. They were most of them compoſed in your owne houſe, and doe therefore properly belong vnto you, as Lord of the Soile; the language they ſpeake you prouided them, I onely furniſhed them with Tongues to vtter the ſame: they are like young Schollers newly entred, that at firſt ſing very fearefully, it requires your Patience therefore to beare with their imperfections: they were taught to ſing onely to delight you, and if you ſhall take any pleaſure in them, they haue their end, and I my wiſh, a full recompence for my paſſed labours, and a greater encouragement to preſent you with ſome future things more worthy your Patronage: till which opportunity, I reſt

By which little outward demonſtration, you may eaſily gueſſe at the greatneſſe of my inward affection, as skilfull Geometricians doe obſerue the true ſtature of the whole body by ſight of the foote onely. Experience tels vs that Songs of this Nature are vſually eſteemed as they are well or ill performed, which excellent grace I am ſure your vnequalled loue vnto Muſicke will not ſuffer them to want, that the Author (whom you no leſſe loue) may be free from diſgrace. They were most of them compoſed in your owne houſe, and doe therefore properly belong vnto you, as Lord of the Soile; the language they ſpeake you prouided them, I onely furniſhed them with Tongues to vtter the ſame: they are like young Schollers newly entred, that at firſt ſing very fearefully, it requires your Patience therefore to beare with their imperfections: they were taught to ſing onely to delight you, and if you ſhall take any pleaſure in them, they haue their end, and I my wiſh, a full recompence for my paſſed labours, and a greater encouragement to preſent you with ſome future things more worthy your Patronage: till which opportunity, I reſt

By which little outward demonſtration, you may eaſily gueſſe at the greatneſſe of my inward affection, as skilfull Geometricians doe obſerue the true ſtature of the whole body by ſight of the foote onely. Experience tels vs that Songs of this Nature are vſually eſteemed as they are well or ill performed, which excellent grace I am ſure your vnequalled loue vnto Muſicke will not ſuffer them to want, that the Author (whom you no leſſe loue) may be free from diſgrace. They were most of them compoſed in your owne houſe, and doe therefore properly belong vnto you, as Lord of the Soile; the language they ſpeake you prouided them, I onely furniſhed them with Tongues to vtter the ſame: they are like young Schollers newly entred, that at firſt ſing very fearefully, it requires your Patience therefore to beare with their imperfections: they were taught to ſing onely to delight you, and if you ſhall take any pleaſure in them, they haue their end, and I my wiſh, a full recompence for my paſſed labours, and a greater encouragement to preſent you with ſome future things more worthy your Patronage: till which opportunity, I reſt
