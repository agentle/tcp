PATHWAY TO
PERFECTION.
            A Sermon preached at Saint Maryes
Spittle in London on VVednesday in
Easter weeke. 1593.
            By Thomas Playfere, Doctor of
Diuinitie.
            AT LONDON,
Printed by Iames Roberts for Andrew
VVise, dwelling in Paules Church-yard, at the
signe of the Angel. 1597.
         
         
            
            
            To the most noble and
vvorshipfull Knight, my
honourable good Patron, Sir
George Carey, Knight Marshall of her
Maiesties most honourable housholde, and
gouernour of her Ile of Wight, all
ioyes, externall, internall,
eternall.
            
               SIR, as soone as I had
preached this Sermon,
it pleased the L. Bishop
of London last deceased,
both by his letter,
and by word of mouth,
to request a copie of it for the presse. The
like did diuers other also. But in trueth I
had then no coppy of it. Or if I had beene
possessed of any, yet I was resolute to yeeld
to no such motion. VVhich some (I knowe
not who) vnderstanding, that being by so
many, and so many times importuned, to

print this, or some other Sermon, I alwaies
vtterly refused so to doe, haue presumed to
print the Meane in Mourning; altogether
without true iudgement, or calling me
to counsell therein. And that so falselie,
and in most places so quite contrary to my
meaning, that I may say to him, whosoeuer
was the procurer thereof, as Martiall the
Poet sayd to one,
            
               Quem recitas meus est, ô Fidentine, libellus:
               Sed male dum recitas, incipit esse tuus.
            
            
               O Fidentine, a booke of mine
               Thou printst against my will;
               And yet not mine, but it is thine
               Because thou printst it ill.
            
            VVhen in the triumph of Iulius Caesar,
the Romains had carried about the modell
of those Citties, which hee had subdued,
grauen in yuorie, and not long after in the
triumph of Fabius Maximus, they shewed

                  〈◊〉
                description of his Citties, carued in
woode: Chrysippus beholding the difference,
saide merrily, that Fabius citties
were but the sheathes of Caesars Citties.
And certes I may be bold to auerre, that as
much diuersitie as there is betweene yuorie

and woode: so much there is betweene that
Sermon which was first once preached, &
that which was afterward twise printed.
For those two editions were but woodden
sheathes. Or if there were any mettall in
them, yet it had not an yuorie but a dudgin
haft, beeing blunt and dull, without
any poynt or edge.
            Therefore after I was, not onely perswaded
by the aduise of all my friendes, but
euen enforced by the necessitie of the thing
it selfe, to print that Sermon as it was preached,
I thought good likewise to let this goe
with it. That as the grauer of images in
Aesop telleth Mercurie, if hee would giue
a groate for the image of Iupiter, hee
should haue his owne image for nothing:
so if any one who hath cast away his mony
vpon the former editions, will bestowe a
groate vpon the true copie now sette out by
my selfe, hee may haue this sermon with it
for nothing, in surplussage ouer and besides
the bargaine. VVhich if it shall please you
out of your true woorth fauourably to patronise
and protect, then all that reape anie
benefit by perusing it, shall haue good cause
to honour your most noble minde, by whose
munificence and bountie my studies haue
beene hetherto continued. And so crauing

your honourable acceptance of my faithfull
endeuours I humbly take my leaue.
From Saint Iohns Colledge in Cambridge
the first day of February. 1595.

            To the Reader.
            
               GEntle Reader, the sentences
are so framed, as thou
maist reade them, without
any regarde of the
marginal notes, as though
they were not sette downe
at all. Doe therefore heerein as thou shalt
thinke best. The quotations which are
marked without a parenthesis, as thus, a b
c, were all vttered when the Sermon was
preached. The rest, which are marked
with a parenthesis, as thus, (a) (b) (c),
were thought conuenient to bee printed,
though, not the quotations themselues, but
only the matter contained in thē was preached.

            THE
PATHVVAIE TO
Perfection.
            The Text.
            
               But one thing, I forget that
which is behinde, and endeuour
my selfe to that which
is before, and followe hard, towarde
the marke, for the
prize of the high calling of
God in Christ Iesus.

            RIght Honourable, right Worshipfull,
and most Christian
and blessed brethren; perfection
is all in all. The onely thing
in euery thing. But that which is vnperfect,
is like eyther the vntimely
birth of a woman, or else the vntimely
fruire of a tree. The one dying
before it be borne, the other rotting

before it be ripe. Therefore it is sayd
of the lawe,He. 7. v. 19 That it made nothing
perfect: but of the Gospell,Ih▪ 19. 13. that it
is most perfect in it selfe. And of the
tower of Babell,Lu. 14. 30. these men began
well to build, yet could not perfect it:
but of the frame of the world,Ge. 1. v. 1. thus
the heauen and the earth were perfectly
finished, yea so perfectly, that
euery thing since which hath had any
little resemblance of this perfection,
is sayd to be as perfect as God made
the world. Now of all things in the
world, man especially is borne, not
to dye, as an vntimely birth, but to
liue: and man liueth, not to rotte away
as vntimely fruite, but to flourish
for euer. Therefore we that doe
not dye vnder the law, but liue vnder
grace,Rom. 9. 14 must not be lyke the law, but
like the Gospell: and we which shall
not rotte away as the Tower of Babel,
but flourish for euer, as the building
of God,1. Cor. 3. 9 must not be lyke the tower
of Babell, but lyke the frame of the
world; labouring continually to be
perfect, as our heauenly Father is

perfect.Mar. 5. 48. Labour, I say, we must:
for as nothing is excellent, and easie
both together; in lyke sort perfection,
though it be so excellent a thing,
that it ought to be much desired, yet
it is not so easie a thing, that it can be
soone attayned. Therefore sayes the
Apostle in the former verse, I do not
thinke that I haue yet attayned to it.
For, sayes Bernard:Quomodo proficis si, i
                     •
                   tibi su
                     ••
                  icis? Howe canst
thou possibly be a proficient, if thou
thinke thy selfe already sufficient?
The arke of the couenant was but a
Cubit and a halfe high.Exo. 25. 10. i1. Ki. 7. 32 So likewise
the wheeles of the Cauldron were
but a Cubit and a halfe high. Nowe
we know that a Cubite and a halfe is
an vnperfect measure, which shewes
that none in this life are perfectly perfect.
The verie highest are, as the
Arke in Moyses tabernacle, or as the
wheeles in Salomons temple, but a
Cubite and a halfe high:
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . perfectly
vnperfect when they begin: vnperfectly
perfect when they end. Benaiah
was honourable among thirtie,
but he attained not to the first three:

               1. Sa. 3, 23. And so some one man may bee as
perfect as thirtie, yea, as a thousand
other men, and yet not attayne to
the perfection of the blessed Trinitie,
which is the first three. Nay
when we haue done the best we can,
we are but vnprofitable SeruantsLu. 17. 10..

So that the most perfect perfection
wee can attayne to in this lyfe, is an
humble acknowledging of that imperfection
which wee haueEst quaedā imperfecta perfectio, vt sciat homo se non esse perfectum in hac vita. Primaesius in Col. c. 1. in fine., and

as Salomon went vp sixe steps
to come to hys great throne of Iuory
Reg. 10. 19., so must wee ascend sixe degrees
to come to this high toppe of perfection.

The first (Not manie thinges)
But one thing. The second (I doe not
remember, but I Forget that which is
behinde. The third (I stand not still,
but) I endeuour my selfe to that which
is before. The fourth (I runne not
amisse, but) I followe hard, The fift
(Not beside the marke, but) Toward
the marke. The sixt, (Not for anie
other prize, but) For the prize of the
high calling of God in Christ Iesus.
            
            Touching the first, hee sayes (Not
manie things) But one thing. Gregorie
hath thys sentenceCum animus diuiditur ad multa fit minor ad singulae. The minde
of man is lyke the stone Tirrhenus.
That stone, so long as it is whole
swimmeth, but beeing once broken
sinketh. And so the heart of man

Ierusalem, 
                  •
               ignifying the vision of
peace which is one thing▪ but when
hee was carried to Riblah, signifying
a multitude which is manie thinges,
then were his eyes put out. VVhat

so neare one as two? And yet wee
must not goe so farre from one as
two, seeing it is a verie hard matter
and almost vnpossible, that one mind
should well heede two diuers things:
Vt res opposstas mens ferat vna duas. Cor. Gallus. Hercules himselfe could not cope
with two aduersaries at once. So that
Peter was vnwise to ware two swords
at once.Lu. 22. 3
                     •
                  
                Alexander sayed, the
whole world could not holde two
Sunnes at once. So that Issacar was
an Asse to beare two burthens at
once.Gen. 49 14. No man sitteth vpon two
seates together. No man hunteth
two games together. No man iustleth
with two Speares together. Hee that
hath two harts, if he haue a true hart
of the one, hee will haue a false hart
of the other. Therefore sayes Saint
Iames:Iam. 1, 8. A double hearted man is
vnconstant in all his wayes. He that
hath two tongues, if hee tell trueth
with the one, hee will lye with the other.
Therefore sayes Saint Paule:
1. Ti. 3, 8 Deacons must not be double tongued.
Hee that serues two Maisters,
if he please the one, he will displease

the other: therefore sayes our Sauiour:
Lu. 10, 13 No man can serue two Maysters.
Hee that walketh two wayes,
if hee goe well in the one, hee will
stumble in the other. Therfore saies
Ecclesiasticus:Eccl. 2, 13 Woe be to the sinner
which walketh two manner of
wayes. VVherefore we must not be
lyke the Philistines which had two
harts,1, Sa. 5. 2. one hart that cleaued to God,
another that cleaued to Dagon. Wee
must not bee lyke the Iewes which
had two tongues,Soph. 2, 1. one tongue that
sweared by the Lorde, another that
sweared by Malcham. VVee must
not bee lyke the Israelites which serued
two Maysters,1, Kin. 18. 12. they halted betwixt
two opynions seruing sometimes
God, sometimes Baal. VVee
must not be like Salomon which walked
two waies,1, Ki, 11, 5 his hart was not perfect
with God, but somtimes he walked
the way of the Lord, sometimes
the way of Ashteroth. We must not
doo so, I say; wee must not followe
God and Dagon; God & Malcham:
God and Baal: God and Ashteroth.

If wee would bee perfect indeede,
wee must followe (Not many things,
no not so much as two thinges) But
one thing.
            
            For this One thing, is the very band
of Perfection

                   grae, Affect. eur. 2.. Heere-vpon Christ
speaking to his Spouse, sayth thusCantica. 4, 9.,
Thou hast wounded my heart with
one of thine eyes, and with one chaine
of thy necke. The Church, I graunt,
hath manie eyes. But because as the
eyes of a mayden looke vnto the hand
of her mistressePsa. 123. 2.: so all these eyes
wayte onelie on the Lord, looke onelie
one way, and so (in a sort) make
onely one eye, therefore hee sayes,
with One of thine eyes. So likewise
the Church hath many chaynes. But
because these chaynes are so linked
and intorteled together, that they all
make (in a manner) but one golden
chayne of Christian vertues, which
is the band of Perfection, and bindeth
the Church to Christ, as the necke
ioyneth the bodie to the head, therefore
hee sayes, with One chayne of
the necke. This one eye it is, this one

chayne it is, which makes Christ in
loue with his Church, which ouercomes
him, and woundes his heart.
Thou hast wounded my heart, sayes
hee, with one of thine eyes, and with
one chayne of thy neck. The Spouse
of Christ must haue but One chayne
about her necke. The Disciple of
Christ must haue but One coate vppon
his backe.Luk. 9. 3. Hee must not be a
turne-coate, much lesse a change-coate.
Seeing indeed that which Cyprian
speakes of Christes coate, may
be as truly sayde of euery Christians
coate, That eyther it must be Vnica,
or else it cannot be Tunica, eyther it
must be One or none. For as Rebeccaes
two Twins did strugle and wrestle
before they were borne, for hatred
and malice, but Elizabeths one
childe did spring and skip before hee
was borne, for ioy and gladnes; so
hee that busies himselfe about more
thinges then one, shall neuer prooue
singular in anie thing,

shall finde that strife and resistance in
his head, which Rebecca did in her

wombe, but hee that labours and trauailes
onely about One thing, shall
bring it to good perfection, and be
as well deliuered of it, as Elizabeth
was of Iohn Baptist. Hence it is that
wee are exhorted, for our heart,Act. 4, 32. to
haue One heart and one soule, for our
tongue,1, Cor. 1, 10. to speake One and the selfe
same thing, for our Master,Mat. 13, 8. to serue
One Maister in heauen, for our way,
Phil. 3, 16 to walke after One and the selfe
same rule. According to that most
wise and worthy word
                  Cor vnū, via vna. My L. Treasurer his word. 
               One heart,
One way. VVhich is also agreeable
to the word of God, who sayeth, I
will giue them one hart, and one way,
that they may feare me for euer, for
the wealth of them and of their children
after them,Ie. 32, 39 Wherefore let
vs not haue many mindes, or trouble
our selues about many thinges, but
with Mary,He. 10, 41 mind onely One thing
which is necessarie: let vs not haue
many tongues, or desire many things,
but euery one of vs say with Dauid,
Psal. 1
                     •
                  , 1 
               One thing onely haue I desired of
the Lord: let vs not serue many Maisters,

or be many Maisters our selues,
but as Sophony speaketh,Soph. 3, 9. with One
shoulder serue the Lorde our God,
and onely worship him: let vs not
walk many waies, or kick against many
pricks,Act. 9, 5. or shoote at rouers (as I
may say) but with Saint Paule in this
place, ayme onely at one marke, and
follow But one thing. This is the first
degree to perfection.
            TOuching the second hee sayth, (I
doo not remember, but) I forget
that which is behind. Truth it is, we
may remember, both that wee haue
done ill, to amend it, and also that we
haue done well, to cōtinue it. For the
first Chrisostom saith,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . Nothing doeth
so well help vs forward in a good
course, as the often remembrance of
our sins. Whereas in the bitternes of
our soules wee call to remembrance
the dais of old, which we haue passed
away in sin. Wherupon the Psalmist
particularly intituleth the eight and
thirtith Psal. a Memorandum, or a Remembrance,

because he made it, whē
hee called to remembrance his sinnes,
which hee had in former time committedC
                     •••
                   commissa olim a se delicta memoriae repeteret. Euthymius. ibidem,
And generally Baruch sayeth
to vs in this sort. Remember well
what you haue done, and as it came
into your hearts to turne away from
God, so now striue with your selues
ten times more to turne agayne vnto
him n. Thus did Paule, remembring
he had once beene a persecutor,

                  . Bar. 4, 28. 1. Tim. 1. 13 he
did repent him of it, & made amends
for it, and was afterward tenne times
more zealous to saue the wicked, then
before hee had beene to destroy the
godly. For the second, an other sayeth,

they inwardly feele, which are delighted,
with the remembrance of vertue
past, with the fruition of ioy pesent:
with the expectation of felicitie to
come? This three-fold cord of comfort,
as it can neuer be broken, so it
must always be drawn forth at length,
that he which is iust may be stil more
iust, that hee which is strong may be
still more strongRe. 22, 11 Thus did Dauid,

               1. Sa. 17, 36. remembring hee had once slaine a
Beare, he did not repent him of it, but
gathered strength and courage by it,
& was afterward more bold to combat
with a mighty Gyant, than before
he had beene to deale with an eluish
Beare, Therefore as they which leap,
the further they goe backward to
fetch their run, the further they leap
forward, when they haue runne: so
heere we may looke back a little, and
remember both that we haue done ill,
to amend it, and also that wee haue
done well to continue it. Otherwise
the remembrance eyther of vices or
vertues, is so far from putting vs any
whit forward, that it casteth vs quite
backward. For as Marke the Eremite
witnesseth, The remembrance of former
sins is inough to cast him downe
altogether,
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . who otherwise might
haue had some good hope. Our sinnes
& Elies Sonnes are alike. Ely hearing
his Sonnes were slaine, whom he himselfe
had not chastised and corrected
as he ought, fell down backward and
brake his necke1. Sa. 4, 17. And so all they

that remember & hearken after their
former sins, which they should haue
mortified and kild, fall downe backward,
and turne away from God. For
this is the difference betweene the
godly and the wicked. Both fall: But
the godly fall forward vpon their faces,
as Abraham did wh
                  •
               n he talked
with God: the wicked fall backward
vppon the ground, as the Iewes did
when they apprehended Christ. He
that remembers his sinnes, to be sorie
for them, as Abraham did, falls forward
vppon his face: but hee that remembers
his sins, to reioyce in them,
as the Iewes did, fals backward vpon
the ground. VVherefore if thou be
vppon a mountaine, looke not backward
again vnto Sodom, as Lots wife
did:Gen. 19, 27. if thou be within the Arke,
flie not out againe into the world, as
Noahs Crow did:Gen. 8, 7 if thou be well
washed, returne not agayne to thy
mire as the Hog doth:2, Pet. 2, 22. if thou be
cleane purged, run not againe to thy
filth, as the Dog doth:Pr. 16. 11 If thou be
going towards the Land of Canaan,

remember not those vices which are
behind thee: no, nor those vertues neither.
For as Gregory writeth,Memoria virtutis forma mentis. De arcae pastorali. par. 4, ca. 1. The
remembrance of former vertues doth
many times so besot and inueigle a
man, that it makes him lyke a blinde
Asse fall downe into a ditch. When
Orpheus went to fetch his wife Euridice
out of hell, he had her granted to
him vpon condition, that hee should
not turne backe his eyes to looke vppon
her, till he had brought her into
heauen. Yet hauing brought her forward
a great way, at length his loue
was so excessiue, that hee could not
contain any longer, but would needs
haue a sight of her. VVhereupon
forthwith hee lost both her sight and
her selfe, shee sodainly againe vanishing
away from him.Flexit aman

fiction. Neuertheles it serueth very
fitly to this purpose. To admonish
vs, that if we haue anie vertue, which
is to be loued as a man is to loue hys
wife, yet we must not be so blind in
affection, as to doate too much vpon
it, or to fall in admiration of our selues
for it, or to be alwaies gazing & wondering
at it, lest by too much looking
vpon it, and by too well liking of it,
and by too often remembring it, wee
loose it. Because indeede he that remembers
his vertues, hath no vertues
to remember. Seeing he wants humility
which is the mother-vertue of all
vertues. For this is the difference between
the godly & the wicked. Both
remember vertues. But the godly remember
other mens vertues: the wicked
remember theyr owne vertues.
They remembring other mens vertues,
make thē ensamples to imitate:
these remembring theyr owne vertues,
make them miracles to wonder
at. Therefore the godly remembring
they haue some one or other little
vice in them, are humble, though

they haue very manie great vertues:
but the wicked remembring they
haue some one or other little vertue

man will take it, Forget it. Themistocles
said, he had rather learne the Art
of forgetfulnes, then of memory. That
is, as I vnderstand it, rather diuinity,
then philosophy. For philosophy is an
Art of memory, but diuinity is an Art
of forgetfulnes. Therfore the first lesson
that Socrates taught his Scholler
was, Remember
               Reminiscere.. For he thought that
knowledge is nothing els but a calling
of those things to remembrance
which the mind knew, before it knew
the body. But the first lesson that
Christ teacheth his Scholler is, Forget
               Obliuiscere..

The patriark Abraham was content

for Gods pleasure to sacrifice his Son
Isaac.Ge. 21, 16.. But as soone as he had done,
he Forgets it. Therfore God remembers
it, and sets downe euery seuerall
circumstance of it. By mine owne selfe
haue I sworn (saith the Lord) because
thou hast don this thing. There is the
general. But what thing? The particuler

louing and frindly intertainment. But
as soone as she had don she Forgets it.
Therfore Christ remembers it, and
amplifies it from point to point. He
turned to the woman and said to Simon,
Seest thou this woman? when I
came to thy house, thou gauest me no
water for my feet: but she hath washed
my feet with the teares of her eies,
and wiped thē with the haires of her

hath anointed my feet with ointment.
Lo yee how true it is which I said before,
that if wee remember our good
workes, then God will forget them;
but if we Forget them, then God will
remember them; yea & he wil reward
them when we haue forgotten them.
If we wage warre with GodLu. 14, 31, & think
to ouercome him with ten thousand
of our good deeds, then will he like a
puisant Prince, bring forth into the
field a huge army of our sins, twentie
thousand of our sins against vs, and
with twenty thousand of our sins will
easily ouerthrow ten thousand of our
good deedes, and so finally confound
vs. But if one the other side wee can
bee content to Forget all our good
workes; and to strowe our best garments,
and our most florishing branches
at Christs feeteMat. 21, 8; and to cast
downe our verie crownes before the
throane of the LambeReu. 4, 10, then he will
be a right Lambe indeed, hee will not
fight with vs, but hee will crowne vs
with honour & glory. Almighty God

appoynted his people not to sheare
the first borne of the sheepeDe. 15. 16. The
first borne of the sheepe are the best
of our good works. These we must
not sheare, nor lay naked and open to
the view and knowledge of all men,
but Forget them, and hide them vnder
the fleece of silence, and keepe
them secret to our selues. So Ioseph,
whom God did lead as a sheepePsa. 80, 2,
hauing a first borne, did not sheare
this first borne of the sheepe, but called
him Manasses, that is, Forgetfulnes
of those thinges which were behind,
when God had now answered
the desires of his hartEcl. 5, 19. The faithful
speaking to Christ say thus, wee will
make for thee borders of golde guilt

the fashion of the world. The fashion
of the world is to guild siluer with
gold, & to put the best side outward.
But the faithfull guild gold with siluer,
and put the best side inward. So
Moses hauing a glorius countenance,
did not set it out to the shew, but did
Forget it, and couered it with a vaileEx 34, 33.
               
Now, a glorious countenance couered
with a vaile, what is it else, but a
border of gold, guilt with siluer? But
we, we alas, for the most part, haue
such base mindes, that wee are scarce
worth the ground we goe vpon▪ We
doe not guild our borders of golde
with siluer; but wee sheare the first
borne of our sheepe. We do not cast
down our garments and our branches
and our crownes-before the throane
of the lamb, but we war against God
with tenne thousand of our good
works. Or rather indeed, which of vs
all can muster together so many good
works to fight for him? Nay, if wee
haue done one thing well, or one time
well, we think all is well▪ we need do
no more, we haue done good inough,
and oft inough. Yea, if others do not
commend vs also, we do so wonderfully
please our selues in it, that wee
are ready presently to prayse our
selues for it. But heere we may all of
vp learne true humilityHumilitas animi sublimitas christiani▪ Leo., which is
true magnanimity of S. Paul. Paul had
a most noble and most stately hart,

higher than the very poles of heauen
it selfe. All that euer he had done hetherto,
or could doo, he thinkes too
little, nay, he counts it nothing. He
was not a whit inferiour to the very
chiefest Apostles2, Cor. 12, 11., yet he Forgets
it. Hee laboured more than they all.
1, Cor. 15, 10. yet he
Forgets it. He spake with
tongues more than they all1 Cor. 14, 18., yet he
Forgets it. Hee had care of the churches
2, Cor. 11, 28., yet he Forgets it. He fought
with beasts at Ephesus1, Cor. 15, 32., yet he Forgets
it. He troad fathan, that vile beast
vnder his feeteRo. 16, 30., yet he Forgets it.
Hee spake wisedome among them
that are perfect1. Cor. 2, 6., yet he Forgets it.
Hee was rapt vp to paradise into the
third heauen, where he first learned
that among the Angels, which afterwards
hee taught amongst men1, Cor. 12, 4.,
yet he Forgets it, All this is nothing
with him.Quae retro sunt obliuisci et ad ea quae 
                     •
                  nte sunt Apostolum seq

                  i. Ep. 15. All this he Forgets, & saith,
I Forget that which is behind. This is
the second degree to perfection.
            TOuching the third, hee sayes, (I
stand not still) but I Endeuour

my selfe to that which is before. Saint
Bernard writing to one Haimericus
Chancelor of Rome, in his very first
salutation, wisheth him to forget
those things which are behind, and to
follow the Apostle to those thinges
which are before. Which no man can
doo, that either stands still, or is idle.
Wherefore Hermes saith generally,
Nothing in the whole world is altogether
idle
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

a time for euery thing else, but
for idlenes he hath allowed no time.
Moses Arke had rings; and barres
within the ringsEx. 24, 14., to signifie that it
was not made to stand still, but to be
remoued from place to place. Iacobs
ladder had slauesGe. 28, 12, vpon which hee
saw none standing still, but all either
ascending or else descending by it.
Ascend you likewise to the top of the
ladder, to heauen, and there you shal
heare one say, My Father doth now
worke, and I work also. Whereupon
Basil noteth, that king Dauid hauing
first said, Lord who shall dwell in thy
tabernacle, addes thenPsal. 15, 2. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ., Not he that

hath wrought righteousnes heeretofore,
but hee that doth now worke righteousnes,
euen as Christ sais, My father
doth now worke, and I worke also.
Descend you likewise to the foote of
the ladder to the earth, and there you
shall heare that figge tree accursed,
which did beare leaues and no fruite.
VVhereupon Theophylact noteth,
that Iohn Baptist hauing first sayde,
The axe is layde to the roote of the
tree, adds thenMat. 3, 11. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ., Not euery tree that
hath not brought forth good fruite
heretofore: but euery tree that doth not
now bring forth good fruite shall be cut
downe, euen as that fruitlesse fig tree
was cut downe, and cast into the fire.
Therefore we must so walke, as God
seeing our continuall fruitfulnes may
say of vs, I see men walking like trees
Mar. 8, 24. Men walke like trees, when as men
are neuer idle, but alwaies abounding
in the worke of the Lord1. Cor. 15. 58.. As the
tree of lyfe euerie moneth bringeth
forth twelue maner of fruitsReu. 22, 2. For
so Christ said to him whom he healed
Mar. 2, 10, Take vp thy bed, and walk. He sais

not, Take vp thy bed and stand still,
like a stone, but take vp thy bed, and
walke, like a tree. Otherwise to them
whom he found standing still, he said
in his wrath and in his sore displeasure,
why stand yee still all the day
idle? why are ye like Moab setled vpon
your leesIe. 48, 11., and not poured from
vessell to vessell? we must make account
to giue account for euery idle
word, wee speakeMat. 12, 36.. And much
more then for euery idle houre wee
spende. Hee hath called the time against
me, sayes IerusalemLam. 1, 15. So that
for the very time which we haue contemned,
we shall be condemned: and
for euery day which wee haue spent
idlely, wee shall be shent seuerelie.
The Istaelites were commaunded,
not once in a weeke, or once in a moneth,
but euery day to gather Manna,
except onely the Sabaoth dayEx. 16, 26.. To

come to the saboth of our euerlasting
rest in heauen, wee must neuer stand
still, but euery day bee doing somewhat.

should say, if thou wilt bee perfect,
then walke before me, and Endeuour

For the Apostle in the other part,
speaking of those thinges which are
behind, saith that he doth not onely
not beare them in body, But not so
much as beare them in mind. Heere

contrariwise, speaking of those things
which are before, hee sayth, that hee
doth not onely intende hys minde to
them, but also extend his very body
towards them. So that as they which
runne in a race, bend forward they
                  •
               
breasts, and stretch out their armes,
to shew that they haue a desire to run

which runne in this course of Christianity▪
must cast away euery thing that
presseth down, & sin which cleaueth

signifies) stretch our selues, to those
things which are before. And like as
Aeolus left all the other winds, which
might haue beene a trouble to hym
with his friend Vlisses, to be packt vp
in a male, & kept onely the westerne
wind for his owne vse, to bring him
home into his country: so we must reiect
all other things, which may be as

God, whereby we may Endeuour our

               elues to that which is before, and
stretch out our sailes, & so come safelie

or three dayes together, that she may
stretch out her selfe the better, and
spin her threed the finer: so we must

nonce, that wee may not any longer
weaue the spiders webEsa, 59, 5., but with
the silk worme spin a new thrid. The
spiders webb is vinculum, the silke
wormes thrid vehiculum. And like as
the viper perceauing her olde skin to
bee so stiffe that shee cannot easilie
stretch out her self in it, strips it quite
off: after the same sort we which are
by nature a generation of vipers,
must strip off our old skinColo. 3, 9., and perceauing
we cannot well do our Endeuour
               
& stirre our selues in the armor
of Saul, wee must with Dauid put it
of, and put on the armour of light.
When long warre had bin betweene
the two houses of Saul and Dauid, at
length the house of Saul waxed weaker
and weaker, & the house of Dauid
waxed stronger & stronger2. Sa. 3. 1.. In like
manner the spirit must alwaies Endeuour
it selfe to that which is before, &
neuer leaue fighting with the flesh,
till the house of Saul, who was a lim
of the deuill, that is, the flesh, waxe
weaker and weaker, and the house of
Dauid, who was a figure of Christ,
that is the spirit, waxe stronger and
stronger. Thus the Baptist being but
a child waxed stronger and stronger
in spirit. And yet speaking of Christ
and himselfe, he sayes thusIoh. 3. 30., He must
increase, I must decrease. But the
Baptist was borne of olde Elizabeth:
Christ vvas borne of young Marie.
Whereby wee see, that that which is
borne of the olde man, which is the
flesh, must daily decrease in vs, and
grow downeward: but that which is

borne of the new man, which is the
spirit, must daylie increase in vs, and
grow vpward. For so indeede Christ
in the beginning of the new world increased,
in wisdome for his mind, and
stature for his bodieLuk. 2, 52. To teach vs
that if wee be liuely members of the
same body, then we must in like sort
Endeuour our selues to that which is
before, and increase and multiplyCrescite et multiplicamini. Non solum ad corpus sed etiam ad animum refer

& grow vp into him who is the head,
till we all come to the measure of the
age of the fulnes of Christ. The holy
ghost also in the beginning of the
old world, was moued vpon the watersGen. 1, 2.
To teach vs that if we be inspired
& moued by the same spirit, then
we must in like sort be moued vpon
the waters, and passe apase ouer the
red sea of this world, that wee may
quickly come to the celestial Canaan,
which is the kingdome of God. We
pray indeede that the kingdome
of God may come. But the kingdome of
God commeth not by obseruation,

gaping for it

dyd runne from the doore of his

must we Endeuour to runne forward,

vnto, the comming of the day

possible) meete the Lorde in the ayre

wee would haue his kingdome come.
VVee pray also that the will of God
may bee done in earth as it is in heauen.

But the will of GOD will be
not done if wee will doo nothing.
Therefore as the Cherubins spread
out their winges on high, and couer
the mercy seateExo. 37. 9: So must we spread
out our wings, and stretch out, or Endeuour
our selues, and bee alwayes
prest and ready to flye, as it were, to
do the will of GodEz. 1. 11 Nō solum aquila, sed et bos, et leo, et homo volant., if wee would
haue his will done in the earth, as it
is in heauen. VVhen God at the
first had made a paradise vpon earth,
hee tooke the man, and put him into
it, to dresse it and keepe it
                  Gen. 2, 15 vt operatu
                     •
                   et custodiret illū. vulgata.. Adam
was not enioyned to bestow any bodily
labour in dressing it at that time.

For this was a part of his punishment
afterward. Neither yet had he neede
to keepe it from wild beasts. For all
these were then subiect and obedient
vnto him. So that he dressed and
kept it, by keping those graces which
God hath giuen him, yea and Endeuouring
hymselfe to encrease them
continuallyQuamuis paradisus operib. ruralibus nō egeret tamen quia primus homo lex posteritatis futurus erat, legitimi etiam in paradiso spetiem suscepit laboris. Ambro. de Parad. c. 4.. Therfore the Apostle
beseecheth vs also, that wee receaue
not the grace of God in vaine, but
that in all thinges wee approue our
selues, as the seruants of God, in much
patience, in afflictions, in necessities,
in distresses, and so forth2. Cor, 6. 1 See yee,
how many posts & props he putteth
vnder vs, that we may be stayed vp
and confirmed in the grace of God.
How many tooles, as it were, & implements
he giueth vs, that we may not
receaue the graces of God in vaine,
but that as they are receaued & kept
in vs, so they may be daylie dressed
and bettered by vs. For, as Saint Peter
witnesseth2. Pet. 1. 
                     •
                  ., if these things be and
abound, we shall neither be idle nor
vnfruitfull in the knowledg of Christ.

Wherevpon O
                  •
               cumenius obserueth,
that the graces of God, as the flowers
of a garden, must not onely be kept,
but also bee dressed, that they may
haue, not onely a beeing, but also an
abounding
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  .. Because a man may haue
great good things being in him, and
yet be himselfe like a garden that is
kept indeed, but not dressed, altogether
idle and vnfruitfull. But if they
be both being and abounding in him,
if hee Endeuour himselfe to goe on
further euery day then other, then
surely he is neither idle nor vnfruitful
in the knowledge of Christ. Hereupon

Sit not still, but fit vp higher. So the

Thus much cōcerning this part,
beeing the thirde degree to perfection.
            TOuching the fourth, hee sayth,
(I runne not amisse, but I followe
hard. A man may runne amisse, otherwise
then he shoulde, by running
eyther too slowly or too fast.
            
            Nowe for ouer-much slownesse,
Rusticus Diaconus sayethTurpe est contra ardenter peruersa asserentes, nos pro veritate frigidiores inueniri. li. aduersus Acephalos., It is a

starke shame for vs to bee colde in
maintayning a truth, seeing our aduersaries
are so hot in defending a
falshoode. VVhen the aduersarie
had sowne tares among the good
corne, the Mayster sayde to his Seruaunts,
Let both growe together.
Hee sayeth not, Let the tares growe,
and the good corne not growe, but,
Let both growe together. If the
tares growe so fast for the fire, then
let the good corne growe as fast for
the barne. If the wicked runne so
fast to damnation, then let the godlie
runne as fast to saluation. Yet
the Prophets haue euer complayned,
that the children of thys worlde
are much more forwarde in theyr
kinde, then the Children of light.
Dauid speaking of the Children of
thys worlde, sayth, They encourage
them-selues in an ill purpose. But
Esay speaking of the Children of
light, saythEsa. 59, 4., No man calleth for
iustice, no man contendeth for the
truth. VVhen the time drew neere
that our Sauiour should bee taken

and carried away to be crucified, onely
Iudas that vile traytor was vigilant
and watchfull to bring his mischieuous
purpose to passe, but all the other
disciples were fast a sleepe. Therfore
as Ierusalem sayde of her eyeLa. 3. 51..
Mine eye hath spoiled my soule: So
might these drousy disciples haue said
of their eye, Our eie hath spoiled our
soule. And as the Centurion said of
his seruantMat. 8. 6., My seruāt lieth at home
sick of the palsey and is ill troubled:
So might Christ haue said of these his
sleepie disciples, My disciples lye at
home sicke of the palsey, and are ill
troubled. Wel said, ill troubled. For
he that is diligent to discharge his duty,
and takes paines in his calling as
he ought, is well troubledBene torquetur.. But he
that hath the palsey and is dissolute
and negligent, and lies at home sicke
of the lazie disease, is ill troubledMale torquetur.. Ill
troubled, with an euill spyrite, with
the spirit of slumber, which, as Iob
testifiesIob. 40. 16. lyeth in the couert of the
reedes. They that are lazie and lither
fellowes, and haue nothing in them,

are heere called reedes, in whom the
deuill himselfe lyeth and sleepeth securely.
But though he be well quieted
in them, yet (as I said before) they
are ill troubled with him. Ill troubled
with him, as those seauenty Kings
were ill troubled with Adonibezec,
when hee did cut off the thumbs of
their hands and feet. For he that hath
the thumbs of his hands cut off, may
perhaps do something, but hee is so
long about a little that he were better
sit still & do nothing, then be so long
pidling about nothing. So hee that
hath the thumbs of his feete cut off,
may peraduenture goe forwarde, but
it isTestudineus gradus. Plaut. such a snayles pace which hee
goes, that he were better stand still &
not go at all forward, then go so slowlie
forward. Wherefore we must not
goe so slowly forward, as though the
thumbs of our hands and feete were
cut off, but rather we must runne as
fast as it is to be supposed that mightie
man could2. Sam. 21. 20., vvhich had vppon
euery hand sixe fingers, and vppon
euerie foote sixe toes. But yet sayes

BernardEt feruor discretionem erigat, et discretio feruorem dirigat., As zeale must erect our
discretion, that we runne not too slowly,
so discretion must direct our zeale,
that we runne not too fast. That wise
woman, by whome is meant the
Church of Christ, laboureth with
the counsell of her handesConsilio manuum. Pr. 31, 13.. Her
handes are full of eyesOculatae manus. Plautus.. Shee hath
more fore-sight and wisedome euen
in her little finger, then many a man
hath in his whole head. Shee laboureth
with her handes. There is zeale.
Shee laboureth with the counsell of
her hands. There is discretion as well
as zeale. In Leuiticus they are forbidden
to bring anie blinde offering
to GODLe. 22. 22.. All zeale without
discretion, is an offering without an
eye. All blind zeale, is a blind offering.
Which God wil neuer accept. So
that as Minerua is saide to put a golden
bridle vppon Pegasus, that hee
should not flye too fast: in lyke sort
our Minerua, that is our Christian
discretion, must put a golden bridle
vppon Pegasus, that is our earnest
zealeIames. 3. 3, least if our zeale bee vnbrideled,

it make vs followe too fast.
Therefore Octauian the Emperour
did beare in his Eschocheon, a Crabfish
and a Butterflie, with this mot,
Festina lente. Softe pace, goes farre. A Crabfish
creepes. Thats softe pace. A Butterflie
flies. That goes farre. A Crabfish,
a Butterflie, Softe pace, goes
farre. And Vespasian the Emperour
did stampe in his coyne a Dolphin
and an anchor, with this impresaSat cito, si sat bene.,
Soone inough, if well inough.
A Dolphin out-strips the ship. Thats
soone inough. An anchor stayes the
shippe. Thats well inough. A Dolphin,
an Anchor, Soone inough,
if well inough. For as if the lower
spheares in the heauen should not
bee stayed with the contrarie course
of the highest spheare in the firmament,
they would soone sette the
whole world on a light fire: So the
inferiour affections of the minde, if
they be not staied with the contrary
course of reason, and with the milde
motion of the spirit of God, they will
soone ouer-heat thee, and ouerthrow

all thou goest about. Therfore Chilo
giueth vs this precept, not to ouer-heat
Iacobs sheepe by driuing them
too fastGe. 33. 13., not to make ouer much hast
in the way. According to that in the
Prophet Esay, where it is saidQui crediderit non festinabit. c. 28 v. 16., Hee
which beleeueth shall not make hast.
The string of an Instrument may be
as wel too high as too low. If it be too
lowe it iarres, if it bee too high it
breaks. So the mind of man may be as
wel too intent, as too remisse. If it be
too remis, it runs too slowly: if it be
too intent, it runs too fast. Wherfore
Clemens giueth vs this precept, that
we should not be strained and wrested
too high, but set and tuned arightNon

            For the way of the righteousPro. 4, 18., it
glittereth as the light, which shyneth
more and more vnto the perfect day.
It glittereth as the Sun, which commeth

forth as a bridegroome out of
his chamber, and reioyceth as a giant,
to run his course. Indeed the wicked
are like a wheele. O my God make
them like a wheele, sayes DauidPsa. 82. 13. A
wheele tilts vp behind, and shootes
downe before. So the wicked are forward
to all badnes, and backward to
all goodnes. But the godly are like a
Panther. A Panther hath foure claws
and no more, on each hind foot, but
fiue clawes, and no lesse on each fore
foote. So the godly, though they bee
weake to the worldward, yet they are
strong to Godward. And setting the
better foote before (as wee say) they
Follow hard and run with might and
maine most violently to lay holde on
that hope which is set before them

For there are two sortes of violent
men. Of the first sorte the Apostle
sayes, b. No extortioners or violeent
men shal inherit the kingdom of heauen.
Of the second sort our sauior saies
Ma. 11. 12, The kingdome of heauen suffereth
violence and violent men lay hold on
it. Both are violent men: but both are

not violent to men. For they offer
violence to men: these offer violence
to God. Therefore they doe not enter:
but these do enter into the kingdome
of heauen. For though God
be not content that wee should offer
violence to men, yet he is well content
that wee should offer violence
to himselfeBona violentia qua acquiritur regnum Dei. Vis intrare in regnum celorum? Esto violentus et improbus Em Dominica. 3. Aduent.

me so to speake) and by the force of
faith spoile him▪ and rob him of al his
eternal treasuresMore latronum suis eum spol

his church he saythCan. 2, 13., Arise my loue,
my faire one, make hast and come away.
He that doth make account to
come to GOD, must make hast to
come to God. He must vse violence,
and Follow harde, and come downe
quickly with Zacheus, and for speedines
he must be like a Doe or a Roe
vpon the mountaines of Bether. Euen
as those beastes in EzechielEzec. 1. 14 did run
& returne as lightning: So must euery
one who is enlightned with the spirit
of God Followe as swiftlie as lightning,

which doth no soner flash down
from heauen to the earth, thē he must
in affection mount vp from the earth
to heauen. And like as the Isralites
were commanded to eate the passe ouer
in hastEx. 12. 11.: Semblably all we which
are true Isralites must girde vp the
loines of our minds, and Follow hard,
and run a pace, & redeeme the time,
that both the wrath of God may pas
ouer vs, and also the mercy of God
may abide with vs. For God among
other arguments of his mercy sayes
thusIob. 39. 16, Who hath giuen wings to the
Ostridg? The Ostridg neuer flies with
his wings but onely a little lifts vp his
body with them when he runs. And in
ye pinion of each wing he hath a sharp
spur, wherewith he pricketh his own
self, that he may run the faster. So that
God hath giuē wings vnto ye Ostridg
not for the Ostridge, but for vs. That
we might thereby learne, howe wee
ought by all good meanes to quicken
our dull disposition, that wee may
Followe harde, euen as wee see the
Ostridge eggeth his owne selfe forward

with the flapping of his wings.
For they that wayte vpopn the Lord
shall change their strength, they shall
lift vp their winges, (not onely as the
Ostridge, but also) as the Eagle: they
shall (I say) lift vp their wings as the
EagleEsa. 40, 31, they shal run and not be faint,
they shall walke and not bee weary.
Euen as Pindarus writeth that King
Therons coursers were such as wold
neuer be wery of going l: so shal these
Follow still, and neuer be weary of
well doing. But the most especiall
thing to be considered heere is this,
that the Prophet sayes, They which
waight vpon the Lord, shall change
their strengthMutabunt fortitudinem. Hee sayes not, they
shall loose their strength, that whereas
before they were strong, now they
shall be weake: but they shall change
their strength (namelie, the vse of
their strength) that whereas before
they were strong, and did follow hard,
to serue sinne, nowe they shall be as
strong, & shall Follow as hard, to serue
God.Ro. 6. 19. For God only it is which can
melt brasse out of a stoneIob. 28. 2.. I wot wel

there is a stone called Almacrasia,
which being molten becometh brasse.
But these words haue a far more hidden
meaning. To wit, that God doth
melt brasse out of a stone, when he
taketh the hart of a sinner which is as
hard as a stone, and melting it with
the holy Ghost, and with fire, dooth
afterward make it as tough as brasse.
This was seene in the conuersion of
Paul. For when Paul was made an
Apostle, thē a stone was made brasse.
He was as hard as any stone, before
his conuersion, when he stoned StephenAct. 7, 58.
Hee was as tough as any
brasse after his conuersion, when he
did Follow so hard, that no affliction
could seperate him from the loue of
ChristRo. 8, 35. Which thing was prophecied
of long beforeGe. 49, 27. When the Patriarch
Iacob sayd, Beniamin shall be
as a rauening Wolfe; in the morning
he shall deuoure the pray: in the euening
he shall deuide the spoile. Paul
was this Beniamin, because he was of
the tribe of BeniaminPhil. 3. 5.. Paul was
this rauening wolfe, because he breathed

out threatning and slaughter against
the Disciples, and was euen
mad vpon them as a rauening WolfeActs 9, 5..
Paule in the morning deuoured
the pray, because in the beginning
of his dayes he wasted and deuoured
the Church of God as a prayGal. 1, 13. Paul
in the euening deuided the spoile, because
in the latter ende of his dayes,
he did Follow his calling hard, and deuided
the word of God aright2, Tim. 2, 15., of
which the Psalmist saies, I reioyce in
thy word, more then they which
haue found a great spoile. So that this
is no losse of strength, but onely a
change of strength. O blessed Beniamin!
O holy Apostle! Thou hast
now changed thy strength. Yea by
changing it thou hast much increased
it. For thou wert nothing so strong
before, as thou art now. Nothing so
strong before, being a ston, as thou art
now, being brasse. Nothing so strong
before, being a rauening wolf, as thou
art now, beeing a meeke lambe. Nothing
so strong before, in the morning,
as thou art now, in the euening.

Nothing so strong before, when thou
diddest deuoure the pray, as thou art
nowe, when thou doest deuide the
spoyle▪ When no impediments, no
stumbling-blocks can stay thee, but
thou wilt needes Follow hard, and
runne ouer the whole world, to deuide
the spoyle among all Nations,
to preach the Gospell vnto all people.
So likewise Baruch was inflamed,
as the Hebrew word signifieth

                  Hekeriah. Nehemi. 3, 20., hee was (I say) inflamed, to fortifie
the wall of Ierusalem. In mans bodie
the arteries running along the
veines, and beating vpon them, stir
vp the blood, and keepe it warme,
least otherwise by standing still, it
should congeale and waxe colde
                  Vide Theodor. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      lib. 1..
After the same manner in Baruch his
heart, there were liuely and quicke
motions of the holy Ghost, which
did blowe coales, and stirre vp the
gift of GOD in him2, Tim. 1, 6., which did
warme hys blood, and make hym
Followe the matter harde, beeing
wholly inflamed with a burning desire,
to see the Cittie of GOD

restored againe to her former glory.
So Abraham when the Angels came
to himGen. 18, 7., made hast to runne to his
tent: & his wife made hast to kneade
three measures of fine meale; and his
boy made hast to kill & dresse a good
and tender calfe. Loe yee how all are
imployed in a godly mans house. Abraham
and his wife, man & woman;
Abraham and his boy, old and yong;
all make hast, and Follow hard. So
Dauid did runne the way of Gods
commaundements. Nay, no ordinary
pace would serue him, but hee must
needs daunce before the Arke. Yea,
his feete could not hold him, but hee
must needs haue wings as a Doue. O
that I had wings as a Doue (sayes he)
then would I flye and be at restPs. 55, 6.
Hee wisheth for winges, not that he
might first be at rest, and afterward
flye, but that he might first flye, and
afterward be at rest. That he might
first Follow hard, and flye vp with the
wings of faith, into the heauenly paradice,
and afterward be at rest, and
settle there, in the tree of eternall life.

O that I had wings, that I had wings,
as a Doue (saies he) then would I flie,
would I flie, and be at rest. And so
must we after the example of Dauid,
of Abraham, of Baruch, of Paul, fight
for the faith which we haue receaued
Iude, 1, 3: & striue to enter in at the straight
gateLu. 13, 24.: and labour for the meate
which perisheth notIh. 6, 27.: and study
to enter into restHe. 4. 11. We must▪ I say,
studie: and labour; and striue; and
fight; and Followe hard. This is the
fourth degree to perfection.
            TOuching the fift he sayes (not beside
the marke, but) Toward the
marke. Austine holdeth, that a man
were better run, either too slowly, or
too fast in the way, then follow hard
out of the way. For the harder thou
followest out of the way, the further
thou runnest from the Marke. Herevpon
the Apostle, after following
hard, addeth immediatly▪ Toward the
Marke. Insinuating thereby, that to
follow is nothing, but the Marke is
the matter. And consequently that

he which is not a skilfull Mark-man,
can neuer bee a faythfull follower.
Therfore we must marke well, what
this Marke is. In one word it is the
crosse of Christ

that the eternall word, is the preached
word, meaning thereby that the only
way, to the begotten word, is the
written word. According to that of
the PsalmistPs. 119, 1, Blessed are they
which are vpright in the way, and
walk in the law of the Lord. So that if
thou wouldest be vpright in the way,
which is the word Christ, then thou
must walke in the lawe of the Lord,

holy scripture is giuen by the inspiration
of God, to be a lanterne vnto our

nothing. As if hee should say, If you
goe backward againe to the circumcision

to weare such a faire cognisance of

Theseus beeing guided by Ariadnes

may be safe, and goe in, and out, and

after this sort, is not to goe forward
& backward, but to go only forward.
Seeing, whether we goe in by remembrance
of Christs mercies, or goe

out by consideration of our own miseries,
whether we goe in by faith, or
goe out by good works, whether we
goe in by life, or goe out by death, alwayes
we finde pasture, that is heauenly
comfort in Christ, alwayes we
goe forward, alwayes wee follow toward
the Marke. Now for Humorists,
S. Paul aduiseth vs to put on the armour
of righteousnes, on the right
hand, and on the left2, Cor. 6. 7. Marcus Caelius
was said to haue a good right hand,
but an ill left hand, because he could
plead, against a man better, then for
him. But here it is contrary. For these
are armed well enough on the left
hand, but they lye open to the deuill
on the right hand. Who like a cunning
fencer doth strike a great deal

amisse to consider, what ought to be the
chiefest end of all our actions, and what
is the greatest felicity that man may attayne
by following hard towarde the
marke, which the Apostle here calleth,
The prize of the high calling of God in
Christ Iesus. Varro reporteth, that the
auntient Philosophers haue held and
maintayned, two hundred threescore
and eight seuerall opinions, concerning
felicityLibro de philosophia apud August. de ciuit

and Rome, and all the braue and
gallant wits in the world, could neuer
attaine to the true knowledge of perfect
blessednes. For following so many, they
could neuer finde any, but vanishing away
in their owne smokie conceites,
when they thought themselues wise
men they prooued in the end to be very
foolesRo. 1, 22. Seeing this is the greatest
folly that can be, and a miserie of all miseries,
for a man but once to dreame of
so diuers and so contrary felicities. I will
touch but a few of them at this time.
And that very briefely. Some therefore

define perfect happines, to be an action
of the minde, according to vertue, in a
perfect life. But by this perfect lyfe, they
vnderstand this present life. VVhereas
the Apostle auoucheth, that the Seruants
of God haue their fruit in righteousnes,
and theyr end euerlasting lyfeRo, 6, 22..
Therefore as euerlasting death is the
greatest miserie, so euerlasting life is the
greatest felicity. VVhich iuerlasting life
being the perfect life, is not this present
life, nor in this present life, but the life to
come, & in the life to come. This is, and
then is, euerlasting life. Others esteeme

we that are Christians see, and ought to
see our calling better then they. Howe
that not many vvise men according to
the flesh, not many mighty, not manie
noble, are called. But that we must aswel
by dishonour2 Cor. 6. 8, as by honour enter into
eternall glory. Some others imagin that
carnall pleasure is perfect happines. But
what saith the Apostle? Meates for the
belly, and the belly for meats, but God will
destroy both it and them
               1, Cor, 6, 13.. Meates for the
belly. That is true, we doe eate to lyue.
And the belly for meates. That is false,
VVee doe not lyue, to eate. Therfore
GOD will destroy both it and them. Both
the belly, & the meates of all Epicures.
Because they thinke their belly is made
for meatesMachometus credidit beatitudinem consistere in cibo, potu, & delectationibus corporalibus. Ioh. Galensis Anglus. l. de orig. Mach. cap. 5., whereas indeede onely

is not meate or drinke (or any carnall
pleasure) but righteousnes and peace, &
ioy in the holy Ghost.
            
            
               
Others account transitory riches to be
perfect happines. And certainly, if wee
vse our riches well, as diuers worthy Citizens
of this Citty haue done, to the
maintenance of learning, to the building
of Hospitals, & to such other good purposes,
then riches (I graunt) are a great
helpe to a vertuous mind, and a speciall
furtherance to felicity. Otherwise that
complaint of Saluianus may take place
euen in those our timesTanta est miseria huius temporis, vt nullus habeatur magis faelix quam qui est plurimum diues. De guber. lib. 3.. Our times

a man is esteemed according to
his money, whereas rather the money
should bee esteemed according to the
man. Euery one is reputed worthy if he
be wealthy, and naught if he be needy,
whereas rather euery one should be reputed
wealthy if he be worthy, and needie
if hee be naught. For questionlesse
riches of themselues doe encumber and
entangle the mind, euen as an Ape is tied
and teddered to his clogge. VVe reade
according to the Greek translation, that
Abraham was very rich. But there is a

Latine translation, which saith, that Abraham
was very heauy. And the originall

heauie burthen, and doe many times
hinder them very much, which would
attaine to blessednes. Yea if thou set thy
heart vpon them, they will likewise set
themselues vpon thy hart, and lie so heauily
vpon thy hart, that they will presse,
and way thee downe with thy hart into
hell. Therfore diuers holy men and women
heretofore haue voluntarily abandoned
their wealth, and preferred pouerty
before it, that they might the sooner
& the easier come to perfection. For

VVherefore we must follow hard
toward the mark (not for any action in
this life, but) for euerlasting life▪
                (not for
any worldly honour, but) for eternall glorie:
(not for any carnall pleasure, but)

for ioy in the holy Ghost: (not for anie
transitory treasure, but) for the kingdom
of heauen: (not for any other prize, but)
For the prize of the high calling of God in
Christ Iesus.
            
            This euerlasting life, is the onely perfect
life, because it is the prize: this eternall
glory is the onely high honour, because
it is of the high calling: this ioy in
the holy Ghost is the onely godly pleasure,
because it is of God: this kingdome
of heauen, is the onely Christian treasure,
because it is in Christ Iesus. This (I
say) this euerlasting life, is the onely perfect
life, because it is the prize. VVhich
maketh the Marchant-venturer, that
gets it, most absolutely blessed. As the
Psalmist, saythPsa. 127, 1, speaking of another,
Blessed art thou, that fearest God, and
walkest in his waies. For thou shalt eate
the labour of thy hands. O well art thou,
and happy shalt thou be! O well art thou!
For thou hast feared God, and walked
in his waies, for thou hast followed hard,
toward the marke. And happy shalt thou
be! for thou shalt eate the labour of thy
hands; for thou shalt haue, by the gracious
gift of God, euerlasting life, the
onely perfect life, The prize of the high

calling of GOD in Christ Iesus. As the
Apostle sayth2, Ti. 4. 8. Rom. 6, 22., speaking of himselfe,
I haue finished my course, I haue kept
the fayth. There is hence-forth layde
vp for mee the crowne of righteousnesse.
O well art thou, aud happie shalt
thou bee! O well art thou! For thou
hast finished thy course, and kept the
fayth; for thou hast followed hard,
towarde the marke. And happie shalt
thou bee! for there is hence-forth layde
vp for thee, the crowne of righteousnesse;
for there is hence-forth layde
vp for thee euerlasting life, the onelie
perfect lyfe. The prize of the high calling
of GOD in Christ Iesus. Thys eternall
glorie is the onely high honour, because
it is of the high calling. For all of
the visible Church, haue a calling. Seeing
the Church is nothing else, but the
companie of them which are called

prayeth for the dispiersed Iewesa 1. Pe. 1, 10, That
the God of all grace, which hath called
them to his eternall glory, would make
them perfect, confirme, strengthen,

and establish them therein. And S. Paul
likewise prayeth for the Thessalonians
2. Thes. 1 11., That God would make them worthy
of his calling (to eternull glory) and perfect
al the good pleasure of his goodnes,
and the work of faith in them. VVhereby
wee see that they are the onely worthies
of the world, which are so happy,
as to haue this high honour, and dignity

seeling of the temple. VVhere were grauen
palme-trees and chaynes2, Chr. 3, 5. The
palme-tree is high, the chayne is calling.
The palme-tree chayne, the high calling.
For God the Father by his effectuall
calling, as by a strong chayneIoh. 6. 44.,
doth draw his children to Christ. And
then standing before the Lambe, they
hold palmes in their handsReue. 7, 9., which are
the ensignes of their honour. So that being
drawne vp to the high palme-tree
by the calling chayne, they are made
partakers of eternall glory, the only high
honour, The prize of the high calling of
God in Christ Iesus. This ioy in the holie
Ghost is the only godly pleasure, because
it is of God. Indeede sometimes euen in
this life we haue a tastCan. 8, 2

Grapes and other pleasures of Canaan

the East gate, the most illuminate and
highest power & part of it, continuallie

shut against all men, yea against all the
world, and opened onely to one thing,
I meane to God, who hath already entred
into it, and enlightened it with his
spirit. That as at the window of Noahs
Arke, there entred in, no mist, no water,
nothing else but one thing onely, which
is lightGen. 6, 16 Fenestra dicitur Zohar, quia non aliud quam me ridia
                        •

               ▪ so at this East gate, no mist
of humaine errors, no water of worldly
cares may enter in; but onely the light
of heauen, and a sanctified desire, to be
fast knit, and perfectly vnited, by faith
and loue to God. Hence it is that Moses,
comming to talke with God vpon
the mountaine, was commaunded to
bring no man with him, but to come vp
himselfe aloneEx. 24, 18.. Nay more-ouer being
vpon the mountaine alone, he was couered
and compassed about with a thick
cloude, which made him feare the name
of the Lord, and hooded him, as I may
say, in such sort, that hee could see nothing,
but one thing, which was God.
And therefore the Psalmist sayth, O
make my heart like Moses heart, when
he was vpon the mountaine: O make
my heart like the windowe of Noahs
Arke, and the East gate of the temple:
O make my heart but onely one heart,

one in it selfe & one in thee: O knit my
heart vnto thee, that I may feare thy
name. Tell me, wherefore sayes Christ
Can. 7, 4, speaking to his spouse, Thy nose is
like the tower of Lebanon, but onley to
teach vs, that I forget that which is behind,
is the second degree to perfection?
For seeing Christ is nowe risen againe,
and ascended vp into heauen, which is
the high tower of Lebanon, therefore
wee which are the Saints of God, must
not bee like the Idols of the heathen,
which haue noses and smell not, but we
must haue noses like the tower of Lebanon

shall see all the inuincible hoast of Angels,
of Archangels, of Principalities, of
Dominations, reuerently attending vpon
the king of glory. VVee shall see the
king himselfe Christ Iesus, disparkling
& displaying those beames of beautie,

which are the heauens vvonder, and all
the Angels blisse. If there were no we amongst
vs one as faire as euer Absolon
was▪ who would not be glad to beholde
him? But suppose some one were tenne
times as fayre as Absolon, howe then
would men looke & gaze vpon him? I
but if another vvere a hundred times as
faire as Absolon, what a matter of admiration
wold that make? Put the case
then some one should now step forth &
sh
                  •
               we himselfe a thousande times fayrer
then euer Absolon was, vvhat wondering,
what maruailing would there be amongst
vs? howe would our eyes bee
dazeled, how would our very mindes be
amazed at this sight? VVel, al this is but
a counterfeit, but a shadow, in respect of
the bright-blazing beautie of our spirituall
spouse. For Christ Iesus is ten times
fairer, yea a hundred times fayrer, yea a
thousand times fayrer, yea ten hundred
thousand times fayrer, then all the children
of men. So that if the whole beautie
not onely of all men, but euen of all
this inferiour Globe, were put together
in one, yet it would not be any way cō
               parable
not onely to Christs glorie, but
not so much as to the least glorified bodie

in heauen. And yet all this is but the
outside of heauen▪ all thys wee shall see
with our bodily eye. The inside and the
insight is much more glorious. For the
least glorified body seeing innumerable
Saints and Angels more highly exalted
then he is, hath his ioy doubled, & trebled,
& beyond all measure multiplied,
when he cōsidereth, that he is loued vnspeakably
more, by all of them, yea by
euery one of them, then hee can be by
himselfe. And therefore againe seeing
himselfe so deere vnto them, hee for his
parte likewise as a hote burning coale is
set on fire and inflamed with loue, and
the more he seeth any other excell him
in glory, the more doth he reioyce, and
is gladder of his glory, then his owne.
But now when hee lifteth vp his eyes to
the glorious Trinitie, and seeth how the
Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost,
doe eternally and perfectly loue and like
and enioye one another in surpassing
sweetnes and content, then all his affections
are swallowed vp in loue, all his
spirits are rauisht in delight, all his desires
are imparadized in pleasure. In so
much as if on the one side were layd the
loue of Christ as he is man, and of all the

Saints and Angels among themselues,
and on the other side, the loue which the
least glorified body in heauen beholding
the blessed Trinitie breatheth out
to GOD, this loue would without all
comparison excell & exceed that as far,
as light doth darknes, or as heauen doth
the earth. VVherefore for man to see
God; for Iacob to be called Israel; for
him that hath bin a seruant, to becom a
sonne; for him that hath kept the lawe,
to enioy the testament; is the highest
degree to perfection, yea it is the very
perfection of perfection it selfe; The
onely perfect life; the onely hye honor;
the onely godly pleasure; the only christian
treasure. The prize: of the high calling:
of God; in Christ Iesus. Seeing then,
blessed brethren, seeing wee fight not as
they that beate the ayre1, Cor. 9 26., but our rewarde
is so great, so exceeding great in
heauenMat. 5,, therefore as Iacob wrastled

called IsraelGe. 32, 24 so let vs wrastle all the
night long of this lifeMar. 13. 35., & neuer giue

I will not let thee goe, except thou
blesse meGen. 32, 26.
               ▪ euen so let euerie true
Israelite say to Christ, I tooke hold of
him, and left him notCan. 3, 4.. O Lord Iesus,
who would leaue thee? or who
would let thee goe? or rather who
would not hold thee fast? which strengthenest
him that holdeth thee fast, and
makest him perseuere, that is strengthened,
and crownest him that perseuereth,
and makest him perfect that is
crowned. Therefore I will hold thee
fast, and will not let thee goe, except
thou blesse me, that is indeede, I will
neuer let thee goe, because thou doest
neuer blesse but onely those that alwayes
hold thee fast. Holde fast then,

I say. Hold fast that which you
