For ſayinge of maſſe as I ſuppoſe.
            
               WHo ſo liſt beare of a wonderous chaunce
               Of late I mette with one did me tell
               The craftieſt prieſt in England or Fraunce
               Hath loſt his noſe, and how ſhould he ſmell
               He went to his freinde his mynde to diſcloſe
               And as he came home one cut of his noſe.
            
            
               It is a gentleman, a prieſt he tolde me
               To tell you his name I do not much paſſe
               It is olde ſyr Iohn the vycar of Lee
               which rayles at gods boke & reeles at his maſſe
               His cankarde mynde he cannot kepe cloſe
               yet he ſerued him ſhrewdly that cut of his noſe.
            
            
               His ſmeller is ſmitten cleane from his face
               yet was there but one as he did ſaye
               Which caught him and pluckt of his noſe in that place
               A hie man, a lowe man, a foxe, or a graye
               Tenne ſhillinges he ſaith in his purſe be did loſe
               I thinke he lied therof, but not of his noſe
            
            
               Great ſerching was ſence that ſmeller to ſeke
               Some for haſt left their ſcabbert at home
               Some had gunnes ſome halberts ſome forked pikes
               ſome in ſhyrts of maile like a luſty mome
               There was neuer ſene before I ſuppoſe
               Such toſſing and tombling for a prieſtes noſe.
            
            
               Som men yt thought him no harme in ther life
               But becauſe they feare God, and do go about
               To liue with pure conſcience & be without ſtrife
               Thei ar boūd to the peas now for a prieſts ſnoue
               But becauſe he can kepe mens horedom ſo cloſe
               Therfore they make ſuch a worke for his noſe.
            
            
               Becauſe his ſcollers did mock at his maſſe
               He ſaid he wolde make bloud run by their heles
               But God hath turned the plage from their arſe
               And he with his noſe did bloudy the ſtiles
               with bloud I hard ſaye as red as a roſe
               he dronke well belike before he loſt his noſe.
            
            
               What maner of noſe was it ſir ye ſought for
               A black noſe, a red noſe, or one like my fiſt
               To be without noſe was the marke of an whore
               And now it is the marke of an whoriſhe prieſt
               And now you are ryd right well of the noſe
               Why do you make ſuche a worke for your noſe.
            
            
               Or was your noſe ſomewhat wan or pale
               A blewe noſe a bottle noſe, or was it yellowe
               Nos autem haue ſene it ſometime at the ale
               Libera nos ſalua nos frō the ſwap of ye ſwalowe
               But why did ye vſe ſyr to lye ſo and gloſe
               was it any meruayle though ye loſt your noſe.
            
            
               Some men are liuing to whom he did ſay
               Seing he knew the truth, if euer he ſayd maſſe
               He wiſht that ſome membre might be cut away,
               Now at his requeſt it is come to paſſe
               Much work he doth make for the lōp he did loſe
               well, what will ye geue ſyr for a newe noſe.
            
            
               But what ſhal we ſay, yf men do not lye
               who cut of the prieſtes noſe it is harde to iudge
               But he him ſelf I think did it of enuy
               And then to bewite it to them he did grudge
               That therby they might ther kingdom vp cloſe
               As ſometime Sopirus did ſnap of his noſe
            
            
               For ſometime he ſayth it was but a mome
               And eftſone a talle man this he doth name
               But ſtyll he affyrmeth it was but one
               which caught him and brought his noſe oute of frame
               Could one man ſo do it as you ſuppoſe
               Except he were willing to haue of his noſe.
            
            
               Remedie is none, but this thinge is true
               His ſnout is ſnaptſ of how
                     •
                  oeuer it was
               I thinke it were beſt to make him a new
               As ſone he may do it, as god at his maſſe
               yf he cannot make him a ſnout, I ſuppoſe
               he can not make god no more then his noſe
            
            
               Seing the true God is gone frō your towne
               And god Pean & Baccus doth rule in his ſtede
               with hoyſty and ſoyſty ouer ſhoulder & crowne
               yet hath he no more life then a lompe of leade
               yf he haue, then charge him that man to diſcloſe
               which met you & caught you, & cut of your noſe.
            
            
               But yf you do vſe the true god to mocke
               And geue his honor to your god in the purſe
               Loke whom ye bleſſe, and in blyndneſſe rocke
               The liuing god will you & your bleſſinges curſe
               And at length your falſehed to all men diſcloſe
               And thē no dout your head wyl folow your noſe
            
            
               Take hede I ſaye you chaplyns of Balle
               Though ye haue fed longe at Ieſabels borde
               Not longe but helias ſhall geue you a fall
               Repent and returne to the liuinge Lorde
               Though ye pricke till bloud runne by your toes
               ther wil a worſe chance com thē leſing your noſe
            
            
               I wyll not pray for you, let them do that liſte
               For feare God with me ſhould be miſcontent
               Seyng of purpoſe the holy ghoſt you reſiſte
               And if ye haue cleane forgotten to repent
               when God ſhall the ſecretes of all men diſcloſe
               ye ſhal haue aſmuch help as the preiſt of his noſe
            
            
               But you haue a vauntage ſyr if you mark all
               if a mous catch your god whē ye haue made it
               Then ye may catche the mouſe faſt by the walle
               For how can you hurt your noſe except ye had it
               The prouerbe is true in you I ſuppoſe
               He cannot tell where to turne his noſe.
            
            Finis.
            God ſaue the Quene.
