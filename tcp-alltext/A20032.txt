               THe moste famous oratoure and learned Phylosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero, wryteth, that in all consultations as touchynge owre behauoure and order of lyuynge amonge men, it behoueth vs euer to beare in mynde howe farre the dignitie of mans nature, excelleth the condition of brute beastes. For they, beinge ruled altogether by sence, delyte in nothynge but beastely appetites, whereunto they runne headlonge as to theyr onely felicitie. But the mynde of man, beinge of more noble nature, is nurysshed with knowleage, and taketh pleasure in diuisynge or excogitatynge sume honest thynge, whereby it not onely leaueth amonge men a memorie of his immortall nature, but also engendereth the lyke affection in other that delyte to see and heare such thinges as are commendable in theyr predicessours And this surely thynke I to bee the cause that eyther the famous factes of woorthy men,Commendation of noble factes. or ingenious inuentions of experte artificers, haue not onely nobilitate the autours and diuisers of the same, or such to whom they haue byn dedicate, but also that parte of theyr commendations haue redounded to all suche as haue spente theyr tyme and taken peynes in illustratynge and settynge furthe theyr doynges.

But certeynely the most trewe and permanent glory,Trewe glory. procedeth of such monumentes as brynge sume great and notable cōmoditie & profite to the lyfe of men, rather then of the hugious heapes of stones of the Pyramides of Egypt, wherin is nought els to see but the fonde & barbarous ostentation of superfluous riches:Great and sūptuous works, Or of the Mazes cauled Labyrinthi, or of horryble great Images cauled Colossi, of knottes inexplicable, of brasen caudrons of monstrous byggenesse, of hauens with echo seuen tymes reboundynge, and dyuers suche other portentous inuentions, the which as they do delite vs in considerynge the maruelous arte and witte of suche artificers as diuised and made the same, so are they otherwyse vnprofitable: And brynge rather a fame to theyr inuentoures, then trewe glorye.Fame differeth from true glory.

For surely, as Gonsalus Ouiedus wryteth to the Emperours maiestie in his hystorie of the Weste Indies, that he thynketh hym no trewe Spanyarde whiche reioyceth not in the good fortune of theyr kynges by whose ayde and godly zeale this myghtie portion of the worlde hath byn added to the flocke of Chrystes congregation,The conuertion of the gentyles.

Neyther yet had the church of Europe any knowleage of the myghtie Chrystian Empire of Preciosus Iohannes, otherwyse cauled Presbyter Iohannes, Emperour of many Chrystian nations in Ethiope,Prester Iohn the Christian Emperour of Ethiope. vntyll the yeare of Chryste .M.CCCC.xxxiii. as largely appeareth in the nauigations of the Portugales, and especially in the booke of Damianus a Goes, wrytten to the bysshop of Rome, Paule the thyrde of that name, of the fayth and religion of the Ethiopians which they haue hadde sence the tyme of the Apostles. A thynge certes most woonderfull,

and suche, that yf the same were not hydde hetherto by gods vnsercheable prouidence, I can not but thynke much negligence or ignorance in owr forefathers and predicessours vntyll the dayes of the ryght noble, prudent, and Catholike kynge of Aragon Don Ferdinando grandfather to Themperours maiestie by his eldest dowghter,Don Ferdinando kynge of Aragon. & to the queenes hyghnesse by his seconde dowghter the most vertuous lady queene Catherine her graces moother: A prince doubtelesse of suche nobilitie, prowes, magnificence, and all other vertues commendable in a prince, that who so shall indifferentely way all his doinges and good successe in all his affayres, comparinge the same to thenterpryses and doinges atchyued by suche famous princes in whome the Greekes and Romans haue so greately gloryed, maye with one eye perceaue not onely howe farre his noble factes do surmount theyrs, but also wel consyder what noble braunches of isshewe were lyke to sprynge owt of so woorthy a stocke. And suerly if sence the begynning of the worlde, the fauour of god toward men hath byn knowen by such benefites and blessynges as he hath geuen to men,The fauour of god knowen by his benefites. it seemeth to me that in maner (onely Chryste excepted) there neuer lyued man to whom god hath geuen greater benefites and shewed more fauoure. Great doubtlesse was the fauour and mercie that god shewed vnto Noe,Noe. by whom he saued the remanent of mankynde beinge but fewe in number. But much greater was the grace which he shewed to kynge Ferdinando vnder whom and by whose meanes he saued not onely the bodies but also the soules of innumerable millions of men inhabytynge a great part of the worlde heretofore vnknowen and drowned in the deluge of erroure.What god hath wrought by kynge Ferdinando. What shulde I here speake of Abraham the father of fayth whose promyses were great,Abraham, and he cauled the frende of god? Dyd he or his posteritie see Israell increase to such multitudes and nations as kyng Ferdinandos posteritie may see thincrease of this spirituall Israell vnto whome as a seconde Abraham he was the father of fayth?Spirituall Israell. Moises was so great in the syght of god that he disclosed vnto hym his secreate name,Moises. and miraculously caused a corner of the sea to open at his prayer. But howe greater a myracle was it that he opened vnto the nauie of Don Ferdinando the greate Ocean thowght before that tyme to bee without ende, where neuerthelesse he and his posteritie the

kynges of Spayne haue nowe planted a newe Israell muche greater then that whiche Moises ledde throughe the red sea. It were here superfluous to speake of Dauid whom Godde founde a man accordynge to his hartes desyre:Dauid. and yet maye it be doubted whether his plages and scourges were greater then his benefites? His sonne Salomon for al his inconstant and wauerynge wysedome and his great ryches obteyned by his nauigations to Ophir,Salomon.

A thyng doubtlesse so strange and marueylous that as the lyke was neuer done before, so is it perhaps neuer lyke to be done ageyne: so farre haue the nauigations of the Spanyardes excelled the vyage of Iason and the 'Argonautae to the region of Colchos, or all that euer were before.

The which thynge doubtelesse may seeme so much the greater and more difficulte, forasmuch as in the myddest of the chiefe heate of his chargeable warres ageynste the Moores of Granada, he euen then and at the same tyme sente furth shyppes for the conquestynge of the Indies,The conqueste of the Indies as thowgh he and the nation of the Spanyardes had byn appoynted by god eyther to subdue the enemies of the fayth or to bringe theym to Christes religion.

And as it is the nature of god not only to shewe his loue and fauour to such as haue pleased hym, but also to poure furth the plentie of his grace vppon theyr succession from generation to generation, so hath he with lyke fecilitie prospered the reigne of Themperours maiestie who by his wisdome and prowes hath not onely pollitikly gouerned,The Emperours maiestie but also augmented and inlarged such dominions as fel to hym by discente of inheritaunce. What shuld I speake of his warres and conquestes in India, in Aphrike, in Italie, in Fraunce, in Germanie, and in Flaunders: all the which to be declared accordyngely wolde rather require hole volumes then fewe sheetes of paper. Yet hath one in fewe woordes effectually expressed his dominions and conquestes in these verses folowynge.

            And certes who so well considereth the progenie of kynges that in so shorte a time haue linially descended from Don Ferdinando, and howe many kyngedomes they possesse, may see that God hath fulfylled in hym also the promises and blessynges of Abraham,Gen. 17.
                as to make hym the father of many nations, and his seede to growe great vpon the earth: Also that many kynges shulde come furth of his loynes, and to make a perpetuall league and conuenaunt with hym and his posteritie to bee theyr god for euer.

But after many yeares when the Iberians (that is the Spaniardes) knewe the price of syluer, and applyed them selues to the seekynge of metals and founde great plentie of syluer, they obteyned greate ryches therby forasmuch as in maner al that earth of the mountaynes is so replenysshed with syluer that it is a marueylous thynge to con

For they deputed to that laboure a multitude of bowght seruauntes, whiche searchynge the haynes of metals in dyuers places, and percyng the earth dyuers wayes for the space of many furlonges, browght furthe great plentie of golde and syluer. But the rychesse of these mynes was fyrst founde at such tyme as the Carthaginenses (the enemies of the Romane Empire) had the Iberians in subiection:The Carthaginenses inriched by the syluer of Spain. which was the cause that theyr poure afterwarde increased.

With better fortune therefore, and greater hope of gayne are ryche metals sought in Spayne, the goodnesse of whose soyle yeldeth cloddes of earth conteynynge much golde and syluer. And these be the very wordes of Diodorus Siculus, which the later wryters doo also confirme. For Iulius Solinus in his Polyhistor, compareth Spayne to the best contreys in plentie of grayne, vyttayles, oyle, syluer, golde, and Iron.

It were to longe here to speake of the greate plentie of fine woolles lyttle inferiour vnto owrs: also abundaunce of sugar,The commodities of Spain vines, pome granates, limondes, and orangies in such plentie that they suffice not only Spayne, but also in maner all Europe: whereas the apples and crabbes of Englande are scarsely able to serue it selfe. And althowghe here summe wyll obiecte, that they lacke corne, woodde, and certeyne other thynges, yet are theyr commodities so greate otherwyse, that al such thynges are browght them owt of other countreys for theyr wares: and that in such plentie, that they are there better chepe then euer they were in Englande sence the signe of the steeple the poore mans Inne was pulled downe in all places.The sygne of the steeple.

What shulde I heare speake of the golde which themperours maiestie receaueth frome all the Indies,Thēperours reuenues from the Indies. wheras onely in the two meltynge shoppes of the gold mines of the Ilande of Hispaniola, is molten yearely three hundreth thousande pounde weyght of .viii. vnces to the pound, wherof the fyfte parte is dewe vnto hym, whiche amounteth to three score thousande weyght yearely. Yet doo I not here speake of the golde mines of the other Ilandes and the firme lande reachynge .viii. thousande myles from the north to the south: Neyther of the ryche Ilandes of the south sea cauled Mare del Sur,The Ilandes of the South-sea. where the kynge of one lyttle Ilande named Tararequl, Margaritea, or de las Perlas, lying in the goulfe of Saynt Michael, payeth yearely for his tribute a hundreth pounde weight of perles: Neyther yet of the fyfte parte of other thynges, as precious stones, brasile, gossampine cotton, spices, and dyuers other thynges, wheras also the ryche Ilandes caused the Maluchas perteyne to the inheritaunce of Castile,The Ilandes of Maluca. althowgh the kynge of Portugale enioy them for certeyne yeares by composition. But the Indies haue rebelled (say they) and there commeth no more golde from thense. But what if summe of them haue rebelled? dooth it therby folowe that there commeth no more gold from the other that lyue vnder obedience? But if thou wylte say that they haue al rebelled at once, thou must proue that thou sayest eyther by hystorie or wytnesse of such as know the truth herof, as I (hauing made diligent searche for the same) am able to proue the contrarie,

and that suche talke is onely imagined by busie headdes. Ageyne: what if they haue rebelled in summe prouinces? dooth it folowe that they maye not ageyne be browght vnder subiection as were oftentymes the prouinces of the Romanes and as were in owre dayes dyuers countreys of Englande whiche haue byn sore afflicted with that plage. But whether the sandes of the ryuers and the mountaynes of the Indies bee so emptied with golde that no more can be founde there, I thinke it here superfluous to answere to this obiection, forasmuch as it is hereafter confuted in the booke of metals where yow shall fynde by experience that metals growe and increase, and that after certeyne yeares, suche owlde caues of the mynes as haue byn dygged, are ageyne replenysshed with vre: Also that the sprynges of suche mountaynes turnynge theyr course and breakynge furth in other places, brynge with them greate plentie of such golden sande as is founde in the ryuers into the which they faule. What impudencie is it therfore with woordes of reproche to caule hym poore whose poure is so greate, his treasure so infinite, and his doinges so chargeable, that I beleeue that when so euer it please almyghtie God to caule hym frome this lyfe to the greate domage of all Chrystendome, it shalbe harde to fynde an other that shall in all poyntes bee so well able to supplye that roome and maynteyne thimperiall dignitie. Let al honest natures therfore learne to speake well of princes accordynge to the sentence De Principibus nil nisi bonum, forasmuch as they are the ministers of god who hath theyr hartes in his hande and ruleth the same as seemeth beste vnto hym. For there is no poure neyther good nor badde, but of god: and he that resysteth or speaketh euyll of the poure, resisteth and speaketh euyll of god. Thou shalt not speake euyll of the prince or ruler of thy people saith saint Paule.

Saynt Paule the doctoure of the gentiles (to whose Apostelshippe also these newe gentiles doo perteine) was of such zeale toward the Iewes whom god had reiected,The godlye zeale of. S. Paule. that he wysshed hym selfe to bee accursed of god for theyr sakes. He went from Damascus to Arabie, preached the gospell in Grecia, came prisoner to Rome, was scourged and stoned, and suffered thryse shypwracke, what then thinke yow he wold do if he were now aliue? Is it to be thought that he wolde not aduenture .xxv. dayes saylynge to come to such a marte of soules in such redinesse to bee easely obteyned? I beleue verely that neyther death, nor the deuyll, nor Leuiathan, nor the worlde, shulde let hym but that he wolde geue thonset ageynst them all in hope of victorie by hym by whom he sayth he can doo all thynges. He was not negligent in his office nor ignorant of his rewarde, but trusted to the promesse of him that sayde by the mouth of the prophet Isai:Isai. 66.

Meanyng therby that lyke as god had done his part in geuyng them bodies of natural bewtie and comelynesse, so it apperteyned to his office beinge the cheefe pastoure of goddes flocke, to prouyde that theyr soules might be made woorthy to inhabite such bodies and the hole nation consecrated vnto god by baptisme. For he sayde furthermore: It is meete that vnto these also, the gospell of life bee preached: And hereuppon immediatly sent preachers into Englande whereby the hole nation was in shorte tyme conuerted to Christes faith,England converted to the faith of christ. although sum had receaued the gospell longe before euen from Chrystes tyme by the preachyng of Ioseph of Arimathia who asked the body of Chryste of Pilote, and buryed it reuerently. I wolde to god that there were now many mo such Gregories in the worlde: And that there might lyke zeale and gentelnesse bee founde in vs Englysshe men towarde other nations, as we haue founde in other towarde vs. Owre predicessoures were not vtterlye vnmyndefull of these benefites, but applyed them selues lykewise to spreade the gospell in other nations.

            Furthermore Damianus a Goes,Damianus a Goes wryteth in his booke De deploratione Lappianae gentis, that he was the fyrst that moued Erasmus to speake sumwhat hereof: And that he (Erasmus I meane) was determined to write a iust volume of this matter yf he had not byn preuented by death. Albeit (sayth Damianus) in his booke entiteled Ecclesiastes, he dyd not keepe silence of so wicked an vngodlynesse, whiche surely is suche, that it may in maner make all Christian men (and especiallye such vnto whom god hath gyuen poure and knowleage) giltie of so heyghnous a crime,To the christian princes. that he may take vengeance of them in the day of iudgement before the iuste iudge Chryst. Nowe therfore (sayth he) let the Christian Monarches take heede what accoumpte they shall make before the tribunal of Chryste at the laste day, when neyther fauoure, nor pardon, or flatterie can take place to bee any excuse for the losse of so manye soules. And these be the very woordes of the woorshipful and lerned man Damianus a Goes, wrytten to the bysshoppe of Rome Paule the thyrde of that name, whom he further chargeth to looke diligently hereunto, as a thynge moste chiefely perteynynge to the office of Christian prelates. Mee thynke verely that the sheepe of Europe shulde by this tyme be so well fedde,The sheepe of Europe. that they shulde by good reason be so stronge and mightie in Christes religion (excepte they be infected with the dysease which the phisitians caule Cachexia, beinge an euyl disposition of the body whereby the more they are fed the worse they lyke) that many sheppardes myght well bee spared to bee sent to other sheepe which ought to be of the same foulde. For this purpose the doctoure of diuinitie when he commenseth,The doctoure of diuinitie hath his scapular cast ouer his headde in token that he hathe

forsaken the worlde for Christes sake: And his bootes on his legges in token that he shall euer bee in a redinesse to go forwarde in preachynge the gospell, as I doubte not there bee many in Englande wolde gladly doo euen amonge these new gentyles if they were therto mainteyned by the ayde of the secular poure as in this case it shalbe requisite for the furniture of necessaries hereunto apperteynynge,An admonitiō to riche men. I must nowe therfore appele vnto yow, yow riche men and rulers of the worlde, to whom god hath giuen gooddes as thynges neyther good nor badde of them selues, but onely as they are vsed wel or euil. If yowe vse them well, they are the gyftes of god wherwith yow may doo many thynges acceptable both to god and men. And if yow vse them otherwyse, yowe possesse not them, but they possesse yow, and theyr canker and ruste (as saythe the Apostle) shalbe a testimonie ageinst yow in the day of the great audit. Thinke not therfore that this thynge perteyneth not vnto yowe, if yowe perteyne vnto Christe and looke to haue any parte with hym. Consyder with yowre selues if it were onely to get worldely ryches, howe redye and greedy yowe wolde bee to venture a greate deale to get a thyrde part, with owt castynge of any perell by lande or by sea, as the wyttie poet Horase hath in fewe wordes descrybed the marchauntes desyre and aduentures to obteyne rychesse.The marchant
               
                  Impiger extremos currit mercator ad Indos,
                  Per mare pauperiem fugiens, per saxa, per ignes.
                  The which verses are thus much to say in effecte.
                  The marchaunt in hope greate rychesse to fynde,
                  By fyer and by water passeth to Inde,

                  To flye from pouertie and hasarde al
               
As the poet hath in these verses, by the marchaunt declared the desyre that couetous men haue to obteyne slippery riches, the lyke affection to obteyne worldly fame and honour,The desyre of wordely fame. maye we see in valiant and noble capitaynes in the warres where they contende to put them selues forwarde to the moste daungerous aduenture as to haue the forewarde of the battayle: a token surely of much nobilitie and manly corage. But oh immortall god? Is it not to bee lamented that men can be so valient, slowte, and in maner desperate in theyr owne priuate

matters, perteynyng onely to theyr bodies, and yet so coulde, negligent,Men are slothfull in goddes cause. and fearefull in goddes cause and thynges touchynge the health of theyr soules? If there were neyther deuyll nor lawe to accuse men before god in this case, shall not theyr owne consciences bee a lawe of condemnation ageynste theym in that they haue not shewed that loue to mankynde, which the very lawe of nature moueth brute beastes to shewe one to an other in theyr generations? But what hope is there (excepte god wolde in maner by myracle conuerte the hartes of such men) what hope is there I say, that they wyll depart with any of theyr gooddes, muche lesse aduenture theyr bodies, to the furtheraunce of Christes religion in these regions beinge so farre from them, wheras many shewe lyttle loue, charitie, or liberalitie (if not rather cruelt
                  •
               e, tyrannie, and oppression) to theyr poore neighbours and brootherne dwelling euen at home at theyr owne elbowes. But as this couetousnesse is to bee reproued, so is the liberalitie of such to be commended as haue byn at greate coaste and charges in settynge forwarde suche viages: wherein not onely the marchauntes of London, but also diuers noble men and gentelmen as well of the counsayle as other,Uyages from Englande. which bothe with theyr money and furtheraunce otherwyse haue furnysshed and sent furth certeyne shyppes for the discouerynge of such landes and regions as were heretofore vnknowen, haue herein deserued immortall fame, for as much as in such attemptes and daungerous vyages, they haue shewed no smaule liberalitie vppon vncerteyne hope of gayne: wherein they haue deserued so much the greater prayse as theyr intent seemed to bee rather to further honest en
                  •
               erprises then for respecte of vantage. And here certeynely in the mention of these viages I myght seeme vngratefull if I shulde omitte to giue dewe commendations to the two chiefe capitaynes of the same as the woorthy knyght syr Hugh Wylloby and the excellent pilotte Rycharde Chaunceler who haue therein aduentured theyr lyues for the commoditie of theyr countrey:Syr Hugh Wylloby and Rycharde Chaunceler. Men doubtlesse woorthye for theyr noble attemptes to bee made knightes of the Ocean or otherwyse preferred if euer god sende them home ageyne although they fayle of theyr purpose. For as suche haue obteyned absolute glory that haue browght great thynges to passe,Glory and fame. so haue they deserued immortall fame which haue only attempted the

same: forasmuch as fortune (who sumtymes fauoureth the vnworthyest) is not in the poure of man. Xerses obteyned glorie in makynge a bridge ouer the sea Hellespontus ioynynge Europe to Asia, and Darius ouer Bosphorus when he passed with his armye towarde the Scythians. No lesse fame and commendation (although not lyke glory) deserued Demetrius, Cesar, Calligula, and Seleucus Nicanor, whiche attempted to cutte in sundre certeyne places cauled) Isthmi, (beinge narowe portions of lande so diuidynge twoo seas, that there is no passage from the one to the other) and yet neuer finisshed that they tooke in hande, beinge hyndered eyther by deathe,The rewarde of noble enterprises. warres, or other chaunces. The auncient Romans & Greekes gaue such glorye vnto them that had eyther well deserued of the common welthe, or otherwyse attempted such great enterprises as might bee profitable for mankynde, that after theyr death they caused Images of golde, syluer, brasse, Iuery, and marble to bee made to theyr lykenesse, and the same to be placed in theyr solemne haules, palaices, or temples, with certeyne verses made to the comnendation of them whom the Images represented.

            ¶ To the moste noble Prince and Catholike kynge, Charles, Peter Martyr of Angleria wysheth perpetuall felicitie.
            
               THe diuine prouidence, frome the tyme that he fyrste created the worlde, hathe reserued vnto this day the knowleage of the great and large Ocean sea:The largenes of the Ocean vnknowen to this day. In the which tyme he hath opened the same, chiefely vnto yowe (moste mightie Prince) by the good fortune and happie successe of yowr grandfather by yowr mothers syde. The same prouidence (I knowe not by what destenie) hath brought me owt of my natiue countrey of Milane, and owt of the citie of Rome (where I continued almost .x. yeares) into Spaine, that I myght particularlye collecte, these marueylous and newe thynges, which shoulde otherwyse perhappes haue line drowned in the whirlepoole of obliuion: forasmuch as the Spanyardes (men woorthy greate commendation) had onely care to the generall inuentions of these thynges. Notwithstandinge, I doo not chalenge vnto me only, the thankes of the trauaile bestowed herein, wheras the chiefe rewarde therof is due to Ascanius vicounte Cardinal,Cardinal Ascanius. who perceauynge that I was wylling to departe owt of the citie to be present at the warres of Granatum,The warres of Granatum ageynst the Moores. dissuaded me from my purpose. But seing that I was fully resolued to departe, exhorted and required me to wryte vnto hym such newes as were famous in Spayne and woorthy to be noted. I tooke therfore my iorney into Spaine chiefely for the desyre I had to see thexpedition whiche was prepared ageynst the enemies of the fayth: forasmuche as in Italye, by reason of the dissention amonge the Princes, I coulde fynde nothynge wherewith I myght feede my wytte, beinge a younge man desyrous of knowleage and experience of thynges. I was therefore presente at the warres: frome whense I writte to Cardinal Ascanius, and by sundry epistels

certifyed hym of such thynges as I thought moste woorthye to be put in memorie. But when I perceaued that his fortun

As I was therfore musynge with my selfe of these thynges, the Cardinal of Arragonie, after that he had seene the two fyrste bookes of my Decades wrytten to Ascanius, required me in the name of kynge Frederike his vncle,Kynge Frederike. to put foorth the other eyght epistell bookes, In the meane tyme also, while I was voyde of all care as touchynge the matters of the Ocean, the Apostolicall messengers of the bysshopppe of Rome Leo the tenth,Leo the tenth▪ byshoppe of Rome. (by whose holsome counsayle and autoritie we truste the calamities of Italy shalbe fynysshed) raysed me as it were frome sleape, and encoraged me to proceade as I had begunne. To his holynesse I writte two Decades cōprysed in short bokes after the maner of epistels, and added them to the fyrst, which was printed withowt myne aduise, as shall further appeare by the preface folowynge. But nowe I returne to yow (most noble Prince) from whom I haue sumwhat digressed.Spayne subdued from the Moores, Therfore wheras yowr graundefathers by yowre moothers syde,

The next daye folowing, the kinges brother resortyng to the shyppes, eyther in his owne name or in his brothers, seduced the women.

For in this part, the Iland receaueth a greate goulfe. This hauen, he named saynt Nycolas porte,Saynt Nycolas porte. beinge scarsely .xx. leaques from Cuba. As he departed from hense and sayled westwarde by the south syde of Cuba, the further that he went, so muche the more the sea seemed to bee extended in breadth & to bende towarde the south. On the south syde of Cuba, he fownde an Ilande which thinhabitantes caule Iamaica.

This he affirmeth to bee longer and broder then the Iland of Sicilie: hauyng in it only one mountayne, which on euery parte begynninge from the sea, ryseth by little and little into the myddest of the Ilande: And that soo playnely without rowghnes, that suche as goo vp to the toppe of the same, can scarsely perceaue that they ascende.Iamaica. This Ilande he affirmed to bee very fruitfull and full of people as well in thinner partes of the same as by the shore: And that thinhabitantes are of quicker wytte then in the other Ilandes,Quicke wytted people. and more experte artificers and warrelyke men. For in many places where he woulde haue arryued, they came armed ageynst him and forbodde him with threatening wordes But beinge ouercome,The composeinge of the earth. they made a league of frendeship with hym. Thus departynge from Iamaica, he sayled towarde the Weste with a prosperous wynde for the space of three

                  Aurea Chersonesus, or Malaccha.) in owre Easte India beyonde the beginninge of Persides. For he playnely beleued that he had lefte onely two of the twelue howres of the sonne,A secreate of Astronomie. which were vnknowen to vs, for the owlde wryters haue lefte halfe the course of the sonne vntouched, where as they haue but onely discussed that superficiall parte of the earth which lyeth betwene the Ilandes of Gades and the ryuer of Ganges:The ryuer of Ganges. or at the vttermoste, to Aurea Chersonesus. In this nauigation, he chaunced on many furious seas, running with a faule as it had byn the streames of fluddes: Also many whorlepooles, and shelfes, with many other daungers, and streyghtes by reason of the multytude of Ilandes,Daungerous streightes by reason of many Ilandes. which ley on euery syde. But not regardinge all these perelles, he determyned to proceade vntyl he had certaine knowledge whether Cuba were an Ilande or firme lande. Thus he sayled forward coastinge euer by the shore towarde the weste for the space of CC.xxii. leaques, that is, abowte a thousande and three hundreth myles: And gaue names to seuen hundreth Ilandes by the waye:The Admiral gaue names to seuen hundrethe Ilandes. Leauynge also on the lefte hande (as he feared not to reporte) three thousande here and three.thre thousād Ilandes. But let vs nowe returne to suche thinges as he fownde worthy to be noted in this nauigation. Saylinge therfore by the syde of Cuba, and searchinge the nature of the places, he espied not farre from Alpha and O, a large hauen of capacitie to harborowe manye shippes:A large hauē
                   whose enteraunce is bendinge, beinge inclosed on bothe sydes with capes or poyntes which receaue the water. This hauen is large within, and of exceadinge depthe. Saylinge by the shore of this porte, he sawe not farre frome the same, two cotages couered with reedes, and in many places fyer kyndeled. Here he sente certeyne armed men owte of the shippes to the cotages: where they fownde nother man nor woman, but rostemeate enowgh. For they fownde certeyne spyttes of woodde lyenge at the fyre, hauinge fyshe on theym abowt a hundreth pownde weight, and two serpentes of .viii foote longe a piece,Rosted fysshe and serpents of .viii. foote longe. wherat marueylinge, and lokynge abowt if they coulde espye any of thinhabitantes, and that none appeared in syght (for they fledde all to the mountaynes at the comminge of owre men) they fell to theyr meate, and eate the

For (as Plinie sayth) Crocodiles haue sumetymes byn fownde of .xviii. cubettes longe. But of these the byggest were but of .viii. fote. Thus beinge well refresshed, they entered into the next woodde where they fownde many of the same kynde of serpentes hangynge vppon bowghes of trees: of the which, sume had theyr mouthes tyed with strynges, and sume theyr teethe taken owte. And as they searched the places nere vnto the hauen, they sawe abowte .lxx. men in the toppe of a hyghe rocke, whiche fledde as soone as they had espied owre men. Who by signes and tokens of peace, caulinge them ageyne, there was one which came nere them and floode on the toppe of a rocke, seemynge as thowgh he were yet ferefull. But the Admiral sent one Didacus to hym,Didacus thinterpretour. a man of the same countrey, whom he had at his fyrste vyage taken in the Ilande of Guanahaini, beinge nere vnto Cuba: wyllinge hym to come nere and not to bee afrayde. When he harde Didacus speke to him in his owne tonge he came bowldly to hym: and shortly after resorted to his cō
                  pany, persuadinge them to come without all feare. After this message was doone, there descended frome the rockes to the shippes, abowt three score and ten of thinhabibitantes, proferinge frendeshippe and gentelnes to owre men: whiche the Admirall accepted thankefully, and gaue them dyuers rewardes: And that the rather, for that he had intelligence by Didacus thenterpretoure, that they were the kynges fysshers,The kynges. fysshers. sent of theyr lorde to take fysshe ageynst a solemne feaste which he prepared for an other kynge.

Beynge asked why they fyrst rosted the fysshe which they entended to beare to their kynge. They answered, that they might bee the fressher and vncorrupted.

Heare amonge certeyne wooddes of date trees,wooddes of date trees. and pyneable trees of excedyng height he fownd two natiue sprynges of fresshe water. In the meane tyme whyle the woodde was cuttynge and the barrelles fyllyng, one of owre archers went into the wood to hunt: where he espyed a certeyne man with a whyte vesture,Men appareled like white fryers. soo lyke a fryer of thorder of saynt Marye of Mercedis, that at the fyrste sight he supposed it had byn the Admiralles preeste which he browght with hym, beyng a man of the same order.

Then turning his backe and cryinge owte to his felowes, he made haste to the shyppes with all that he myght dryue. These apparelled men, made signes and tokens to hym to tary and not to bee afrayde. But that notwithstandinge, he ceased not to flye. The Admirall beinge aduertised hereof, and not a lyttle reioysynge that he had fownde a ciuile people, in continently sent forth armed men, with commaundement, that yf neede should soo requyre, they shulde enter fortie myles into the Ilande, vntyl they myght fynde eyther those apparelled men, or other inhabitantes of that countrey. When they hadde passed ouer the woodde, they came into a greate playne full of grasse and herbes, in which appeared no token of any pathe way. Here

attemptinge to goo throwgh the grasse and herbes, they were soo entangled and bewrapte therin, that they were scarsely able to passe a myle, the grasse beinge there lyttle lower then owre rype corne.grasse almost as hyghe as corne Beinge therfore weryed, they were enforced to returne ageyne, fyndyng no pathe way.

Who departinge, when they had fownde not farre from the sea syde certeyne steppes of wylde beastes,Steppes of wyld beastes feete. of the which they suspected sum to bee of Lyons feete being striken with feare, returned backe ageyne.

Of these vines they browght with them into Spaine many clusters of grapes very ponderous and full of lycoure.

They saye also that in the laundes or medowes of those wooddes, they sawe flockes of greate cranes twyse as bygge as owres.Greate Cranes. As he went forward and turned his sayles towarde certeyne other mountaines, he espied two cotages on the shore, in the whiche he sawe onely one man: who beinge browght to the shyppe, signified with heade, fyngers, and by al other signes, that he coulde deuise that the lande which lay beyonde those mountaynes, was very full of people.

There was no rocke or hyll that coulde be seene, but the same was all of a smoke. But whether these fyers were made by thinhabitantes for their necessary busynes, or as we are wont to sette beacons on fyre when we suspecte thapproche of owre enemies, thereby to gyue warninge to theyr neyghbours to bee in a redines, and gather togyther if perhappes owre men shulde attempte any thinge ageynst them, or otherwyse as seemethe most lykely, to caule them togyther as to a wonder to behould owre shippes, they knewe yet no certentie.

Not longe after, he entered into a gulfe of whyte water,A goufe of whyte water humaine people. lyke vnto that wherof we spake before. At the lengh fearing the shelfes of the Ilands, he returned to the shore of Cuba by the same way which he came. Here a multitude of thinhabitantes, as well women as men, resorted to hym with cheerefull countenaunce and without feare: bringynge with them popingayes breade, water, and cunnyes: But especially stocke doues much bygger then owres: which he affirmeth, in sauour and taste, to bee muche more pleasaunt then owre partryches.Stock doues of more pleasaunt tast thē partriches.

He had a greate trayne of menne waytinge on hym. All the whyle the preeste was at masse, he shewed hym selfe verye humble and gaue reuerente attendaunce with graue and demure countenaunce. When the masse was ended, he presented to the Admirall, a baskette of the fruites of his countrey, delyueringe the same with his owne handes. When the Admirall had gentelly interteyned hym, desyringe leaue to speake, he made an oration in the presence of Didacus thinterpretoure, in this effecte.An oration of the naked gouernour. I haue byn aduertised (moste mighty prince) that you haue of late with greate power subdued many landes and Regions hytherto vnknowē to you: and haue browght no little feare vppon all the people and inhabitantes of the same. The which your good fortune, you shal beare with lesse insolencie,Theyr opinion of the

                      of man. if you remember that the soules of men haue two iourneyes after they are departed from this bodye. The one fowle and darke, prepared for suche as are iniurious and cruell to man kynde: The other pleasaunt and delectable, ordeyned for thē which in theyr lyfe tyme, loued peace and quietnes. If therefore you acknowleage your selfe to bee mortall, and consyder that euery man shall receaue condigne rewarde or punyshemēt for such thinges as he hath done in this life, you wyl wrongefully hurte no man. When he had sayde these wordes and other lyke, which were declared to the Admirall by thinterpretour, he marueylinge at the iudgemente of the naked owlde man, answered, that he was gladde to heare his opinion as touchinge the sundry iourneys and rewardes of sowles departed from theyr bodyes: Supposinge that nother he, or any other of thinhabitantes of those Regions,Desyre of golde founde that which religion coulde not fynde. had had any knowleage thereof. Declaringe further that the chiefe cause of his comminge thyther was to instructe them in such godly knowleage and trewe religion: And that he was sente into those countreys by the Christian kynge of Spayne (his lorde and maister) for the same purpose:
                     Virtus post nummos. &c.
                   And specially to subdue and

punishe the Canibales and such other mischeuous people: And to defende innocentes ageynst the violence of such euyl doers wyllynge hym and all other such as embrased vertue, in no case to bee afrayde: But rather to open his mynde vnto him, if eyther he, or any other suche quiete men as he was, hadde susteyned any wronge of theyr neyghbours: and that he wold see the same reuenged. These comfortable wordes of the Admirall soo pleased the owlde man, that notwithstandyng his extreeme age, he woulde gladly haue gone with the Admiral as he had doone in deede, if his wyfe and chyldren had not hyndered hym of his purpose. But he marueyled not a lyttle, that the Admirall was vnder the dominion of an other: And muche more, when thinterpretour towlde hym of the glorye, magnificence, pompes, greate power, and furnymentes of warre of owre kynges, and of the multitudes of cities and townes which were vnder theyr dominions. Intendyng therfore to haue gonne with the Admirall, his wyfe and children fell prostrate at his feete, with teares desyrynge hym not to forsake them and leaue them desolate. At whose pytifull requestes, the worthy owlde man beinge moued, remayned at home to the comfort of his people and famylie, satisfyenge rather them then hym selfe. For not yet ceasinge to woonder, and of heauy countenaunce bycause he myght not departe, he demaunded oftentymes if that lande were not heauen, which browght foorth suche a kynde of men. For it is certeyne, that amonge them, the lande is as common as the sonne and water:The Iland as common as the sunne and water. And that Myne and Thyne (the seedes of all myscheefe) haue no place with them. They are contente with soo lyttle, that in soo large a countrey, they haue rather superfluitie thē scarsenes. Soo that (as wee haue sayde before) they seeme to lyue in the goulden worlde,The golden worlde. without toyle, lyuinge in open gardens, not intrenched with dykes, dyuyded with hedges, or defended with waules. They deale trewely one with an other, without lawes, without bookes, and without Iudges. They take hym for an euyll and myscheuous man, which taketh pleasure in doinge hurte to other. And albeit that they delyte not in superfluities, yet make they prouision for thincrease of suche rootes,Prouisiō without care. wherof they make theyr breade, as Maizium, Iucca, and Ages, contented with suche simple dyet,Simple diete wherby health is preserued, and dyseases auoyded.

Wherfore at the Calendes of September, enteringe into the hauen of the same Ilande, cauled saynt Nycolas hauen, he repayred his shippes to thintent that he myght ageyne wast and spoyle the Ilandes of the Canibales,The Canibales. and burne all theyr Canoas, that those raueninge wolues myght no longer persecute and deuoure the innocent sheepe. But he was at this tyme hyndered of his purpose by reason of a dysease which he had gottē with to muche watchinge.Sickenes of to much watchinge. Thus beinge feeble and weake, he was ledde of the maryners to the citie of Isabella, where, with his two brytherne which were there, & other his familiers, he recouered his health in shorte space. Yet coulde he not at this tyme assayle the Canibales, by reason of sedicion that was rysen of late amonge the Spanyardes which he had lefte in Hispaniola, wherof we wyll speake more heareafter. Thus fare ye wel.

Intendynge therefore to pacifie their troubled myndes, and to punyshe them that slew his men before he departed from thense, he sent for the kynge of that vale, which in the booke before, we descrybed to bee at the foote of the mountaynes of the Region of Cibaua. This kynges name was Guarionexius:Guarionexius the kynge of the greatyale Didacus the interpretour who, the more streyghtly to concyle vnto hym the frendeshyppe of the Admirall, gaue his syster to wyfe to Didacus, a man from his chyldes age browght vp with the Admiral, whom he vsed for his interpretoure in the prouinces of Cuba. After this, he sent for Caunaboa, cauled the lorde of the howse of goulde: that is, of the mountaynes of Cibaua, For this Caunaboa,

Beinge demaunded why he browght soo greate a rout of men with hym, he aunswered that it was not decente for soo great a prince as he was, to goo foorth of his howse without suche a bande of men. But the thinge chaunced much otherwyse then he looked for. For he fell into the snares which he had prepared for other. For wheras by the way he began to repente hym that he came foorthe of his howse, Hoieda with many fayre wordes and promyses,Fayre worde make fooles fayne. browght hym to the Admirall: At whose commaundement, he was immediatly taken & put in prison: So that the sowles of owre men were not longe from their bodies vnreuenged. Thus Caunaboa with all his familie beinge taken, the Admirall was determined to runne ouer the Ilande. But he was certified that there was such famine amonge thinhabitantes,Famine in the Ilande of hispaniola. that there was alredye fyftie thousande menne deade therof: And that they dyed yet dayly as it were cotton sheepe: The cause wherof was wel knowen to bee theyr owne obstinacie and frowardnes. For where as they sawe that owre men entended to choose them a dwelling place in the Ilande, supposinge that they myght haue driuen them from thence if the vytailes of the Ilande shoulde fayle, they determyned with them selues, not only to leaue sowing and plantyng, but also to destroy and plucke vp by the rootes euery man in his owne region,The hunger of golde causeth great famine. that whiche they had alredye sowen of both kyndes of breade wherof we made mencion in the fyrst booke. But especially amonge the mountaynes of

                  Cibaua, otherwyse cauled Cipanga, for as muche as they hadde knoweleage that the golde which abundeth in that Region, was the cheefe cause that deteyned owre men in the Ilande. In the meane tyme, he sent foorth a Capitayne with a bande of men to searche the sowthe syde of the Ilande. Who at his returne, reported that throwghe out all the Regions that he trauayled, there was suche scarsenes of breade, that for the space of .xvi. dayes he eate nowght elles but the rootes of herbes, and of younge date trees, or the fruites of other wylde trees, But Guarionexius, the kynge of the vale lyinge beneth the mountaynes of Cibaua, whose kyngedoome was not soo wasted as the other, gaue owre menne certeyne vytayles.
               Within a fewe dayes after, bothe that the iourneys myght bee the shorter, and also that owre men myght haue more safe places of refuge, if the inhabitantes shuld hereafter rebell in lyke maner, he buylded an other fortesse (whiche he cauled the towre of Cōception) betwene the citie of Isabella and saint Thomas fortresse,The towre of conception. in the marches of the kyngdome of this Guarionexius within the precincte of Cibaua vpon the syde of A hyll, hauynge a fayre ryuer of holsome water runnynge hard by the same.

This golde was not fownde in the banke of that ryuer, but in a heape of drye earthe: and was lyke vnto the stone cauled Tofus,

This piece of Electrum, was of such weight, that I was not onely with both my handes vnable to lifte it from the grownde, but also not of strengthe to remoue it eyther one waye or an other. They affyrmed that it wayde more then three hundreth pownde

And albeit that in the dayes of thinhabitantes yet liuynge, Electrum was no where digged, yet knewe they where the myne therof was:The myne of Electrum. but owre men with muche adoo, coulde hardely cause them to shewe them the place, they bore them suche priuie hatred.

Thus as he with a bande of armed men, had entered three score myles further within the lande, the people of the countrey here and there resortynge to hym, gaue hym a certen portion of theyr breade in exchange for other of owre thynges. But he coulde not long tary here, bicause they lacked meate in the fortresse, whyther he hasted with such as he had now gotten. Leauyng

therfore in the fortresse a garryson of tenne men, with that portion of the Ilande breade whiche yet remayned,huntinge houndes. leauynge also with them a hownde to take those kyndes of lyttle beastes which they caule Vsias, not muche vnlyke owre conyes, he returned to the fortresse of Conception. This also, was the moonthe wherin the kynge Guarionexius, and also Manicautexius,
                  kynge Manicautexius. bortherer vnto hym, shulde haue brought in theyr tributes. Remaynynge there the hole moonthe of Iune, he exacted the hole tribute of these twoo kinges, and vytayles necessary for hym and suche as he brought with hym, whiche were abowt foure hundreth in number. Shortely after, abowte the calendes of Iulye, there came three Caraueles from Spayne,Uytayles browght frō Spayne. bringynge with them sundry kyndes of vitayles, as wheate, oyle wyne, bacon, and marckelmas beafe: whiche were dyuyded to euery man accordynge as neede required. Sum also was lost in the cariage for lacke of good lookyng too. At the arryuall of these shyppes, the lieuetenaunte receaued commaundment from the kynge and the Admyrall his brother, that he with his men shulde remoue theyr habitation to the sowthe syde of the Ilande, bycause it was nerer to the golde mynes: Also that he shoulde make dilygent searche for those kynges whiche had slayne the Christian men, and to sende them with theyr confederates, bownd into Spayne. At the nexte vyage therfore, he sent three hundreth captiues with three Kinges: And when he had diligently searched the coastes of the south syde, he transported his habitation, and buylded a fortresse there, vpon the toppe of a hyll, neere vnto a shure hauen.
               This fortresse, he cauled saynt Dominikes towre.Saynt Dominikes towre. Into this hauen, runneth A ryuer of holsome water, replenyshed with sundrye kyndes of good fysshes.

After he had buylded this fortresse, leauinge therin a garryson of .xx. men, he with the remanent of his souldiers, prepared them selues to searche the inner partes of the Weste syde of the Ilande, hytherto knowen onely by name. Therfore abowte .xxx. leaques, (that is) foure score and tenne myles from the fortresse, he chaunced on the ryuer Naiba,
                  The ryuer of Naiba whiche we sayde to descende from the mountaynes of Cibaua, ryght towarde the sowth, by the myddest of the Iland. When he had ouerpassed this ryuer with a coompanye of armed men diuided into .xxv. decurions, that is, tenne in a company with theyr capitaynes, he sent two decurions to the regions of those kinges in whose landes were the great woods of brasile trees.wooddes of brasile trees. Inclyninge towarde the lefte hande, they fownde the woodes, entered into them, and felled the hygh and precious trees, which were to that day, vntouched. Eche of the decurions fylled certeyne of the Ilande howses with the trunkes of brasile, there to be reserued vntyll the shyppes came which shulde cary them away. But the Lieuetenaunt directinge his iourney towarde the ryght hande, not farre from the bankes of the ryuer of Naiba, fownde a certeyne kynge whose name was Beuchius Anacauchoa,
                  kinge Beuchius Anacauchoa. encamped ageynst thinhabitantes of the prouince of Naiba, to subdue them vnder his dominion, as he had doone manye other kynges of the Ilande, bortherers vnto hym: The palaice of this great kynge, is cauled Xaragua:The palaice of

All that Region from Naiba,, to the furtheste marches of the weste, is vtterly withowte golde, althowgh it bee full of mountaynes.Mountaynes without gold When the kynge had espied owre men, layinge a parte his weapons, & gyuinge signes of peace, he spake gentelly to them, incerteyne whether it were of humanitie or feare) and demaunded or thē what they woolde haue. The Lieuetenaunte aunswered: That he shulde paye tribute to the Admirall his brother,Tribute. in the name of the Christian kynge of Spayne. To whom he sayde: Howe can yowe requyre that of me, whereas neuer a Region vnder my dominion bringeth foorth golde. For he had harde, that there was a strange nation entered into the Ilande, whiche made

greate searche for golde. But he supposed that they desyred none other thynge. The leauetenaunt answered ageyne: God forbydde that we shulde enioyne any man to pay such tribute as he myght not easely forbeare, or such as were not engendered or growinge in the Region: But we vnderstand that your Regions brynge foorth great plentie of Gossampine cotton, and hempe,The woolfe entreateth. the sheepe. with suche other, whereof we desyre yowe to gyue vs parte. When he harde these woordes, he promysed with cherefull countenaunce, to gyue hym as muche of these thynges as he wolde requyre. Thus dismissinge his army, & sendynge messengers beefore, he hym selfe accoompanyed the Leauetenaunte and browght hym to his palaice, beinge dystante (as we haue sayde) .xxx. leaques. In al this tracte, they passed throwgh the Iurisdiction of other princes beinge vnder his dominion: Of the whiche, sume gaue them hempe, of no lesse goodnes to make tackelinges for shippes then owre woodde. Other sume, browght breade, and sum gossampyne cotton:hempe and gossampine cotton. And soo euery of them payde tribute with suche commodities as theyr countreys browght foorth. At the lengthe they came to the kinges mansion place of Xaragua. Before they entered into the palaice,howe the Lieuetenant was receaued at the kynges palaice. A greate multitude of the kynges seruauntes and subiectes resorted to the courte, honorably (after their maner) to receaue their kyng Beuchius Anacauchoa, with the strangers which he browght with hym to se the magnificence of his courte. But nowe shall yowe heare howe they were interteyned. Amonge other tryumphes and syghtes, two are especially to bee noted. Fyrste there mette them a company of xxx. women, beinge all the kynges wyues and concubines,The kinges wyues. bearinge in theyr handes branches of date trees, singinge and daunsinge: They were all naked, sauynge that theyr pryuie partes were couered with breeches of gossampine cotton. But the virgins, hauynge theyr heare hangynge downe abowte their shulders, tyed abowte the foreheade with a fyllet, were vtterly naked.well fauered women. They affirme that theyr faces, brestes, pappes handes, and other partes of theyr bodyes, were excedynge smoothe, and well proportioned: but sumwhat inclyning to a louely browne. They supposed that they had seene those most beawtyfull Dryades,
                  Dryades. or the natyue nymphes or fayres of the fontaynes wherof the antiquites speake so muche. The branches of date trees which they bore in theyr right handes whē

Thus enteringe into the kynges howse, they fownde a delycate supper prepared for them after theyr maner.A delicate supper. When they were well refreshed with meate, the nyght drawinge on, they were browght by the kynges officers, euery man to his lodginge, accordyng to his degree, in certeyne of theyr howses abowte the palaice, where they rested them in hangynge beddes after the maner of the countrey,hanginge beddes. wherof we haue spoken more largely in an other place.
               ¶ The daye folowyng they browght owre men to their common haule,A common haule. into the whiche they coome together as often as they make any notable games or triumphes, as we haue said before. Here, after many daunsynges, synginges, maskinges runnynges, wrestlynges, and other tryinge of mastryes, soodenly there appered in a large plaine nere vnto the haule .ii. greate armies of men of warre, whiche the kynge for his pastyme had caused to bee prepared,A pretie pastyme. as the Spaniardes vse the playe with reedes whiche they caule Iuga de Canias. As the armies drewe neere together, they assayled the one the other as fiersely, as if mortal ennemies with theyr baners spleade, shulde fight for theyr goodes, theyr landes, theyr lyues, their libertie, theyr countrey, theyr wyues and theyr chyldren.

In the tyme of his absence .xxx. of his men were consumed with diuerse diseases.Prouision for diseased men Wherfore beinge sore trowbled in his mynde, and in maner at his wyttes ende what he were best to doo, for as muche as he wanted al thynges necessarie as well to restore them to healthe whiche were yet acrased, as also vitayles to mayntaine the hole multitude, where as there was yet no shippe coome from Spaine, as at the length he determyned to sende abrode the sicke men

here and there to sundrye Regions of the Ilande, and to the castelles which they had erected in the same. for directly from the citie of Isabella to saynt Dominikes towre, that is, from the north to the south,The castels or towres of hispaniola. throwgh the Iland, they had buylded thus many castelles. Fyrste .xxxvi. myles distante from Isabella, they buylded the castell of Sperantia. from Sperantia. xxv. myles, was the castell of saynte Catharine. from saynte Catharines .xx. myles, was saynt Iames towre. Other .xx. miles from saynte Iames towre, was A stronger fortresse then any of the other, which they cauled the towre of Conception: which he made the stronger bicause it was situate at the rootes of the golden mountaynes of Cibaua,The golden mountaynes of Cibaua. in the greate and large playne soo fruitefull and well inhabited as we haue before described. He buylded also an other in the mydde waye betwene the towre of Conception & saynt Dominikes towre. The which also was stronger then the towre of Conception, bycause it was within the lymittes of A great kynge, hauing vnder his dominion fiue thowsande men: whose chiefe Citie and heade of the Realme, beynge cauled Bonauum,
                  Bonauum he wylled that the castell shulde also bee cauled after the same name.
               Therfore leauynge the sicke men in these castels and other of the Ilande howses nere vnto the same, he hym selfe repayred to saynte Dominikes,Tribute. eractinge tributes of all the kynges whiche were in his waye. When he had taryed there A fewe dayes, there was a rumor spredde, that all the kynges abowte the borders of the towre of Conception, had conspyred with desperate myndes to rebell agenste the Spaniardes.The kynges rebelle. When the Lieuetenaunte was certified hereof, he tooke his iorneye towarde them immediately, not beyng discoraged eyther by the lengthe of the waye, or feeblenesse of his souldyers, beynge in maner forweried with trauayle. As he drewe nere vnto them, he had aduertisement that kynge Guarionexius was chosen by the other prynces to bee the Capitayne of this rebellion:Guarionexius capitaine of the conspiracie. And that he was enforsed therto halfe vnwilling, beynge seduced by theyr perswasions and prouocations. The whiche is more lykely to be trewe, for that he had before had experience of the power and policie of owre men. They came together at a daye appoynted, accoompanied with .xv. thousande men,An army of xv thou

He sent foorthe therfore to euery kynge, a Centurian, that is, a capitaine of a hundreth, which were commaunded vppon a sudden to inuade theyr howses in the night, and to take thē sleepinge, beefore the people (beinge scattered here and there) might assemble togyther. Thus secreatly enteringe into their vylages, not fortified with waules, trenches, or bulwarkes, they broke in vppon them, tooke them, bounde them,The kynges are taken p

The Lieuetenaunt hym selfe with his hundreth men, assayled kynge Guarionexius as the woorthier personage, whom he tooke prysoner as dyd the other capitaynes theyr kynges, & at the same howre appoynted. Foureteene of theym were browght the same nyght to the towre of Conception. Shortlye after, when he had put to death two of the kynges which were the chiefe autours of this newe reuolte, and had suborned Guarionexius and the other kynges to attempte the same: least the people for sorowe of theyr kynges shulde neglecte or forsake their countrey, which thinge myght haue byn greate incommoditie to owre men, who by thincrease of theyr seedes and fruites were oftentymes ayded, he freely pardoned and dismissed Guarionexius and the other kynges.kynge Guarionexius is pardoned. The people in the meane tyme flocked togyther abowte the towre, to the nōber of fyue thowsande withowte weapons, with pytiful houling for the delyueraunce of theyr kynges: The ayer thundered, & the earth trembeled throwgh the vehemencie of theyr owtery The Lieuetenaunt warned Guarionexius and the other kynges, with threatenynges, with rewardes, and with promyses, neuer hereafter to attempte any suche thynge. Then Guarionexius made an oration to the people of the great power of owre mē, of theyr clemencie towarde offenders, and liberalitie to suche as remayne faithfull: desyringe them to quiet theyr myndes: and from hensefoorth nother in deede nor thowght to interpryse any thynge ageynst the Christians, but to obeye & serue them, excepte they wolde dayly br

For vnto that day, none of them durste aduenture to taste of them by reason of theyr horrible deformitie and lothe sumnes. Yet the Lieuetenaunt beinge entysed by the pleasantnes of the kynges syster, determined to taste of the serpentes.

The mountaynes are rowgh, hygh, and suche as no man can passe to the toppes therof. They are also bendynge: and haue theyr corners reachinge downe to the sea. Betwene bothe the corners of the mountaynes, is there a greate playne, by the which many riuers faule from the mountaynes into the sea. The people are verye fierse and warlyke men,The inhabytantes of the mountaynes. hauing theyr original of the Canybales. For when they descende from the mountaynes to the playnes to keepe warre with theyr bortherers, they eate all suche as they kyll. Guarionexius therfore,Guarionexius rebelleth ageyne. flyinge to this kyng of these mountaynes, gaue hym many presentes of suche thynges as are wantinge in his countrey: therwith declaringe howe vylely, vylaynously, and violently, he had byn vsed of owre men: with whom he could nothinge preuayle nother by fayre meanes, nor by foule: nother by humilytie nor by stoutnes. And that to bee the cause of his resortinge to hym at that tyme: moste humbly desyring hym to bee his defence ageynst thoppressions of suche myscheuous people. Maiobanexius here vppon, made hym promesse to ayde and helpe hym ageynst the Christians al that he myght.

At his comminge, the Leauetenaunt asked hym what al these sturres and tumultes ment. He answered without abashemēt: Yowre brother the Admirall hath to doo therwith, and shall answere for the same before the kynge. For we perceaue that the kynge hath soo put hym in truste, that he hath hadde no regarde to vs. Here we peryshe for hunger whyle we folowe yowe: and are dryuen to seeke owre vnhappy foode in the desertes.

These shyppes by chaunce arryued fyrst on that syde of the Ilande where Roldanus Xeminus ranged with his coompanyons.

Departing sodainly from hense by reason of the contagiousnes of the ayre, he sayled .CCCCLXXX myles towarde the Weste southwest, which is the myddest betwene the weste and the southe. There was he so vexed with maladies and heate (for it was the moneth of Iune) that his shyppes were almoste sette on fyre.Contagious ayre and extreeme heate The hoopes of his barrels cracked and brake, and the fresshe water ranne owte. The men also complayned that they were not able to abyde that extremitie of heate. Here the northe pole was eleuate only .v. degrees from the Horizontall.The pole eleuate .v. degrees. For the space of .viii. dayes in the which he suffered these extremites, only the fyrst day was fayre: but all the other, clowdy and rayny: yet neuerthelesse feruent hotte.

Which wynde folowinge directly towarde the weste, he fownde the starres ouer that paralelle, placed in other order,The starres placed in other order. and an other kynde of ayer, as the Admirall hym selfe towlde me. And they al affirme, that within three dayes saylinge, they fownde moste temperate and pleasaunte ayre. The Admirall also affirmeth, that from the clime of the great heate and vnholsome ayer, he euer ascended by the backe of the sea, as it were by a hygh mountayne towarde heauen.A sea rysyng lyke a mountayne. Yet in all this tyme, coulde he not once see any lande. But at the length, the day before the Calendes of Iuly, the watcheman lookynge foorth of the toppecastell of the greatest shyppe, cryed owte alowde for ioy that he espyed three excedynge hyghe mountaynes: Exhortinge his felowes to bee of good cheere, and put away all pensiuenes. For they were very heauy and sorowfull, as well for the greefe which they susteyned by reason of thintollerable heate, as also that their freshe water fayled them, which ranne owte at the ryftes of the barels, caused by extreme heate as we haue sayde.heate causeth the barrels to breke. Thus beinge wel conforted, they drewe to the lande. Yet at theyr fyrst approche, they coulde not arryue by reason of the shalownes of the sea nere the shore. Yet lookyng owte of theyr shyppes, they might well perceaue that the Region was inhabyted and well cultured. For they sawe very fayre gardens, and pleasaunte medowes: frome the trees and herbes wherof, when the mornynge dewes beganne to ryse, there proceaded manye sweete sauoures.Swete sauours proceadynge frome the lande.

Theyr priuie partes were couered with fillettes of gossampyne cotton, of sundry coloures enterlaced: And were besyde al ouer naked.

Here the Admirall consideringe with hym selfe the corporature of this people and nature of the lande, he beleaued the same to bee soo much the nerer heauen then other Regions of the same paralelle,The higher the coulder. and further remoued from the grosse vapours of the vales and marysshes, howe muche the hygheste toppes of the byggest mountaynes are distante from the deepe vales.

               ¶ The Admiral that he myght allure the younge men to him with gentelnes, shewed them lokynge glasses, fayre & bright vesselles of copper, haukes belles, and suche other thynges vnknowen to them. But the more they were cauled, so much the more they suspected crafte and deceate, and fledde backewarde. Yet dyd they with greate admiracion beholde owre men and theyr thynges, but styll hauinge their ores in theyr handes redy to flye. When the Admirall sawe that he coulde by no meanes allure thē by gyftes, he thought to proue what he coulde do with musicall instrumentes:Musical instrumentes. and therefore commaunded that they which were in the greatest shippe, shulde play on theyr drummes and shalmes. But the younge men supposinge this to bee a token of battayle, lefte theyr ores, and in the twynlynge of an eye hadde put theyr arrowes in theyr bowes and theyr targettes on theyr armes: And thus directinge theyr arrowes towarde owre men, stoode in expectaciō
                  
to knowe what this noyse myght meane. Owre men lykewise preparinge theyr bowes and arrowes, approched toward thē by lyttle and lyttle. But they departinge from the Admirals shippe, and trustinge to the dexteritie of theyr ores came soo neare one of the lesse shippes, that one of theym plucked the clooke from the gouernour of that shippe, and as wel as they coulde by signes, requyred hym to coome alande, promysinge feyth that they wolde common with hym of peace. But when they sawe hym goo to the Admirals shippe whether he went to aske leaue that he might common with them, suspectinge heareby sume further deceate, they lept immmediatly into the Canoa, and fledde as swyft as the wynde. So that to conclude, they coulde by no meanes be allured to familiaritie.
               Wherfore the Admirall thowght it not conuenient to bestowe any longe tyme there, at this vyage. No greate space frome this Ilande, euer towarde the weste, the Admirall saith he fownde so owteragious a faule of water, runninge with such a violence from the Easte to the Weste,The violent course of the water from the Easte to the Weste. that it was nothynge inferioure to a myghty streame faulynge from hyghe mountaynes. He also confessed, that since the fyrst daye that euer he knewe what the sea mente, he was neuer in suche feare. Proceadinge yet sumwhat further in this daungerous vyage, he fownde certeyne goulfes of .viii. myles, as it had byn thenteraunce of sume greate hauen, into the which, the sayde violent streames dyd faule. These goulfes or streyghtes, he cauled Os Draconis,

That is, that for the space of .xxvi, leaques, amountynge to a hundreth and foure myles, he sayled euer by freshe water:A sea of fresh water. In so muche, that the further he proceaded, especially towarde the west, he affirmeth the water to bee the fre

with moonkeys or marmasits on that part towarde the East. For that syde was rowgh with rockye and stony mountains: And therfore not inhabyted with men. Yet they that went a lande to searche the countrey, fownde nere vnto the sea, many fayre fieldes well tylled and sowen: But noo people, nor yet houses or cotages. Parhappes they were gone further in to the countrey to sowe theyr corne and applye theyr husbandry, as wee often see owre husbande men to leaue theyr stations and vyiages for the same purpose. In the weste syde of that mountayne, they espyed a large playne, whither they made haste,The fayre & large region of paria. and cast anker in the brode ryuer. As soone as the inhabitantes had knowleage that a strange nation was arryued in theyr coastes, they came flockinge withowte all feare to see owre men. We vnderstode by theyr sygnes and poyntynges, that this Region was cauled Paria: and that it was very large: In so muche that the further it reacheth towarde the weste, to be so muche the better inhabited and replenished with people. The Admiral therfore, takynge into his shyppe foure of the men of that lande, searched the weste partes of the same. By the temperatenes of the ayer, the pleasauntnes of the grownde,Temperate ayer and frutful grounde. and the multytude of people which they saw dayly more and more as they sayled, they coniectured that these thynges portended sum great matter: As in deede their opinion fayled them not, as we wyll further declare in his place. The soonne not yet rysen, but beginninge euen now to ryse, beinge one day allured by the pleasauntnes of the place and sweete sauours which breathed from the land to the shippes,Sweete s

As owre men approched towarde them, there came certeine messengers from their Cacici, that is, the kynges of the countrey, to desyre the Admirall in the name of theyr princes to coome to theyr palayces withowte feare,humayne people. and that they and al theyrs shulde bee at his commaundement. When the Admirall had thanked them and made his excuse for that tyme, there came innumerable people with theyr boates to the shippes: hauyng for the most parte cheynes abowte theyr neckes, garlandes on theyr heades, and braselettes on theyr armes of pearles of India:Cheynes and garlandes of gold & perles And that so commonlye, that owre women in playes and tryumphes haue not greater plentie of stones of glasse and crystall

in theyr garlandes, crownes, gerdels, and suche other tyrementes. Beinge asked where they gathered them, they poynted to the next shore by the sea bankes. They signified also by certeyne scorneful giestures which they made with theyr mouthes and handes, that they nothyng esteemed perles.Baskettes ful of pearles, I knowe who had bags ful. Taking also baskettes in their handes, they made signes that the same might bee fylled with them in shorte space. But bycause the corne wherwith his shyppes were laden to bee caryed into Hispaniola, had taken hurt by reason of the salte water, he determined to deferre this marte to a more conuenient tyme. Yet he sent to lande two of the shippe boates laden with men, to thintent to fetch sum garlandes of perles for exchange of our thynges, and also sumwhat to searche the nature of the Region and disposition of the people. They enterteyned owr mē gentelly:howe the Admirals men were enterteyned. and came flockynge to them by heapes, as it hadde byn to beholde sume straunge monsters. Fyrste there came to meete owre men, two men of grauitie, whome the multitude folowed. One of these was well in age, and the other but younge. They thinke it was the father with his soonne whiche shulde succede hym. When the one had saluted and embrased the other, they browght owre men into a certeyne rownde howse, nere vnto the whiche, was a greate courte. Hether were browght many chayers and stooles made of a certeyne blacke woodde,cheyers and st

After that owre men, and theyr Princes were sette, theyr wayting men came in laden, sume with sundry delicate dysshes, and sume with wyne.Fruites and wyne. But theyr meate, was only fruites: and those of dyuers kyndes and vtterly vnknowē to vs. Theyr wyne was both whyte and redde: not made of grapes, but of the lycour of dyuers fruites, and very pleasaunte in drynkynge.wyne of the lycour of fruites. After this banquette made in the owlde mans howse, the younge man browght them to his tabernacle or mancion place, where was a greate coompany bothe of men and women, but they stoode deceauered the one from the other. They are whyte,whyte men nere the Equinoctial euen as owre men are, sauynge suche as are much conuersant in the sonne. They are also very gentyll, and full of humanitie towarde strangiers. They coouer theyr pryuie partes with gossampine cotton wrowght with sundry coloures: and are besyde all naked. There was fewe or none, that had not eyther a coller, a cheyne, or a braselette of golde and pearles,

and many had all. Beinge asked where they had that golde, they poynted to certeyne mountaynes,mountaynes are the matrices of golde. seemynge with theyr countenaunce to dissuade owre men from goinge thyther. For puttinge theyr armes in theyr mouthes, and grynninge as thowgh they bytte the same, stylle poyntinge to the mountaynes, they seemed to insinuate that men were eaten there: But whether they mente by the Canibales,Canibales or wylde beastes owre men cowlde not well perceaue. They tooke it excedinge greeuouslye, that they coulde nother vnderstande owre men, nor owre men them. When they which were sente to lande, were returned to the shippes abowte three of the clocke at after noone the same daye, bringinge with them certeyne garlandes and collers of pearles, they loosed theyr ankers to departe, myndinge to coome ageyne shortly, when all thynges were sette in good order in Hispaniola. But he was preuented by an other, which defeated hym of the rewarde of his trauayle. He was also hyndered at this tyme by reasō of the shalownes of the sea & violēt course of the water,Shalownes of the sea, which with continual tossing, broosed the greatest ship as often as any great gale of wynde arose.

Wherof the gouernour hauinge knowleage (as he saythe) beinge also aduertised that the Leauetenaunt was gonne to his brother before the men which he had prepared were in a redines, apprehended them bothe vnwares, before the multitude came togyther.

Yet sayled they on further (not without greate daunger) for the space of twoo hundrethe and fortie leaques, folowing yet the same wynde by the lost pole. Wherfore, whether habitable Regions bee vnder the Equinoctiall lyne or not,habitable Regions vnder the Equinoctial lyne. let these men and the owlde wryters, aswel Philosophers as poetes and cosmographers discusse.

Yet were there many of the oulde wryters, whiche attempted to proue it habitable. These maryners beinge demaunded, if they sawe the south pole, they answered that they knewe no starre there lyke vnto this pole, that myght be decerned aboute the poynte. But that they sawe an other order of starres, and a certeyne thicke myst rysynge from the horizontall lyne,An other order of starres A thycke mist which greatly hyndered theyr syght. They contende also, that there is a great heape or rysynge in the myddest of the earth,A rysinge in the myddest of the earth. which taketh away the syght of the southe pole, vntyll they haue vtterly passed ouer the same. But they verely beleue that they sawe other images of starres, muche differinge from the situation of the starres of owre hemispherie or halfe circle of heauen. Howe soo euer the matter bee, as they informe vs, wee certifie yowe. At the lengthe, the seuenth day of the calendes of Februarye, they espied lande a farre of.

Goinge a lande, and tarienge there for the space of twoo dayes, they departed bycause they saw no people steringe, althowghe they fownde certeyne steppes of men by the sea syde. Thus grauinge on the trees and the stones nere vnto the shore, the kynges name and theyrs, and the tyme of theyr comming thether, they departed. Not farre frō this station, folowynge the fyers on the lande by nyght, they founde a nation lyinge vnder the open fyrmamente after the maner of warre. Owre men thought it not beste to trowble them vntyll the morninge. Therefore, at the rysinge of the soonne, fortie of owre men well armed, wente toward them: ageynst whom came furth .xxxii. of them, with bowes, slinges

But owre men thought it not good to faule to bickeringe with them, vncerteyne whether it were for feare, or bycause they wolde not dryue thē to flight. Wherfore they went aboute to allure them by faire meanes & rewardes. But they refused all kynde of gentelnes, & stoode euer in a redines to feight, declaringe the same by signes and tokens. Thus owr men resorted to theyr shippes, and they to the place from whence they came, without any further busynes. The same nyght abowte mydnyght, they fledde, and left the place voyde where they lay in campe. Owre men suppose them to bee a vagabunde and wanderinge nacion lyke vnto the Scythians,A vagabunde kynde of men withowte houses or certeyne dwellinge places, lyuinge onely with the fruites of the earth, hauing theyr wyues and chyldren folowinge them. Such as measured their footesteppes in the sande, affirme with greate othes, that one of theyr feete is almost as longe as twoo feete of owre men of the meane sorte. Saylinge on yet further,Giantes. they founde an other ryuer, but not of deapth sufficient to beare the carauels. They sent therfore the foure shippe boates to lande, ful of armed men to search the countrey. They espyed vppon a hyghe hyll nere vnto the sea syde, a greate multitude of people, to whom owre coompany sent furthe one man with certeyne of owre thynges to allure them to exchaunge. And when he had cast a haukes bell towarde them, they cast downe a wedge of golde a cubette longe. The which as he stouped to take vppe, they soodenly inclosed hym, and caryed hym awaye. But he was shortly after rescued by his coompanyons, to sum of their paynes: for they slewe eyght of owre men, and wounded many a farre of, with theyr arrowes, and dartes made of wood hardened at the endes with fyre. After this, they encoompased owre shippe boates within the ryuer, and came rasshelye within the reache of owre men,Desperate bouldenes. layinge houlde on the boates sydes, where they were thrust throwgh and hewen in peeces as it had byn sheepe, by reason they were naked. Yet wolde they not for al this, gyue ouer: but tooke from owre men one of their boates, hauing noo men in it. For the gouernour therof

being slayne with an arrowe, the other fledde and escaped. And thus they lefte this fierce and warlyke people, saylinge towarde the northweste alonge by the same coastes, with sorowfull hartes for the death of theyr coompanyons.

These twoo Pinzoni, the vncle and the neuie, susteyned manye great trowbles and horrible tempestes and perilles in this nauigation. For when they had nowe sayled by the coastes of Paria abowte .vi. hundreth leaques, and (as they supposed) beyonde the citie of Cathay and the coastes of Easte India beyonde the ryuer of Ganges,Cathay in India beyonde the ryuer of Ganges there rose soodenly soo fierce a tempeste in the mooneth of Iuly, that, of the foure carauels which they had with them, twoo were drowned euen beefore theyr eyes:A shipwracke by tempest. and the thyrde lyenge at anker, with lyke soodennes caryed owte of theyr syght throwgh the violence of the tempeste: The fourth also lyinge at anker, was soo shaken and broosed, that al the seames therof were almost loosed. Yet came they to lande owt of this laste shyppe, but vtterlye despayrynge of the shyppe.

With these two therfore, they tooke theyr vyage directly to Spaine And thus beinge tossed with tempestes and vexed with aduersities, they returned to theyr natiue contrey of Palos, to theyr wyues and children, the day before the Calendes of October, with the losse of many of theyr dere frendes and neighbours.

As touchinge this vyage, as yet I knowe noo other newes that I thought worthy to certifie yowe of. Wherfore, I wyl nowe make an ende of this booke, bycause yow put me so often in rememberance of your departure. Yet to accomplysshe the Decade, I wyll declare sumwhae of the superstitions of Hispaniola.

departinge sumwhat farre from the caue to thintente to see what thynges were abrode, was soodenly taken of the soonne (whose sight he was forbydden) and was turned into a stone. They fayne the lyke of dyuers other, that whereas they went foorthe in the nyghte season a fysshynge, so farre from the caue that they coulde not returne before the rysynge of the soone (the which it was not lawful for them to behold) they were transformed into myrobalane trees,The original of Mirobalane trees. which of them selues growe plentifully in the Ilande. They saye furthermore, that a certeyne ruler cauled Vagoniona, sent one furth of the caue to goo a fysshynge, who by lyke chaunce was turned into a nyghtyngale bycause the soonne was rysen beefore he came ageyne to the caue:The nightingale. And that yearelye abowte the same tyme that he was turned into a byrde, he dothe in the nyght with a moornynge songe bewayle his mysfortune, and caule for the helpe of his maister Vagoniona. And this they thynke to bee the cause why that byrde singeth in the night season. But Vagoniona, beinge sore troubled in his mynd for the losse of his familier frende whom he loued soo intierly, leauinge the men in the caue, brought foorth onely the women with theyr suckynge chyldren, leauinge the women in one of the Ilandes of that tracte, cauled Mathinino,

These thynges to this day are had in greate estimation amonge the kynges, as goodly iewels and most holy reliques.holy reliques These men whiche we sayde before were lefte in the caues withowte women, went furth in the nyght (as they say) to wasshe them selues in a ponde of raine water

For they saye that there was once in the Ilande, a man of greate power, whose name was Iaia: whose only soonne being dead, he buryed hym within a greate gourde.A vengeable greate gourd. This Iaia, greuouslye takyng the death of his soonne, after a fewe moonthes, came ageyne to the gourde: The which when he had opened, there isshewed foorth many great whales and other monsters of the sea:The originall of the sea. where vppon he declared to suche as dwelt abowte hym, that the sea was enclosed in that gourde. By which report, foure brethren (borne of one woman who dyed in her trauail) beinge moued, came to the gourde in hope to haue many fysshes. The whiche when they had taken in theyr handes, and espied Iaia comming, (who oftentymes resorted to the gourd

And this is the oppinion of theyr wyse men as concernynge thoriginall of the sea. But nowe (most noble prince) you shall heare a more pleasaunt fable. There is a certeyne caue cauled Iouanaboina, in the territorye of a certeyne kynge whose name is Machinnech. This caue they honour more religiously then dyd the Grekes in tyme paste, Corinth, Cyrrha, or Nysa:A holy caue. And haue adourned it with pictures of a thousand fasshions.

If therfore by lacke of the nauell he doo perceaue that a deade body lyeth by hym, the feelynge is immediatly resolued.

As soone as they perceaue him to bee gonne, a great multitude of them gather togyther to seeke hym with deuoute prayers: And when they haue fownde hym, brynge hym home religiously on theyr shulders to the chapell dedicated vnto hym. But they coomplayne that sence the commynge of the Christian men into the Ilande, he fledde for all togyther, and coulde neuer sence bee founde, wherby they diuined the destruction of theyr countrey. They honoured an other Zemes in the lykenes of a woman, on whom wayted twoo other lyke men, as they were ministers to her. One of these, executed thoffice of a mediatour to the other Zemes which are vnder the power and commaundement of this woman,Mediatours,
                  A woman zemes of great poure. to rayse wyndes, cloudes, and rayne. The other is also at her commaundemente a messenger to the other Zemes whiche are ioyned with her in gouernaunce, to gather togyther the waters whiche faule from the hygh hylles to the valleys, that beinge loosed, they may with force brust owte into greate fluddes and ouerflowe the countrey if the people doo not gyue due honoure to her Image. There remayneth yet one thynge woorthy to bee noted, wherwith we wyll make an ende of this booke. It is a thynge well knowen, and yet fresshe in memory amonge the inhabitantes of the Ilande, that there was sumetyme twoo kynges (of the which one was the father of Guarionexius of whō we made mention before) which were woont to absteyne fyue dayes togyther continually from meate and drinke,Fyue dayes fastinge. to knowe sumwhat of theyr Zemes of thynges to coome:A maruelous il

And that for this fastynge beinge acceptable to theyr Zemes, they receaued answere of them, that within fewe yeares, there shuld coome to the Ilande a nation of men couered with apparell, which shulde destroye al the customes and cerymonyes of the Iland. and eyther sley all theyr chyldren,The deuyll sumtyme telleth truth. or brynge them into seruitude. The common sort of the people, vnderstoode this oracle to bee mente of the Canibales. And therefore when they had any knowleage of theyr commyng, they euer fledde, and were fully determyned neuer more thaduenture the battayle with them. But when they sawe that the Spanyardes had entered into the Ilande, consultinge amonge them selues of the matter,

they concluded that this was the nation which was mēt by thoracle.The Idols abolyshed. Wherin, theyr opinion deceaued them not. For they are nowe all subiecte to the Christians, all suche beinge slayne as stoobernely resisted. Nor yet remayneth there anye memory of theyr Zemes: for they are al brought into Spayne, that we myght bee certified of theyr illusions of euyl spirites and Idoles, the which yowe yowre selfe (most noble Prince) haue seene and felte when I was presente with yowe.

                  AT the fyrst begynnynge and newe attempte, when Colonus had taken vppon hym thenterpryse to search the Ocean sea, I was ernestly moued and requyred by the letters of certeyne of my frendes and noble men of Rome to wryte suche thynges as shoulde happen. For they whyspered with greate admiracion, that where as there were many newe landes founde, and nations which liued naked and after the lawe of nature,The Lawe of nature. they coulde here noo certentie therof, beinge greately desyrous of the same.

to persuade me, euen soo slacked my feruentnes to enquyre any further, vntyl the yeare of Christe .1500. When the court remayned at Granata where yowe are viceroye: At which time Lodouike the Cardinall of Aragonie, neuie to kynge Frederike by his brothers syde (beinge at Granata with the queene Parthenopea the syster of owre catholike kynge) browght me kynge Frederikes letters, wherby he exhorted me to fynyshe the other bookes whiche folowed the twoo epystell bookes,Epistel books which I wryte to Ascanius. For they both acknowleaged that they hadde the copie of all that I wryte to cardinall Ascanius. And albeit that euen then I was sicke (as yowe knowe) yet tooke I the burden vppon me, and applyed my selfe to wrytynge. I haue therfore chosen these fewe thynges, owte of a greate heape of suche as seemed to me most woorthy to bee noted amonge the large wrytynges of the autoures and searchers of the same. Wherfore, forasmuch as yowe haue endeuoured to wreste owt of my handes the hole exemple of al my woorkes, to adde the same to the innumerable volumes of yowre librarie, I thowght it good nowe to make a breefe rehersall of those thynges which were done from that yeare of a thowsande and fyue hundreth,The historye folowing, conteyneth the actes of ten yeare. euen vnto this yeare which is the tenth from that. For I entende to wryte more largelye of these thynges hereafter, if god graunte me lyfe. I hadde wrytten a hole booke by it selfe of the superstitions of the people of the Ilande, supposinge therwith to haue accomplyshed the hole Decade consistynge of tenne bookes. But I haue added this to the tenthe as a perpendiculer lyne, and as it were a backe guyde or rerewarde to the other: So that yowe may knytte the fyrst tenthe, to the nynthe, and impute this to occupie the place of the tenthe to fyll vp the Decade. This order haue I appoynted, lest I shulde bee compelled often times to wryte ouer the hole woorke, or sende yowe the same defaced with blottes and interlynynge. But nowe let vs coome to owre purpose. The shippe masters and maryners ranne ouer many coastes durynge these tenne yeares: But euer folowed suche as were fyrste fownde by Colonus. For rasinge continually alonge by the tracte of Paria,

For they are excedinge fierce, and vse venemous arrowes, and longe staues lyke iauelens, made harde at the ende with fyer. They fownde many beastes,Innumerable beastes vnlyke vnto owres. both creepinge and foure footed, muche differinge from owres, variable and of sundrye shapes innumerable: yet not hurtflul, excepte Lyons, Tygers, and Crocodiles. This I meane in sundry Regions of that greate lande of Paria: but not in the Ilandes: Noo not soo much as one. For all the beastes of the Ilandes, are meeke and withowte hurte,Nothing hurtfull in the Ilandes. except men which (as wee haue sayde) are in many Ilandes deuourers of mans flesshe. There are also dyuers kyndes of foules. And in many places battes of such bygnes, that they are equall with turtle doues.Battes as bygge as turtle doues. These battes, haue often tymes assauted men in the nyght in theyr sleepe, and soo bytten them with theyr venemous teethe, that they haue byn therby almoste dryuen to madnes, in soo much that they haue byn compelled to flye from such places, as from rauenous harpies. In an other place, where certeyne of them slepte in the nyght season on the sandes by the sea syde, a monster commynge owte of the sea,A man deuoured of a monster of the sea came vppon one of them secreatly and caryed hym away by the myddeste owte of the sight of his felowes to whome he cryed in vayne for helpe vntyll the beaste lepte into the sea with her praye.

Where vnto they were soo wel wyllynge, that dyuers profered them selues to take vppon them the subduing of the lande, makyng great sute to the kynge that they might bee appoynted therto. The coaste of this tracte is exceadynge greate and large: and the Regions and landes therof extende maruelous farre:Note the largenes of the newe landes. Soo that they affirme the continent of these Regions with the Ilandes abowte the same, to bee thryse as bygge as al Europe, besyde those landes that the Portugales haue fownde southwarde, whiche are also exceadynge large. Therfore doubtlesse Spayne hathe deserued greate prayse in these owre dayes,Commendacion of the Spaniardes. in that it hath made knowen vnto vs soo

                  Cuba, is an Ilande. (which of longe tyme they thowght to haue byn firme lande for the greate length therof) is an Ilande. Yet is it noo maruell that thinhabitantes them selues

towlde owre men when they searched the length therof, that it was withowte ende. For this nacion being naked and contente with a lyttle, and with the limittes of theyr owne contrey, is not greatly curyous to know what theyr neyghbours doo, or the largenes of theyr dominion. Nor yet knewe they if there were any other thinge vnder heauen, besyde that whiche they walked on with theyr feete. Cuba,

Eastwarde not farre from Hispaniola, there lyethe an Ilande, lesse then Hispaniola more then by the halfe, which owre men cauled Sancti Iohannis,

To euery such wyttie and skylfull man as is put in truste to bee a suruoier or ouerseer of these woorkes, there is assigned one or more kynges of the Ilande with theyr subiectes.The kynges brynge theyr subiectes to woorke in the golde mynes. These kynges accordyng to theyr league, coome with theyr people at certeyne tymes of the yeare, and resorte euery of them to the golde myne to the which he is assigned: where they haue all maner of dygginge or myninge tooles deliuered them: And euery kynge with his men, haue a certeyne rewarde alowed them for theyr labour. For when they departe from the mynes to sowynge of corne, and other tyllage (wherunto they are addict at certeyne other tymes,Tyllage. leaste theyr foode shulde fayle them) they receaue for theyr laboure, one a ierken, or a dublet, an other a sherte, an other a cloke or a cappe. For they nowe take pleasure in these thynges, and goo no more naked as they were wont too doo. And thus they vse the helpe and laboure of the inhabitantes both for the tyllage of theyr ground, and in theyr gold mines as thowghe they were theyr seruauntes or bondemen. They beare this yoke of seruitude with an euyll wyll: but yet they beare it. They caule these hyred labourers, Anaborias. Yet the kynge doth not suffer that they shulde bee vsed as bondemen:

And onely at his pleasure they are sette at libertie or appoynted to woorke. At suche tyme as they are cauled together of theyr kynges to woorke (as souldiers or pioners are assembled of theyr centurians) many of them stele away to the mountaynes and wooddes, where they lye luckynge,They abhorre laboure being content for that tyme to lyue with wyld frutes, rather then take the paynes to laboure. They are docible and apte to lerne,They are docible. and haue nowe vtterly forgotten theyr owlde supersticions. They beleue godly, and beare wel in memory suche thynges as they haue lerned of owre faith. Theyr kynges children are brought vp with the chiefest of owre men,The kynges chyldren. and are instructed in letters and good maners. When they are growen to mans age, they sende them home to theyr countreys to bee exemple to other, and especially to gouerne the people if theyr fathers bee dead that they maye the better set foorthe the Christian Religion, and keepe theyr subiectes in loue and obedience. By reason whereof, they coome nowe by fayre meanes and gentell persuasions to the mynes which lye in twoo Regions of the Ilande aboute thirtie myles distante frome the citie of Dominica: wherof the one is cauled Sancti Christophori:
                  The two chiefe golde myres of hispaniola. And the other being distante aboute foure score and tenne myles, is cauled Cibaua, not farre from the cheefe hauen cauled Portus Regalis. These regions are very large: In the which in many places here and there, are fownd sumtyme euen in the vpper crust of the earth and sumtyme amonge the stones,Golde founde in the vpper part of the earth. certeyne rounde pieces or plates of golde, sumtyme of smaule quantitie, and in sum places of great weyght: In so muche that there hath byn found rounde pieces of three hundreth pounde weyght, and one of three thousande, three hundreth and tenne pounde weyght:A piece of golde weighinge three thousande three hūdreth & ten pounds.

Albeit, there were moo then a thowesande persons whiche sawe and handeled the piece of golde.

Wherefore I wyl nowe brefely reherse in order, what hyd coastes the Spanyardes ouerranne, who were the autours therof, where they rested, what further hope they browght, and fynallye what great thynges those tractes of landes doo promesse in tyme to coome. In the declaration of my decade of the Ocean, which is nowe printed and dispersed throwghowte Christendome vnwares to me, I described howe Christophorus Colonus fownde those Ilandes wherof we haue spoken,

Wherfore aboute the Ides of December, Alphonsus departinge fyrst with three hundreth souldiers from the Ilande of Hispaniola (in the which wee sayde the Spanyardes had builded a citie, and planted theyr habitacion) and saylynge in maner full southe, he came to one of the

This porte is dystant foure hundreth fyftie and syxe myles from that parte of Hispaniola which the Spanyardes caule Beata, in the which also they furnysshe them selues when they prepare anye vyage to seeke other newe landes. When Fogeda had entered into the hauen,Fogeda his autoritie confirmed by the kynges letters patents. he inuaded, slewe, and spoyled the people, whome he founde naked and scattered. For they were gyuen hym for a praye, by the kynges letters patentes bycause they hadde bin before tyme cruel ageynst the Christians, and coulde neuer bee allured to permytte them quietly to coome within theyr dominions. Here they founde gold, but in no greate quantitie, nor yet that pure. They make of it, certeyne brest plates and brooches, which they weare for coomelynes. But Fogeda not content with these spoyles, vsinge certeyne captiues whiche he had taken before, for guydes, entered into a vyllage twelue myles distante frome the sea syde further into the lande, into the whiche they were fledde whom he fyrst inuaded.warlyke people.

And thus in shorte tyme they browght theym and theyr howses to asshes, and made them pay the raunsome of bludde with bludde.A greate slawghter. For of a greate multitude of men and women, they spared onely syxe chyldren, al other being destroyed with fyer or sword except fewe which escaped priuilye. They lerned by the reserued chyldren, that Cossa and his felowes were cutte in pieces and eaten of them that slewe them. By reason wherof, they suppose that these people of Caramairi tooke theyr originall of the Caribes otherwyse cauled Canibales.

                   that is, the house of the catte, bycause they sawe a catte first in that place: and Boium, in the toonge of Hispaniola, is a house. Ancisus came with a shyppe laden with all thynges necessarye, bothe for meate and drynke, and apparell, bryngynge also with hym an other brigantine. This is he for whose comming

the capitayne Fogeda looked for soo longe. He loosed anker from Hispaniola in the Ides of September: And the fourth day after his departure, he espyed certeyne hyghe mountaynes,Mountaynes couered with snowe. the whiche for the abundance of snowe which lyeth continually in the toppes therof, the Spanyardes cauled Serra Neuata,

                   They whiche were in the brygantyne, towlde Ancisus that Fogeda was returned to Hispaniola. But Ancisus supposing that they had fayned that tale, commaunded them by thautoritie of his commission to turne backe ageyne. The brigantiners obeyed and folowed hym: yet made they humble sute vnto hym that he woolde graunte them that with his fauour they myght eyther goo ageyne to Hispaniola, or that he hym selfe woolde brynge theim to Nicuesa: And that they woolde for his gentelnes declared towarde them in this behalfe, rewarde hym with twoo thousande drammes of golde. For they were ryche in golde, but poore in breade.Riche in gold and pore in breade. But Ancisus assented to neyther of theyr requestes: affirmynge that he myght by no meanes goo anye other way then to Vraba the prouince assigned to Fogeda. Where vppon, by theyr conduct, he tooke his vyage directly toward Vraba. But nowe let it not seme tedious to yowre holynes to heare of one thyng worthy to bee remembred, which chaunced to this Lieuetenaunt Ancisus as he came thether. For he also cast anker in the coastes of the region of Caramairi whiche wee sayde to bee famous by reason of the hauen of Carthago:The Region of Caramairi and of the goodly stature, strength, and beawty of both men and women beinge in the same. Here he sent certeyne to goo alande on the shore, both to fetche fresshe water, and also to repaire the shippe boate which was sore broosed. In this meane tyme A greate multitude of the people of the countrey armed after theyr maner,Feare on both partes. came aboute owre men as they were occupied abowte theyr busynes, and stoode in a redynes to feight, for the space of three dayes contynually: durynge whiche tyme, neyther durst they set vppon owre men, nor owre men assayle them. Thus bothe parties keepynge theyr arraye, stoode styl three hole dayes the one gasynge on the other. Yet all this tyme owre men applyed theyr woorke, placinge the shippewrightes in the myddeste of theyr armye.Ship w

One of owre men fledde: but the other remayned, caulynge his felowe ageyne and rebukynge hym for his fearefulnes. Then he spake to the barbarians in their owne language which he had lerned beinge conuersant with the captiues that were caryed from thense longe before. They marueylynge to here a straunger speake in their natiue tonge, put of theyr fiercenes and fell to frendly communication, demaundinge who were the capitaynes of that coompanie whiche were arryued in theyr lande. He answered that they were strangers passyng by: And that he marueyled why they wold attempte to dryue them from theyr coastes and disturbe theyr shyppes: arguinge theim of follye and crueltie, and further threatinge their ruine and destruction, except they woold vse them selues more frendely towarde them. For hee aduertised them that there wolde shortly coome into theyr lande armed men, in nōber lyke to the sandes of the sea: And that to theyrter destruction, not only if they resysted them not, but also excepte they receaued them and enterteyned them honorably. In the meane tyme Ancisus was enformed that his men were deteyned. Wherefore suspectinge sume deceate, he browght furth al his target men for feare of theyr venemous arrowes:The vse of targettes agenst venemous arrowes. And settinge them in battell arraye, he marched forwarde towarde them which steyed his men. But he which communed with the barbarians, gyuinge him a signe with his hande to procede noo further, he steyed. And cauling to hym the other, he knewe that all was safe. For the barbarians profered him peace, bycause they were not they whom they suspected them to haue byn: meanynge by Fogeda and Nicu

Here the hole assemble beinge carefull and disquieted by reason of the gouernours erroure, after consultacion, by thaduise of the capitaynes of the brigantines, who had rased nere vnto the coastes of Beragua, they sayled directly thether. Beragua, in the language of thinhabitantes of the same prouince, is as much to saye, as the golden ryuer.The golden ryuer of Beragua. The region it selfe is also cauled by the same name, takynge name of the ryuer. In the mouth of this ryuer, the greatest vessels cast anker, and conueighed al theyr vytailes and other necessaries to lande with theyr shippe boates: and elected Lupus Olanus to bee theyr gouernour in the steede of Nicuesa whom they had loste. By thaduice therfore of Olanus and the other vnder capitaynes, that all hope of departure myght bee taken from the souldiers which they had nowe browght thether, and to make them the more wyllinge to inhabite that land, they vtterly forsooke and caste of those shyppes beinge nowe rotten for age, and suffered them to bee shaken and broosed of the surges of the sea. Yet of theyr soundeste plankes, with other newe, made of the trees of that Region (which they say to be excedinge bygge and hygh) they framed a newe carauel shortly after, whiche they myght vse to serue for theyr necessitie. But Beragua was founde by the vnfortunate destenie of Petrus de Vmbria.

For he, beinge a man of prompt wytte and apt forwardenes to attempte thynges (in whiche sumetyme fortune wyll beare a stroke notwithstandinge owre prouidence) tooke vpon hym thaduenture to searche the shore to thintent to find a waye for his felowes where they myght beste coome alande. For this purpose, he chose hym twelue maryners, and wente aboorde the shippe boate whiche serued the greateste shyppes. The flowinge of the sea, raged and rored there, with a horrible whurlinge as wee reede of the daungerous place of Scylla in the sea of Scicilie,The daungerous place of Scilla in the sea of Cicilie. by reason of the houge and ragged rockes reachyng into the sea, from which the waues rebounding with violence, make a greate noyse and rowghnes on the water, whiche rowghnes or reflowinge, the Spanyardes caule

But in shorte space, a waue of the sea almoste as bygge as a mountayne, reboundinge from the rockes, ouerwhelmed the boate and deuoured the same with the men, euen in the sight of theyr felowes: So that of them all, onely one escaped by reason he was experte in swymmynge.Swymminge For gettinge holde of the corner of a rocke, and susteynynge the rage of the sea vntyll the nexte daye when it wexed caulme, and the shore was drye by the faule of the water, he escaped and resorted to his coompanye. But Vmbria with the other eleuen, were vtterlye caste away. The resydue of the coompany, durst not commite them selues to the shippe boates, but went alande with theyr brigantines. Where remaynynge a fewe dayes, and saylinge alonge by the ryuer, they founde certeyne vyllages of thinhabitantes, which they caule Mumu. Here they beganne to build a fortresse, and to sowe seedes after the maner of theyr countrey, in a certeyne vale of frutefull grownde, bicause in other places the region is baren. As these thynges were thus dooinge in Beragua, one of their coompanye standynge vppon the toppe of a hyghe rocke of especiall, and lyftynge his eyes towarde the Weste, beganne to crye, Lynnyn sayles, lynnyn sayles. And the nerer it drewe towarde hym, he perceaued it to bee a shyppe boate comminge with a lyttle sayle. Yet receaued they it with muche reioysinge: for it was the fyssher boate of Nicuesa his carauele,The fyssher boate of Nicuesa his carauele. and of capacitie to carye onely fyue men, and had nowe but three in it, which had stoulne it from Nicuesa bycause he refused to gyue credit to theim that he had passed Beragua, and lefte it behynde hym Eastwarde. For they seinge Nicuesa and his felowes to consume dayely by famynne, thowght they woolde proue fortune with that boate, if their chaunce myght bee to fynde Beragua, as in deede it wss. Debatinge therefore with theyr felowes, of these matters, they declared howe Nicuesa erred and loste the carauele by tempest,The miserable case of Nicuesa. and that he was nowe wanderinge amonge the marysshes of vnknowen coastes, full of myserie and in extreeme penurie of all thynges, hauinge nowe lyued for the space of three score and tenne dayes, only with herbes and rootes, and syldoome with frutes of the countrey, contented to drinke water, and yet that often tymes faylynge, bycause he was instant to trauayle westwarde by foote, supposing by that meanes to come

to Beragua. Colonus the fyrste fynder of this mayne lande, had coasted alonge by this tracte, and named it Gratia Dei: but the inhabitantes caule it Cerabaro.
                  The Region of Gratia Dei or Cerabaro. Throwghe this Region, there runneth a ryuer which owre men named Sancti Matthei,
                  The ryuer of Sancti Matthei. distante from the weste syde of Beragua aboute a hundrethe and thirtie myles. Here I lette passe the name of this ryuer, and of manye other places by the names which thinhabitantes vse, bycause owre men are ignorant thereof. Thus Lupus Olanus the conductor of one of the shippes of Nicuesa, and nowe also vice Leauetenaunt in his steede, after that he hadde receaued this information of the maryners, sente thether a brigantine vnder theyr guydynge, these maryners therfore, which came in the fyssher boate, founde Nicuesa,
                  The rigorousnes of Nicuesa. and browght hym to the place where Olanus laye, whome at his commynge he caste in pryson, and accused hym of treason bycause he vsurped thautoritie of the Lieuetenauntshippe, and that for the desyre he had to beare rule and bee in autoritie, he tooke no care of his errours: also that he behaued hym selfe negligently: demaundinge further more of hym, what was the cause of his soo longe delay. Lykewyse he spake to al the vnder officers sharplye and with a troubled mynde: And within fewe dayes after commaunded them to trusse vp theyr packes, and make them redye to departe. They desyred hym to quyet hym selfe, and to forbeare them a while vntyl they had reaped the corne that they had sowne, which wolde shortly bee rype. For all kynd of corne waxeth rype there euery fourth moonethe after it is sowne.Come wa

After they had sayled aboute the space of .xvi. myles, a certeyne younge man whose name was Gregorie, a Genues borne, and of a chylde browght vp with Colonus,
                  The commendacion of a younge man browght vp with Colonus cauled to rememberance that there was a hauen not farre frome thense: And to proue his sayinge trewe, he gaue his felowes these tokens: that is, that they shulde fynde vppon the shore, an anker of a loste shyppe halfe couered with sande: And vnder a tree nexte vnto the hauen, a sprynge of cleere water. They came to the lande: founde the anker and the sprynge, and commended the wytte and memorye of the

younge man, that he only amonge many of the marynes whiche had searched those coastes with Colonus, bore the thynge soo well in mynde. This hauen, Colonus cauled Portus Bellus.
                  
                     Portus Bellus.
                   Wheras in this vyage for lacke of vytayles they were sumetymes enforced to goo alande, they were euel entreated of the inhabitantes. By reason wherof, theyr strengthes were soo wekened with hūger,weakenes of hunger. that they were not able to keepe warre ageynst naked men, or scarsely to beare theyr harnes on their backes. And therfore owre men loste twentie of theyr coompanie, which were slayne with venemous arrowes. They consulted to leaue the one halfe of theyr felowes in the hauen of Portus Bellus: And the other parte Nicu

                     Cap Marmor.
                   But they were soo feeble by reason of longe hunger, that theyr strength serued them not to susteyne suche laboure. Yet he erected a lyttle towre able to resyst the fyrst assaute of the inhabitantes. This towre he cauled Nomen Dei.
                  
                     Nomen Dei.
                   From the tyme that he left Beragua, what in the iorney amonge the sandie playnes, then also for hunger whyle he buylded the towre,Nicuesa his men cōsumed of the fewe which remayned a lyue, he loste twoo hundreth. And thus by lyttle and lyttle, the multitude of seuen hundreth foure score and fyue men, was nowe browght to scarsely one hundreth. Whyle Nicuesa lyued with these few miserable men, there arose a contētion amonge them of Vraba,
                  Contencion about the lieuetenauntship of Uraba. as concerninge the Lieuetenantshippe. For one Vaschus Nunnez,

                  Ancisus lieuetenaunt for Fogeda. And therfore forbodde that he shulde execute the office of the Lieuetenaunteshippe: And wylled theym to chuse certeyne of theyr owne coompanye, by whose counsayle and authoritie they myght bee gouerned.
               Thus beinge diuided into factions by reason that Fogeda, their capitayne came not ageyne, whom they supposed to bee nowe deade of his venemous wounde, they contended whether it were beste to substitute Nicuesa in his place. The wyseste sorte suche as were famylier with Nicuesa, and coulde not beare thinsolencie

                   sowght owt throwgh owt all those coastes. For they had knoweledge that he departed from Beragua bycause of the barennes of the grounde: And that by thexemple of Ancisus, and suche other as had made shippewracke, it were possible that he might wander in sume secreate place: And that they coulde not be quiete in theire myndes vntyll they knewe the certētie, whether he with his felowes were alyue or deade. But Vaschus Nunnez, fearinge leaste at the commyng of Nicuesa he shulde not bee had in autoritie emonge his felowes, sayde they were mad men to thinke that Nicuesa lyued: And althowgh he were alyue, yet that they hadde noo neade of his helpe. For he auouched that there was none of his felowes, that were not as meete to rule as Nicuesa. While they were thus reasonynge too and froo, one Rodericus Colmenaris arryued in those coastes with two greate shippes hauinge in theym three score fresshe men,
                     Rodericus Colmenaris.

                  The nauigation of Rodericus Colmenaris. I intende to speake sumewhat more. He therfore departed from the hauen of Hispaniola cauled Beata (where they prepare and furnysshe theym selues whiche make any viage into these landes) aboute the Ides of October in the yeare .1510: And landed the .ix. of Nouember in a Region in the large prouince of Paria founde by Colonus betwene the hauen Carthago and the Region of Cuchibachoa.
                  
                     Cuchibacoa.
                   In this viage what by the rowghnes of the sea & fiercenes of the barbariās, he suffered many incommodities. For when his fresshe water fayled, he sayled to the mouthe of a certeyne riuer which thinhabitantes caule Gaira,
                  The ryuer Gaira. beinge apte to receaue shippes. This ryuer had his course from the toppe of an exceadinge hyghe mountayne couered with snowe,An exceding hygh mountayne couered with snowe. hygher then the which, all the coompanyons of this capitayne Rodericus, saye that they neuer sawe. And that by good reason, yf it were couered wyth snowe in that Region which is not past ten degrees distante from the Equinoctial lyne. As they beganne to drawe water owt of their shippeboate, a certeyne Kynge made towarde theym appareled with vestures of gossampine cotton, hauinge twentie noble men in his coompanye appareled also:Appareled men.

As he drewe neere towarde owre men, he seemed frendly to admonysshe theym to take none of the water of that ryuer, affirminge it to bee vnholsome for men: And shewed theym that not farre from thense, there was a ryuer of good water. They came to the ryuer. And endeuouringe to coome nere rhe shore, they were dryuen backe by tempeste. Also the burbulinge of the sande, declared the sea to bee but shalowe there. They were therefore enforced to returne to the fyrste ryuer where they myght safely caste anker. This Kinge layde wayte for owre men. For as they were fyllinge theire barrelles, he set on theym with abowt seuen hundreth men (as owre men iudged) armed after theire maner, althowgh they were naked.

Yet escaped they not the handes of theyr enemyes. For the shippe departed from thense in the nyght season and lefte them there, supposinge that they had byn slayne. Thus by manye▪ suche perels and daungers (which I lyghtly ouerpasse bicause I wyl not bee tedious to yowre holynes) he arryued at the length at the hauen of Vraba,
                  The hauen of Uraba. and cast anker at the easte syde therof, frō whense not longe before, owre men departed to the west syde by reason of the barennes of that soyle. When he had contynued a whyle in the hauen, and sawe noo man stourynge, marueylinge at the silence of the places (for he supposed there to haue fowunde his felowes) he coulde not couiecture what this shulde meane: and there vppon beganne to suspecte that eyther they were deade, or that they had chaunged the place

of theyr habitacion. To knowe the certentie hereof, he commaunded all the greate ordinaunce and other smaule gunnes which he had in his shippes, to bee charged: And fyers to bee made in the nyght vppon the toppes of the rockes. Thus the fyers beinge kyndeled, he commaunded all the gunnes to bee shotte of at one instante: by the horrible noyse whereof, the goulfe of Vraba was shaken,The gou

For whereas they were before his comminge, withowte vytayles and almoste naked, he brought them abundance of meate, drynke, and apparell.

               ¶ The thyrde booke of the seconde Decade of the supposed continent.
               
                  ALl the chiefe officers in Beragua,
                  
                     Beragua.
                   and such as were most politike in counsayle, determyned that Nicuesa shulde bee sowght owte if by any meanes he coulde bee founde. Where vppon they tooke from Ancisus the gouernoure refusinge the commynge of Nicuesa, a brygantyne whiche he made of his owne charges: And agreed, ageynst bothe the wyll of Ancisus, and the master of fence Vaschus Nunnez, that Nicuesa shulde bee sowght foorthe to take away the stryfe as touchinge the gouernement.Nicuesa is sought foorth They elected therfore Colmenaris (of whom we spake before) to take this matter in hande: wyllynge hym to make diligent search

for Nicuesa in those coastes where they supposed he erred. For they harde that he had forsaken Beragua, the region of an vnfrutefull grounde. They gaue hym therfore commaundement to brynge Nicuesa with hym, and further to declare vnto hym that he shulde doo ryght good seruice to coome thether, in takyng away thoccasion of theyr seditions. Colmenaris tooke the thynge vppon hym the more gladly bycause Nicuesa was his very frende: Supposinge that his commynge with vytayles shulde bee noo lesse thankefull to Nicuesa and his coompanie, then it was to them of Vraba. Furnysshynge therefore one of his owne shippes whiche he browght with hym and also the brigantyne taken frome Ancisus, he frayghted the same with part of the vytayles and other necessaries which he browght with hym before from Hispaniola to Vraba. Thus coursynge alonge by all the coastes and goulfes nere there abowte, at the length at the poynte cauled Marmor, he founde Nicuesa,
                  Nicuesa is founde in a miserable case. of all lyuynge men most infortunate, in maner dryed vppe with extreeme hunger, fylthye and horrible to beholde, with onely three score men in his company, lefte alyue of seuen hundreth. They al seemed to hym soo miserable, that he noo lesse lamented theyr case, then yf he had founde them deade. But Colmenaris conforted his frende Nicuesa: and embrasinge hym with teares and cherefull woordes, relyued his spirites, and further encoraged hym with greate hope of better fortune: declarynge also that his commynge was looked for and greatelye desyred of al the good men of Vraba, for that they hoped that by his autoritie, theyr discorde and contention shulde bee fynysshed. Nicuesa thanked his frende Colmenaris. after such sorte as his calamitie requyred. Thus they tooke shyppe to gyther, and sayled directly to Vraba. But so variable and vnconstant is the nature of man, that he soone groweth owte of vse, becommeth insolente and vnmyndful of benefites after to much felicitie.In

For Nicuesa, after thus many teares and weepynges after dyuers bewaylinges of his infortunate desteny, after so many thankes geuynge, ye after that he had faulen downe to the grounde and kyssed the feete of Colmenaris his sauioure, he beganne to quarel with hym before he came yet at Vraba, reprouinge hym and them all for thalteracion of the state of thynges in Vraba, and for the gatheringe of golde: Affirming that none of them owght to haue layde hande of any golde with

owte the aduice of hym or of Fogeda his coompanion. When these sayinges and suche lyke, came to the eares of theym of Vraba, they soo stoured vp the myndes of Ancisus Lieuetenaunte for Fogeda, and also of Vaschus Nunnez, of the contrary parte, ageinste Nicuesa,
                  Nicuesa fauleth from one miserie into an other. that shortely after his arryuall with his three score men, they commaunded hym with threatenynge to departe frō thense. But this pleased not the better sort. Yet fearynge least tumult shulde bee amonge the people whom Vaschus Nunnez had stered to factions, the best parte was fayne to giue place to the greatest.The greatest part ouercommeth the best This wretched man therfore Nicuesa thus drowned in miseries, was thruste into the brigantyne whiche he hym selfe browght: and with hym only seuentene men, of his three score which remayned alyue. He tooke shyppe in the Calendes of Marche in the yeare .1511. intendynge to goo to Hispaniola to coomplayne of the rasshenes of Vaschus Nunnez, and of the violence doone to hym by Ancisus.
                  The death of Nicuesa. But he entered into the brigantine in an vnfortunate houre: for he was neuer seene after. They suppose that the brigantine was drowned with all the men therin. And thus vnhappie Nicuesa faulynge headlonge owte of one miserye into an other, ended his lyfe more myserablye then he lyued. Nicuesa beinge thus vylely reiected,Famen enforseth them to faule to spoylynge. & al theyr vytayles consumed which Colmenaris browght them, faulynge in maner madde for hunger, they were enforced lyke raueninge woolues seakynge theyr praye, to inuade suche as dwelte abowte theyr confynes.

Thus associatinge with hym Colmenaris, he wente to spoyle the kynges which were bortherers there abowte, and came fyrst to a Region abowte that coaste, cauled Coiba, (wherof we made mencion before) imperiously and with cruel countenaunce commaundinge the kynge of the region whose name was Careta,

But Careta denyed that he coulde gyue them any at that tyme: alleagyng that he had oftentymes ayded the Christians as they passed by those coastes: by reason wherof his store was nowe

But Vaschus woolde admytte none of these excuses: And thervppon tooke Careta prisoner,kynge Careta is taken and spoyled. spoyled his vyllage, and browght hym bownd with his twoo wyues and chyldren and all his famelie to Dariena.

The cause hereof was, (as Vaschus alleaged) that Ancisus hadde his commission of the Lieuetenauntshippe, of Fogeda onely whome they sayde to bee nowe deade, and not of the kynge. Sayinge that he woolde not obey any man that was not put in office by the kyng hym selfe by his letters patentes.

                  AFter that they had taryed here a fewe dayes and baptised Comogrus with all his famelie,kynge Comogrus is baptised with his famely. and named hym by the name of Charles after the kynge of Spayne, they returned to theyr felowes in Dariena leauinge with hym the hope of the thousande souldyers, which his sonne requyred to passe ouer those mountaynes towarde the South sea. Thus enteringe into the vyllage which they had chosen to inhabite, they had knowleage that Valdiuia was returned,Ualdiuia returneth from hispaniola. within syxe moonethes after his departure: but with noo great plentie of vytayles, bycause he browght but a smaule shippe: yet with hope that shortely after, there shulde bee sent them abundance of vytayles with a newe supply of men. For younge Colonus, the Admiral and viceroy of Hispaniola, and the other gouernours of the Ilande, acknowleaged that hetherto they had noo respecte to theym of Dariena, bycause they supposed that Ancisus the Lieuetenant had safely arryued there with his shippe laden with vatayles: wyllynge them from hensefoorth to bee of good cheere, and that they shulde lacke nothynge hereafter: But that at this present tyme, they had noo bygger shippe wherby they myght sende them greater plentie of necessaries by Valdiuia. The vytayles therfore which he browght, serued rather sumwhat to mytigate theyr present necessitie, then to satisfye theyr lacke. Wherfore within a fewe dayes after Valdiuia his returne, they fel ageine into lyke scarsnes: especially for asmuch as a great storme and tempest whiche came from the hyghe mountaynes with horrible thunder and lyghtnynge in the mooneth of Nouember,horrible thunder and

For wheras coulde is wantinge, the naturall heate is not dryuen frome the owtewarde partes into the inwarde partes and precordials, whereby digestion is much strengthened. Beinge therfore thus frustrate of the increase of theyr seedes, and the kynges nere abowte them spoyled of both vytayles and golde, they were enforced to seeke theyr meate further of:hunger. And therwith to signifie to the gouernours of Hispaniola with what great necessitie they were oppressed: And what they had lerned of Comogrus as concernynge the Regions towarde the Southe: wyllynge them in consideration therof to aduertyse the kynge to sende them a thousande souldiers,A newe supply of a thousande souldyers. by whose helpe they myght by force make waye throwghe the mountaynes diuidynge the sea on bothe sydes, if they coulde not brynge the same to passe quyetly. The same Valdiuia was also sent on this message, caryinge with hym to the kynges treasourers (hauinge theyr office of recepte in Hispaniola) three hundreth poundes weyght of golde after eyght ounces to the pounde, for the fyfte portion dewe to the kynges escheker.

And thus is it apparente by this accompte, that they receaued of the barbarous kynges, a thousande and fyue hundreth poundes of eyght ounces to the pounde.A thousande and fyue hundreth pounds weyght of wrought gold All the whiche they founde redy wrought in sundry kyndes of ouches, as cheynes, braselets, tablets, and plates, bothe to hange before theyr brestes, and also at theyr eares, and nosethryls. Valdiuia therefore tooke shyppinge in the same carauell in the whiche he came last, and returned also beefore the thyrde day of the Ides of Ianuary, in the yeare of Christ M.D.XI. What chaunced to hym in this vyage, wee wyll

A common souldier of owres whom the kynge had wounded, coomminge to hym when he was taken, cutte of his arme at one stroke with his swoorde. But this was doone vnwares to the capitaynes. The number of the Christian men which were here, was aboute a hundrethe and fiftie: the one halfe whereof, the capytaynes lefte here, and they with the resydue, rowed vpp the ryuer ageyne with twelue of the boates of those Regions, whiche they caul. Vru, as they of Hispaniola caule them Canoas, as we haue sayde. From the ryuer of Riuus Niger and the Iland of Cannafistula,

Uppon the banke of this ryuer next vnto the mouthe of the same, there was a kynge cauled Abibeiba:
                  kyng abibeiba dwellethe in a tree. who, bycause the Region was full of marysshes, had his palaice buylded in the toppe of a highe tree, a newe kynde of byldynge and seldome seene. But that lande beareth trees of suche exceding heigth,Abundance of moyster & heat is cause of byggenes. that emonge theyr branches, a man may frame large houses: As wee reede the like in diuers autoures howe in many Regions where the ocean sea rysethe and ouerflowethe the lande, the people were accustomed to flye to the high trees, and after the faule of the water, to take the fysshe lefte on the lande.The rysynge of the Ocean sea. This maner of buyldinge, is to laye beames crosse ouer the branches of the trees, faste bownde togyther, and there vppon to rayse theyr frame, strongly made ageynste wynde and


wether. Owre men suppose that they buylde theyr houses in trees, by reason of the greate fluddes and ouerflowinge of ryuers whiche often tymes chaunce in those Regions. These trees are of suche heighth,Trees of maruelous height that the strength of no manes arme is able to hurle a stone to the houses buylded therein. And therfore doo I gyue the better credit to Plinie and other autours whiche wrytte that the trees in sume places in India are soo high by reason of the frutefulnes of the grounde,Plinie. abundance of water, and heate of the Region, that noo man is able to shute ouer theym with an arrowe. And by iudgemente of all men, it is thowght that there is noo frutfuller ground vnder the soonne,Frutefull grounde. then this is whereof wee nowe entreate. Owr men measuringe manye of these trees, founde theym to bee of suche biggnes, that seuen men, ye sumetymes eight, holdinge hande in hande with theyr armes streached furthe, were scarsely able too fath

For albeit that the vehemencie of the wynde, is not of poure to caste downe those houses, or to breeke the branches of the trees, yet are they tossed therewith, and swaye sumwhat from syde to syde, by reason wherof, the wyne shulde bee muche troubeled with moouinge. All other necessarye thinges, they haue with theym in the trees. When the kynge or any other of the noble men, dyne or suppe in these trees, theyr wyues are browght theym from the celleres by theyr seruantes, whyche by meanes of exercise, are accustomed with noo lesse celeritie to runne vppe and downe the steares adherente to the tree, then doo owre waytynge boyes vppon the playne grounde, fetche vs what wee caule for from the cobbarde bysyde owr dyninge table. Owre men therfore, came to the tree of kinge Abibeiba, and by thinterpretoures cauled hym foorthe to communication, gyuinge hym signes of peace, and there vppon willinge hym to coomme downe. But he denyed that he woolde coomme owte of his house: Desyringe them to suffer hym to lyue after his fasshion. But owre men fell from fayre woordes to threateninge, that excepte he wolde descende with all his famelie, they wolde eyther ouerthrowe the tree, or elles set it on fyer. When he had denied them ageyne, they fell to hewinge the tree with theyr axes. Abibeiba seeinge the chippes faule from the tree on euery syde,Abibeiba, the kynge of the tree, yeldethe to Uaschus.
                  
chaunged his purpose, and came downe with only two of his soones. Thus after they had entreated of peace, they communed of gatheringe of golde. Abibeiba answered that he had noo golde, and that he neuer had any neede therof, nor yet regarded it any more then stones. But when they were instante vppon hym, he sayde vnto them.Gold no more estemed then stones. If yowe soo greatly desyre golde, I will seeke for sume in the nexte mountaynes, and bringe it vnto yowe. For it is plentifully engendred in those mountaynes. Then he appointed a day when he wold bringe this golde. But Abibeiba came neyther at the day, nor after the daye appoynted. They departed therfore from thense well refresshed with his vitailes and wyne, but not with goulde as they hoped. Yet were they enformed the like by Abibeiba and his ditionaries as concerninge the golde mynes and the Canibales, as they harde before of kinge Comogrus. Saylinge yet further aboute thirtie myles, they chaunced vppon certeyne cotages of the Canibales:Canibales. But vtterly voyde with owte men or stuffe. For when they had knowleage that owre men wandered in the prouinces nere aboute theym they resorted to the mountaynes, caryinge al theyr goodes and stuffe wyth them.

When he had therfore founde him, he spake to him in this effecte.Abraiba causeth the kynges to rebell. What thynge is this Oh vnfortunate Abibeiba? or what nation is this that soo tormenteth vs that wee can not enioye owre quyet lybertie?

When Abibeiba harde these wordes and such other like, he condecended to doo in al thinges as Abraiba wolde requyre: Where vppon they appoynted a day to brynge theyr conspiracie to passe. But the thynge chaunced not accordynge to their desyre. For of those whiche wee sayde to haue passed to the Canibales, there returned by chaunce to Riuus Niger the nyght before the day appoynted to woorke theyr feate, thirtie men to the ayde of theym whiche were lefte there yf anye sedition shulde ryse they suspected.The kynges are dryuen to flyght. Therfore at the daunyng of the day, the confetherate kynges with fyue hundreth of theyr ditionaries armed after theyr maner, beseaged the vyllage with a terrible alarome, knowynge nothynge of the newe menne which came thether the same nyght.

The kynges escaped, they slewe manye, and tooke many captiues whiche they sente to Dariena where they vse them for labourers to tyll and sowe theyr grounde.

               But what ayde and helpe they confesse that they haue had of the godly poure of this image, that is of the blessed virgin, it is a thynge woorthy to be harde, and most assuredly to bee taken for a truthe. For by the report of owre men, there is such feruēt godly loue & zeale in these simple men toward the holy virgin, that to them beinge in the daungers of warre ageynst theyr enemies, they doo in maner (yf I may soo terme it) compel her to descende from heauen to helpe them in theyr necessities.The effect of godly zeale. For such is the goodnes of god, that he hath lefte vnto men in maner a pryce wherby wee may purchase hym with his holy angels and sayntes, that is to wytte, burnyng loue, charitie & zeale. Howe therfore can the blessed virgin at any time be absent frō thē which cal for her helpe with pure faith & feruent loue? Commendator him selfe, with al his noble mē and gentelmen, doo testifie with one voyce, that in a fought battayle in the which this maryner was capitayne, bearyng with hym this picture of the virgin Marie,A miracle in the tyme of the battayle the Zemes of theyr enemies turned their backes and trembeled in the presence of the virgins Image and in the syght of them all. For euery of thē brynge theyr Zemes to the battayle, hopynge by theyr helpe to obteyne the victorie. Ye they say further, that duryng the tyme of the battayle, they sawe not only an Image, but a liuely woman clothed in fayre and whyte apparel, aydynge them ageinst theyr enemies: whiche thynge also the enemyes them selues acknowleaged,The virgin Mary▪ is present at the battayle. confessynge that on the contrary parte shee appeared to them, shakynge a septer in her hande with threatenynge countenaunce, whiche caused theyr hartes to

shake and faynt for feare. But after that this maryner departed from them, beinge taken into a shyppe of certeyne Christians passynge by those coastes, Commendator declared that he with all his subiectes, continually obserued his institucions: In soo muche that beinge at contention with an other prince, which of theyr Zemes were moste holy and of greateste poure, the matter grewe to suche extremitie that they tryed it with hande strokes: And that in all these attemptes, the blessed virgin neuer fayled hym, but was euer presente in the brunte of the battayle, and gaue hym easye victorie with a smaule poure of men, ageynst a mayne armye of his enemies. Beinge demaunded with what woordes they cryed vppon the virgin Mary when they assayled theyr enemies, they answered that they had lerned noo other woordes of the mariners doctrine, but Sancta Maria adiuua nos, Sancta Maria adiuua nos: That is, holy Mary helpe vs, holy Marye helpe vs: And this also in the Spanysshe tonge. For he had lefte these woordes in the mouthes of all men.A maruelus experience of fayth Whyle they murthered and destroyed them selues thus on bothe sydes, they fell to entreatie of peace and agreed to trye the matter, not hande to hande by combatte of certeyne chosen for bothe parties as the maner was amonge the Romaynes and dyuers other nations in the owlde tyme, or by any slyght or policie, but that twoo younge men shulde bee chosen, for eche partie one, with theyr handes bounde fast behynde them in the playne fielde, bothe parties beinge sworne to acknowleage that Zemes to bee the better, which fyrst loosed the bandes of the younge man whiche stoode bounde for the tryall of his religion. Thus diuidinge them selues,Muche lyke vnto this, is redde in. Reg. xviii. and placeinge the sayde younge men before them in the syght of them al, with theyr handes fast bounde by theyr enemyes, the contrary parte cauled fyrst on theyr Zemes (that is, the deuyll to whose similitude theyr Images are made) who immediatly appered in his lykenes aboute the younge man that stoode bounde in the defence of Sathans kyngedome.The deuil appeareth in his lykenes
               
               But as soone as Commendator with his coompanye cryed Sancta Maria adiuua nos, Sancta Maria adiuua nos, forthwith there appeared a fayre virgin clothed in whyte, at whose presence the deuell vanquisshed immediatly. But the virgin hauinge a longe rod in her hande, & putting the same on the bandes of the younge man that stoode for Commendator, his handes were loosed immediatly

in the syght of them all, and his bandes founde about the handes of hym that stoode for the other partie,An other miracle. in somuch that they them selues fownde hym dowble bounde. But for all this, were not the enemies satissyed: querelinge that this thynge was doone by sum slyght or diuise of man, and not by the poure of the better Zemes. And there vppon requyred for thaduoydynge of all suspection, that there myght bee eyght graue and sage men appoynted, for eche syde foure, whiche shulde bynde the men in the syght of theim all, and also gyue iudgemente whether the thynge were doone withowte crafte or gyle. Oh pure simplicitie and constant fayth: Oh golden and blessed confidence. Commendator and his familiers, doubted not to graunte theyr enemies theyr requeste with lyke faythe wherwith the diseased woman obteyned healthe of the fluxe of her bludde,
                     Math. 14. and wherby Peter feared not to walke on the sea at the syght of his master Christe. These younge men therfore were bounde in the presence of these eight graue men, and were placed within theyr lystes in the syght of bothe parties. Thus vppon a signe gyuen, when they cauled vppon theyr Zemes, there appered in the syght of them all,The deuyl appereth agein. a deuyll with a longe tayle, a wyde mouthe, greate teeth, and hornes, resemblyng the similitude of the Image which the kyng being enemye to Commendator, honoured for his Zemes. As this deuyl attempted to loose the bandes of his cliente, the blessed virgin was immediatly presente as before at the caule of Commendator and his subiectes,The Uirgin Mary ouercommeth the deuyll. and with her rodde loosed the bandes of her suppliant, which were ageyne lykewyse founde fast tyed aboute the handes of hym that stoode for the contrarye parte. The enemies therefore of Commendator, beinge stryken with greate feare and amased by reason of this greate miracle, confessed that the Zemes of the virgin was better thē their Zemes. For the better profe wherof, these pagans beinge bortherers to Commendator,

They baptised in one day a hundreth and thirtie of thinhabitantes, sumtyme enemyes to Commendator, but now his frendes & ioyned with him in aliance.
               
                  All suche as came to bee baptised, gaue the preestes of theyr owne liberalitie,The preeste & rewarde. eyther a cocke or a henne. But no capons: for they can not yetskyl how to carue theyr cocke chyckēs to make them capons. Also certeyne salted fysshes, and newe fyne cakes made of theyr breade: likewise certeyne foules franked and made fatte. When the preestes resorted to the shippes, syxe of these newe baptysed men accoompanied theym laden with vitailes, wherwith they ledde a ioyfull Easter. For on the Sunday two dayes before saynte Lazarus day, they departed from Dariena, and touched at that tyme, onely to the cape or angle of Cuba nere vnto the Easte syde of Hispaniola. At the requeste of Commendator, Ancisus lefte with hym one of his coompanie, to thintente too teache hym and his subiectes wyth other his bortherers, the salutacion of the angell whiche we caule the Aue Maria.

Thus Ancisus takinge his leaue of kynge Commendator, directed his course to Hispaniola, from whiche he was not farre.

As concerninge his maners and vsages other wayes, they are not vnknowen to yowre maiestie, vnder whose wynge he hath of a chylde byn browght vp in the courte, and euer founde faythfull towarde yowre hyghnesse. Wherfore, to declare my opinion vnder yowre graces fauour (whom it hath pleased to appoynt me a commissioner in these affayres) I thinke it were vngodly that he shuld bee put from his office at the sute of any other, especially beinge thereto moued by ambition and couetousnes: who perchaunce woold proue them selues to be the same men in the office if they shuld obteyne it, as they nowe shewe them selues in the ambitious desirynge of the same.

For this marchaunt shyppe commynge from Hispaniola founde them landinge at certeyne Ilandes nere there aboute. But in the meane tyme whyle my importunate caulers on, Galeaceus Butrigarius and Iohannes Cursius, men studious by al meanes to gratifie yowre holynes, ceased not to put me in rememberance that they had one in a redines to depart into Italy, and taryed onely to cary with hym vnto yowre holynes these my fayre Nereides althowgh rudely decked, leaste I shulde bestow muche tyme in vayne, I haue let passe many thynges, & wyll reherse onely such as seeme in my iudgement moste woorthye memory, althowgh sumwhat disordered as occasion hath serued.

This marquesse whyle shee lyued, dyd euer shewe a manly and stoute mynde, bothe in peace and warre, so that by her counsayle manye noble thynges were browght to good effecte in Castile: vnto this noble woman, the wyfe of Petrus Arias was niese by her brothers syde. Shee folowyng the magnanimitie of her aunt, perceauinge her husbande nowe furnyshyng hym selfe to depart to the vnknowen coastes of the newe woorlde, and those large tractes of lande and sea, spake these wordes vnto hym.

Wherefore for my parte to declare my affection herein, yowe shall vnderstande, that whyther so euer yowre fatal destenye shall dryue yowe, eyther by the furious waues of the greate Ocean, or by the manyfoulde and horrible daungers of the lande, I wyll surely beare yowe coompany. There can no

perell chaunce to me so terrible, nor any kynde of death so cruell, that shal not bee much easyer for me to abyde, then to liue so farre seperate from yowe. It were muche better for me to dye, and eyther to bee cast into the sea to bee deuoured of the fysshes, or on the lande to the Canibales, then with continuall mournynge and bewaylinge, to lyue in deathe and dye lyuinge, whyle I consume in lookyng rather for my husbandes letters then for hym selfe. This is my full determinacion, not rashely nor presentely excogitate, nor conceaued by the lyght phantasie of womans brayne, but with longe deliberatiō and good aduisement. Nowe therfore choose to whether of these twoo yowe wyll assente: Eyther to thruste yowre swoorde in my throte, or to graunte me my requeste. As for the ch

Let vs leaue vnto them suche gooddes and possessions as haue byn left vs by owre parentes and frendes wherby they may lyue amonge the woorshipful of theyr order. For other thynges I take no care. When this noble matrone of manly vertue had fynisshed these woordes, her husbande seinge the constant mynde of his wyfe, and her in a redynes to doo accordynge to her woordes, had no hart to denye her louinge peticion: but embrasinge her in his armes, commended her intente and consented to her requeste. Shee folowed hym therfore as dyd Ipsicratea her Mithridates with her heare hangeinge loose aboute her shulders. For shee loueth her husbande as dyd Halicarnassea of Caria, hers beinge deade, and as dyd Artemisia her Mausolus: We haue also had aduertisemēt sence their departure that she (being browght vp as it were amonge soft fethers) hath with noo lesse stoute corage susteyned the roringes and rages of the Ocean, then dyd eyther her husband or any of the maryners brought vp euen amonge the sourges of the sea. But to haue sayde thus much hereof, this shal suffice. Let vs nowe speake of other thynges no lesse woorthy memorie. Therfore, whereas in the fyrste Decade we haue made mencion of Vincentius Annez Pinzonus, ye shal vnderstande that he accoompanyed Christophorus Colonus the Admirall in his fyrst vyage, and afterwarde made an other vyage of his owne charges with onely one shyppe.

affirmed that all the nauigations of the Ocean, owght to perteyne to theym onely. The Castilians argued on the contrarie parte, that what so euer god by the ministratiō of nature hath created on the earth, was at the begynnynge common emong men: And that it is therfore lawfull to euery man to possese suche landes as are voyd of Christian inhabitours. Whyle the matter was thus vncerteynly debated, bothe parties agreed that the controuersie shulde bee decerned by the bysshope of Rome, and plighted faithe to stande to his arbitrimente. The kyngedome of Castile was at that tyme gouerned by that great Queene Helisabeth with her husbande: for the roialme of Castile was her dowerye.The bysshop of Rome diuideth the land Shee also and the kynge of Portugale, were cosyn germaynes of two systers: by reason wherof the dissention was more easely pacified.

                  The ryuers of Uraba. The ryuer of Dariena fauleth into the goulfe of Vraba with a narowe chanel,The ryuer of Darien fauleth into the goulfe of Uraba. scarsly able to beare the canoas or lyghters of that prouince, and runneth by the vyllage where they chose theyr dwellynge place. But the ryuer in the corner of the goulfe which we sayde that

                     Danubius.
                   and Danowe) fauleth into the sea Pontike, and Nilus into the sea of Egypte: wherfore they named it Grandis,
                  Grandis or Rio grandis. that is great: whiche also they affirme to nooryshe many and great Crocodyles,A crocodile is much lyke an eute, but of excedyng bignes. as the owld wryters testifie of Nilus, and especially as I haue lerned by experience, hauinge sayled vp and downe the ryuer of Nilus when I was sent ambasadoure to the Soldane of Alcayr at the commaundement of the moste catholyke Kynge.
               What I may therfore gather owte of the wrytynges of so many lerned autours as concerninge the ryuer of Nilus,
                  The autoure of this booke was in Egipt The riuer Nilus in Egypte I knowe not. For they say that nature hath gyuen two riuers of that name to water the lande, whether they wyll them to sprynge owte of the mountaynes of the moone or the soonne,

                   Affirming one of the same to faule into the goulfe of Egypte toward the Northe, and the other into the South Ocean sea. What shall wee saye in this place? Of that Nilus in Egypte, there is noo doubte. The Portugales also whiche sayle by the coastes of the Ethiopians cauled Nigritae,

                  ruelous inuentions haue founde an other towarde the South, and ernestly affirme the same to bee also deriued frō the mountaynes of the moone: And that it is an other chanell of Nilus, bycause it bryngeth foorth Crocodyles, whereas it hathe not byn reade before tyme that any other ryuer noorysshed Crocodyles sauinge onely Nilus. This ryuer, the Portugales caule Senega.
                  The ryuer Senega▪ an other chanell of the ryuer of Nilus. It runneth throwgh the Region of the Nigritas, beinge very frutefull towarde the north shore: but on the southe syde sandie and rowghe. Crocodiles are also engendred herein. What shall wee then say of this thyrde: ye I may wel say the fourth.Crocodiles. The thyrde & fourth Nilus. For I suppose them also to bee Crocodiles which Colonus with his coompany founde armed with scales as harde as shelles in the ryuer cauled Delagartos wherof wee haue made mention before.
                     Delagartos.
                   Shall wee say that these ryuers also of Darien and Vraba, haue theyr originall frome the mountaynes of the moone, wheras they sprynge owte of the nexte mountaynes,

and can by noo meanes haue the same originall with Nilus in Egypte, or that in Nigrita,
                  The ryuers springe owt of the mountaynes or els that in the kyngedome of Melinda, from whense soo euer they are deryued. Whereas these other (as we haue sayde) springe owt of the next mountaines whiche deuyde an other southe sea with noo greate distaunce from the North Ocean. Wherfore it appeareth by experience of such as haue trauayled the worlde in owre time, that other waters besyde the ryuer of Nilus in Egypte,Crocodiles engendred in other ryuers besyde Nilus

In the marysshes also and fennes of the Regions of Dariena, are founde greate plentie of Phesauntes and peacockes, (but not of variable coloures) with many other kyndes of byrdes and foules vnlyke vnto owres,Byrdes and foules. as well apte to bee eaten, as also to delite the eares of menne with pleasaunt noyse. But owre Spanyardes, bycause they are ignorant in foulynge, take but fewe. Also innumerable popingayes of sundry kindes are found chattering in the groues of those fenny places. Of these there are sume equall to Capons in byggenes, and sume as lyttle as sparowes. But of the diuersitie of popingayes,Popingayes. we haue spoken sufficientely in the fyrst Decade.

Spanyardes say, that in the tyme of Colonus, they founde and passed by an other ryuer after this,A ryuer of maruelous byggenes loke the first decade the ix. boke. whose goulfe faulynge in to the sea, they affirme to bee lyttle lesse then a hundreth myles in the fyrste coastes of Paria, as wee haue sayde elsewhere.

But if wee shall denye that the earth draweth humours of the sea, and agree that all fountaynes or sprynges are engendered of the conuersion or turnynge of ayer into water distilling within the halowe places of the montaynes (as the most part thinke) we wyll gyue place rather to thautoritie of them whiche stycke to those reasons, then that owre sense is satisfyed of the full truth therof.

graunte therfore that in certeyne places by conuersion of the ayrie dewe into water within the caues of suche mountaynes, many sprynges and ryuers are engendred.

Howe so euer it be: I can not but gyue credit to the report of such worthy men as haue recourse to those regions: And can noo lesse then declare the same albeit it may seeme incredible to sume ignorant persons not knowynge the poure of nature to whome Plinie was persuaded that nothynge was impossible.Nothinge impossible to the poure of naure. Wee haue therfore thought it good to make this discourse by the way of argument, least on the one syde, men of good lernyng and iudgement, and on the other syde, suche as are studious to fynde occasions of quarelynge in other mens wrytynges, shulde iudge vs to bee so vndescreete lyghtly to gyue creditte to euery tale not beinge consonant to reason. But of the force and greate violence of those fresshe waters,The cause of the greatnes and force of the goulfe. which repulsinge the sea make so greate a goulfe (as wee haue sayde) I thinke the cause therof to bee the greate multitude of fluddes and ryuers, which beinge gathered togither, make so great a poole: and not one ryuer as they suppose. And for as muche as the mountaynes are excedynge hyghe and stiepe,hygh and stiepe hylles I thinke the violence of the faule of the waters to be of such force, that this conflicte betwene the waters, is caused by thimpulsion of the poole that the salte water can not enter into the goulfe.

And sume there are which affirme this lande to bee very large in other places althowgh it bee but narowe here. There commeth also to my remembrance an other cause: the whiche althowgh it bee of no greate force,An other reason yet doo I entende to wryte it. Perhappes therfore the length of the lande reachyng far from the Easte to the weste, if it bee narowe, may bee a helpe hereunto. For as wee reade that the ryuer Alpheus passethe through the holowe places vnder the sea from the citie of Elis in Peloponoso,

                   so is it possible that these mountaynes may haue suche longe caues perteynynge vnto theim,Longe caues in the mountaynes. that they may be the receptacles of the water passing through the landes beinge farre distante: And that the same waters commynge by soo longe a tracte, may in the way bee greately encreased by the conuersion of ayer into water, as wee haue sayde. Thus muche haue I spoken freely, permittinge bothe to them whiche doo frendely enterprete other mens doinges, and also to the malicious scorners, to take the thynge euen as them lysteth. For hetherto I can make no further declaration hereof. But whē the truth shalbe better knowē, I wyl do my diligence to commit the same to wryting. Nowe therefore, forasmuche as we haue spoken thus muche of the breadth of this land, we entēd to describe the length & forme of the same.

               Wherupon I repayred to the byshoppe of Burges beinge the chiefe refuge of this nauigation. As wee were therfore secretly togyther in one chamber, we had many instrumentes perteynynge to these affayres as globes and manye of those mappes which are commonly cauled the shipmans cardes, or cardes of the sea.Cardes of the sea. Of the which, one was drawen by the Portugales, wherunto Americus Vesputius is sayde to haue put to his hande, beinge a man moste experte in this facultie and a Florentyne borne:The carde of Americus Uesputius. who also vnder the stipende of the Portugales, hadde sayled towarde the south pole many degrees beyond the Equinoctiall. In this carde we founde the fyrst front of this land to bee brooder then the kynges of Vraba had persuaded owre men of theyr mountaynes. To an other, Colonus the Admiral whyle he yet lyued and searched those places had gyuen the beginnynge with his owne handes:The carde of Colonus. Wherunto Bartholomeus Colonus his brother and Lieuetenaunt had addid his iudgement, for he also, had sayled aboute those coastes. Of the Spanyardes lykewyse, as many as thought them selues to haue any knowleage what perteyned to measure the lande and the sea, drewe certeyne cardes in parchement as concernyng these nauigations. Of all other, they most esteeme them which Iohannes de la Cossa the coompanion of Fogeda (whom wee sayde to bee slayne of the people of Caramairi in the hauen Carthago,

And this aswell for the greate experience which they bothe hadde (to whom these tractes were as wel knowen as the chambers of theyr owne houses) as also that they were thought to bee cunninger in that parte of Cosmographie which teacheth the description and measuringe of the sea. Conferringe therefore all these cardes togyther, in euery of the whiche was drawen a lyne expressinge, not the myles,The maner of measuring the cardes. but leagues after the maner of the Spanyardes, we tooke owre compases and beganne to measure the sea coastes after this order.

And here must I make protestacion to yowre holynes, not to thynke this to bee sayde lyghtly or rashely.A water of maruelous vertue. For they haue soo spredde this rumour for a truth throwghowt all the courte, that not onely all the people, but also many of them whom wisedome or fortune hath diuided from the common sort, thinke it to be true. But if yowe shal aske my opinion herein,The renouation of age. I wyl answere that I wyll not attribute so greate poure to nature: but that god hath noo lesse reserued this prerogatiue to hym selfe, then to searche the hartes of men, or to gyue substance to priuation, (that is) beinge to noo beinge: Excepte we shall beleue the fable of Colobis of Eson renouate, to bee as trewe as the wrytinges of Sibylla Erythrea. Albeit perhappes the scoles of phisitians and naturall philosophers wyll not muche stycke to affirme that by thuse of certeyne secreate medecines and dyete,The accidentes of age may bee hydden. the accidentes of age (as they caule them) may be longe hydden and deferred, which they wyll to bee vnderstoode, by the renouacion of age. And to haue sayde thus much of the length and breadthe of these Regions, and of the rowghe and hugious mountaynes with theyr watery caues, also of the dyuers degrees of that lande, I thinke it sufficient. But I thowght it not good to let passe what chaunced to these miserable men amonge theyr generall calamities.

Then caulinge vnto hym the guydes and labourers which came with hym from thense he rewarded them liberallye and dismissed theym with thankes. Shortly after, by the conduct of Chiapes hym selfe, and certeyne of his men, departinge from the toppes of the mountaynes, he came in the space of foure dayes to the bankes of the newe sea: where assemblynge al his men togyther with the kynges scribes and notaries, they addicted al that maine sea with all the landes adiacent there vnto to the dominion and Empire of Castile.Uaschus addicteth the newe land & sea, to the dominion of Castile.

Vaschus rewarded hym lykewise as we sayd before of Poncha, Coquera beinge thus pacified, they returned to the palaice of Chiapes. Where, visitinge theyr companions, and restynge there a whyle, Vaschus determyned to search the nexte greate goulfe, the which, from the furthest reachynge therof into the lande of theyr countreys, from the enteraunce of the mayne sea, they saye to bee threescore myles.A goulfe of threescore myles.

but that he woolde brynge hym on the waye and take part of his fortune. Therfore as soone as they were nowe entered into the maine sea, such sourges and conflictes of water arose ageynst them that they were at theyr wyttes endes whither to turne them or where to reste. Thus beinge tossed and amased with feare, the one loked on the other with pale and vncherefull countenaunces.

Here the water soo encreased, that it almost ouerdowed the Iland.The increasing of the South sea. They say also that that south sea doth soo in maner boyle and swelle, that when it is at the hyghest it doth couer many greate rockes, which at the faule therof, are seene farre aboue the water.

Such as were brused, they tyed fast with theyr gyrdels, with slippes of the barkes of trees, and with tough and longe stalkes of certein herbes of the sea, stopping the ryftes or chynkes with grasse accordynge to the presente necessitie. Thus were they enforced to returne backe ageyne lyke vnto men that came frome shippewracke, beinge almost consumed with hunger, bycause theyr vytayles were vtterly destroyed by tempeste. Thinhabitantes declared that there is harde all the yeare horrible rorynge of the sea amonge those Ilandes as often as it rysethe or fauleth. But this most especially in those three monethes in the which it is moste boystious as Chiapes towlde Vaschus before: Meanynge (as they coulde coniecture by his woordes) October, Nouember, and December: for he signifie) the present moone and the twoo moones folowynge, countynge the moonethes by the moones, whereas it was nowe October. Here therefore refresshynge hym selfe and his souldiers a

For he was ouercoome, dryuen to flyght,kynge Tumaccus is driuen to flyght. and many of his men slayne. He hym selfe was also sore wounded, but yet escaped. Vaschus sent certeyne messengers of the Chiapeans to hym to returne, and not to bee afrayde. But he could be nothyng moued nether by promysses nor threateninges. Yet when the messengers were instant, & ceassed not to threaten death to him and his famely, with the vtter desolation of his kyngedome if he persisted in that obstinacie, at the length he sent his soonne with them: whom Vaschus honorably enterteyninge, apparelinge hym gorgiously and gyuing hym many gyftes, sent hym to his father, wyllynge hym to persuade hym of the puissaunce, munificence, liberalitie, humanitie, and clemencie of owre men. Tumaccus beinge mooued by this gentelnes declared toward his sonne, came with him the thyrde day, bryngynge nothynge with hym at that tyme. But after that he knewe that owre men desyred goulde and pearles,Golde and perles, he sent for syxe hundreth and .xiiii. Pesos of golde, and two hundreth and fortie of the biggest and fayrest perles besyde a great number of the smaulest sorte.

Of these thynges I was enformed of one Arbolantius beinge one of Vaschus coompanions whom he sent to the kyng with manye perles and certeyne of those sea musculs. But when Tum

Thus reioysinge on bothe parties, they embrased and made a league of continual frendeshippe. Tumaccus thought him selfe happie that he had presented owre men

with such thankeful gyftes and was admitted to theyr frendshippe: and owre men thinkynge them selues happie and blessed that they had founde suche tokens of great ryches, swalowed downe theyr spettle for thyrste.The thyrst of golde. At all these doinges, kynge Chiapes was present as a wytnes and coompanion. He also reioysed not a lyttle, aswell that by his conductinge he sawe that owre men shulde bee satisfied of theyr desyre, as also that by this meanes he had declared to the next kynge his bortherer and enemie, what frendes he had of owre men, by whose ayde he myght lyue in quyetnes and bee reuenged of his aduersarie if neede shulde soo requyre.Ambition amonge naked men. For (as wee haue sayde) these naked kynges infeste theim selues with greuous warres onely for ambition and desyre to rule. Vaschus bosteth in his epistell, that he lerned certeyne maruelous secreates of Tumaccus him selfe as concernynge the greate ryches of this lande: wherof (as he sayth) he woold vtter nothyng at this presente,This Ilande is cauled Margarites Diues, or Dites. for asmuche as Tumaccus toulde it him in his eare. But he was enformed of bothe the kynges, that there is an Ilande in that goulfe, greater then any of the other, hauing in it but onely one kynge, and hym of soo great poure,A kynge of greate poure. that at suche tymes of the yeare as the sea is caulme, he inuadethe theyr dominions with a greate nauie of Culchas, spoyling and caryinge a way for a praye, all that he meeteth. This Iland is distant from these coastes, onely twentie myles: Soo that the promontories or poyntes therof rechyng into the sea, may bee seene from the hylles of this Continent. In the sea nere about this Ilande, sea musculs are engendred of such quantitie, that many of them are as brode as buckelers,Biggeperles. In these are perles founde (beinge the hartes of those shell fysshes) often tymes as bygge as beanes, sumtymes bygger then olyues and such as sumptuous Cleopatra myght haue desyred.Cleopatra, queene of Egypt resolued a pearle in vineger and drunke it, price.v. thousande pounde of owr mony. thef

woordes, he swore great othes that he woolde furthwith inuade the Ilande, spoylynge, destroyinge, burnynge, drownynge, and hangynge, sparinge neyther swoorde nor fyre, vntyll he hadde reuenged theyr iniuries: And therwith commaunded his Culchas to bee in a redynes. But the twoo kynges Chiapes and Tumaccus, exhorted hym frendly to deferre this enterprise vntyll a more quiete season, bycause that sea was not nauigable withowte greate daunger, beinge nowe the begynnynge of Nouember. Wherin the kynges seemed to saye trewe. For as Vaschus hym selfe wryteth, great roryng of the sea was harde amonge the Ilandes of the goulfe by reasō of the raginge and conflicte of the water.

But lette vs nowe returne to owre purpose. Vaschus therfore determined with the fysshers of Chiapes to proue what myght bee doone in his fyshe pooles or stations of sea muscules. Chiapes to shewe hym selfe obediente to Vaschus his requeste, although the sea were boystyous, coommaunded thirtye of his fysshers to prepare them selfes and to resorte to the fysshinge places. Vaschus sente onelye syxe of his men with them to beeholde them frome the sea bankes, but not to coommitte them selues to the daunger of the sea. The fysshynge place was distante frome the palayce of Chiapes aboute tenne myles.The fysshing place of king Chiapes. They durste not aduenture to dyue to the bottome by reason of the furye of the sea. Yet of the muscules whiche lye hyghest, and of suche as were dryuen to the shore by the vyolence of the water, theye broughte syxe greate farthels in the space of a fewe dayes. The perles of these were but lyttle, aboute the bygnes of smaule fytches: yet verye fayre and bewtyfull, by reason theye were taken newely owte of the fysshe, beinge yet rawe. And that they shulde not bee reproued of lyinge as concerninge the bignes of these sea musculs, they sente many of them into Spayne to the kynge with the perles, the fysshe beynge taken owte. Wee thinke verily that there maye in noo place bygger bee founde. These shelle fysshes therfore beynge thus founde here in soo manye places in that sea, and gold in maner in euerye house,Golde in maner in euery house. doo argue the ryche treasurye of nature too bee hyd in those coastes, forasmuche as suche greate ryches haue byn founde as it were in the lytle fynger of a giantes hande.The ryche treasurye of nature.

This tyran, whether it were that his giltie conscience for his mischeuous actes, put him in feare that owre menne woolde reuenge the same, or that he thought hym selfe inferior to resist them, fled at theyr commynge. Vaschus wryteth that in these regions in the mooneth of Nouember he was sore afflicted with greate heate and intollerable thirst,Greate heate in the monethe of Nouember. by reason that syde of the mountaynes hath lyttle water: In soo muche that they were in daunger to haue perisshed but that certeyne of thinhabitants shewed them of a sprynge which was in the secreate place of a woodde, whither Vaschus with all speade sent twoo quycke and stronge younge men of his coompanions with theyr gourdes and suche water vesselles as Teaocha his men browghte with them. Of thinhabitantes, there durst none depart from

For they affyrme that for the space of syxe hole moonethes there passed not one nyghte withowte summe hurte doone: soo that it kylled nyghtlye eyther a bullocke, a mare, a dogge, or a hogge, sumtimes euen in the highe wayes of the village. For owre men haue nowe greatheardes of cattayle in those regions. They say also that when this tyger had whelpes,Tigers whelpes. noo man myght safelye goo furthe of his doores, bycause shee spared not men if shee mette fyrste with them. But at the lengeth, necessitye enforced them to inuente a policye howe they myght bee reuenged of suche bludshed. Searchynge therfore dilygently her footesteppes,Thus the Egiptians take Crocodiles. and folowynge the pathe wherbye shee was accustomed in the nyght season to wander owte of her denne to seeke her praye, theye made a greate trenshe or pytte in her walke, coueringe the same with hurdels whervppon theye caste parte of the earthe and dispersed the resydue. The dogge tyger chaunsed fyrste into this pitfaul,The dogge tyger taken. The rorynge of the tyger. and fel vppon the poyntes of sharpe stakes and suche other ingens as were of purpose fyxed in the bottome of the trenshe. Beynge thus wounded, he rored soo terrybly, that it grated the bowels of suche as harde hym, and the wooddes and montaynes neare aboute, rebounded the noyse of the horryble crye. When they perceaued that he was layde faste, they resorted to the trenshe and slewe hym with stones, dartes, and pykes. With his teethe and clawes, he broke the dartes into a thousande chyppes, Beynge yet deade, he was fearefull to all suche as behelde hym: what then thinke you he woolde haue doone beynge alyue and loose. One Iohannes Ledisma of Ciuile, a nere frynde to Vaschus and one of the coompanyons of his trauayles, toulde me that he hym selfe dyd eate of the fleshe of that tiger:Tigers flesh eaten. and that it was nothinge inferyor to biefe

Beynge demaunded howe they knewe hit to bee a tyger forasmuche as none of them had euer seene a tyger, they answered that they knewe hit by the spottes, fiercenes, agilitye, and suche other markes and token wherby the anciente writers haue described the tiger. For sum of them, had before tyme seene other spotted wilde beastes, as lybardes & panthers. The dogge tiger beynge thus kylled, theye folowynge the trase of his steppes towarde the mountaines, came to the denne where the bytche remayned with her twoo younge suckynge whelpes.The bitche tyger.

But owre men nowe perceiued that they measured his poure by their owne. For their kinges are but guattes compared to elephantes, in respecte to the poure and pollicye of owre men. Owre men were also enformed by suche as dwelte neare aboute Tumanama, that his region was not beyonde the montaynes as they supposed: Nor yet so ryche in golde as younge Comogrus

Vaschus therfore, leauynge his sycke men in the vyllage of Poochorrosa, tooke with hym threscore of his moste valiante souldiers, and declared vnto them howe kynge Tumanama had oftentymes spoken proude and threatnyng woordes ageynste them:A good policye.

Eyther of these houses were in length a hundreth and twentie pases; and in bredth fyftie pases as owre men measured them. In these two houses the kynge was accustomed to muster his men as often as he prepared an armye. When Tumanaman therfore, was thus taken captyue with all his Sardanapamcall famelye, the Pocchorrosians bragged and threatened hym beynge nowe bounde, that he shulde shortly bee hanged. The other kynges also his bortherers, reioysed at his mysfortune.

For their wynes although they bee not made of grapes yet are they of force to make men droonken. He declared furthermore that the other kynges his bortherers had of malice surmysed suche lyes of hym enuyinge his fortune bycause he was of greater poure then they.

Addynge herevnto that if it woolde please hym to pardon hym not hauinge offended, he woolde bringe him great plentie of gold. Thus layinge his ryght hande on his breast, he swore by the sonne, that he euer loued and feared the chrystians sence he fyrste harde of their fame and vyctoryes: Especially when he harde saye that they had Machanas, that is, swoordes sharper then thearse, and such as cutte in pieces al thynges that coomme in their waye.

Lette no man therfore perswade yowe (o moste myghtye victourer) that euer suche woordes proceded owte of my mouthe. As Tumanama with trembeling spake these woordes, therwith swalowynge downe the knot of deathe, Vaschus seemed by his teares to bee moued to compassion:

                  Tumanama beyng demaūded wher they had that gold, answered that it was not gathered in his dominiōs But that it was brought

his auncestours from the ryuer Comogrus toward the southe. But the Pocchorrosians & other his enemies, sayd that he lyed: Affirmynge that his kingdome was ryche in golde. Tumanama on the contrary part, instantly protested that he neuer knewe any golde myne in all his dominions. Yet denyed not but that there hath sumtimes byn found certaine smaule graines of golde, to the gatherynge wherof, he neuer had any regarde, bycause they coulde not gette it without great & longe labour.They abhorre labour. Whyle these thynges were dooinge, the sycke men whiche Vaschus had lefte in the village of Pocchorrosa, came to hym the .viii. day of the Calendes of Ianuary in the yeare of Christe. M.D.XIII. bringyng with them certayne labourers from the kynges of the southe with sundrye instrumentes to dygge the grounde and gather golde. Thus passynge ouer the day of the natiuitye of Christ without bodely labour, vppon sainte Steuens daye he brought certeyne myners to the syde of a hyll not farre dystante from the palaice of Tumanama, where (as he saith) he perceaued by the coloure of the earth that it was lykely to brynge furthe golde. When they had dygged a pytte not past a hand breadth and a halfe,The coloure of the golden earthe and a tryall of the same. and syfted the earthe therof, they founde certayne smaule graynes of golde no bygger then lintell seedes, amountynge to the weyght of twelue graynes as they prouyd with their balances of assaye before a notarie and wytnesse that the better credytte myghte bee gyu

Wherby they argued that the rychenesse of that lande was agreable to the report of the bortherers, although Vaschus coulde by noo meanes cause Tumanama to confesse the same. They suppose that he nothynge esteemed so smaule a portion. But other saye that he denyed his countrey to bee frutefull of golde, leaste by reason therof the desyre of golde, myght intyse owre men to inhabyte his kyngdome, as in deede the seely kynge was a prophet in soo thinkynge.

Where we haue descrybed the regions of Vraba and Beragua to bee situate,The regions of Uraba and Beragua. these seas are deuided by smaule distaunce. Yet owght we to thynke the region which the great ryuer of Maragnonus runneth through,The greate riuer Maragnonus. to bee very large if we shall graunt Maragnonum to bee a ryuer and no sea, as the freshe waters of the same owght to persuade vs. For in suche narowe caues of the earth, there can bee no swalowinge goulfes of such bygnesse as to receaue or nooryshe so great abundance of water. The lyke is also to bee supposed of the great ryuer of Dabaiba which we sayde to bee from the corner of the goulfe of Vraba in sume place of fortie fathomes depth,The great riuer Dabaiba, or sancty Iohannis. and sumwhere fiftie: Also three myles in breadth, and so to faule into the sea. We must needes graunt that the earth is brode there, by the whiche the ryuer passeth from the hyghe mountaynes of Dabaiba from the East and not from the west. They say that this ryuer consisteth and taketh his encrease of foure other ryuers faulynge from the mountaynes of Dabaiba.

Lykewyse that in the same region of Vraba there are in sume places narowe streyghtes not passynge fyftene leaques: and the same to bee saluage and withowt any passage by reason of dyuers marysshes and desolate wayes,Marisshes and desolate wayes. which the Latines caule Lamas: But the Spanyardes accordynge to theyr varietie, caule thē

But before we passe any further, it shall not bee greatly from owr purpose to declare from whense these mountaynes of Dabaiba haue theyr name accordynge vnto thantiquities of thinhabitantes.A superstitious opinion of thoriginall of montaines of Dabaiba. They saye therefore that Dabaiba was a woman of greate magnanimitie and wysedome emonge theyr predicessours in owlde tyme: whom in her lyfe, all thinhabitantes of those prouinces did greatly reuerence, and beinge deade gaue her diuine honour and named the regiō after her name, beleuynge that shee sendeth thunder and lyghtnynge to destroy the frutes of the earth yf shee bee angered, and to send plentie if shee bee well pleased. This superstition hathe byn persuaded them by a craftie kynde of men vnder pretense of

religion to thintent that they might enioye suche gyftes and offeringes as were brought to the place where shee was honoured.Dragons and crocodiles in the marishes This is sufficient for this purpose. They saye furthermore that the marysshes of the narowe lande wherof we haue spoken, brynge foorth great plentie of Crocodiles, dragons, battes, and gnattes beinge very hurtfull. Therefore when so euer they take any iorney towarde the south, they go owte of the way towarde the mountaynes, and eschewe the regions neare vnto those perelous fennes or maryshes. Sume thinke that there is a valley lyinge that way that the ryuer runneth which owre men caule Rio de los perdidos, that is, the ryuer of the lost men (so named by the misfortune whiche there befell to Nicuesa and his coompany) and not far distant from the hauen Cerabaro whiche diuideth those mountaynes towarde the south.The hauen Cerabaro. But let vs nowe fynishe this booke with a fewe other thynges woorthy to bee noted. They say therefore that on the ryght hande and lefte hande frome Dariena, there are twentie ryuers in all the whiche,Twentie golden ryuers. greate plentie of golde is founde. Being demaunded what was the cause why they brought no greater abundance of gold from thense, they answered that they lacked myners: And that the men which they tooke with them from Spayne thyther, were not accustomed to laboure, but for the moste parte brought vp in the warres. This lande seemeth also to promesse many precious stones.Precious stones. For besyde those which I sayde to bee founde neare vnto Cariai and Sancta Martha, one Andreas Moralis a pylot (who had trauayled those coastes with Iohannes de la Cossa whyle he yet lyued) had a precious diamonde which he bought of a naked younge man in the region of Cumana in the prouince of Paria.

This stone was as longe as two ioyntes of a mans middell fynger, and as bygge as the fyrst ioynte of the thumme: beinge also paynted on euery syde, consistynge of eyght squares perfectly formed by nature. They say that with this they made scarres in anuilles and hammers, and brake the teethe of fyles, the stone remaynyng vnperysshed. The younge man of Cumana, wore this stone aboute his necke emonge other ouches, and soulde it to Andreas Moralis for fyue of our coūterfect stones made of glasse of dyuers colours wherwith the ignorant younge man was greatly delyted. They founde also certeyne topases on the shore.Topases. But thestimation of golde was so

If yowre holynesse do aske to what purpose is al this, ye shal vnderstand, that I had scarcely fynysshed the historye of suche thynges as chaunsed to Vaschus Nunnez and his coompanye in their vyage to the southe sea, when soodenly there came newe letters from Petrus Arias the newe gouernour whom the kyng had appoynted the yeare before with an army of men and a nauye of shippes to sayle to these newe landes. He sygnifyeth by his letters, that he with his nauye and coompany, arryued all safelye.
               Furthermore, Iohannes Cabedus (whome yowre holynes at the requeste of the moste catholyke kynge had created bysshoppe of that prouynce of Dariena) and three other of the chiefe offycers ioined in cōmission to be his assystance,The bysshop of Dariena. as Alfonsus de Ponte, Diegus Marques, and Iohannes de Tauira, confyrmed the same letters and subscribed them with their names. The nauygation therfore of Petrus Arias,

Petrus Arias therfore, arriued at Gomera the eyghte daye after his departure, with a nauye of .xvii. shippes and a .M. and fyue hundreth men, althoughe there were onely a thousand and two hundreth assygned hym by the kynges letters. It is sayde furthermore that he lefte behynd hym more then two thousande verye pensyue and syghynge that they also myght not be receaued, proferynge them selues to go at their owne charges.

Summe thynke the sea too be verye muddye there, and that these weedes are engendered in the bottome therof, and so beynge loosed, to ascende to the vppermooste parte of the water, as wee see oftentymes chaunce in certeyne stondynge pooles, and sumtymes also in greate ryuers. Other suppose that they are not engendered there, but to bee beaten from certeyne rockes by the vyolence of the water in tempestes.

                   Within the mouthe of the ryuer of Bahaboni, lyeth an Ilande where it is sayde that thinhabitauntes buylded their fyrste howse whiche they named Camoteia. This howse they consecrated shortely after, and honoured the same reuerently with continual gyftes and monumentes, euen vntyl the commynge of owre men, lyke as the Christians haue euer relygyously honoured Ierusalem the fountayne and oryginall of owre faythe:hierusalem As also the Turkes attribute the lyke to the cytie of Mecha in Araby,

                   and thinhabytantes of the fortunate Ilandes (cauled the Ilandes of Canarye) to Tyrma buylded vppon a hyghe rocke from the whiche many were wounte with ioyfull myndes and songes to caste them selues downe headlonge,The Ilandes of Canarie, beyng persuaded by their priestes that the soules of all suche as so dyd for the loue of Tyrma, shulde therby enioye eternall felycity.

These doo yet (for the moste parte) obserue bothe the language and maners of the Frenshemen, although the eyres and successours of Betanchor, had soulde the two subdued Ilandes to certeyne men of Castile. Yet thinhabitours whiche succeded Betanchor, and buylded them houses and encreased their families there, do contynue to this daye: And lyue quietly and pleasauntly with the Spanyardes, not greued with the sharpe coulde of Fraunce. But lette vs nowe returne to thinhabitauntes of Matinino and Hispaniola. The Ilande of Hispaniola was fyrste named by the fyrste inhabitours,The fyrst names of hispaniola. 
                  Quizqueia, and then Haiti.
               
               And this not by chaunce, or at the pleasure of suche as diuised these names, but of credulitie and belefe of summe great effecte. For Quizqueia, is as muche to saye as a great thinge: And that so greate that none maye bee greater. They interprete also, that Quizqueia sygnifyeth, large, vniuersall, or al, in like signification as the Greekes named their god cauled Pan:
                     Pan.
                   Bycause that for the greatnes therof, these symple soules supposed it to bee the hole worlde: And that the soonne beames gaue lyghte to none other worlde but onely to this Ilande with the other adiacente aboute the same: And thervppon thoughte it most woorthy to bee cauled great, as the greatest of all other knowen to them. Haiti is as muche to saye by interpretation, as roughe, sharpe, or craggie. But by a fyguratiue speache cauled denomination (wherby the hole is named by part) they named the hole Iland Haiti (that is) roughe: For as muche as in many places the face of this Iland is rough b

                   reason of the craggie montaynes,The roughnesse of hispaniola horrible thicke wooddes, and terrible darke and diepe valleys enuyroned with great and highe montaynes, althoughe it bee in manye other places exceadynge bewtifull and florysshynge.
               Here muste wee sumwhat digresse from thorder we are entered into. Perhappes your holynesse wyll maruell by what meanes these symple men shoulde of soo longe contynuance beare in minde suche principles, where as they haue no knowledge of letters. So it is therfore, that from the beginninge, their princes haue euer byn accustomed to committe their children to the gouernaunce of their wise men whiche they caule Boitios, to bee instructed in knowledge,The maner of lernynge. and to beare in memorie

suche thynges as they lerne. They gyue them selues chieflye to two thynges: As generally to lerne thoriginall and successe of thynges: And particularlye to reherse the noble factes of their graundefathers great graundefathers and auncestours aswell in peace as in warre. These two thynges they haue of owlde tyme composed in certeyne myters and ballettes in their language. These rhymes or ballettes,Ballets and rhymes. they caule Ar

And as owre mynstrelles are accustomed too synge to the harpe or lute, so doo they in lyke maner synge these songes and daunce to the same, playinge on tymbrelles made of shels of certen fysshes. These tymbrels they caule Maguei. They haue also songes and ballettes of loue: And other of lamentations and moornyng:Singing and daunceing.
                  Soonges of loue and moornynge. Summe also to encorage them to the warres, with euery of them their tewnes agreable to the matter. They exercyse theym selues muche in daunceinge, wherin they are verye actyue and of greater agilitie then owre men, by reason they gyue them selues to nothyng so muche, and are not hyndered with apparell whiche is also the cause of their swiftenesse of foote. In their ballettes lefte them of their auncestours, they haue prophecies of the comminge of owre men into their countrey. These they synge with moornyng and as it were with gronyng,Prophesies, bewayle the losse of their lybertie and seruitude. For these prophecies make mention that there shoulde coome into the Ilande Maguacochios,
                  Note that is, men clothed in apparell, and armed with suche swoordes as shulde cutte a man in sunder at one stroke: vnder whose yoke their posteritie shulde bee subdued. And here I do not maruell that their predicessours coulde prophecye of the seruitude and bondage of their successyon, if it bee trewe that is sayd of the familiaritie they haue with spirites whiche appeare to them in the night,Theyr familiaritie with spirites wherof we haue largely made mention in the nynth booke of the first decade, where also wee haue entreated of their Zemes (that is) their Idoles and Images of diuelles whiche they honoured.The deuyl is dryuen awaye by baptisme But they saye that sence these Zemes were taken awaye by the Christians, the spirites haue no more appeared.

So that euen they are not vtterlye ignorante in the surueyinge of their landes.Surueyers The common people haue none other care then of settynge, sowynge, and plantynge. They are mooste experte fysshers,They lyue as much in the water as on the lande by reason that throughowte the hole yeare, they are accustomed daylye to plounge them selues in the ryuers, so that in maner they lyue no lesse in the water then on the lande. They are also giuen to huntynge. For (as I haue sayde before) they haue twoo kyndes of foure footed beastes, wherof the one is lyttle cunnes cauled Vtias, and the other Serpentes named Iuannas,
                  Serpentes muche lyke vnto Crocodiles,A Crocodile is much lyke to owr ewte or Lyserte of eyght foote length, of moste pleasaunte taste, and lyuynge on the lande.

               The hole Ilande was also cauled Cipanga of the region of the montaynes aboundynge with golde:

                   Lyke as owre anciente poetes cauled all Italye Latium of parte therof.Italy cauled Latium Therfore as they cauled Ausonia and Hesperia, Italie, euen soo by the names of Quizqueia, Haiti, and Cipanga, they vnderstode the hole Ilande of Hispaniola. Owre men dyd fyrste name it Isabella of queene Helisabeth whiche in the Spanyshe tounge is cauled Isabella:Isabella And so named it of the fyrst Colonie where they planted their habitation vpon the banke nere vnto the sea on the Northe syde of the Ilande, as wee haue further declared in the fyrste decade. But of the names, this shall suffyce. Lette vs nowe therfore speake of the forme of the Ilande.The forme of the Ilande of hispaniola They whiche fyrste ouer ranne it, described it vnto me to bee lyke the leafe of a chestnutte tree, with a goulfe towarde the west syde, lyinge open ageynst the Ilande of Cuba. But the experte shyppe mayster Andreas Moralis, broughte me the forme therof sumwhat differynge from that. For from bothe the corners, as from the Easte angle and the West, he described it to be indented and eaten with many great goulfes, and the corners

to reache foorthe verye farre: and placeth manye large and safe hauens in the great goulfe on the East syde. But I trust shortely soo to trauayle further herein, that a perfecte carde of the particular description of Hispaniola maye bee sente vnto yowre holynesse.A particular carde of hispaniola. For they haue nowe drawne the Geographicall description therof in cardes, euen as yowre holynesse hath seene the forme and sytuation of Spayne and Italye with their montaines, valleyes, ryuers, cities, and colonies. Lette vs therfore without shamfastnesse compare the Ilande of Hispaniola to Italie,hispaniola compared to Italie, sumtyme the heade and queene of the hole worlde. For if wee consyder the quantitie, it shal bee founde lyttle lesse, and muche more frutefull. It reacheth from the Easte into the Weste, fyue hundreth and fortye myles accordynge to the computation of the later searchers: Althoughe the Admyrall sumwhat increased this number as wee haue sayde in the fyrste decade. It is in breadth summe where, almoste three hundreth myles: And in summe places narower where the corners are extended. But it is suerlye muche more blessed and fortunate then Italie:The temperature of hispaniola. Beynge for the mooste parte therof so temperate and florysshynge, that it is neyther vexed with sharppe coulde, nor afflycted with immoderate heate. It hath bothe the steyinges or conuersyons of the soonne (cauled Solstitia) in maner equall with the Equinoctiall,The equinoctiall. with lyttle difference betwene the length of the daye and nyghte throughout all the yeare. For on the the south syde, the day ascendeth scarcely an houre in length aboue the nyghte, or contrary wyse. But the dyfference is more on the northe syde.Coulde accidentall, and not by the sytuation of the region, Yet are there summe regions in the Ilande in the whiche the coulde is of sum force. But yowre holynesse muste vnderstonde this to bee incident by reason of the obiecte or nearenesse of the mountaines, as wee wyl more largely declare hereafter. Yet is not this coulde so pearcynge or sharpe, that thinhabitantes are molested with snowe or bytynge froste. In other places, the Ilande enioyeth perpetuall springe tyme, and is fortunate with contynuall soomer and haruest.Perpetuall

                     he Ilande, We haue before declared howe it is in maner equally diuided with foure greate ryuers descendynge frome hygh mountaynes: wherof that which runneth towarde the East, is cauled Iunna, as that towarde the West is named Attibunicus: The thyrde is Naiba or Haiba which runneth Southwarde: The fourth is cauled Iache, and fauleth towarde the North. But this shippe master, hath brought an other description obserued of thinhabitantes from the begynnynge.
               Let vs therfore diuide the hole Ilande into fiue partes, caulynge the regions of euery prouince by theyr owlde names: and fynally make mention of suche thynges as are woorthye memory in euery of them. The begynninge of the Ilande on the East syde, is conteyned in the prouince named Caizcimu: so named for that in theyr language Cimu, signifieth the front or begynnynge of any thynge. After this, foloweth the prouince of Huhabo, and then Caihabo. The fourth is Bainoa, Guaccaiarima conteyneth the west corner. But the last saue one, Bainoa is of larger boundes then the three other. Caizcimu reachethe from the fyrst fronte of the Ilande to the ryuer Hozama, whiche runneth by the citie of saynt Dominicke.The citie of s. Dominicke But towarde the North syde, it is ended at the rough mountaynes of Haiti.
                  The mountaynes of haiti 
                  Huhabo, is included within the mountaynes Haiti and the ryuer Iaciga. Caeiabo the thyrde prouince, conteyneth all that lyeth betwene Cubaho and Dahatio, euen vnto the mouth of the ryuer of Iaccha or Iache (one of the foure which diuide the Ilande equally) and ascendethe to the mountaynes of Cibaua,
                  The mountaynes of Cibaua where the greateste plentie of golde is founde: Owte of the which also the ryuer Demahus springeth: and ioynynge with

the springes of the ryuer of Naiba, (being an other of the foure which diuideth the Ilande towarde the south sea) fauleth to an other banke of the ryuer of saynt Dominicke. Bainoa, begynneth at the confines of Caiabi, and reacheth euen vnto the Ilande of Cahini which lieth neare vnto the sea bankes of the north syde of the Ilande where wee sayde that they erected the fyrst colonie or habitacion.The Ilande of Cahini The prouince of Guaccaiarima,

                   occupieth the remanent towarde the west. This they named Guaccaiarima, bycause it is the extreme or vttermost parte of the Ilande. For Iarima in theyr language signifieth the tayle or ende of any thynge: And Gua, is an article whiche they vse often tymes in the names of thynges: And especially in the names of theyr kynges: as Guarionexius, and Guaccanarillus. In the prouince of Caizimu, are these regions: Higuei, Guanama, Reyre, Xagua, Aramana, Arabo, Hazoa. Macorix, Caiacoa, Guaiagua, Baguanimabo and the rough mountaynes of Haiti. Here let vs speake sumewhat of theyr aspirations which they vse otherwyse then the Latins doo.Of theyr aspirations It is to bee noted that there is no aspiration in theyr vowels, which hath not theffecte of a consonant. So that they pronounce theyr aspirations more vehemently then wee do the consonant .f. Ye, all suche woordes as in their tonge are aspirate, are pronounced with lyke breath and spirite as is .f. sauing that herein the neather lyppe is not moued to thuppermost teethe. With open mouthes and shakynge theyr brestes, they breath out these aspirations, ha, he, hi, ho, hu, as the Hebrewes and Arabians are accustomed to pronounce theyrs.The pronunciation of the hebrewes & Arabians, I fynde also that the Spanyardes vse the lyke vehemence in the aspirations of those woordes whiche they haue receaued of the Moores & Arabians which possessed Spaine,The Moores and Arabiās possessed Spayne. and continued there many yeares: As in these woordes: Almo hadda, whiche signifieth a pyllowe or bolster: Also Almohaza, that is, a horse combe: with dyuers such other woordes whiche they speake in maner with panting brestes and vehement spirite. I haue thought it good to reherse these thynges, bycause amonge the Latines it often tymes soo chaunceth that onely the accent or aspiration, chaungeth the signification of the woorde:howe the aspiration changeth the signification of wordes as hora, for an houre, and ora for the plurale number of this woorde os, which signifieth the mouth: Also ora, which signifieth regions or coastes. The lyke also chaunceth in the diuersitie of the accente, as occido I kyll, and occi

I faule. Euen so in the language of these simple men, there are many thynges to bee obserued. But let vs nowe returne to the description. In the prouince of Hubabo, are these regions: Xamana, Canabacoa, Cuhabo, with many other, the names wherof I haue not yet learned. The prouince of Caibabo, conteyneth these regions: Magua, and Cacacubana. Thinhabitantes of this region, haue a peculyar language much differinge from the common language of the Iland,Dyuers languages in the Ilande and are cauled Macoryxes. There is also an other region cauled Cubana, whose language differeth from the other. Lykewyse the region of Baiohaigua, hath a dyuers toonge. There are also other regions, as Dahabon, Cybaho, and Manabaho. Catoy is in the myddle of the Ilande. By this runnethe the ryuer Nizaus: And the montaynes cauled Mahaitin, Hazua, and Neibaymao, confine with the same. In the prouince of Bainoa, are the regions of Maguana, Iagohaiucho, Bauruco, Dabaiagua, and Attibuni, so named of the ryuer: Also Caunoa, Buiaici, Dahabonici, Maiaguariti, Atiei, Maccazina, Guahabba, Anniuici, Marien, Guaricco, Amaguei, Xaragua, Yaguana, Azzuei, Iacchi, Honorucco, Diaguo, Camaie, and Neibaimao. In Guaccaierima the last prouince, these regions are conteyned: Mauicarao, Guabagua, Taquenazabo, Nimaca, Bainoa the lesse, Cabaymi, Iamaizi, Manabazao, Zauana, Habacoa, and Ayqueroa. But let vs entreate sumwhat of the particulars of the regions. In the prouince of Caizcimu, with in the great goulfe of the beginnynge, there is a greate caue in a hollowe rocke vnder the roote of a hygh mountayne,A greate caue in the rocke of a mountayne, about twoo furlonges from the sea. The enterie of this caue is not much vnlyke the doores of a great temple, beinge very large and turnynge many wayes. Andreas Moralis the shyp master,A daungerus enterprise at the commaundement of the gouernoure, tempted to searche the caue with the smaulest vessels. He sayth that by certeyne priuie wayes, manye ryuers haue concourse to this caue as it were to a sinke or chanell.Riuers deuoured of caues, After thexperience here of, they ceased to maruaile whither other ryuers ranne whiche commynge fourescore and tenne myles, were swalowed vp, so that they appeared no more, nor yet fell into the sea by any knowen wayes. Nowe therfore they suppose that ryuers swalowed vp by the holowe places of that stony mountayne, faule into this caue. As the shipmaster entered into the caue his shippe was almost swalowed. For he saith that there are many whyrlepooles and rysinges or boylinges of the water,

which make a violent conflicte and horrible rorynge one encounteryng the other. Also many huge holes & holowe places: So that what on the one syde with the whirle pooles,whirlepooles and conflict
                        •
                      of waters, & on the other side with the boyling of the water, his shyp was long in maner tossed vp and downe lyke a baule. It greatly repented hym that he had entered, yet knewe he no way how to come forth. He now wandered in darkenesse, as wel for the obscurenesse of the caue into the which he was farre entered,Clowdes in the caue. as also that in it were thicke cloudes engendered of the moist vapours proceading of the conflicte of the waters whiche cō
                  tinually faule with great violence into the caue on euery side. He compareth the noyse of these waters, to the faule of the famous ryuer of Nilus from the montaines of Ethyope.The Cataractes of Nilus They were al so deafe, that one could not here what an other said. But at the length with great daunger & feare, he came foorth of the caue as it had byn owte of hel. Aboute three score miles distante from the chiefe citie of saincte Dominicke, there are certeyne hyghe montaynes vppon the toppes wherof is a lake or standynge poole inaccessible,A standynge poole in the t

These montaynes, they caule Ymizui Hibabaino. This poole is of freshe water three myles in compasse, and wel replenysshed with diuerse kindes of fysshes. Many smaule riuers or brookes faule into it. It hath no passage owte, bycause it is on euery syde enclosed with the toppes of mountaynes. But lette vs nowe speake of an other poole whiche maye well bee cauled a sea in the mydlande, and bee coompared to the Caspian or Hircanian sea in the fyrme land of Asia:The Caspia

These sprynges make a ryuer than can not bee waded ouer, whiche neare at hande ioynynge with the other, fauleth into the lake. Here muste wee staye a whyle. The kynge of this regyon founde his wyfe praying in a chapel builded by the Christians with in the precincte of his dominion,A myracle. and required her coompanie to satisfye his fleshely luste. His wyfe reproued hym, and put hym in remembraunce to haue respecte to the holye place. The woordes whiche shee spake to hym,The Indian language. were these: Teitoca,

Teitoca: whiche is as muche to saye, as, bee quyet, bee quyet: Techeta cynato guamechyna: That is, god wyl bee greatly angerie. Guamechyna, sygnifyeth god, Techeta greatly, Cynato angrie.

Yet by this myracle beynge striken with repentaunce, he euer after ledde a relygious lyfe: In soo muche that from thense foorthe hee woolde neuer suffer the chapell to bee swepte or decked with any other mannes hande. By the same myracle, manye of thinhabitauntes and all the Christians beyng moued, resorted deuoutly to the chappell. They take it in good parte that the kynge suffered the reuenge of that reproche. Lette vs nowe retourne to Caspium. That salte lake is tossed with stormes and tempestes: And oftentymes drowneth smaule shyppes or fyssher boates, and swaloweth them vppe with the maryners:Such as are drowned in the lake are not cast vp ageyne. In so muche that it hath not byn harde of, that any man drowned by shyppewracke, euer ploonged vppe ageyne, or was caste on the shore, as commonly chaunceth of the deade bodyes of suche as are drowned in the sea. These tempestes, are the deintie banquetes of the Tiburones. This Caspium, is cauled Hagueigabon. In the myddest hereof, lyeth an Ilande named Guarizacca,
                  The Ilande Guarizacca in the myddest of the poole. A lake of salt and freshe water. to the whiche they resorte when they go a fysshynge: But it is not cultured. There is in the same playne, an other lake nexte vnto this, whose water is myxte of salte and freshe: And is therfore nother apte to bee droonke, not yet to bee refused in vrgente necessytie. This conteineth in length .xxv. miles, and in breadth eight myles: In summe places also nyne or ten. It receaueth manye ryuers whiche haue no passage owte of the same, but are swalowed vppe as in the other. Water springeth out of the sea into this also: but in no great quantitie, whiche is the cause that it is so commyxte. In the same prouynce towarde the Weste syde, there is an other lake of freshe water,A lake of fresshe water not farre distante from Caspius. This thinhabitauntes caule Iainagua. The same salte lake, hath on the North syde therof, an other named Guaocaa. This is but lyttle: as not past three or foure myles in breadth, and one in length.

Lookyng toward the West, it hath collaterally on the lefte hande the montaines of Daiguani: And on the ryght hande, the montaines, of Caigua, so cauled of the name of the vale it selfe. At the rootes of the montaines of Caigua toward the North syde, there lyeth an other vale much longer & larger then that before named. For it conteineth in length, almoste two hundreth myles:A playne of two hundreth myles in length. And in breadth .xxx. wher it is largest, & about .xx. wher it is narowest This vale in summe parte therof, is cauled Maguana: In an other place, Iguamu, & elles where, Hathathiei.

She woolde oftentymes play and wrestle vppon the banke with the kynges chamberlens: And especially with a younge man whom the kynge fauoured well, beinge also accustomed to feede her. Shee woolde bee sumetymes as pleasaunt and full of play as it had byn a moonkey or marmaset: And was of longe tyme a great comfort and solace to the hole Ilande. For no smaule confluence aswell of the Christians as of thinhabitantes, had dayly concourse to beholde so straunge a myracle of nature, the contemplation wherof was no lesse pleasaunt then woonderfull. They say that the meate of this kynde of fysshe, is of good taste: And that many of them are engendered in the seas therabout. But at the length, this pleasaunt playfelowe was loste, and caried into the sea by the great ryuer Attibunicus,

For at that tyme there chaunced so terrible a tempest of wind, & rayne, with such fluds ensewing that the like hath not lightly byn hard of. By reason of this tempest, the ryuer Attibunicus so ouerflowed the bankes, that it fylled the hole vale & myxt it selfe with all the other lakes.

There are no sides of mountaynes or hylles, no ryuers, which abound not with golde and delycate fysshes,Golde in all mountaynes, and golde and fysshe in all ryuers. except only one ryuer which from thoriginall therof, with the sprynges of the same breakynge foorth of the mountaynes, commeth owt salte and so contynueth vntyll it peryshe. This ryuer is cauled Bahuan: and runneth through the myddle of the region Maguana in the prouince of Bainoa. They suppose that this ryuer hathe made it selfe awaye vnder the grounde by sume passages of playster or salte earthe. For there are in the Ilande many notable salte bayes,Salte bayes, wherof we wyl speake more hereafter. We haue declared howe the Ilande is diuided by foure ryuers & fyue prouinces.howe the Ilande is diuided with mountaynes. There is also an other particion, whiche is this. The hole Ilande consysteth of the tops of foure mountaines which diuide it by the myddest from the East to the weste. In all these is abundance of nooryshynge moysture and greate plentie of golde:Golde. of the caues also of the whiche, the waters of al the riuers (into the which the caues emptie them selues) haue theyr originall and increase.The ryuers haue theyr increase from the caues of the mountaynes There are lykewyse in thē horryble dennes, obscure and darke vales, and myghtie rockes of stone. There was neuer any noysome beaste founde in it: Nor yet any rauenynge foure footed beaste.No hurtful or raueninge beast in the Ilande. No lyon, no beare no fierce tygers, no craftie foxes, nor deuouring woolfes. Al thynges are blessed and fortunate: And nowe more fortunate, for that so many thousandes of men are receaued to bee the sheepe of Christes flocke, all theyr Zemes and Images of deuylles being reiected and vtterly out of memorie.The autours excuse. If I chaunce nowe and then in the discourse of this narration to repeate one thynge dyuers tymes or otherwise to make digression, I must desyre yowre holynes therwith not to bee offended. For whyle I see, heare, and wryte these thinges, mee seemeth that I am herewith so affected, that for verye ioy I feele my mynde stirred as it were with the spirite of Apollo as were the Sibylles, whereby I am enforced to repeate the same ageyne: Especially when I consyder howe farre the amplitude of owre religion spreadeth her wynges.

Yet amonge these so many blessed and fortunate thynges, this one greeueth me not a lyttle: That these simple poore men neuer brought vp in labour,By what meane

In so much that women with chylde, perceauynge that they shall brynge foorth such as shalbe slaues to the Christians, vse medecines to destroy theyr conception. And albeit that by the kynges letters patentes it was decreed that they shulde bee set at lybertie, yet are they constrayned to serue more then seemeth conuenient for free men. The number of the poore wretches is woonderfully extenuate. They were once rekened to bee aboue twelue hundreth thousande heades: But what they are nowe, I abhorre to rehearse. We wyll therefore let this passe: and returne to the pleasures of Hispaniola.
                  The plesures of hispaniola. In the mountaynes of Cibaua, which are in maner in the myddest of the Ilande in the prouince of Caiabo (where we sayd to bee the greatest plentie of natyue golde) there is a region named Cotohi, situate in the clowdes,The region of Cotohi,

                     ituate in the Clowdes. enuironed with the toppes of hyghe mountaynes, and well inhabited. It consisteth of a playne of .xxv. myles in length, and .xv. in breadth. This playne is hygher then the toppes of other mountaynes:A playne in the toppes of mountaynes So that these mountaynes, maye seeme to bee the chiefe and progenitours of the other.The hygher, the coulder. This playne suffereth alterations of the foure tymes of the yeare: as the Sprynge, Soomer, Autumne, and wynter. Here the herbes ware wythered, the trees loose theyr leaues,Moderate coulde in the mountaynes. and the medowes become hore: The whiche thynges (as we haue sayde) chaunce not in other places of the Ilande, where they haue only the Spring and Autumne. The soyle of this playne bryngeth foorth ferne and bramble busshes bearynge blacke berries or wylde raspes,Ferne of maruelous bignes which two are tokens of coulde regions. Yet is it a fayre region: for the coulde therof is not very sharpe: neyther dooth it aflicte thinhabitantes with froste or snowe. They argue the frutefulnes of the region by the ferne, whose stalkes or steames are bygger then a spere or iauelen. The sydes of those mountaynes are ryche in golde.Golde. Yet is there none appoynted to dygge for the same, bycause it shalbe needefull to haue apparelled myners, and such as are vsed to labour. For thinhabitantes lyuinge

confeuted with lyttle, are but tender: And can not therfore away with labour or abyde any coulde.Thinhabitantes of hispaniola can abyde no labour nor coulde. There are two ryuers which runne through this region, and faule from the toppes of the present mountaynes. One of these is named Comoiayxa, whose course is towarde the West, and fauleth into the chanell of Naiba. The other is cauled Tirecotus: which runnynge towarde the East, ioyneth with the ryuer of Iunna. In the Ilande of Creta (nowe cauled Candie) as I passed b

                   in my legacie to the Soldane of Alcayr or Babylon in Egypte,The Iland of Creta of Candie, vnder the dominion of the Uenetians. the Uenetians toulde me that there laye suche a region in the toppes of the mountaynes of Ida, whiche they affirme to bee more frutefull of wheate corne then any other region of the Iland. But forasmuch as once the Cretenses rebelled agenst the Uenetians, and by reason of the streight and narowe way to the toppes therof, longe defended the region with armes against thauctoritie of the Senate, and at the length beinge forweryed with warres, rendered the same, the Senate commaunded that it shulde bee lefte deserte, and the streightes of thenteraunces to bee stopped, lest any shulde ascende to the region without their permissyon. Yet in the yeare of Christe M. D. ii. lycence was graunted to the husband men to tyll and manure the region, on suche condition that no suche as were apte to the warres, myght enter into the same. There is also an other region in Hispaniola named Cotoby after the same name. This diuideth the boundes of the prouinces of Vhabo and Caiabo. It hath mountaynes, vales, and plaines. But bycause it is baren, it is not muche inhabited. Yet is it richest in golde: For the originall of the abundaunce of gold, beginneth here: In so muche that it is not gathered in smaule graines and sparkes as in other places: but is founde hole,Pure and massie golde in the region of Cotoy. massie, and pure, emonge certaine softe stones and in the vaines of rockes, by breakynge the stones wherof, they folowe the vaynes of golde.

For they thincke that such graines are not engendered where they are gathered: especially on the dry land: but otherwise in the riuers. They say that the roote of the goldē tree extendeth to the center of the earth & there taketh norishēmt of increase.The roote of the golden tree. For the deaper that they dygge,The braunches of the golden tree. they fynd the trunkes therof to be so muche the greater as farre as they maye folowe it for abundaunce of water springing in the montaines. Of the braunches of this tree, they fynde summe as smaule as a threde, and other as bygge as a mannes fynger accordynge to the largenesse or straightnesse of the ryftes and clyftes. They haue sumetimes chaunced vpon hole caues susteyned and borne vp as it were with golden pyllars:Caues susteyned with pyllers of golde.

Many folowed aswel of owre men as of the naked inhabytantes, but all in vayne. Thus when the pleasaunt wanderer perceaued that the Christians ceased to pursue hym, he lefte the childe in a crosse waye by the whiche the swyneheardes were accustomed to dryue the swyne to their pasture. Shortly after, a swynchearde founde the chyld and brought hym home to his father yet tormentynge hym selfe for sorowe, supposynge that wylde man to haue byn one of the kynde of the Canibales, and that his soonne was nowe deuowred. In the same Ilande they gather pytche whiche sweateth owte of the rockes,Pitche of the rocke. beynge muche harder and sourer then the pitche of the tree: and is therfore more commodious to calke or defende shyppes ageynste the woormes cauled Bromas, wherof wee haue spoken largely before.

Pitche is lykewyse gathered of it as of the pyne tree: althoughe summe saye that it is gathered by distyllyng or droppyng of the woode when it is burnt. It is a straunge thynge to here of the leafe thereof: and how necessary prouision of nature is shewed in the same. It is to be thought that this is the tree in the leaues wherof the Chaldeans (beynge the fyrste fynders of letters) expressed their myndes before the vse of paper was knowen.The leafe of a tree in the steede of paper. This leafe is a spanne in breadth and almost round. Owre men write in them with pynnes or nedles or any suche instrumentes made of metall or woodde, in maner as well as on paper. It is to bee lawghed at what owre men haue perswaded the people of the Ilande as towchynge this leafe.They beleue that leaues do speake. The symple soules beleue that at the commandement of owre men, leaues do speak and disclose secreates.A pretie storie. They were brought to this credulitie by this meanes. One of owre men dwellynge in the citie of Dominica the chiefe of the Ilande, delyuered to his seruaunte (beyng a man borne in the Ilande) certayne rosted connies, (whiche they caule Vtias beynge no bygger then myse) wyllynge

hym to carie the same to his frende whiche dwelte further within the Ilande. This messenger, whether it were that he was therto constrayned through hunger, or entysed by appetite, deuoured three of the counnies by the waye.
               He to whome they were sente, writ to his frynde in a leafe howe manye he receaued. When the mayster had looked a whyle on the leafe in the presence of the seruaunt, he sayde thus vnto hym. Ah soonne, where is thy faythe? Coulde thy gredye appetyte preuayle so muche with the as to cause the to eate the connies commytted to thy fydelytie? The poore wretche trembelynge and greatlye amased, confessed his faute: And therwith desyred his mayster to tell hym howe he knewe the treweth therof. This leafe (quod he) whiche thou browghtest me, hath toulde me all. Then hee further rehearsed vnto hym the houre of his coommynge to his frende,Ignorance causeth admiration. and lykewyse of his departynge when hee retourned. And thus they meryly deceaue these seely soules and keepe theym vnder obedyence: In so muche that they take owre men for goddes, at whose coommaundement leaues doo disclose suche thynges as they thyncke mooste hyd and secreate. Bothe the sydes of the leafe receaueth the formes of letters euen as dooeth owre paper.The leafe wherin they wryte. It is thycker then double parchement, and meruelous toughe. While it is yet florys

It dooeth not corrupte or putrifye: nor yet looseth the letters thoughe it bee wette: nor by any other meanes excepte it bee burnte.

When the apple is full ripe, the iuise looseth that strength. The apple is eaten, and of good tast. There is also an herbe whose smoke (as we haue rehersed the like before of a certen woodde) is deadly poison.

Then coommynge sumwhat nearer, he sayde: Beholde these Ilandes on the ryght hande and on the lefte, whiche all obeye vnto owre empyre, and are ryche, happye, and blessed, if yowe caule those landes blessed whiche abounde with golde and perle. Wee haue in this Ilande lyttle plentie of golde: But the deepe places of all the seas aboute these Ilandes, are full of perles: wherof yowe shall receaue of me as many as yow wyll requyre, so that ye persyste in the bonde of frendeshyppe whiche yowe haue begunne.

Yet emonge those whiche were brought from this Ilande, there was one bought euen in Dariena for a thousande and two hundreth Castelans of golde. This was almost as bygge as a meane walnutte:An other perle of great price. And came at the length to the handes of Petrus Arias the gouernoure, who gaue it to that noble and faithefull woman his wyfe, of whose maner of departure with her husbande, wee haue made mention before. Wee muste then needes thinke that this was verye precious which was bowght so deare emonge suche a multitude of perles where they were not bought by one at once, but by poundes and at the least by ounces. It is also to be thought that the Uenecian marchaunte boughte his for no great sum of mony in the East parts.

For the better profe wherof, they saye that they founde certaine pearles coommynge foorthe of their matreces, as beynge nowe coome to the tyme of their full rypenesse,The

Yet do they affyrme by thexperience and industrie of the dyuers, that the greatest pearles lye in the deepest places,where the byggest, meane, and least pearles are engēdred they of the meane sorte hygher, and the least hyghest of all and nearer to the brymme of the water. And saye therfore that the greatest do not wander: but that they are created, nourysshed, and increase in the deepest places of the sea, whether fewe, dyuers, and that but seeldome dare aduenture to diue so deepe to gather them, aswel for feare of the sea crabbes whiche wander emonge these perle fyshes to feede of them,Sea crabbes and for feare of other monsters of the sea, as also leste their brethe shuld fayle them into long remayninge in the water. And this they saye to bee the cause why the owldest and therfore byggest sea muscles,The sea muscles wherin perles are engendred. inhabyte the deepest places from whense they are not lyghtly moued by tempestes. Furthermore, howe muche the bygger and oulder these fyshes are, they say that in their larger matrices, the greater number and bygger pearles are founde: And that for this cause, there are fewer founde of the byggest sorte. They thyncke also, that when they fyrste faule from their fysshes in the deepe places, they are deuoured of other fysshes, bycause they are not yet harde. Ageyne, the smaulest differ from the byggest in a certayne swellynge or impostumation whiche the Spaniardes caule a tympane. For they denye that to be a pearle which in oulde muscles cleaueth fast to the shel: But that it is a warte, whiche beynge rased from the shell with a fyle, is rounde and bryght but onely of one syde, and not precious, beynge rather of the nature of the fyshe it selfe, then of a pearle. They confesse that they haue seene certayne of these muscles cleauynge on rockes: Yet these but fewe, and nothynge woorthe. It is also to bee thought that the pearle fysshes or sea muscles whiche are founde in India, Arabie, the redde sea, or Taprobana, are ruled in suche order as the afore named famous autours haue written. For their opinion herein is not vtterly to bee reiected, forasmuche as they were learned men and trauayled longe in the serchynge of these thynges. But wee haue nowe spoken suffyciently of these sea fysshes and of their egges which the fonde nysenes

When this man perceaued the lawier lookynge on his booke, marueylynge thereat, he came runninge vnto him, and by interpretours of the kynge whom he serued, spake thus vnto him: Haue yowe also bookes wherin yowe may reserue thynges in perpetual memorye?Bookes.

Owre men sent foorth a fewe foote men and with them theyr laundresses to wasshe theyr shertes and sheetes. For from the Ilande of Ferrea beinge one of the Ilandes of Canarie (euen vnto this Ilande, for the space of foure thousande and twoo hundreth myles) they had seene no lande where they myght fynde any fresshe water: for as muche as in all this large space, the Ocean is without Ilandes. At theyr commynge therfore to lande, the Canibales assayled them, caried awaye the women, and put

the men to suche distresse that fewe of them escaped. By reason wherof, Pontius being greately discomfited, durste not inuade the Canibales, fearynge theyr venemed arrowes which these naked manhunters can direct most certenly.

Yet had they but lyttle golde: for hee had caryed all his stuffe with hym. Here they founde certeyne slaues marked in the faces after a straunge sorte. For with a sharpe prycke made eyther of bone, or elles with a thorne, they make holes in their faces: and foorthwith sprinkelynge a pouder theron, they moiste the pounced place with a certeyne blacke of redde

iuise, whose substaunce is of suche tenacitie and claniminesse, that it wyll neuer weare awaye. They brought these slaues away with them. They saye that this iuise is of such sharpnesse and putteth them to suche payne, that for extreeme doloure they haue no stomacke to their meate certaine dayes after. The kynges whiche take these slaues in their warres, vse their helpe in seekynge for golde and in tyllage of the grounde, euen as do owre men. From the pallaice of Iuana. folowynge the course of the water aboute tenne myles towarde the Southe, they entered into the dominion of an other kynge, whome owre men named the oulde man, bycause hee was oulde, not passynge of his other name. In the regyon of this kynge also, they founde golde in all places bothe on the lande and in the ryuers.Golde. This region is verye fayre and frutefull: and hath in it many famous ryuers.

For such is the nature of this blynde goddesse, that she oftentimes delyteth in the ouerthrowe of them whom she hath exalted: and taketh plesure in confounding hygh thinges with lowe, and the contrary.

We haue sayde also that in theyr orchardes they noryshe a tree which beareth a kynde of greate gourdes. Of these gourdes therefore well stopped leaste any water shulde enter in at theyr ryftes and cause them to sinke,Gourdes of the tree. they cast many in the shalowe pooles: where, by theyr continuall wanderynge and wauerynge with the motions of the wynde and water, they put the foules owt of suspection and feare. The fouler in the meane tyme, disguysinge hym selfe as it were with a visour, putteth a great gourde on his head much lyke to a helmet, with two holes neare about his eyes,

his face and hole heade besyde beinge couered therwith. And thus entereth he into the poole euen vnto the chynne. For beinge from theyr infancie exercised in swymmynge and accustomed to the waters, they refuse not to continue therein a longe space. The foules thynkynge this gourde to be one of the other that swymme vppon the water, the fouler goeth softly to the place wher he seeth the greatest flocke of foules: And with waggynge his heade, counterfectinge the mouing of the wauerynge gourdes, drawethe neare to the foules: where softely puttynge foorth his ryght hande, he soodenly snatcheth one by the legges and plungeth her into the water where he putteth her into a bagge whiche he hath with hym of purpose The other foules supposinge that this dyued into the water of her owne motion to seke for foode (as is their maner) are nothyng moued hereby, but go forwarde on their waye as before, vntyll they also faule into the same snare.

                     er opinions of the swift course of the Ocean towarde the west. also of the maner of gathering of golde in the golde myne of Dariena, as I was aduertised of late. And with these two quyet and peaceable thynges, we wyl make an ende of the tragical affayres of the Ocean: and therwith byd yowre holynes fare wel. So it is therfore, that Andreas Moralis the pylot, and Ouiedus (of whom we haue made mention before) repayred to me, at my house in the towne of Matrite, As we met thus togyther, there arose a contention betwene them two, as concernynge this course of the Ocean. They both agree that these landes and regions perteynynge to the dominion of Castile, doo with one continuall tract and perpetuall bonde, embrase as one hole firme lande or continent al the mayne lande lyinge on the north syde of Cuba and the other Ilandes,The continēt or firme land. beinge also northwest both from Cuba and Hispaniola. Yet as touchynge the course of the water, they varrie in opinion. For Andreas, wyll that this vyolent course of water bee receaued in the lappe of the supposed continente

which bendeth so much and extendeth so farre towarde the North, as we haue said: And that by the obiect or resistance of the lande so bendynge and crookynge, the water shulde as it were rebounde in coompasse, and by force therof be dryuen about the north syde of Cuba and the other Ilandes excluded without the circle cauled Tropicus Caneri, where the largenes of the sea maye receaue the waters faulynge frome the narowe streames, and therby represse that inordinate course, by reason that the sea is there very large and great. I can compare his meanynge to nothynge more aptely then to the swyfte streame commyng foorth of a mylle and faulyng into the myl poole. For in al suche places where waters runne with a vyolent faule through narowe chanels, and are then receaued in large pooles, they are soodenly disparcled and theyr violence broken: So that wheras before they seemed of such force as to ouerthrowe all thynges beinge in theyr waye, it can not then be perceaued which way they runne. The Admiral him selfe Diegus Colonus,
                  The vyages of Diegus Colonus. sonne and heyre to Christophorus Colonus the fyrst fynder of these landes (who had nowe in commyng and goinge, foure tymes passed throughe these seas) beinge demaunded of me what he founde or perceaued in saylynge too and fro,The vyage from the new landes to Spayne. answered that there was muche difficultie in returnynge the same way by the which they go. But wheras they fyrst take the waye by the mayne sea towarde the North before they directe theyr course to Spayne, he saythe that in that tract, he felt the shippe sumtymes a lyttle dryuen backe by the contrary course of the water. Yet supposeth that this chaunceth onely by the ordinarie flowynge and reflowynge of the sea: And the same not to be enforced by the circumflection or course of the water reboundynge in compasse as we haue sayde. But thinketh rather, that this mayne lande or supposed continent, shulde sumwhere bee open: And that the sayde open place, shoulde bee as it were a gate, enterie, or streyght, diuydyng the North partes of that lande from the South: by the which also, the Ocean runnynge towarde the West, may by the rotation or impulsion of the heauens, bee dryuen about the hole earth. Ouiedus agreeth with Andreas Motralis as touchynge the continuall adherence and closenes of the sayde continente. Yet neyther that the waters shulde so beate ageynst the bendynge backe of the West lande, or bee in

such sorte repulsed and dryuen into the mayne sea. But saith that he hath diligently consydered, that the waters runne from the deepest and myddest of the maine sea, towarde the West. Also that saylinge nere vnto the shore with smaule vesselles, he founde the same waters to returne ageine towarde the East.The contrary course of waters. So that in the same place, they runne together with contrary course, as we oftentimes see the lyke to chaunce in riuers wherby the obiecte of the bankes, diuers whirlepooles and turnynges aryse in the water. By reason wherof, if any chaffe, strawe, woodde, or any other thyng of lyght substance be caste in any suche places in ryuers, it foloweth that al such as runne with the water in the myddest of the chanell, procede well forwarde: But suche as faule into the bendynge goulfes and indented margentes of the crooked bankes, are caryed ouerthwarte the chanell, and so wander about vntyll they meete with the ful and directe course of the ryuer. Thus haue we made yowe partener of suche thinges as they haue gyuen vs, and writen their dyuers opinions. We wyll then gyue more certeyne reason, when more certeyne truth shalbe knowen. We must in the meane tyme, leane to opinions vntil the day coome appointed of god to reueale this secreate of nature, with the perfecte knowleage of the pointe of the pole starre.The poynt of the pole star, Hauyng sayd thus muche of the course of the Ocean, a briefe declaration of the golde mynes of Dariena,
                  The golde mynes of Dariena and the maner of gatherynge golde. shall close vppe owre Decades and make an ende of owre trauayles. Wee haue sayde, that nyne myles distante from Dariena, are the sydes of the hylles and the drye playnes in the whiche golde is gathered bothe on the drye lande, and also on the bankes and in the chanelles of ryuers. Therfore to al such as are wyllynge to gather golde, there is of ordinarie custome appointed to euery man by the suruoiers of the mynes, a square plotte of grounde conteyning twelue pases, at the arbitriment of the chooser, so that it bee not grounde already occupied, or lefte of other. The portion of grounde beinge thus chosen (as it were assygned of the augures to buylde a temple) they inclose their slaues within the same, whose helpe the Christians vse in tyllynge of their grounde and gatherynge of golde, as we haue saide. These places appointed vnto them, they keepe as long as them lyue. And if they perceaue tookens of lyttle golde, they requyre an other plotte of

The kynge receaued owre men honorably and broughte them into his pallayce: where he feasted them well after his maner. They are accustomed to eate fleshe, and haue great plentie of beastes and foules:Plentie of beastes and foules. as peacockes, and other whiche they francke and feede in their houses: Also dyuers kyndes of wylde foules of the mountaines, wooddes, and waters: Likewise partriches, quailes, turtle dooues, duckes, and geese. Of beastes, they haue connies, woolues, lyons, tigers, foxes, wylde boores, hartes, and hares. After this banquet, the kyng with his traine and famylie brought owre men into a brode crosse way where many streates do meete.Theyr Idoles and Idolatry. In this, they shewed them as it were a great and highe aulter buylded foure square of marble compacte together partly with the toughe cleye of Babilon cauled Bitumem, and partly with smaule stoones. It had on euery syde foure steares. Uppon the altare was an Image of a man made of marble: and fast by it the Images of two beastes of vnknowen shape, whiche seemed as thoughe they wolde with yanynge mouthes haue torne in sunder the bealy of the mannes Image.

In this place offenders were put to death: In token wherof they sawe innumerable arrowes steined with bludde, sum scatered, sum lyinge on heapes, and sum broken: Also a great number of mennes bones lying in a court or yarde nere vnto this funestal place.

For he made signes vnto them that on the further syde of the nexte hyll, they shulde fynde sprynges of water, intendyng to haue assayled them in that narowe passage. But by the colouryng of theyr forheades (as they are accustomed in theyr warres) and by the bearynge of theyr bowes and other weapons, owr men perceaued theyr wylynes, and refused to go any further. Yet a thousande of the Barbarians assayled theym vnwares and vnprepared. By reason wherof, they were put to flyght, and dyuers of them slayne in the chase.The Spanyardes are put to flyght and many slayne. Many that fledde to warde the shippes, were entangeled in the mudde and maryshes nere vnto the shore. Twentie and two, were slayne with arrowes, and the resydewe for the most parte, wounded. Franciscus Fernandes the gouernour of the nauie, receaued in this conflicte three and thirtie woundes. And in maner none escaped without hurt. If they had gonne to the hylles whiche were appoynted them, they had byn slayne euery man. They therfore that escaped, returned to the Ilande of Fernardina frome whense they came, where they were receaued of theyr felows with heauie chere. But when Diegus Velasquen the gouernoure of the Ilande, had intelligence hereof,An other expedition. he immediatly furnyshed a newe nauie of foure Caraueles with three hundreth men. Of this nauie he appoynted Iohn Grisalua his neuie, to be the gouernour: And assigned for vnder capitaynes, Alphons Auila, Frances Montegio, and Peter Aluarado. For the pylot he assigned Antonie Alamino who had the regiment of the fyrst nauie. They attempted the same vyage ageyne, but declyned sumwhat more towarde the South about threscore and tenne myles.

Then Alaminus the pylot turned his sailes to the North side wherof he had better knowleage. Thus at the length, they

came to the towne Campeebium and kynge Lazarus with whom they had bin that attempted the fyrst vyage the yeare before. At the fyrst, they were gentelly receaued, and requyred to resort to the towne. But shortly after,The Barbarians make resistaunce. they repented that they had bydden them: and there vpon wylled them to stay about a stones cast from the towne, and to proceade no further.
               When owre men desyred that they myght make prouision for freshe water before theyr departure, they assigned them to a certeyne well which they had lefte behynde them. Declaringe further, that it shulde be lawfull for them to take water there or els no wheare. Owre men rested that nyght in the fyelde adioynynge to the well. The which thynge the Barbarians suspectinge, assembled an army of three thousande men, and encamped not farre from them. Bothe partes passed awaye the nyght without sleepe.

This they cauled Grisalua after the name of the gouernoure.The ryuer Grisalua. The barbarians marueilyng at the huge greatnesse and mouynge of owre shyppes, came swarmyng the bankes on bothe sydes the ryuer, to the number of syxe thousande men armed with targettes and brest plates of gold,Targets and brest plates of golde. bowes and arrowes, brode swoordes of heauy woodde, and longe iauelens hardened at the endes with fyer: Thus stondynge in battayle raye to defende their coostes, and with proude countenaunces forbyddinge owre men to coome alande.

Here also the language of thinterpretours of Cuba agreed well enowghe with thers. When they had admitted the peace profered them by thinterpretours, al the Canoas staied excepte one whiche approched toward the shippes. A certeyne ruler that was in this Canoa, demaunded of owre men what they sought in other mennes landes. They answered, gold. And that, for permutation of other ware, and not of gift or vyolently.

But the gouernour denyed that he coulde release hym withowte the consent of his felowes: And therfore kept hym styll to proue what he could further knowe of hym.

One of them in the whiche Frauncis Montegius the vnder gouernour was caryed, sayled harde by the shore: and the other twoo kept aloofe within prospecte of the land. Thinhabitauntes of these coastes also, no lesse marueylynge at the shyppes then dyd the other, came with twelue Canoas to Montegius, desyringe hym by thinterpretours to coome alande, promysynge in the name of their kynge, that hee shoulde be honorably entertayned. But Montegious answered that hee coulde not assente to their request bycause his coompanions were so farre from hym. Yet dyd he gyue them certayne of owre thynges straunge vnto them, and thankes for their gentylnesse. Shortly after espyinge a great towne they directed their course thither. Thinhabitauntes prohibyted them to coome alande, and came foorthe ageynst them with bowes & quyuers ful of arrowes, brode swoordes made of heauy woode, and Iauelens hardned at the ende with fier.

Hauynge therefore founde and doone these thynges whereof we haue spoken, Crisalua returned to the Ilande of Fernandina well contented,Other viages from Cuba or Fernandina. but so were not his companions. We muste nowe diuerte sumwhat from this matter, and speake of an other nauigation. And from thense wyll we returne to these landes which owre men haue founde. So it is therfore, that Diegus Velasquen the gouernour of the Iland of Fernandina, about the same tyme that he had sent foorth this nauie of foure Caraueles, he prepared an other nauigation of onely one Carauell and one brygantine with fortie and fyue men. These exercised vyolent handes ageinst thinhabitauntes of those regions where they arryued, thynkynge that they myght forceably drawe them to the dyggynge of golde bycause they were Caffranite Idolaters and circumcised.

Owte of one of these (which they named Sancta Marina) they violentely caried away three hundreth men and women which they thrust into the Carauell and returned immediatly to Fernardina, leauynge the brigantine with .xxv. of theyr felowes to thintent to hunt for more men.

Now shall you heare how fortune sought the reuenge of these pore wretches. Therfore as theyr kepers went aland and few remained in the Carauel, they perceuing occasiō ministred wher by they myght recouer theyr libertie, soodeynely snatched vp owt mens weapons and slewe syxe of them which yet remayned in the Carauel, whyle the residue lepte into the sea.The Barba

where they burnte the Carauel and caried away the weapons with them. From hense they conueyed them selues to theyr owne countreys with the Canoas of this Ilande. Heare in lyke maner they pryuilie assayled them that were lefte with the brigantyne, and slewe many of them also. The residue that escaped, fledde to the brigantine where they bewayled theyr felowes deathes and counted theyr owne escape a victorie. On the shore not farre from the place where they suffered this misfortune, there is a tree, in the toppe wherof they set vp a crosse, and graued this inscription in the barke of the tree: Vannuis Aldarieci. There is a ryuer named Darien, on the banke wherof standeth the chiefe citie of the supposed continent.The chiefe citie of the supposed continent. The gouernour therfore hauing intelligence herof, sent with all speede two shippes of warre well furnyshed, to the ayde of them that were lefte. But they were wyse to late. Yet folowynge the viewe of the crosse, they came to the shore and redde the letters grauen on the tree, but durste not attempte fortune. Thus with all theyr hardie souldiers departinge from hense with despayre, they sayled to the nexte Ilande, out of the which they caryed away by violence fyue hundreth men and women, supposynge lykewyse that they myght lawfully so doo bycause they were Idolaters and circumcised.

thus pacified, the resydue of the Barbarians were caryed to the towne of Sanctiago and condemned to laboure in the golde mynes.

Therfore, after that it was knowen to owre men of howe greate momente these trattes were, the Spanyardes which inhabited the Ilande of Cuba Anunctus beinge the gouernour of the Ilande furnyshed a newe nauie of ten Carauelles and fyue hundreth menne,An other vyage of .x.

As soone as Frauncis Fernandes of Corduba, and then Iohn Grisalua came within prospecte of the Ilande of Sacrifyces (wherof we haue made mention before) soodenly a tempest of contrary wynde prohibited theym to take lande and drowe them backewarde to Cozumella lyinge on the East syde of Iucatana.

Also none other water then in welles and cesterns, bycause it lacketh riuers and springes by reason it is plaine, conteynynge onely .xlv. myles in circuite. At the coommynge of owre men, thinhabitauntes fledde to the thicke woods, & forsoke their townes for feare. Owre men entered into their houses where they founde plentie of vyttayles and many ornamentes perteynynge to the furnyshynge of their houses, as hanginges and carpettes of dyuers colours, sheetes also of gossampine cotton (whiche they caule Amaccas) and muche apparell.Carpets and sheetes. They haue furthermore innumerable bookes,Innumerable bokes. of the whiche with many other thinges sent to owre newe Emperour, we wyll speake more largely hereafter. The souldiers wandered about the Iland & viewe althynges diligently, kepyng them selues styll in battell raye least they myght be sodenly inuaded. They founde but a fewe of thinhabitauntes and onely one woman in their coompanie. By thinterpretours of Cuba and other whiche the Spaniardes tooke fyrst from Iucatana, they perswaded the woman to caule the kynges that were absente.

For in al this so large a space of land, the deuelyshe anxietie for the desyre of wicked money, hath not yet oppressed thinhabitantes.

                     Valdiuia.

Unhappy Valdiuia therfore,The shipwracke of Ualdiuis. takynge this matter in hand in an euell houre, was with a sudden and vyolent whirlewinde, dryuen vppon certayne quickesandes in the prospecte of the Ilande of Iamaica, lyinge on the South syde of Hispaniola and Cuba. These blind and swalowyng sandes, the Spaniardes caule vypers:The quicke sandes cauled vypers. And that by good reason, bycause in them many shyppes are entangled, as the lycertes are implycate in the tayles of the vipers. While the Carauell thus wresteled with the water, it was so bruste in sunder, that Valdiuia with thirtie of his felowes, coulde scarsely with muche difficultie descende into the shyppe boate: where, without

                  ers, and without sayles, they were caried awaye by the vyolence of the water.

They wandered thus .xiii. dayes not knowyng whyther they went

nor yet fyndynge any thyng to eate. Famen consumed seuen of them whiche were caste in the sea to feede the fyshes. The resydue lykewise in maner consumed by famen and faulynge from one calamitie into an other, were driuen to Iucatana and fell into the handes of a cruell kynge who slewe Valdiuia the gouernour with certayne of his felowes.Ualdiuia is sacrificed to Idoles. And when hee had fyrst sacrifyced them to his Zemes, shortely after he eate them with his frindes of that conspiracie. For they eate onely their enemyes and straungiers: And doo otherwise absteyne from mannes fleshe. In this meane tyme, while Hieronimus Aqullraris with syxe of his felowes were reserued to be sacrifyced the thirde daye,howe Aquillaris escaped they brooke their bandes, escaped the handes of that cruell tyranne, and fledde to an other kynge beynge his enemye, who receaued them, yet onely as bondemen. It is a straunge thinge to heare of the moother of this Aquillaris. For as soone as she harde that her soonne was faulen into the handes of the nations that eate mannes fleshe, shee fell madde incontinent: So that when so euer after, shee sawe any meate rostyng at the fyer, or onely ready spytted to laye to the fyer, shee ceased not to crye out in this maner. O me moste wretched moother: Behold the members of my son. But to returne to owre purpose. When Aquillaris had now receaued the gouernours letter sente by the Cozumellane messengers, hee declared to the kynge his mayster (whose name was Taxmarus) what was their erraunt thither,kynge Taxmarus. and wherfore they were sent: vsyng in the meane tyme many large discourses in expressynge the great poure and magnifycence of their kynge who had of late arriued in those coastes. Also of their humanitie and gentilnesse toward their frindes and suche as submytted them selues to them, and againe their rygour and fiercenesse ageynst suche as stoobernly eyther contemned them or denyed their requestes. With these woordes he broughte Taxmarus into suche feare, that the maister was now fayne to desyre his seruaunt so to handell the matter that they myght quyetly enter into his dominion as his freendes and not as his enemies.

They demaunded what owre men required. Aquillaris answered, vyttayles.

In so muche that by his procuratour, he accused them before the Senate as fugitiue theeues and traytours. They on the other parte alleaged that they had dooen the kyng better seruyce then he: And that they had shewed suffycient obedience in appealyng to the kyng as the hygher Iudge. But the gouernour required by the vertue of his commission and the kinges letters pattentes that they myght be headed for their disobedience ageinst hym whom they knewe to be autorised by the kynge. They ageine replied that they had not offended the kyng, but rather deserued rewarde for their great dangiers and trauailes.

Wee haue also declared how at the arriual of Petrus Arias the newe gouernour, he deuided his armye into Centurions, that is, capitaines ouer hundrethes, whom hee sent foorth dyuers waies. What tragedies folowed hereof, I wyll absolue in fewe woordes, bycause all are horrible and

vnpleasaunte. For sence we fynyshed owre Decades,Contention betwene Uaschus and Petrus Arias. there hath byn none other then kyllynge, sleyinge, murtherynge and accusinge. The kynge made Vaschus gouernoure but durynge his pleasure. His courage was such, and his factes so notorious, that he coulde not longe abyde the hautynes of Petrus Arias. To bee breefe, theyr faulynge owte and discord confounded al thynges. Iohn Cacedus the pulpitte fryer of the order of saynt Frances, dyd his vttermoste endeuour to make them frendes, promysynge vnto Vaschus the dowghter of Petrus Arias to wyfe. But no meanes coulde be founde howe these two which bore the chiefe rule, myght bee brought to agreement. At the length the matter grewe to such extremitie, that Petrus Arias fyndynge occasion of querelynge ageynste Vaschus,
                  Petrus Arias commandeth that Uaschus be put to death. sent processe to the maiestrates of the towne, wherby he commaunded them to strangle Vaschus, and fyue other which were chiefe capitaynes vnder hym: Alleagynge that they and their confetherates conspired to rebel in the South sea: And that Vaschus hym selfe for that intente, had buylded and furnished foure shippes to search the south coastes of the supposed continent: Also that to his three hundreth souldiers and companions which he had with hym, he shulde speake woordes of this effecte as foloweth. My frendes, and felowes of my longe peynes and trauayles:Uaschus is accused. Howe longe shall we be subiecte to the commaundement of other, sythe wee haue bydden the brunt and ouercumme thenterprise for the whiche this newe gouernour was sent with so great a multitude? Who can any longer abyde his pryde and insolentie? Lette vs therefore folowe these coastes whyther so euer fortune shall dryue vs: And amonge these so many pleasaunt and fruteful prouinces of this large lande, let vs chose one in the whiche wee maye with libertie spende that portion of owre lyues which yet remayneth. Who can fynde vs, or shalbe able to profer vs vyolence? When these or the lyke woordes were declared to Petrus Arias, he sente to the Southe partes for Vaschus, wyllynge hym by the vertue of his commission to repayre to him foorth with. Vaschus obeyed, and at his commynge was caste in pryson: yet constantly denyinge that euer he entended any suche thynge. Wytnesses were brought ageynst hym, and his wordes rehearsed from the begynnynge.Uaschus is put to death. To conclude, he was iudged woorthy death, and was put to execution. And this

is the rewarde wherwith the blynde goddesse oftentymes recompenseth such as haue susteyned great trauayles and daungiours to bee hyghly in her fauoure. Petrus Arias leauynge his wyfe in Dariena,

This riuer fauleth into the furthest corner of the goulfe of Vraba by seuen portes or mowthes as dooth the ryuer of Nilus into the Egyptian sea,The goulfe of Uraba. whose large description yowe may also reade in owre Decades. That the mountaynes on euery syde about this ryuer,The ryche mountaynes of Dabaiba. are rych in golde, we haue learned by thinformation of thinhabitauntes, of whom we made diligent inquisition.

A naked nation encounterynge with them that had apparell, the armed ageynste the vnarmed, had the ouerthrowe in maner in all conflictes, and were other all slayne or wounded. They vse inuenemed arrowes, and are suche experte archers, that if they espye any place of theyr enemie bare or vnarmed, they wyll not lyghtly fayle to stryke him there They vse also many dartes,Dartes. which in the tyme of the battayle they hurle so thicke a farre of, that they take the lyght of the sonne frō theyr enemies as it were with a clowde.

               To the reader.
               
                  ALthough amonge dyuers which haue wrytten of the Ocean and Weste Indies, there is none to be compared to Peter Martyr of Angleria, in declarynge by philosophical discourses the secreate causes of naturall affectes bothe as touchynge the lande, the sea, the starres, and other straunge woorkes of nature, yet forasmuche as of later dayes those countreys haue byn better knowen and searched, and dyuers suche particular and notable thynges founde as are conteyned in the hystories of later wryters, emonge the number of whom, Gonzalus Ferdinandus Ouiedus, (whom lerned Cardanus compareth to the ancient writers) is doubtles the chiefe, I haue therfore thought good to ioyne to the Decades of Peter Martyr certeyne notable thynges which I haue gathered owte of his booke intiteled the Summarie or abbrigement of his generall hystorie of the west Indies wrytten in th
                     •
                   firme lande of the same in the citie of Sancta Maria Antiqua in Dariena (where he dwelte and was gouernoure many yeares) And dedicated to Themperous maiestie, as maye appeare by the epystell folowynge.
            
            
               ¶ To the most hygh and myghtie prince Charles the fyfte of that name: Emperour of Rome, Kynge of Spayne, and of the twoo Sicilies, of bothe the sydes of the streyght of Faro, Kynge of Hierusalem and Hungarie, Duke of Burgonie and Earle of Flaunders, Lorde and inheritoure of the firme lande and Ilandes of the Weste Ocean. &c. Gonzalus Ferdinandus Ouiedus his most humble seruant wysheth health and perpetual felicitie.
               
                  THe thynges whiche principally preserue and mayntayne the woorkes of nature in the memories of men, are hystories and bookes composed of the same. Amonge the whiche certes those are esteemed moste trewe and autentyke which haue byn wrytten by wyttie and expert

men well trauayled in the worlde, as faythfull wytnesses of suche thynges as they haue partely seene and byn partely informed by credible persons. Of this mynde and opinion was Plinie, who better then any other autoure hathe wrytten in xxxvii. bookes al that perteyneth to the naturall historie, conteyned al in one volume dedicated to Uespasian Themperour. Wherein, as a prudente historiographer, he declareth suche thynges as he had harde: Attributynge the seconde autoritie to suche as he had redde in autoures that wrote before hym: And thyrdely ioyned to the same hystorie, such thynges as he hym selfe had seene as moste certeyne testimonie. Whose exemple I folowynge, wyl in this my breefe summarie reduce and represent to yowr maiesties memorie such thynges as I haue seene in yowre Empyre of the West Indies aswell in the Ilandes as in the firme lande of the Ocean sea, where I haue serued nowe more then twelue yeares in the place of suruoyer of the golde mynes by the commaundemente of the Catholyke kynge Don Fernando the fyfte of that name and graundfather vnto yowre maiestie, to whom god gaue great fame and glorie. Sense whose death also I haue lykewies serued and trust whyle the rest of my lyfe yet remayneth, to serue yowre maiestie as shall please yowe to commaunde. As touchynge which thinges and such other lyke, I haue more largely written in a hystorie begunne as sone as my age was rype to take suche matters in hande. Wherein furthermore I haue made mention of suche thynges as haue chaunced in Spaine, from the yeare .1494. vnto this tyme. Addynge also thereunto suche thynges woorthy memorie as I haue obserued in other realmes and prouinces where I haue trauayled. And haue likewise particulerly wrytten the lyues and woorthy actes of the catholyke Princes of famous memorie Don Ferdinando and lady Elizabeth his wyfe to theyr last dayes. After whose fruition of heauenly Paradyse, I haue noted suche thynges as haue chaunced in yowre most fortunate succession. Not omittynge particularly to wryte a large booke of such thynges as haue seemed moste woorthy to bee noted as touchynge yowre maiesties Indies. But for asmuche as that volume remaineth in the citie of San. Dominico in the Ilande of Hispaniola where I dwell and am placed in housholde with wyfe, chyldren, and famelie, I haue brought no more with me of that my writynge

then I beare in memorie. Determynynge notwithstandynge for yowre maiesties recreation to make a breefe rehearsall of certeyne notable thynges wherof I haue more largely entreated in my sayde general historie, and such as may seeme moste woorthy to bee redde of yowre maiestie. Of the which, although a great parte haue byn wrytten by other who haue also seene the same, yet perhappes they are not so exactly and particularly described as of me, forasmuche as in maner all that trauayle into these Indies haue greater respecte to luker and gaynes then diligently to searche the woorkes of nature wherunto I haue byn euer naturally inclyned, and haue therfore with all possible endeuour applyed myne eyes and intelligence to fynde the same. And this presente Summarie shall not bee contrary or dyuers from my larger historie wherin (as I haue sayde) I haue more amplye declared these thynges: but shal onely more breefely expresse theffect therof vntyl such tyme as Godde shal restore me to myne owne house, where I may accomplyshe and fynishe my sayd general hystorie. Where vnto to gyue the fyrst principle, I say that Don Christopher Colonus (as it is well knowen) beinge the fyrste Admyrall of this India, discouered the same in the dayes of the Catholyke kynge Don Ferdinando and the ladye Elyzabeth his wyfe, graundfather and graundmother vnto yowre maiestie: In the yeare .1491. And came to Barzalona in the yeare 1492. with the fyrst Indians and other shewes and profes of the great ryches and notice of this west Empire. The whiche gyfte and benefyte was suche, that it is vnto this daye, one of the greatest that euer any subiect or seruant hath done for his prince or countrey, as is manifeste to the hole worlde. And to saye the trewth, this shall doubtlesse bee so commodious and profytable vnto the hole realme of Spayne, that I repute hym no good Castilian or Spanyarde that doothe not recognise the same. And (as I haue sayde before) forasmuch as in my sayde generall historie I haue more largely intreated of these thynges, I intend at this present only briefely to rehearse certeyne especiall thynges, the whiche suerly are verye fewe in respecte of the thousandes that myght bee sayde in this behalfe. Fyrst therfore I wyl speake sumwhat of the nauigation into these parties. Then of the generation of the nations whiche are founde in the same, with their

rytes, customes, and cerimonies. Also of beastes, foules, byrdes, woormes, fysshes, seas, ryuers, sprynges, trees, plantes, herbes, and dyuers other thinges which are engendered boothe on the lande and in the water. And forasmuche as I am one of thorder and company of them that are appointed to returne into these regions to serue yowre maiestie, yf therfore the thynges conteyned in this booke shall not bee distincte in such order as I promised to performe in my greater woorke. I desyre yowre maiestie to haue no respecte herevnto, but rather to consyder the noueltie of suche straunge thynges as I haue herein declared, whiche is the chiefe ende that moued me to write. Protestyng that in this Summarie I haue written the trewth of suche thynges as coome to my remembraunce: wherof not onely I my selfe can testifye, but also diuers other woorthy and credible men which haue bin in those regions, and are nowe presente in yowre maiesties courte. And thus it shal suffyce to haue saide thus much vnto yowre maiestie in maner of a proheme vnto this present worke which I most humbly desyre yowre maiesticas thankfully taccept, as I haue written it faythfully.
            
            
               ¶Of the ordinary nauygation from Spayne to the Weste Indies.
               
                  THe nauygation whiche is commonly made from Spayne to the Weste India, is from Siuile, where yowre maiestie haue yowre house of contractation for those partes, with also yowre offycers thervnto perteynynge, of whom the capitaines take their passeporte and lycence. The patrones of suche shyppes as are appoynted to these vyages, imbarke theym selues at san Luca di Barameda, where the ryuer Cuadalchiber entereth into the Ocean sea. And from hense they folowe their course toward the Ilandes of Canarie. Of these seuen Ilandes, they commonly touche two, that is, eyther Grancanaria or Gomera
                  ▪ And here the shyppes are furnysshed with freshe water, fuell, cheese, biefe, and suche other thynges whiche may seeme requisyte to be added to suche as they brynge with them owte of Spayne. From Spayne to these Ilandes, is coommonly

eyght dayes saylinge, or lyttle more or lesse. And when they are arryued there, they haue sayled two hundereth and fyftie leaques, whiche make a thousande myles, accomptyng foure myles to a leaque as is their maner to recken by sea. Departynge from the sayde Ilandes to folowe their course, the shippes tary .xxv. dayes, or a lyttle more or lesse, before they see the fyrste lande of the Ilandes that lye before that whiche they caule La Spagnuola or Hispaniola. And the lande that is commonly fyrste scene, is one of these Ilandes whiche they caule Ogni sancti Marigalante (or Galanta) La Desseada (otherwise cauled Desyderata) Matanino, Dominica, Guadalupe, San. Christoual, or summe other of the Ilandes wherof there are a great multitude lyinge aboute these aforesaide. Yet it sumtymes so chaunceth that the shippes passe withowte the syght of any of the sayde Ilandes, or any other that are within that course vntyll they coome to the Iland of Sancti Iohannis or Hispaniola, or Iamaica, or Cuba, whiche are before the other. It may also chaunce that they ouer passe all these likewyse, vntyll they faule vppon the coastes of the fyrme lande. But this chaunceth when the pylote is not well practised in this nauigation or not perfecte in the trewe carde. But makynge this viage with experte maryners (wherof there is nowe great plentie) one of the sayde fyrste Ilandes shall euer bee knowen. And from the Ilandes of Canarie to one of the fyrste of these, the distaunce is nyne hundreth leaques by saylynge, or more. And from hense to the citie of saynte Dominike which is in the Ilande of Hispaniola, is a hundreth and fyftie leaques: So that from Spayne hitherto, is a thousand and three hundreth leaques. Yet for asmuche as sumtimes the nauigation procedeth not so directly, but that it chaunceth to wander euer on the one syde or on the other, wee may well saye that they haue nowe sayled a thousande and fyue hundreth leaques and more. And if the nauigation be slowe by reason of summe hynderaunce, it commonly chaunceth to be fynisshed in .xxxv. or .xl. dayes. And this happeneth for the moste parte, not accomptynge the extremes: that is, eyther of them that haue slowe passage, or of them that arryue in verye shorte tyme. For wee owghte to consyder that which chaunceth most commonly. The returne from those partes to Spayne, is not fynysshed without longer tyme, as in the space of .l. dayes, or a lyttle more or lesse.

Neuerthelesse in this present yeare of .1525. there came foure shyps from the Iland of San Dominico to saint Luca in Spaine, in .xxv. dayes. But (as I haue sayd) we ought not to iudge of that whiche chaunceth seldome, but of that which happeneth most ordinarily. This nauigation is very safe and much vsed, euen vnto the sayd Ilande. And from this to the firme land, the shyppes trauerse diuers wayes for the space of fiue, syxe, or seuen dayes saylynge, or more, accordyng to the partes or coastes whither they directe their vyages, forasmuche as the sayde fyrme lande is verye great and large, and many nauigations and vyages are directed to dyuers partes of the same. Yet to the fyrme land whiche is nearest to this Iland, and lyeth directly ageynst San Dominico, the passage is fynisshed in the tyme aforesayde. But it shalbe muche better to remytte all this to the carde of these nauigations and the new Cosmographie, of the whiche no parte was knowen to Ptolomie or any other of the owlde wrytters.
            
            
               ¶Of twoo notable thynges as touchyng the West Indies: And of the great rychesse brought from thense into Spayne⸫
               
                  AFter my vniuersall description of the historie of the Indies, there commeth to my rememberaunce two thynges chiefely to be noted as touchynge thempire of this West Indies perteynynge to the dominion of yowre maiestye. And these besyde the other particulars wherof I haue suffyciently spoken, are to be consydered as thinges of great importaunce. Wherof, the one is the shortenesse of the way & with what expedition yowr maiesties shyppes maye passe beyonde the mayne fyrme lande of these Indies into the newe Southe sea cauled Mare del Sur lyynge beyond the same. And this to thintent to coome to the Ilandes where the spices growe, besyde the other innumerable rychesse of the kingedomes and signiories whiche confin
                     •
                   with the sayde sea where are so many people and nations of dyuers toonges and maners. The other thinge, is to consyder howe innumerable treasures are entered into Spayne by

these Indies, aswell that whiche commeth dayly from thense as also that is continually to bee looked for, bothe of golde and perle & other marchaunties which are first brought into this yowre realme of Spaine before they are seene of other nations or traded into other realmes. Wherby not onely this yowre realme is greatly inriched, but also the benefyte therof redoundeth to the great profyte of other countreys which are neare thervnto. A testimonye of this, are the double ducades whiche yowre maiestie haue caused to bee coyned, and are disparsed throughowte the hole worlde. But after they are once pa
                     •
                  sed owt of this yowre realme, they neuer returne agein bycause they are the best curraunt money of the world. And therfore if after they haue byn in the handes of straungers they chaunce to be retourned ageyne into Spaine, they coome disguised in an other habite, and are diminisshed of the goodnesse of their golde, with the stampe of yowre maiestye chaunged: So that if it were not for their suche defacynges in other realmes for the cause aforesayde, there shulde not bee founde so great quantitie of fyne golde of the coyne of any prynce in the worlde as of powre maiesties. And the cause of all this, are yowre Indies.
            
            
               ¶Of the mynes of golde, and the maner of woorkynge in theym.
               
                  THis particular of the mynes of gold, is a thing greatly to bee noted: And I maye muche better speake hereof then any other man, forasmuche as there are nowe twelue yeares paste sense I serued in the place of the surueier of the meltynge shoppes perteynynge to the golde mynes of the firme lande, and was the gouernour of the mynes of the Catholyke kyng Don Ferdinando, after whose departure from this lyfe, I serued longe in the same roome in the name of yowr maiestie: By reason wherof, I haue had great occasion to knowe howe golde is founde and wrought owte of the mynes: And do knowe ryght well that this lande is exceadynge ryche: hauynge by my accompte and by the labour of my Indians and slaues, gathered and fyned a great portion of the same: and may therfore the better affyrme this

by testimonie of syght. For I am well assured that in no part of Cas
                        •
                     ilia del oro, that is, golden Castile (otherwise cauled Boragua) no man coulde aske me of the mynes of golde, but that I durste haue bounde my selfe to haue discouered them in the space of ten leagues of the countrey where it shulde haue byn demaunded me, and the same to bee verye ryche. For I was alowed all maner of charges to make searche for the same. And although golde be founde in maner euery where in these regions of golden Castile, yet owght wee not in euery place to bestowe the trauell, and charge to get it owte, bycause it is of lesse quantitie and goodnesse in sum place then in sum. And the myne or beyne whiche owghte to be folowed, ought to bee in a place whiche may stande to saue muche of the charges of the labourers, and for the administration of other necessary thinges that the charges may bee recompensed with gaynes. For there is no doubte but that golde shalbe founde more or lesse in euery place. And the golde whiche is founde in golden Castile, is verye good, and of .xxii. caractes or better in fynesse. Furthermore, besyde this great quantitie of golde whiche I haue sayde to be founde in the mynes, there is also from day to day found or otherwise gotten, great treasure of suche wrought gold as hath byn in the custodie of the subdued Indians and their kynges, aswell of suche as they haue gyuen for their fyne and raunsome, or otherwise as frendes to the Christians, besyde that whiche hath byn vpolently taken from the rebelles. But the greatest parte of the wrought gold whiche the Indians haue, is base and holdeth sumwhat of copper. Of this they make braslettes and chaines and in the same they close their iewels whiche their women are accustomed to weare and esteeme more then all the richesse of the worlde. The maner howe golde is gathered, is this, eyther of suche as is founde in Za
                        •
                     ana, that is to saye in the plaines and riuers of the champian countrey being withowt trees, whether the earth be with gra
                     •
                  se or without. Or of suche as is sumtymes founde on the land without the riuers in places where trees growe, so that to coome by the same, it shalbe requisite to cutte downe many and great trees. But after whiche so euer of these two maners it be founde, eyther in the riuers or ruptures or breaches of waters, or elles in the earth, I wyll shewe howe it is founde in bothe these places,

and howe it is seperate and pourged. Therfore when the myne or veine is discouered, this chaunceth by serchyng and prouyng in suche places as by certeyne sygnes and tooken do appeare to skylfull men apte for the generation of golde and to holde golde. And when they haue founde it, they folowe the myne and labour it, whether it be in the ryuer or in the plaine as I haue sayde. And if it bee founde on the plaine, fyrst they make the place verye cleane where they intende to dygge. Then they dygge eyght or ten foote in length and as muche in breadth: but they goo no deeper then a spanne or two, or more as shall seeme best to the maister of the myne, dyggynge equally. Then they wa
                     •
                  he all the earthe whiche they haue taken owte of the sayde space. And if herein they fynde any golde, they folowe it. And if not, they dygge a spanne deeper, and washe the earth as they dyd before. And if then also, they fynde nothynge, they continue in dyggyng and wasshyng the earth as before vntil they come to the hard rocke or stone. And if in fyne they fynd no gold there, they folowe no further to seeke golde in that place, but go to an other parte. And it is to be vnderstode, that when they haue founde the myne, they folowe it in digginge in the same measure in leuell and deapth vntill they haue made an ende of al the myne which that place conteyneth, if it appere to be riche. This myne ought to consyst of certen feete or pases in length or breadth accordynge to certeyne orders determined. And within that compasse of earth, it is not lawfull for any other to dygge for golde. And where as endeth the myne of hym that fyrste founde the gold, immediatly it is lawfull for any other man that wyl, with a staffe to assygne hym selfe a place by the syde of the same, inclosynge it with stakes or pales as his owne. These mynes of Zauana (that is such as are found in the playnes) owght euer to bee sought neare to sum ryuer or brooke or springe of water, or dyke, or standyng poole, to thende that the golde maye bee wasshed, for the whiche purpose they vse the laboure of certeyne Indians as they doo other in dygginge of the myne. And when they haue dygged owte the myne, they fyl certeine traies with that earth, whiche other Indians haue the charge immediatly to receaue at their handes, and to carye those treyes of earth to the water where it maye bee wasshed. Yet do not they that brynge it,

washe it, but delyuer it to other, puttynge it owte of their owne trayes into theirs which they haue ready in their handes to receaue it. These wasshers for the moste parte, are the Indian women, bycause this woorke is of lesse paine and trauayle then any other. These women when they washe, are accustomed to sytte by the waters syde, with their legges in the water euen vppe to the knees or lesse as the place serueth their purpose. And thus holdynge the trays with earth in their handes by the handles therof, and puttynge the same into the water, they moue them rownde aboute after the maner of syftynge, with a certeyne aptenesse in suche sorte that there entreth no more water into the trais then serueth their turne: And with the selfe same apte mouynge of their trais in the water, they euer auoyd the foule water with the earth owte of the one syde of the vessell, and receaue in cleane water on the other side therof. So that by this meanes by little and lyttle, the water wassheth the earth as the lyghter substaunce owte of the trais, and the golde as the heauier matter resteth in the bottome of the same, beyng rounde and holowe in the myddest lyke vnto a barbars basen. And when all the earth is auoyded, and the golde gathered togither in the bottome of the traye, they putte it aparte, and returne to take more earth, whiche they washe continually as 
                     •
                  efore. And thus they that laboure in this woorke, do gather dayly suche portion of golde as shal please god to graunt to the patrones of these Indians and suche other as trauaile in the same. Furthermore, it is to bee noted that for euery two Indians that washe, it is requisite that two other serue them to brynge earthe from the myne, and other twoo to breake the same smaule and fylle their trais therwith. Also besyde these labourers, it is necessarye that there bee other people in the place where they woorke and reste in the nyghte. These are suche as make their breade, and prouyde for vyttayles and other necessaryes. So that to conclude, there are in all, fyue persons ordinarily assigned to euery traye of wasshers.
               There is an other maner of woorkyng the mynes in riuers or brookes of runnynge waters. And this is, that in auoydynge the water of his course, after that the beddes of the ryuers are drye and vtterlye emptied, they fynde golde emonge the breaches, cliftes, and ryftes of stones, and among

all that is in the bottome of the chanell, and where naturally the riuer runneth of greatest force. So that it chaunceth sum tyme, that when the bedde of the ryuer is good and ryche, they fynde in it great quantitie of golde. And therfore yowe maiestie ought to vnderstande for a generall rule, as it appereth in facte, that all golde is engendered in the toppes and hyghest places of the montaines: And in continuance of time is by lyttle and lyttle browght downe to the vales and plaines by showres of rayne, and the faules of sprynges, ryuers, and brookes hauynge their originall in the mountaynes and descendynge from the same, notwithstandynge it bee oftentymes founde in the plaines farre from the mountaynes.
               But when it chaunceth to be founde in great quantitie, it is for the moste parte amonge the mountaynes and in the riuers, or their branches, more then in any other parte of the plaine. And in these two maners is it commonly founde moste abundauntly. And for the better profe that golde is engendered on hyghe, and is brought downe into the lowe places, I haue one great tooken therof whiche causeth me to beleue it for certeine. And this is to consyder that coles neuer putrifie nor corrupt vnder the ground, if they be made of stronge woodde. Wherby it chaunceth that diggyng the earth by the fouldes or indented places of the mountaynes, or on the sydes, and breakynge a myne in the earthe where it had not byn broken before, and hauyng nowe dygged one or two or three poles in measure, the myners founde certeyne coles of wood vnde
                     •
                   the same leuel where they found gold. And this I saye in the earth whiche was taken for a vyrgine: that is to saye, such as had not before byn opened for any myne. The which coles coulde not naturally bee engendred there, or enter in by any meanes. But when the superficial part of the earth was equal with the leuel where the coles were founde, it is lyke that the coles were left there by sum occasion of fyre, & that they fastned there in tyme, and that afterwarde in longe continuance of tyme, they were by lyttle and lyttle couered with the earth which the often showers of rayne washed from the mountaynes, so that by the course of yeares the earth ouergrewe the coles vnto the sayde leuell and measure whiche had before tyme byn the superficiall parte of the earthe where the coles and golde were founde togyther: whereby it maye appeare

that the golde was no more engendered there then were the coles, but brought thyther from the mountaynes by the faules of waters as we haue fayde: forasmuche as the mountaynes are the matrices and bowels of all ryche metals. Further and besyde this, I say that in how much more the gold is gonne farre from the naturall place of his generation to the place where it is founde, it is so muche the more puryfied and fyned and of a better carracte. And the nearer that it is founde to his proper myne or vaine where it is engendered, it is so muche the baser, fouler, and more crude, and of a baser alay and caracte, and dothe wast so much the more in meltynge, and remayneth more brickle. Sumetyme there are founde graynes of golde of greate quantitie and of greate weyght aboue the earth and sumtymes also vnder the earth. And the greateste of all other that was founde to this daye in the Indies, was that which was loste in the sea about the Ilande Beata, whiche weyed three thousande and twoo hundreth Castellans of golde, which are in value foure thousand a hundreth, thirtie and eyght ducades of golde, which waye one Arroua and seuen pounde, or .xxxii. pounde after .xii. ounces to the pounde,A marke, is

And I sawe in the yeare .1515. in the handes of Mychel Passamonte treasurer to yowre maiestie, two graines of the which one wayde seuen poundes, which are .xiiii. markes, and are in the value aboute threescore and fyue ducades of golde euery marke. The other was of .x. markes, which are lyue poundes of lyke value, and of very good golde of .xxii. taractes and better. There are also founde many other greate graynes, although not equall vnto these in byggenes. And forasmuche as I haue spoken of golde, I haue thought good to declare sumewhat howe the Indians can very excellently gylte suche vesselles of copper and base golde as they make. For they can gyue them so fayre and f

This colour they gyue with a certeyne herbe as thoughe it were wrought by the arte of any goldesmyth of Spayne or Italie, and wold of them bee esteemed as a thynge of greate ryches, and a secreate maner of gyldynge. And for as muche as I haue spoken sufficiently of the myne of golde, I wyll nowe speake

sumwhat of copper bycause I haue made mention thereof. This metall is founde in many of the Ilandes of the Indies and also in the firme lande: And is founde dayely in greate quantitie holdynge sumwhat of golde. But for the desyre that owre men haue to golde, they nothynge esteeme the copper, although there myght great commoditie and profi

But of this it shall suffice to haue sayde thus muche, bycause I haue more particularly entreated of these thynges in my generall hystorie of India.
            
            
               ¶ Of the maner of fyshynge for perles.
               
                  THe Indians exercise this kynde of fysshynge for the moste parte in the coastes of the North in Cubagua and Cumana. And manye of theym which dwell in the houses of certeyne particular lordes in the Ilandes of San Dominico and Sancti Iohannis, resort to the Ilande of Cubagua for this purpose. Theyr custome is to go fyue, syxe, or seuen, or more in one of theyr Canoas or barkes erly in the mornynge to sume place in the sea there about where it appeareth vnto thē that there shulde bee greate plentie of those shell fyshes (which sume caule muscles and sume oysters) wherin perles are engendered. And there they plonge them selues vnder the water, euen vnto the bottome, sauynge one that remaynethe in the Canoa or boate which he keepeth styll in one place as neare as he can, lookynge for theyr returne owte of the water. And when one of them hath byn a good whyle vnder the water, he cyseth vp and commeth swymmynge to the boate, enterynge into the same, and leauynge there all the oysters whiche he hath taken and brought with hym. For in these, are the perles founde. And when he hathe there rested hym selfe a whyle, and eaten parte of the oysters, he returneth ageyne to the water, where he remaynethe as longe as he can endure, and then ryseth ageyne, and swimmeth to the boate with his pray, where he restethe hym as before, and thus continueth course by course, as doo all the other in lyke maner, being all

moste experte swymmers and dyuers. And when the nyght draweth neare, they returne to the Ilande to theyr houses, and presente all the oysters to the master or stewarde of the house of theyr lorde who hath the charge of the sayde Indians. And when he hath gyuen them sumwhat to eate, he layeth vp the oysters in safe custodie vntyll he haue a great quantitie therof. Then hee causeth the same fyssher men to open them. And they fynde in euery of theym pearles other great or smaul, two or three or foure, and sumtymes fiue and syxe, and many smaule graines accordyng to the lyberalitie of nature. They saue the pearles bothe smaule and great whiche they haue founde
                     •
                  : And eyther eate the oysters if they wyl, or caste them away, hauynge so great quantitie therof that they in maner abhorre them. These oysters are of hard fleshe, and not so plesaunt in eatyng as are owres of Spayne. This Ilande of Cubagua where this maner of fysshing is exercised, is in the Northe coaste, and is no bygger then the Iland of Zelande. Oftentymes the sea increaseth greatly, and muche more then the fyshers for pearles wold, bycause where as the place is very depe, a man can not naturally rest at the bottome by reason of the aboundaunce of aery substaunce whiche is in hym, as I haue oftentymes proued. For althoughe he may by vyolence and force descende to the bottome, yet are his feete lyfted vp ageyne so that he can continue no tyme there. And therfore where the sea is verye deepe, these Indian fysshers vse to tye two great stoones aboute them with a corde, on euery syde one, by the weyght wherof they descend to the bottome and remayne there vntyl them lysteth to ryse ageine: At which tyme they vnlose the stones, and ryse vppe at their pleasure. But this their aptenesse and agilitie in swimming, is not the thynge that causeth men moste to maruaile: But rather to consyder howe many of them can stande in the bottome of the water for the space of one hole houre, and summe more or lesse, accordynge as one is more apte hereunto then an other. An other thynge there is whiche seemeth to me very straunge. And this is, that where as I haue oftentymes demaunded of summe of these lordes of the Indians, if the place where they are accustomed to fy

me, that althoughe they bee consumed in one parte, yet if they go a fysshynge in an other parte or an other coaste of the Ilande, or at an other contrary wynd, and continue fysshing there also vntyll the oysters be lykewyse consumed, and then returne ageyne to the fyrste place, or any other place where they fysshed before and emptied the same in lyke maner, they find thē ageine as ful of oysters as though they had neuer bin fysshed.Of this reade more largely in the decades. Wherby we may iudge that these oysters eyther remoue from one place to an other as do other fysshers, or elles that they are engendered and encrease in certeyne ordinarie places. This Iland of Cumana and Cubagua where they fyshe for these perles, is in the twelfe degree of the part of the said coaste which incline

Yet not so bigge as they of the Ilande of pearles cauled de las perlas, or Margaritea, whiche the Indians caule Terarequi, lyinge in the goulfe of saincte Michael, where greatter pearles are founde and of greater price then in any other coaste of the Northe sea, in Cumana, or any other parte. I speake this as a trewe testimonie of syght, hauyng byn longe in that South sea, and makynge curious inquisition to bee certenly informed of al that perteyneth to the fysshynge of pearles.

From the saide Ilande also, came a great and verye rounde pearle, whiche I brought owte of that sea. This was as bygge as a smaule pellet of a stone bowe, and of the weight of .xxvi. cacattes. I bought it in the citie of Panama in the sea of Sur: And paide for it syxe hundreth and fyftie tymes the weyght therof of good gold, and had it thre yeares in my custodie: and after my returne into Spaine, soulde it to therle of Nansao Marquesse of Zenete, great chamberleyne to yowre maiestie, who gaue it to the Marquesse his wyfe, the ladye Mentia of Mendozza. I thyncke verely that this pearle was the greatest, fayrest, and roundest that hath byn seene in those partes. For yowre

When he coommeth to the place, he sytteth downe on a rounde seate made for hym of purpose. Where hauynge his disciples the one standynge on the one hande and the other on the other euen in the presence of the kyng and certeyne of his nobles (for the common people are not admytted to these misteries) and turnynge his face toward the deserte, he begynneth his inchauntment and cauleth the spirit with loude voyce by certeyne names which no man vnderstandeth but he and his disciples. After he hath dooen thus a while, if the spirite yet deferre his coommyng, he drynketh of the sayde water, and therwith waxeth hotte and furious, and inuerteth and turneth his inchauntement, and letteth hym selfe bludde with a thorne, marueilously turmoylyng hym selfe as wee reade of the furious Sybilles not ceasynge vntyl the spirite bee coome: who at his coommyng entereth into hym and ouerthroweth hym as it weare a grehounde shulde ouerturne a squerell.

               Furthermore; in many places of the firme lande, when any of the kynges dye, all his housholde seruauntes, aswell women as men which haue continually serued hym, kyl them selues, beleauynge as they are taught by the deuyl Tuyra, that they which kyll them selues when the kynge dyeth, go with hym to heauen and seene hym in the same place and office as they dyd before on the earth whyle he lyued. And that all that refuse so to doo, when after they dye by theyr naturall death or otherwyse, theyr soules to dye with theyr bodyes and to bee dissolued into ayer and become nothynge us do the soules of hogges, byrdes, or fysshes or other brute beastes. And that only the other may enioy the priuileage of immortalitie for euer to serue the kynge in heauen. And of this false opinion commeth it that they which sowe corne or set rootes for the kynges breade, and gather the same, are accustomed to kyll them selues that they may enioy this priuileage in heauen. And for the same purpose, cause a portion of the graine of Maizium and a bundle of Iucca (wherof theyr breade is made) to bee buryed with them in theyr graues that the same maye serue them in heauen if perhappes there shuld lacke seedes to sowe. And therfore they take this with them to begyn with all, vntyl Tuyra (who maketh them all these fayre promisses) prouyde them of greater quantitie.

they are oftentymes accustomed to burye greate quantities of wrought golde with them, I caused twoo graues to bee opened, wherein was nothynge founde but a vessell full of the grayne of Maizium, and a bundell of Iucca as I haue sayde. And demaundyng the cause hereof of the kinge and the other Indians, they aunswered that they that were buryed there, were the labourers of the grounde, and men skylful in sowynge of seedes and makynge of breade, and seruauntes to the kynges father. And to thende that theyr soules shoulde not dye with theyr bodyes, they slewe them selues at the deathe of the kynge theyr master to lyue with hym in heauen. And to thintent that they myght seene him there in the same office they reserued that Maizium and Iucca to sowe it in heauen.
               Wherunto I aunswered them in this maner. Beholde howe your Tuyra deceaueth yowe? And howe all that he teacheth yow is false? Yowe see how in so long a tyme sence they are deade, they haue not yet taken awaye this Maizium and Iucca which is nowe putrified and woorth nothynge, and not lyke to bee sowen in heauen. To this the kynge replyed, sayinge. In that they haue not taken it away nor sowen it in heauen, the cause is that they chaunced to fynde enowgh there, by reason wherof they had no neade of this. To this errour manye thynges were sayde which seemed of lyttle force to remoue hym from his false opinion, and especially any such as at that age are occupyed of the deuyll, whom they paynt of the selfe same forme and coloure as he appereth vnto theym in dyuers shapes and formes.

               ¶ Of the temperature of the regions vnder or neare to the burnt lyue cauled Torrida zona or the Equinoctiall: and of the dyuers seasons of the yeare.
               
                  THe landes and regions that are neare about the clymes of the Equinoctiall lyne, are naturally hotte, althowghe they bee otherwise temperate by the diuine prouidence. And therfore suche flesshe or fyshe as is taken and kylled in these regions, can not bee preserued from putrefaction except it be tosted, sodden, or perboylde, the same daye that it is kylde. And wheras I haue sayde that such regions are naturally hot, and yet temperate by the prouidence of god, it is so in deede. And therfore not without cause the auncient autours were of opinion that the burnte lyne or Torrida zona where passeth the lyne of the Equinoctiall, shulde be vnhabitable by reason the soonne hath greater dominion in that place then in any other of the sphere, remaynynge continually betwene the two tropykes of Cancer and Capricorne. For when in these regions the earth is opened or dygged frō the superficial parte therof to the depth of a mans heyght, it is founde temperate. And within this space, the trees and plantes fasten and spreade their rootes, and no dieper. Extendynge the same as farre in breadth in the ground as do the

               There are also many roughe and hyghe mountaynes with temperate ayer and pleasaunt, cleare, and moderate nightes. Of the whiche particularitie the auncient writers hauyng no certeyne knowleage, affyrmed the said burnte lyne or Torrida zona, or Equinoctial to be naturally vnhabitable. As touching which thing I am able to witnesse the contrary by testimonie of syght and feelyng as by most certeine senses, hauyng liued many yeares in this regions, by reason wherof better credit ought to be giuen to me then to suche as haue grounded their opinion onely vpon coniectures. And to speake further of the sytuation of these regyons, yowe shall vnderstande that the coaste of the Northe sea, beynge in the goulfe of Vraba and in the porte of Dariena, where the shyppes arryue whiche coome owte of Spayne, is in the syxte degree and a halfe, and in the seuenth, and from syxe and a halfe vnto eyght, excepte a smaule pointe which entereth into the sea toward the North That pointe which of this land and new parte of the worlde lieth moste towarde the East, is the cape of saincte Augustine which is in the eight degree. So that the said goulfe of Vraba is distant from the Equinoctiall lyne, from a hundreth and twentie to a hundreth and thirtie leaques and three quarters of a leaque after thaccompte of .xvii. leaques and a h

                  lfe for euerye degree from pole to pole. And thus for a lyttle more or lesse, goeth all the coaste. By reason wherof, in the citie of Sancta Maria Antiqua in Dariena, and in all that course of the forsayde goulfe of Vraba, at all tymes of the yea
                     •
                  e the dayes and nyghtes are in maner of equall length. And if there bee any

dyfference betwene theym by reason of this smaule distance from the Equinoctial, it is so lyttle, that in .xxiiii. houres makynge a naturall daye, it canne not bee perceaued but by the iudgement of speculatiue men and suche as vnderstande the sphere. From hense the North starre is seene very lowe And when the starres which are cauled the wardens of the north starre, are vnder the chariotte, it can not bee seene, bycause it is vnder the horisontal. And whereas I haue sayde beefore that it rayneth in these regions at certeyne ordinarie tymes, it is so in deede. For it is wynter and summer there at contrary tymes to that whiche is in Spayne, where the greateste coulde of froste and rayne is in December and Ianuary: And the greatest heate of sommer aboute saynt Iohannes daye at mydsommer or in the moneth of Iuly. But in golden Castile or Beragua, it is contrary. For the sommer and tyme of greatest drowght and withowt rayne, is at Chrystmas and a moneth before and a moneth after. And the tyme when it rayneth most, is about midsommer and a moneth before and a moneth after. And this season whiche they caule wynter, is not for that it is any coulder then, then at any other tyme of the yeare, or hotter at Christmas then at other seasons, the tyme in these regions being euer after one maner, but for that that in this tyme which they caule wynter, the soonne is hyd from theyr syghtes by reason of cloudes and rayne more then at other tymes. Yet forasmuch as for the moste parte of the yeare they lyue in a cleare, open, and temperate ayer, they sumwhat shrynke and feele a lyttle coulde durynge the tyme of the said moist and cloudy ayer, althowgh it bee not coulde in deede, or at the least suche coulde as hath any sensible sharpenes.

                  MAny other thynges myght be sayde, & much differyng from these wherof I haue spoken. But to lette passe the multitude of thynges whiche are as variable as the power of nature is infinite, and to speake of suche thynges as coome chiefely to my rememberaunce as mooste woorthy to be noted, I wyll fyrste

And although the thynges whereof wee entende nowe to speake may seeme vyle and lyttle to bee esteemed, yet are they woorthy to bee noted and consydered to vnderstand the difference and variable woorkes of nature. So it is therfore, that whereas in many partes of the firme lande by the which aswell the Christians as Indians doo trauel, there are such marysshes and waters in the way that they are fayne to go withowt breeches amonge the herbes and weedes, by reason wherof, certeyne smaule beastes or woormes (which they caule Garapates) much lyke vnto tykes, cleaue fast to theyr legges. These wormes are as little as the pouder of beaten salt: And cleaue so fast that they can by no meanes be taken away except the place bee noynted with oyle. And after that the legges bee noynted awhyle with oyle, or the other partes where these lyttle tykes are fastened, they scrape the place with a knyfe and so take them away. But the Indi

These are so redde that in the nyght they appeare lyke burnynge cooles, and in the day seeme as redde as bludde. These are also venemous, but not so much as the vypers. There are other much lesse and shorter and blacker. These coome owt of the ryuers and wander sumtymes farre on the lande, and are lykewyse venemous. There are also other adders of a russet coloure. These are sumwhat bygger then the vypers, and are hurtful and venemous. There are lykewyse an other sorte of manye coloures and very longe. Of these I sawe one in the yeare of Christ 1515. in the Iland of Hispaniola nere vnto the sea costes at the foote of the mountaynes cauled Pedernales. When this adder was slayne, I measured her and founde her to be more then .xx. foote longe, and sumwhat more then a mans fyst in byggenes. And althoughe she hadde three or foure deadely woundes with a swoorde, yet dyed shee not nor stoonke the same daye, in so much that her bludde continued warme all that tyme. There are also in the marysshes and desertes of the firme lande many other kyndes of lysertes, dragons,Dragons, and other dyuers kyndes of serpentes wherof I entende not here to speake much, bycause I haue more particulerly entreated of these thynges in my generall historie of the Weste Indyes.
               There are also spiders of marueylous bygnessse.Spyders, And I haue seene summe with the body and legges, bygger then a mannes hande extended euery waye, And I ones sawe one of suche bygnesse, that onely her bodye was as bygge as a

sparowe, and full of that laune wherof they make their webbes. This was of a darke russette coloure, with eyes greates then the eies of a sparow. They are venemous and of terrible shape to beholde. There are also scorpions and dyuers other suche venemous wormes. Wherby we maye see, that where as natural causes and influence of the planettes are of strongest actiuitie, they cease not to engender and brynge foorthe bothe good and badde accordynge to the disposytion of the matter, whiche they also doo partely dispose as the phylosophers affyrme.
               Furthermore in the fyrme lande, there are manye toades beyng very noyous and hurteful by reason of their great multitude. They are not venemous. They are seene in greate aboundance in Dariena where they are so bygge that when they dye in the time of drouth, the bones of sum of them (and especially the rybbes) are of suche greatnesse that they appere too bee the bones of cattes or of summe other beastes of the same byggenesse. But as the waters dyminishe and the moysture

Neuerthelesse, at this present, there is no such quantitie of them as was wonte to bee, by reason that as the land is better cultured by the Christians, as well by the fellynge of wooddes and shrubb

In shape and forme, they are muche lyke vnto the crabbe which we paynte for the sygne Cancer, and like vnto those which are found in Spaine in Andalusia in the ryuer Guadalchiber where it entereth into the sea, and in the sea coastes therabout, sauynge that these are of the water and the other of the lande. They are sumtymes hurtefull, so that they that eate of them dye. But this chaunceth onely when they haue eaten any venemous thyng, or of the venemous apples wherwith the Canibale archers poyson their arrowes wherof I wyll speake hereafter. And for this cause the Christians take hede howe they eate of these crabbes if they fynde them neare vnto the sayd apple trees.
               Furthermore in these Indies, aswell in the fyrme lande as in the Ilandes, there is founde a kynde of serpentes, which they caule Y. V. anas, which summe caule Iuannas.

They are very delicate to bee eaten, and it is not yet knowen whether they be beastes of the lande or fyshes, bycause they lyue in the water, and wander in the woddes and on the lande. They haue foure feete, and are commonly bigger then connies and in summe places bygger then otters, with tayles lyke lisartes or eutes. Their skynne is spotted, and of the same kynd of smothnesse or barenesse, although of dyuers colours. Upon the ridge of their backes, they haue many long prickes. Theyr teeth
                     •
                   are very sharpe, and especially theyr fanges or dogge teeth. Their throtes are longe and large, reachynge from their bea

                  des to their breastes, of the lyke skynne to the resydewe of their bodyes. They are dumme, and haue no voyce or make any noyse or crye although they bee kepte tyde to the foote of a cheste or any other thynge for the space of .xx. or .xxv. dayes withowt any thyng to eate or drynke, excepte they gyue them nowe and then a lyttle of the breade

of Cazabbi, or summe such other thyng. They haue foure feete, and their fore feete as longe as a mans fynger with clawes lyke the clawes of a byrde, but weaker, and suche as can not grasple or take holde of any thynge. They are muche better to bee eaten then to beholde. For fewe that see them, wyll haue desyre to eate of them, by reason of their horrible shape excepte suche as haue byn accustomed to the beastes of these regyons, whiche are more horrible and fearefull, as this is not but onely in apparence. Their fleshe is of much better tast then the fleshe of connyes and more holsome. For it hurteth none but onely such as haue had the frenshe poxe. In so much that if they haue onely byn touched of that infyrmitie, although they haue byn hole of longe tyme, neuerthelesse they feele hurte and complayne of the eatynge of these Iuannas, as hath byn often tymes proued by experience.
               There are founde in the fyrme lande certeyne byrdes so lyttle that the hole body of one of theym is no bygger then the toppe of the byggest fynger of a mans hande:Byrdes. and yet is the hare body withowt the fethers not paste halfe so bygge. This byrde, besyde her lyttlenes,A very lyttle byrde. is of such velocitie and swyftnes in flying that who so seeth her sleing in the ayer, cā not se her flap or beate her winges after any other sort then do the dorres or hūble bees or betels: so that there is no man that see

with such swyftnes, that no man wolde lightly beleue it that hath not seene it. And certenly these byrdes are so lyttle, that I durst not haue made mention hereof if it were not that diuers other which haue seene them as wel as I, can beare witnes of my saying. They make their nestes of flockes and heare of cotten wherof there is great plentie in these regions, and serueth wel for theyr purpose. But as touchyng the byrdes, foules, and beastes of these Indies, bycause they are innumerable bothe lyttle and greate, I intende not to speake muche heare, bycause I haue spoken more largely hereof in my generall hystorye of the Indyes.
               There is an other kynde of beastes seene in the firme land which seemed very straunge and marueilous to the Chrystian men to beholde,Beastes. and muche differynge from all other beastes which haue byn seene in other partes of the worlde. These beastes are cauled Bardati:Bardati. And are foure footed, hauing their raile and al the rest of theyr bodies couered onely with a skyn lyke the coperture of a barbed horse or the chekered skynne of a lysarte or Crocodyle, of coloure betwene whyte and russet, inclynynge sumwhat more to whyte. This beast, is of forme and shape much lyke to a barbed horse with his barbes and flankettes in all poyntes. And from vnder that which is the barbe and coperture, the tayle commeth foorth, and the feete in theyr place, the necke also and the eares in theyr partes, and in fyne all thynges in lyke sorte as in a barbed courser. They are of the bygnes of one of these common dogges. They are not hurtfull. They are fylthy, and haue theyr habitation in certen hillockes of earthe where digginge with there feete they make their dens very deepe & the holes therof in like maner as do connyes. They are verye excellent to be eaten, and are taken with nettes and sum also killed with crosbowes. They are lykewise taken often tymes when the husband men burie the stubble in sowyng time, or to renewe the herbage for kyne and other beastes. I haue often times eaten of their fleshe which semeth to me of better tast then kyddes fleshe, and holsome to be eaten. And if these beastes had euer byn seene in these partes of the woorlde where the first barbed horses had their original, no man wold iudge but that the forme and fasshion of the coperture of horses furnished for the warres was fyrste deuysed by the syght of these beastes.
               
                  There is also in the firme lande an other beaste cauled Orso Formigaro that is, the Ante beare.Beares. This beaste in heare and coloure, is much lyke to the beare of Spayne, and in maner of the same makynge saue that he hath a much longer snowt and is of euyll syght. They are often tymes taken only with slaues without any other weapon, and are not hurtful. They are also taken with dogges bycause they are not naturally armed althowgh they byte sumwhat. They are founde for the moste parte about and neare to the hyllockes where are great abundaunce of antes.Antes. For in these regions is engendered a certeyne kynde of antes very lyttle and blacke, in the fyeldes and playnes where as growe no trees, where by thinstinct of nature these antes separate them selues to engender far from the wooddes for feare of these beares: The whiche bycause they are fearefull, vyle, and vnarmed (as I haue sayde) they keepe euer in places full of trees vntyll very famen and necessitie, or the great desire that they haue to fiede of these antes, cause them to coomme owt of the wooddes to hunte for them. These antes make a hyllocke of earth to the heyght of a man, or sumwhat more or lesse, and as bygge as a great chest, and sumtymes as bygge as a butte or a hogges head, and as hard as a stone: So that they seeme as thoughe they were stones set vp to lymytte thendes and confines of certeyne landes.
               Within these hyllockes made of most harde earth, are innumerable and infinite lyttle antes, the which may bee gathered by busshelles when the hyllocke is broken. The which when it is sumtymes moysted by rayne and then dryed ageyne by the heate of the soone, it breaketh and hath certeyne smaul ryftes as lyttle and subtyle as the edge of a knyfe. And it semeth that nature hath gyuen sense to these Antes to fynde such a matter of earth wherwith they may make the sayde hillocke of suche hardenes that it may seeme a stronge pauement made of lyme and stone. And wheras I haue proued and caused sum of them to bee broken, I haue founde theim of suche hardenes as if I had not seene I coulde not haue beleaued: In so muche that they coulde scarsely bee broken with pykes of Iren: So stronge fortresses doo these lyttle beastes make for theyr sauegarde ageynst theyr aduersarie the beare, who is chiefely nurysshed by them, and gyuen them as an enemie, accordynge to the common prouerbe which sayth, Non

                     nchi il suo Bargello: That is, there is no mā so fre that hath not his persecutour or pryuie enemie. And here whē I consyder the maruelous prouidence which nature hath gyuen to these lyttle boddies, I caule to remembraunce the wittie sentence of Plinie, where speakyng of such lyttle beastes, he sayth thus. Why doo we maruayle at the towrebearynge shoulders of Elephantes, and not rather where nature hathe placed so many sences and suche industry in suche lyttle boddies? where is hearynge, smellynge, seeinge, and feelynge, ye, where are the vaynes & arteries (without which no beaste can lyue or moue) in these so lyttle boddies whereof sume are so smaule that theyr hole boddies can scarsely be sene of owr eyes, what shall we then saye of the partes of the same? Yet euen amonge these are there many of such sagacitie and industrye as the lyke is not seene in beastes of greater quantitie, no nor yet in man. &c. But to returne to the hystorie. This enemie which nature hath gyuen to these lyttle beastes, vseth this maner to assayle them. When he resortethe to the hyllocke where the antes lye hid as in theyr fortresse, he putteth his toonge to one of the ryftes wherof we haue spoken being as subtyle as the edge of a swoorde, and there with continuall lyckynge, maketh the place moyst, the fome and froth of his mouth beinge of such propertie that by continual lycking the place, it enlargeth the ryfte in such sort by lyttle and lyttle, that at the length he easely putteth in his toonge whiche he hath very longe and thynne, and much disproportionate to his bodye. And when he hath thus made free passage for his toonge into the hyllocke to put it easely in and owt at his pleasure, then he thrusteth it into the hole as farre as he can reache, and so letteth it reste a good space vntyl a great quantitie of the antes (whose nature reioyseth in heate and moyster) haue laden his tonge and as many as he can conteyne in the holownesse therof: at which tyme he suddeynly draweth it into his mouth and eateth them, and returneth ageyne to the same practise immediatly vntyl he haue eaten as manye as hym lysteth, or as longe as he can reache any with his tonge. The flesshe of this beaste, is fylthy and vnsauery. But by reason of thextreme shyftes and necessitie that the Christian men were put to at theyr fyrst commynge into these partes, they were inforced to proue al thynges and so fel to theatyng of

these beastes. But when they had founde more delycate meates, they fell into hatred with this. These antes haue thapperaunce of the place of theyr enteraunce into the hyllocke, vnder the grounde. And this at so lyttle a hole that it could hardely be founde yf certeyne of them were not seene to passe in and owt. But by this way the beares coulde haue no such poure to hurte them as aboue at the sayde ryftes as I haue sayde. There is an other strange beaste whiche by a name of contrary effecte,A straunge beast whiche seemeth a kynd of Chameleon. the Spanyardes caule Cagnuolo leggiero, that is the lyght dogge, wheras it is one of the sloweste beastes in the worlde, and so heauy and dull in mouynge that it canne scarsely go fyftie pases in a hole day. These beastes are in the firme lande, and are very straunge to beholde for the disproportion that they haue to all other beastes. They are abowte two spannes in length when they are growne to theyr full byggenesse. But when they are very younge, they are sumewhat more grosse then longe. They haue foure subtyle fiete, and in euery of them foure clawes lyke vnto byrdes, and ioyned togyther. Yet are nother theyr clawes or theyr fiete able to susteyne theyr bodyes from the grounde. By reason wherof and by the heauynesse of theyr boddies, they drawe theyr bellyes on the grounde. Theyr neckes are hygh and streyght and all equall lyke the pestle of a morter, which is altogyther equall euen vnto the toppe withowt makynge any proportion or similitude of a headde, or any dyfference excepte in the noddle. And in the toppes of theyr neckes, they haue verye rounde faces much lyke vnto owles: And haue a marke of theyr owne heare after the maner of a cyrcle whiche makethe theyr faces seeme sumwhat more longe then large. They haue smaule eyes and rounde: And nostrylles lyke vnto munkeys. They haue lyttle mouthes, and moue theyr neckes frome one syde to an other as thoughe they were astonysshed. Theyr chiefe desyre and delyte is to cleaue and stycke faste vnto trees or sume other thynge whereby they may clyme alofte. And therfore for the moste parte, these beastes are founde vppon trees whervnto cleauynge fast, they mounte vp by lyttle and lyttle, steyinge them selues by theyr longe clawes. The coloure of theyr heare, is betwene russet and whyte, and of the proper coloure of the heare of a wesell. They haue no tayles, and theyr voyce is much dyfferynge frome other beastes: for

they synge onely in the nyght: And that continually frome tyme to tyme syngynge euer syxe notes one hygher then an other, so faulynge with the same that the fyrste note is the hyghest and the other in a baser tewne as yf a man shuld say La, sol, fa, mi, re, vt. So this beast sayth, Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ha. And doubtelesse, it seemeth vnto me, that as I haue sayde in the chapiter of the beaste cauled Bardari, that those beastes might bee thoriginall and document to imbarbe horses, euen so the fyrste inuenture of musycke myght seeme by the hearynge of this beast to haue the fyrst principles of that scyence rather then by any other thynge in the worlde. But nowe to returne to the hystorie: I say that in a shorte space after this beaste hath soonge and hath paused a whyle, she returneth ageyne to the selfe same songe, and doth this only in the nyght and not in the day. By reason wherof and also bycause of her euyll syght, I thynke her to bee a nyght beaste and the frende of darkenesse. Sumtymes the Christian menne fynde these beastes and brynge theym home to theyr howses, where also they creepe all abowte with theyr naturall slowenesse, in so much that nother for threatenynge or pryckynge they wyll moue any faster then theyr natural and accustomed pase. And yf they fynde any trees, they creepe thyther immediatly, and mounte to the toppe of the hyghest braunche thereof, where they remayne continually for the space of eyght, or tenne, or twentie dayes without eatynge of any thinge as farre as any man can iudge. And wheras I my selfe haue kepte theym in my house, I coulde neuer perceaue other but that they lyue onely of ayer. And of the same opinion are in maner all men of those regions, bycause they haue neuer scene them eate any thynge, but euer turne theyr heades and mouthes towarde that parte where the wynde b
                     •
                  oweth most: whereby may bee consydered that they take moste pleasure in the ayer. They byte not, nor yet can byte, hauyng very lyttle mouthes. They are not venemous or noyous any way: but altogyther brutishe and vtterly vnprofytable and without commoditie yet knowen to men, sauynge onely to moue theyr myndes to contemplate thinfinite poure of god, who delyteth in the varietie of creatures, wherby appeareth the poure of his incomprehensible wisedome and maiestie so farre to excede the capacitie of mans vnderstandynge.
               
                  In these regions there are likewise found certeyne foules or byrdes which the Indians caule Alcatraz.
                  Foules, and byrdes,
                  
                     Alcatraz,
                   These are much bygger then geese. The greatest parte of theyr fethers are of russet coloure, and in sume partes yelowe. Theyr bylles or beakes are of two spannes in length and verye large neare to the heade, and growynge smaule towarde the poynte. They haue greate and large throtes: And are much lyke to a foule which I sawe in Flaunders in Brusselles in yowre maiesties pallaice which the Flemynges caule Haina. And I remember that when yowr maiestie dyned one day in yowre great haule there was brought to yowre maiesties presence a chauderne of water with certeyne fysshes alyue, which the sayde foule did eate vp hole. And I thynke verely that that foule was a foule of the sea bycause shee had fiete lyke foules of the water as haue also these Alcatrazi, which are likewyse foules of the sea: and of such greatnesse that I haue seene a hole cote of a man put into the throates of one of theym in Panama in the yeare 1521. And forasmuch as in that coaste of Panama,
                  
                     Panama
                     ▪
                   there passeth and flyeth a greate multitude of these Alcatrazi beinge a thynge very notable, I wyll declare the maner hereof as not onely I, but also dyuers other nowe presente in yowre maiesties courte haue often tymes seene. Yowre maiestie shall therfore vnderstande that in this place (as I haue sayde before) the sea or Sur ryseth and fauleth two leagues and more from syxe houres to syxe houres: so that when it increaseth, the water of the sea arryueth so neare to the houses of Panama as doth owre sea (cauled Mare Mediteraneum) in Barzalona or in Naples. And when the sayd increasyng of the sea commeth, there commeth also therwith such a multitude of the smaule fysshes cauled sardynes, that it is so marueylous a thynge to beholde, that no man wolde beleue it that hath not seene it. In so much that the Cacique, (that is) the kynge of that land at such tyme as I dwelt there, was bounde dayly as he was commaunded by yowre maiesties gouernour, to brynge ordynaryly three canoas or barkes full of the sayde sardynes and to vnlade the same in the markette place, whiche were afterwarde by the ruler of the citie diuyded amonge the Christian men without any coste or charge to any of them. In so much that yf the people had bin a much greater multitude then they were, and as many as are at this presente in Toledo or more,

and had none other thynge to lyue by, they myght haue byn sufficiently susteyned by these sardynes, bysyde thouerplus which shulde haue remayned. But to returne to the foules wherof we haue spoken. As the sea commeth, and the sardynes with the same, euen so lykewyse coome the sayde Alcatrazzi therwith: and flye continually ouer it in suche a multytude, that they appeare to couer thupper parte or floure of the water. And thus continue in mountynge and faulynge from the ayer to the water, and from the water to the ayer durynge all the tyme of theyr fysshynge. And as soone as they haue taken any of these sardynes, they flye aboue the water and eate them incontinently, and suddeynly returne ageyne to the water for more, continuing thus course by course with owt ceasynge. In lyke maner when the sea fauleth, they folowe there fysshynge as I haue sayde. There goethe also in the company of these foules, an other kynde of foules cauled Coda inforcata, (that is) the forked tayle, whereof I haue made mention before. And as soone as the Alcatraz mounteth from the water with her pray of the sardynes, suddeynly this Coda inforcata gyueth her so many strokes, and so persecuteth her, that shee causeth her to let faule the sardynes which shee hath in her mouth. The which as soone as they are faulne, and before they yet touch the water, the Coda inforcata catcheth them euen in the faule, in suche sorte that it is a great pleasure to beholde the combatte betwene them all the daye longe. The number of these Alcatrazzi is such, that the Chrystian menn
                     •
                   are accustomed to send to certeyne Ilandes and rockes which are neare abowte Panama, with theyr boates or barkes to tak
                     •
                   these Alcatrazzi whyle they are yet younge and can not flye: and kyll as many of them with staues as they wyll, vntyll they haue therwith laden theyr barkes or canoas. These younge ones are so fatte and wel fedde that they can not bee eaten. And are taken for none other intent but only to make grease for candels to burne in the nyght, for the whiche purpose it serueth very well: and gyueth a cleare lyght, and burneth easely. After this maner and for this purpose, innumerable of them are kylde. And yet it seemeth that the number of them that fysshe for sardynes doo dayly increase
               There are other foules cauled Passere sempie:
                     P

                        ssere sempie.
                   that is, simple sparowes. These are sumwhat lesse then semewes: and haue

theyr fiete lyke vnto great malardes: And stande in the water sumtymes. And when the shyppes sayle fyftie or a hundreth leaques abowte the Ilandes, these foules beholdynge the shyppes commyng towarde them, breake theyr flyght and faule downe vpon the sayle yardes, mastes, and cables therof. And are so simple and folyshe that they tary vntyll they maye easely be taken with mens handes, and were therefore cauled of the maryners simple sparowes. They are blacke, and vppon their blacke, haue theyr headde and shoulders of fethers of a darke russet coloure. They are not good to bee eaten, althowgh the mariners haue sumtimes bin inforced to eate thē.
               There is an other kynde of byrdes in the fyrme lande, which the Christians caule Picuti,
                  
                     Picuti.
                   bycause they haue very great beakes in respecte of the lyttlenesse of theyr boddies: For theyr beakes are very heauy and waye more then theyr hole boddyes bysyde. These byrdes are no bygger then quayles, but haue a much greater bushement of fethers, in so much that theyr fethers are more then theyr boddies. Theyr fethers are very fayre and of many variable coloures. Theyr beakes are a quarter of a yarde in length or more, and bendynge downe towarde the earthe, and three fyngers brode neare vnto the heade. Theyr tonges are very quilles, wherwith they make a greate hyssynge. They make holes in trees with theyr beakes, in the which they make theyr nestes. And surely these byrdes are maruelous to beholde for the great difference whiche they haue from all other byrdes that I haue seene, aswel for theyr toonges (which are quylles as I haue sayde) as also for the strangenesse of theyr syght and disproportion of their greate beakes in respect of the rest of theyr boddies. There are no byrdes founde that prouyde better for the safegarde of theyr younge in the tyme of theyr breedynge to bee withowte daunger of wylde cattes that they enter not into theyr nestes to destroye theyr egges or younge. And this aswell by the straunge maner of buyldyng theyr nestes, as also by theyr owne defence. And therfore when they perceaue that the cattes approche towarde them, they ente
                     •
                   into theyr nestes: and holdynge theyr beakes towarde thenteraunce of the same, stande at theyr defence, and so vexe the cattes that they cause them to leaue theyr enterpryse.
               There are also other byrdes of sparowes, whiche the

Christians by contrary effect caule Matti, that is fooles. Wheras neuerthelesse there is no byrde that sheweth more wyt and crafte in defendynge her younge from perell.Folysshe sparowes. These byrdes are lyttle and in maner blacke, and sumewhat bygger then owre thrusshes. They haue certeyne whyte fethers in theyr neckes, and the lyke sagacitie or sharpenes of sense as haue the byrdes or pyes cauled Gazzuole. They seldome tymes light vppon the earth. They make theyr nestes in trees separated from other, bycause the wylde cattes (cauled Mammoni) are accustomed to leape frome tree to tree, not descendynge to the grounde for feare of other beastes, excepte when they are enforced by thyrste to coomme downe to drynke at suche tymes as they are sure not to bee molested. And for this cause doo not these byrdes make theyr nestes but in trees farre diuyded from other. They make them of a cubette in length or more, after the maner of bagges or lyttle sackes, large at the bottome, and growynge narower and narower towarde the mouth whereby they are fastened: hauynge the hole whereat they enter into the sacke, of such byggenes as may onely suffice to re
                     •
                  eaue them. And to thende that the cattes maye not deuoure theyr younge yf they chaunce to mounte vppon the trees where they haue theyr nestes, they vse an other crafte, which is, to make theyr nestes in thycke braunches of trees, and to defende the same with sharpe and stronge thornes implycate and set in such order that no man is able to make the lyke. So that the cattes can by no meanes put theyr legges into the hole of the neste to take owte the younge byrdes, aswell for the sharpenes of the thornes as also for the depth of the nestes, in the bottome wherof, the younge birdes rest with owt daunger of theyr enemie. For sum of theyr nestes beynge three or foure spannes in lengthe, the legge of the catte can not reache to the bottome therof. They vse also an other pollicie: which is, to make many of theyr nestes in one tree. The which they doo for one of these two causes: that is, that eyther of theyr owne naturall disposition they are accustomed to go in great multitudes, & reioyse in the company of theyr owne generation as do the byrdes which we caule stares, or elles to thintent that yf it shoulde so chaunce that the cattes shulde clyme the trees where they make theyr nestes, they might bee a greater company to resyste and molest the cattes,

at whose approch they make a feareful and terrible cry, wherby the cattes are put to flyght.
               Furthermore, in the firme land, and in the Ilandes, there are certeyne byrdes cauled Piche or Gazzuole,

Theyr beakes are also blacke and of the same fasshyon as are the popingiays beakes. They haue longe tayles, and are sumwhat bygger then s

               There are other byrdes cauled Pintadelli,
                  
                     Pintadelli.
                   whiche are lyke vnto certeyne greene byrdes whiche the Italyans caule Fringuelli: and are of seuen coloures. These byrdes for feare of the cattes, are euer woonte to make theyr nestes ouer the bankes of ryuers or the sea, where the braunches of trees so reache ouer the water that with a lyttle weyght they maye bowe downe to the water. Theyr nestes are made so neare the toppes of the braunches that when the cattes coome theron, the braunches bende towarde the water, and the cattes turne backe ageyne for feare of faulynge. For althoughe no beaste in the worlde bee more malicious then this, yet whereas the moste parte of beastes are naturally inclyned to swymme, this catte hath no maner of aptenesse thereunto, and is therefore soone drowned or strangeled in the water, and by a pryuie sense of nature feareth the daunger which he can not escape. These byrdes make theyr nestes in suche sorte, that althowgh they bee weete and fylled with water, yet doo they so suddenly ryse vp ageyne, that the younge byrdes are not thereby hurte or drowned.
               There are also many nyghtyngales and other byrdes whiche synge maruelously with great melodie and dyfference in syngynge. These byrdes are of maruelous dyuers coloures the one from the other. Sum are altogither yelowe, and sum other of so excellente, delectable, and hyghe a coloure as it weare a rubye. Other are also of dyuers and variable coloures: sum of fewe coloures, and other sume all of one coloure: beinge all so fayre and bewtifull, that in bryghtnesse and shynynge they excell all that are seene in Spayne, or Italy or other prouinces of Europe. Many of these are taken with nettes, lyme twygges, and sprynges of dyuers sortes.

               ¶ Of trees, fruites, and plantes.
               
                  THere is bothe in the firme lande and the Ilandes a certeyne tree cauled Cocus,
                  
                     Cocus.
                   beinge a kynd of date trees and hauynge theyr leaues of the selfe same greatenesse as haue the date trees which beare dates, but dyffer much in their growynge. For the leanes of this Cocus grow owte of the trunkes of the tree as doo the fyngers owt of the hande, wreathynge them selues one within an other and so spreadynge abrode. These trees are hygh: and are founde in great plentie in the coaste of the sea of Sur, in the prouince of Cacique Chiman. These date trees brynge furth a frute after this sorte. Beinge altogyther vnite as it groweth on the tree, it is of greater circumference then the heade of a man. And frō the superficiall parte to the myddest which is the frute, it is inuolued and couered with many webs much lyke vnto those hyrdes of towe whiche they vse in Andalusia. Of this towe or webbe, the East Indians make a certeyne kynde of clothe of three or foure sortes, and cordes for the sayles of shyppes.
               But in these Indies of yowr maiestie, they passe not for these cordes or this clothe that maye be made of the frute of Cocus, by reason of the great plentie that they haue of the bombage or cotton of the gossampine trees. The frute which is in the myddest of the sayde towe, is (as I haue sayde) as bygge as a mans fyfte, and sumtymes twyse as bygge and more. It is in forme, lyke vnto a walnutte, or sum other rounde thynge sumwhat more longe then large, and very harde. The rynde or barke herof, is as thycke as the cyrcle of letters of a riale of plate. And within, there cleaueth faste to the rynde of the nutte a carnositie or substaunce of coornel, of the thyckenesse of halfe a fynger or of the least fynger of the hande: And is verye whyte, lyke vnto a fayre Almonde, and of better taste

and more pleasaunt. When this fruite is ch
                     •
                  wed, there remayne certeyne crummes as do the lyke of almondes. Yet if it bee swalowed downe, it is not vnpleasaunt. For al
                     •
                  howgh that after the iewse or moysture bee gonne downe the throte before the sayde crummes bee swalowed, the reste whiche is eaten seeme sumwhat sharpe or sower, yet 
                     •
                  oth it not so greatly offende the taste as to bee caste away. Whyle this Cocus is yet freshe and newly taken from the tree, they vse not to eate of the sayde carnositie and frute: But fyrste beatynge it very much, and then straynynge it, they drawe a mylke thereof, much better and sweeter then is the mylke of beastes, and of much substaunce: The which the Christian men of those regions put in the 
                     •
                  ortes or cakes which they make of the grayne of Maizium wherof they make theyr breade, or in other breade as we put breade in porrage: So that by reason of the sayde mylke of Cocus, the cortes are more excellent to be eaten w
                     •
                  th owt offence to the stomake. They are so pleasaunte to the taste, and leaue it aswell satisfyed as thowghe it had byn delyted with many delycate dysshes. But to proceade further, yowre maiestie shall vnderstand, that in the place of the stone or coornell, there is in the myddest of the sayde carnositie, a voyde place, which neuerthelesse is full of a moste cleare and excellent water, in such quantitie as maye fyll a greate egge shell,I haue seene one of these fruites opened the whiche wh

The which water suerly, is the moste substantial, excellent and precious to be droonke, that maye bee founde in the worlde. In so much that in the momente when it passeth the palate of the mouth and begynneth to goo downe the throte it seemethe that frome the sole of the foote to the crowne of the headde, there is no parte of the boddye but that feelethe great cōfort therby: as it is doutlesse one of the most excellent thynges that may be tast
                     •
                  d vppon the earth, and suche as I am not able by wrytynge or toonge to expresse. And to proceade yet further, I say that when the meate of this frute is taken from the vessell therof, the vessell remayneth as fayre and nette as though is were pullyshed: and is without, of colour inclynynge towarde blacke, and shyneth or glystereth very fayre. And is within of no lesse dilicatenesse. Suche as haue accustomed to drynke in these vesselles, and haue bynne trowbeled with the disease cauled the fretinge of the guttes,

say that they haue by experience founde it a maruelous remedie ageynst that disease: And that it breakethe the stone and prouoketh vrine. This frute was cauled Cocus for this cause, that when it is taken from the place where it cleaueth faste to the tree, there are seene two holes, and aboue them two other naturall holes, which altogyther, doo represent the giesture and fygure of the cattes cauled Mammone, that is, munkeys, when they crye: whiche crye the Indians caule Coca: But in very deede, this tree is a kynd of date trees: and hath the same effecte to heale fretynge of the guttes, that Plinie descrybeth all kyndes of date trees to haue.
               
                  Great trees.There are furthermore in the firme lande, trees of suche byggenesse that I dare not speake therof but in place where I haue so many wytnesses which haue seene the same as wel as I. I say therfore, that a leaque from Dariena or the citie of Sancta Maria Antiqua, there passeth a ryuer very large & diepe, which is cauled Cuti: ouer the which the Indians had layde a greate tree so trauersinge the same that it was in the steade of a brydge, the which I my selfe with dyuers other that are at this present in yowre maiesties courte, haue often tymes passed ouer. And forasmuch as the sayde tree had lyne longe there, and by the great weight therof was so shronke downewarde and partely couered with water that none could passe ouer it but were weete to the knee, I being then in the yeare 1522. thofficial of Iustice in that citie at yowre maiesties appoyntemente, caused an other greate tree to bee layde in that place whiche in lyke maner trauersed the ryuer and reached more thē fyftie foote ouer the further syde. This tree was exceadynge greate, and rested aboue the water more then twoo cubytes. In the faule, it cast downe all suche other trees as were within the reache therof: And discouered certeyne vynes whiche were so laden with blacke grapes of pleasaunte taste, that they satisfyed more then fiftie persons whiche eate theyr fylle therof. This tree in the thyckest parte therof, was more then syxtene spannes thicke: And was neuerthelesse but lyttle in respect of many other trees which are founde in this prouince. For the Indians of the coaste and prouince of Car

                     agenia, make barkes or boates therof (which they caule Canoas,) of such byggenesse, beinge all of one hole tree, that sume conteyne a hundreth men, sume a hundreth and thirtie, and

sume more, hauynge neuerthelesse suche voyde space within the same, that there is lefte sufficiente roome to passe to and fro through owte all the Canoa. Sum of these are so large bysyde the length, that they conteyne more then tenne or twelue spannes in breadth, and sayle with twoo sayles as with the master sayle and the trinkette which they make of verye good cotton. The greatest trees that I haue seene in these partes or in anye other regions, was in the prouince of Guaturo, the kynge wherof rebellynge from thobedience of yowre maiestie, was persued by me and taken prysoner: At whiche tyme I with my company, passed ouer a very hygh mountayne ful of great trees, in the toppe wherof we founde one tree whiche had three rootes or rather diuisions of the roote aboue the earth in forme of a tryangle or triuette:A maruelo
                        •
                     -tree. so that betwene euery foote of this triangle or three feete, there was a space of twentie foote betwene euery foote. And this of such heyght aboue the earthe, that a laden carte of those wherewith they are accustomed to brynge home corne in the tyme of haruest in the kyngedome of Toledo in Spayne, myght easely haue passed throwgh euery of those particions or wyndowes whiche were betwene the three feete of the sayd tree. From the earth vpwarde to the trunke of the tree, the open places of the dyuisions betwene these three feete, were of suche heyght from the grounde, that a footeman with a iauelyn was not able to reache to the place where the sayde feete ioyned togyther in the trunke or body of the tree which grewe of great height in one piece and one hole body, or euer it spredde in braunches, which it did not before it exceaded in heyhht the towre of saynt Romane in the citie of Toledo: from whiche heyght and vpwarde, it spreade very greate and stronge braunches. Amonge certeyne Spanyardes which clymed this tree, I my selfe was one. And when I was ascended to the place where it begunne to spreade the branches, it was a maruelous thing to beholde a greate countrey of suche trees towarde the prouince of Abrayme. This tree was easy to clyme, by rea
                     •
                  on of certeyne Besuchi (wherof I haue spoken before) which grewe wreathed aboute the tree in suche sorte that they seemed to make a scalynge ladder. Euery of the foresayde three feete which bore the boddie of the tree, was twentie spannes in thyckenesse. And where they ioyned al togyther aboue in the

trunke or boddye of the tree, the principall trunke was more then fortie and fyue spannes in circuite. I named the mountayne where these trees grow, the mountayne of three footed trees. And this which I haue nowe declared, was seene of all the companye that was there with me when (as I haue sayde before) I tooke kynge Guaturo prysoner in the yeare 1522. Many thynges more myght here bee spoken as touchynge this matter, as also howe there are many other excellent trees founde of dyuers sortes and dyfference, as sweete Ceder trees, blacke date trees, and many other: of the which sum are so heauy that they can not flote aboue the water but synke immediatly to the bottome. And other ageyne as light as a corke. As touchynge all whiche thynges I haue wrytten more largely in my generall hystorie of the Indies. And forasmuch as at this present I haue entered to intreate of trees, before I passe any further to other thynges, I wyl declare the maner howe the Indians kyndle fyre, only wi

                  h woodde and without fyre,

                     yndlynge of fyre withowt fyre. the maner wherof is this. They take a piece of woodde of two spannes in lengthe, as bygge as the leaste fynger of a mans hande, or as an arrowe well pullysshed, and of a stronge kynde of woodde whiche they keepe onely for this purpose. And where they intende to kyndle any fyre, they take two other pieces of woodde of the dryest and lyghtest that they can fynde, and bynde them fast togyther one with an other as close as two fyngers ioyned. In the myddest or betwene these, they put the poynt of the fyrste lyttle staffe made of harde and stronge wood which they hold in theyr handes by the toppe thereof, and turne or rubbe it rounde aboute continually in one place betwene the two pieces of woodde which lye bounde togyther vppon the earthe, which by that vncessant rubbynge and chafynge, are in short space kyndeled and take fyer.Purrified woodde shynyng in the nyght.
               
               I haue also thought good here to speake sumwhat of such thynges as coomme to my rememberaunce of certeyne trees which are founde in this lande, and sumetyme also the lyke haue bynne seene in Spayne. These are certeyne putrifyed troonkes which haue

                  arth that they are verye whyte and shyne in the nyght lyke burnynge fyre brandes. And when the Spanyardes fynde any of this woodde, and intende priuily in the nyght to make warre and

inuade any prouince when case so requyreth that it shalbe necessary to go in the nyght in suche places where they knowe not the way, the formost Christian man whiche guydethe the waye, associate with an Indian to directe hym therein, taketh a lyttle starre of the sayde woodde, which he put

And forasmuche as this lyght is not seene very farre, it is the better pollicie for the Chrystians bycause they are not thereby disclosed before they inuade theyr enemies.
               Furthermore as touchynge the natures of trees, one particular thynge seemeth woorthy to bee noted, wherof Plinie maketh mention in his natural hystorye where he saythe that there are certeyne trees which contynewe

To this purpose, I saye, that in the Ilandes of these Indies, and also in the firme lande, it is a thynge of muche difficultie to fynde twoo trees that lose or cast theyr leaues at any tyme. For althowgh I haue diligentely searched to knowe the trewthe hereof, y

               ¶ Of Reedes or Canes.
               
                  I Haue not thought it conuenient in the chapiture before to speake of that whereof I intende nowe to intreate of reedes or canes to thintente that I woolde not mengle theym with plantes or trees, beinge thynges of thē selues woorthy to bee particularly obserued. So it is therfore, that in the firme land there are many sortes of reedes, so that in many places they make theyr howses therof, couerynge them with the toppes of the same, and makynge theyr waules of them in lyke maner, as I haue sayde before. And amonge these kyndes of reedes, there is one so greate, that the canes therof are as bygge as a mans legge in the knee, and three spannes in length frome ioynt to ioynt or more: in so much that euery of them is of capacitie to conteyne a lyttle bucket of water. In this kynde, here are founde sum greater and sum lesse, of the which sum they vse to make quyuers for arrowes. There is founde an other kynde which suerly is marueylous, beynge lyttle bygger then a Iauelen, the canes whereof are longer then twoo spannes. These reedes growe one farre from an other, as sumtymes twentie or thirtie pases, and sumetymes also twoo or three leaques. They growe in maner in all prouynces in the Indies: And growe nere to very hygh trees whereunto they leane, and creepe vp to the toppes of theyr braunches, which they imbrase and descende ageyne downe to the earth. Theyr canes are full of moste cleare water without any maner of tast or sauoure eyther of the canes or of any other thynge: And suche as yf it were taken owte of the fressheste sprynge in the worlde. Nor yet is it knowen that euer it hurte any that droonke therof. For it hath oftentymes so chaunced that as the Chrysten men haue trauayled in these regions in desolate wayes where for lacke of water they haue byn in great daunger

to dye for thyrste, they haue escaped that perell by reason that they founde the sayde reedes, of the water of whose canes they haue droonke a great quantitie withowt any hurte thereof ensewynge. Therefore when they fynde these in any place, they make water vesselles of the canes therof, and cary as many of them ful of water as may suffice for one dayes iornay. And sumtyme they cary so many, that they take for euery man two or three quartes of water which may serue them for many dayes bycause it doth not corrupte, but remaynethe styll fresshe and good.
               There are also certeine plantes which the Christians caul Platani.
                  
                     Platani.

Frome the foote to the toppe, they beare certeyne longe and large leaues, beinge more then three spannes in largenes, and about ten or twelue in length: The whiche when they are broken of the wynde, the stalke remayneth hole in the myddest. In the myddeste of this plant in the hyghest parte thereof, there groweth a cluster with fortie or fyftie Platans abowt it, euery of them beinge a spanne and a halfe in length, and as bygge as a mans arme in the smau

They haue a rynde not very thycke, and easy to bee broken: being within altogither full of a substaunce lyke vnto the marye of the bone of an oxe as it appeareth when the rynde or barke is taken frome the same. This cluster owght to bee taken from the plant, when any one of the Platans begynne to appere yelowe. At which tyme they take it and hange it in theyr houses where all the cluster waxeth rype with all his Platans. This cluster is a very good frute: And when it is opened and the rynde taken of, there are founde within it many good drye fygges which beynge rosted or stewed in an ouen in a close pot or sum suche other thynge,Figges. are of pleasaunte taste muche lyke the conserue of hony. They putrifie not on the sea so soone as sume other frutes do: but continue fyfteene dayes and more yf they bee gathered sumwhat greene. They seeme more delycate on the sea then on the lande, not for that they any thinge increase in goodnesse on the sea, but bycause that whereas on the sea other thynges are lackyng wherof is plentie on the land, those meates seeme of beste taste which satisfie presente necessitie.

This troonke or sprygge whiche bryngeth foorth the sayde cluster is a hole yeare in growyng and brynging foorth frute. In whiche tyme it hath put foorth rounde abowte it tenne or twelue sprygges as bygge as the fyrst or principall, and multiplieth no lesse then the pryncipall in bryngynge foorthe of clusters with frutes lykewyse at theyr tyme, and also in bryngynge foorth other and many sprygges as is sayde beefore. From the which sprygges or trunkes, as soone as the cluster of the frute is taken away, the plante begynneth to drye and wyther, which then they take owt of the grounde bycause it doth none other then occupie it in vayne and without profyt. They are so many and doo so maruelously increase and multiplie, that it is a thynge in maner incredible. They are exceadynge moyste.

So that for the multitude thereof it sumetyme so chaunceth that men are inforced to take away the Platans frome theyr possession. These frutes are founde at all tymes of the yeare.
               There is also an other kynd of wyld plantes that groweth in the fyeldes: which I haue not seene but in the Ilande of Hispaniola, althowgh they be founde in other Ilandes of the Indies. These they caule Tunas.

They growe of a thistle full of thornes, and brynge foorth a fruite muche lyke vnto great fygges, which haue a crowne lyke medlers, and are within of a hyghe coloure, with graynes and the rynde lyke vnto a fygge. They are of good taste: And growe abundantly in the fyeldes in many places. They woorke a straunge effecte in suche as eate them. For if a manne eate two or three or more, they cause his vrine to bee of the verye coloure of bludde, which thynge chaunced once to my selfe. At whiche tyme as I made water and sawe the colour of my vrine, I entered into a great suspition of my lyfe, beinge so astonysshed for feare, that I thought the same had chaunced to me vpon sum other cause. In so muche that surely my imagination

myght haue doone me hurte, but that they whiche were with me dyd conforte me immediately, declarynge the cause therof as they knewe by experience beinge auncient inhabitours in those regions.
               There groweth also an other plante whiche the people of the countrey caule Bihaos.
                  
                     Bihaos.
                   This putteth forth certeyne streight braunches and very brode leaues which the Indians vse for dyuers purposes. For in sum places they couer theyr houses with the leaues therof cowched and layde after the maner of thetche, wherunto it serueth very well. Sumtymes also whē it rayneth, they cast these ouer theyr heades to defende theim from the water. They make also certeyne chestes whiche they caule Hauas,
                  
                     Hauas,
                   weaued after a straunge sorte and intermixt with the leaues of this Bihaos. These chestes are wrought in such sort, that although it rayne vpon them, or they chaunce to faule into the water, yet are not such thynges wette as are within them. They are made of the braunches of the sayde Bihaos with the leaues weaued togyther therwith. In these they keepe salte and other subtyle thynges. They vse theym also for an other purpose, which is this: That findyng them in the fieldes at such tyme as they haue scarsenesse of vyttayles, they dygge vp the rootes of these plantes whyle they are yet younge, or eate the plante it selfe in that parte where it is moste tender, which is from a foote vnder the grounde, where it is as tender and whyte as a reede or bulrusshe.
               And forasmuch as wee are nowe coomme to thend of this narration,Dying of cotton. it commeth to my rememberaunce to make mention of an other thynge which is not farre from my purpose. And this is howe the Indians do stayne or dye cloth of bombage cotton, or any other thynge which they intende to dye of dyuers coloures: as blacke, tawny, greene, blewe, yelowe, and redde, whiche they doo with the barkes or ryndes, and leaues of certeyne trees, whiche they knowe by experience to bee good for this practise. And by this arte they make colours in such perfection and excellencie that no better can bee diuysed. But this seemeth a straunge thynge,A straunge thynge. that they doo all this in one selfe same vessell: So that when they haue caused the sayde ryndes and leaues to boyle togyther, they make in the same vessell without any chaunge (as I haue sayde) as many colours as them lysteth. Whiche thynge I suppose to

coomme to passe by the disposition of the coloure whiche they haue fyrste gyuen to the thynge that they intende to dye or colour, whether it bee threede, webbe, or clothe, or any thynge that they intende to coloure.
            
            
               ¶ Of venemous apples wherwith they poyson theyr arrowes.
               
                  THe apples wherewith the Indian Canibales inueneme theyr arrowes, growe on certeyne trees couered with many braunches and leaues beinge very greene and growyng thicke. They are laden with abundaunce of these euyll frutes, and haue theyr leaues lyke the leaues of a peare tree, but that they are lesse and rounder. The frute is much lyke the muscadell peares of the Ilande of Sicilie or Naples in forme and byggenesse: And are in sum partes steyned with redde spottes, and of very sweete sauours. These trees for the moste parte, growe euer by the sea coastes and neare vnto the water: And are so fayre and of pleasaunte sauour, that there is no man that seethe theym but wyll desyre to eate therof.
               In so much that if it may bee spoken of any frute yet growynge on the earth,Note. I wolde saye that this was the vnhappy frute wherof owre fyrste parentes Adam and Eue tasted, wherby they both lost theyr felicitie and procured death to them & theyr posteritie. Of these frutes, and of the greate antes whose bytynge causeth swellynge (whereof I haue spoken els where) and of the eutes or lysartes, and vypers, and such other venemous thynges, the Canibales which are the chyefe archers amonge the Indians,Canibales archiers. are accustomed to poyson theyr arrowes wherwith they kyll all that they wounde.

the commaundemente of the Catholyke kynge Don Ferdinando. But to returne to the hystory. These apples (as I haue said) growe neare vnto the sea. And wheras the Christians which serue yowr maiestie in these parties, suppose that there is no remedy so profytable for such as are wounded with these arrowes, as is the water of the sea if the wounde be much wassted therwith,The water of the sea. by which meanes sum haue escaped although but fewe, yet to saye the trewthe, albeit the water of the sea haue a certeyne caustike qualitie agenyst poyson, it is not a sufficient remedy in this case: nor yet to this day haue the Christian perceaued that of fiftie that haue byn wounded, three haue recouered. But that yowr maiestie may the better consyder the force of the veneme of these trees, yowe shall further vnderstande that yf a man doo but repose hym selfe to sleepe a lyttle whyle vnder the shadow of the same, he hath his head and eyes so swolne when he ryseth, that the eye lyddes are ioyned with the chekes. And if it chaunce one droppe or more of the dewe of the sayde tree to faule into the eye, it vtterly destroyeth the syght. The pestilent nature of this tree is such that it can not bee declared in fewe woordes. Of these there groweth greate plentie in the goulfe of Vraba towarde the North coast on the Weste and Easte syde.The goulf of vraba. The wood of these trees when it burneth, maketh so greate a stynke that noo man is able to abyde it, by reason it causeth so great a peyne in the headde.
               Amonge other trees which are in these Indies as well in the Ilandes as in the firme lande, there is an other kynde which they caule Xagua,

Theyr frute is very good, and of good tast and sauoure, and much lyke vnto certeyne damsons or prunes beinge lyttle and yelowe. But theyr stone is very great: by reason wherof they haue but lyttle meate. Theyr barke or rynde boyled in water, maketh a holsome bathe for the legges, bycause it bindeth and steyeth the loosenesse of the flesshe so sencibly that it is a marueyle to consyder. It is suerly a holsome and excellent bathe ageynst such fayntnesse: And is the beste tree that may bee founde in those parties to sleepe vnder. For it causeth no heauinesse of the headde as doo dyuers other trees. Whiche thynge I speake bycause the Christians are muche accustomed in those regions to lye in the fyeldes. It is therfore a common practice amonge them, that where so euer they fynd these trees, there they spreade theyr mattresses and beddes wherin they sleepe.
               There are also a kynde of hyghe date trees and full of thornes.Date trees, The woodde of these is moste excellent: beinge very blacke, and shynynge, and so heauy that no parte thereof can swymme aboue the water, but synketh immediatly to the bottome. Of this woodde they make theyr arrowes and dartes: Also iauelyns, speares, and pykes. And I saye pykes, bycause that in the coastes of the sea of Sur,
                  Thinhabitan

Of the same lykewyse they make clubbes and swoordes and dyuers other weapons. Also vesselles and housholde stuffe of dyuers sortes very fayre and commodious. Furthermore of this woodde the Christians vse to make dyuers musicall instrumentes, as clarisimbals, lutes, gyterns, and suche other, the whiche bysyde theyr fayre shydynge coloure lyke vnto giete, are also of a good sounde and very durable by reason of the hardenesse of the woodde.
               After that I haue sayde thus much of trees and plantes,

I haue thought good also to speake sumwhat of herbes.An herb that bearethe cordes. You shall therefore vnderstande that in these Indies there is an herbe much lyke vnto a yelowe lyllie, abowte whose leaues there growe and creepe certeyne cordes or laces, as the lyke is partly seene in the herbe which we caule lased sauery. But these of the Indies are muche bygger, and longer: and so stronge that they tye theyr hangynge beddes thereby whiche they caule Hamacas wherof we haue spoken elswhere.

These trees are so full of thornes, that there is no tree or plante that seemeth more wylde and deformed: so that I can not well determyne whether they bee trees or plantes. They haue certeyne braunches full of large and deformed leaues, which braunches were fyrste leaues lyke vnto the other. As the braunches made of these leaues growe foorthe inlength, there commeth other leaues of them. So that

Durynge the tyme of this operation, it cleaueth so fast to the flesshe that it can not without much difficultie bee taken away.

               ¶ Of fysshes and of the maner of fysshynge.
               
                  IN the sea coastes of the firme lande, there are dyuers and sundry kyndes of fysshes muche differynge in shape and forme. And althoughe it be impossible to speake of all, yet wyll I make mention of sum. And fyrst to begynne at sardynes, yowe shall vnderstande that there is founde a kynde of these fysshes very large and with redde tayles, beinge a very delicate fysshe. The beste kyndes of other fysshes are these: Moxarre, Diabace, Brettes, Dahaos, Thorn backes, and Salmons. All these and dyuers other which I donot now remember, are taken in great quantitie in ryuers. There are lykewyse taken very good creuysshes. There are also founde in the sea, certeyne other fysshes: as soles, mackerelles, turbuttes, Palamite, Lizze, Polpi, Chieppe, Xaibas, Locustes, Oysters, exceadynge great Tortoyses, and Tiburoni of maruelous byggenesse:Tiburons. Also Manates,Manates and Murene, and manye other fysshes which haue no names in oure language. And these of such diuersitie and quantitie as can not bee expressed without large wrytynge and longe tyme. But to let passe to intreate particulerly of the multitude of fysshes, I intende to speake chiefely and sumwhat largely of three sortes of moste notable fysshes: wherof the fyrst is, the great Tortoyses,G

                        •
                     es. the seconde is cauled Tiburon, and the thyrde Manate. And to begynne at the fyrste, I saye that in the Ilande of Cuba, are founde great Tortoyses (which are certeyne shell fysshes) of such byggenesse that tenne or fyfteene men are scarsely able to lyfte one of them owt of the water, as I haue byn informed of credible persons dwellynge in the same Ilande. But

of that which I my selfe haue seene, I can testifie that in the firme lande in the vyllage of Acla there are of this sorte sum taken and kylled of suche byggenes that sixe men with much difficultie coulde scarsely drawe them owt of the water. And commonly the least sort of them are as much as two men may cary at a burden. That which I sawe lifted vp by syxe men, had her shell a yarde and a quarter in length, and in breadth more then fyue yardes. The maner of takynge them, is this. It sumtymes chaunceth that in theyr greate nettes (whiche they caule shoote ne
                     •
                  tes) there are founde certeyne Tortoyses of the common sorte in great quantities. And when they coomme owt of the sea and bringe foorth theyr egges and go togyther by coompanies from the sea to feade on the lande, the Christians or Indians folowe theyr steppes whiche they fynde in the sande, and soone ouertake them bycause they are very heauy and slowe in goynge, although they make all the haste they can to return
                     •
                   to the sea as soone as they espie any boddie. When they that pursewe them haue ouertaken them, they put a stake or staffe vnder theyr legges and ouerturne thē on theyr backes as they are yet runnynge, so that they can go no further nor yet ryse ageyne or turne. And thus they suffer them to lye styll whyle they folowe after the reste which they ouerturne in lyke maner: And by this meanes take very manye at suche tymes as they coome furth of the sea as I haue sayde. This fysshe is very excellent and holsome to be eaten, and of good taste. The seconde of the three fysshes wherof I haue spoken, is the Tiburon.Tiburons. This is a very greate fysshe and very quicke and swyfte in the water, and a cruell deuourer. These are often tymes taken, as well when the shippes are vnder sayle in the Ocean, as also when they lye at anker, or at any other time, and especially the leaste kynd of these fisshes. When the shippes are vnder sayle, the biggest sorte are taken after this maner. When the Tiburon seeth the shippe sailinge he foloweth it swymmynge behynde. The which thinges the mariners seeinge, caste furthe all the fylthe of the shippe into the sea for the fysshe to eate, who neuerthelesse foloweth thē with equal pase although th

                  y make neuer suche haste wyth full wynd and sailes, and waloweth on euery syde and about the shyppe: And thus foloweth it sumetyme for the space of a hundreth and fyftie leaques and more. And when the mariners

are disposed to take them, they cast downe by the sterne of the shippe, a hoke of yren as bigge as the biggest finger of a mans hande of three spannes in lengthe and crooked like a fysshehooke with beardes accordinge to the bignesse thereof, and fastened to an iren chayne of fyue or syxe linkes neare vnto thende, and from thense tyed with a greate rope, fastening also on the hooke for a bayte, a piece of sum fisshe, or hogges flessh, or sum other flesshe, or the bouwelles and intralles of an other Tiburon wh

                  che they haue taken before, whiche may easely bee doone, for I haue seene nyne taken in one day. And if they wold haue taken more, they myght also. Thus when the Tiburon hath pleasauntly folowed the ship a longe viage, at the lengthe he swaloweth the baite with the hooke. And a

They are sumtymes founde of tenne or twelue foote long, and of fyue, syxe, or seuen spannes in breadth where they are brodest. They haue very greate and wyde mouthes to the proportion of the reste of theyr boddies, and haue two rowes of teethe the one sumewhat separate from the other, of cruell shape & standing very thicke. When they haue slayne this fysshe, they cutte the boddy therof in smaule pieses, and put it to drye, hangynge it three or foure dayes at the cordes of the sayle clothes to drye in the wynde, and then eate it. It is doubtlesse a good fysshe and of greate commoditie to serue the shippes for vitalles for many dayes. The leaste of these fysshes are moste holsome and tender. It hath a skinne much like to the skynne of a sole, whervnto the sayde Tuberon is like in shape.

Manate therefore, is a fysshe of the sea, of the byggest sorte, and muche greater then the Tiburon in length and breadth: And is very brutysshe and vyle, so that it appeareth in forme lyke vnto one of those great vesselles made of goates skynnes wherin they vse to cary newe wyne in Medina de Campo or in Areualo. The headde of this beast is lyke the head of an oxe, with also lyke eyes. And hath in the place of armes, two great stumpes wherwith he swymmeth. It is a very gentle and tame beaste: And cōmeth oftētymes owt of the water to the next shore where if he find ny herbes or grasse, he feedeth therof. Owre men are accustomed to kyl many of these and dyuers other good fysshes with theyr crossebowes, pursuinge them in barkes or Canoas, bycause they swymme in maner aboue the water. The whiche thynge when they see, they drawe them with a hooke tyde at a smaule corde, but sumwhat stronge. As the fysshe flyeth away, the archer letteth go and prolongeth the corde by lyttle and lyttle vntyll he haue lette it go many fathams. At the ende of the corde, there is tyde a corke or a piece of lyght woodde. And when the fysshe is goone a lyttle way, & hathe coloured the water with his bludde, and feeleth hym selfe to faynt and drawe towarde thende of his lyfe, he resortethe to the shore, and the archer foloweth gatherynge vp his corde: wherof whyle there yet remaine sixe or eyght fathams or sumwhat more or lesse, he draweth it towarde the lande, and draweth the fysshe therwith by little and lyttle as the waues of the sea helpe hym to doo it the more easely.

But whereas before, I haue promysed to speake of other fysshes which are taken in these seas whyle the shyppes are vnder sayle, I wyl not forget to speake of the Tunnye which is a great and good fysshe,Tunnye. and is oftentymes taken and kylde with troute speares and hookes caste in the water when they play and swymme aboute the shyppes. In lyke maner also are taken many turbuts which are very good fysshes as are lyghtly in all the sea.Turbut,
               
               And here is to bee noted, that in the greate Ocean sea, there is a straunge thynge to bee considered, whiche all that

haue byn in the Indies affirme to bee trewe. And this is, that lyke as on the lande there are sum prouinces fertile and frutfull,Note, and sum barren, euen so dooth the lyke chaunce in the sea: So that at sum wyndes the shyppes sayle fiftie or a hundreth, or two hundreth leaques and more, withowt takyng or seinge of one fysshe. And ageyne in the selfe same Ocean, in sum places, all the water is seene tremble by the mouynge of the fysshes, where they are taken abundauntly.
               It commeth further to my rememberaunce to speake sumwhat of the flyinge of fysshes,Flyinge fysshes. which is doubtlesse a straunge thynge to beholde, and is after this maner. When the shyppes sayle by the greate Ocean folowynge theyr vyage, there ryseth sumtymes on the one syde or on the other, many coompanies of certeyne lyttle fysshes, of the which the byggest is no greater then a sardyne: and soo diminisshe lesse and lesse from that quantitie that sum of them are very lyttle. These are cauled Volatori: that is, flyinge fysshes. They ryse by great coompanies and flockes in such multitudes that it is an astonysshement to beholde them. Sumtymes they ryse but lyttle from the water: & (as it chaunceth) continew one flyght for the space of a hundreth pases and sumtymes more or lesse before they faule ageyne into the sea. Sumtymes also they faule into the shyppes. And I remember that on an euenyng when all the company in the shippe were on theyr knees syngynge Salue regina in the highest parte of the Castel of the poope, and sayled with a full wynde, there passed by vs a flocke of these flyinge fysshes: and came so neare vs that many of them fell into the shyppe, amonge the which, two or three fell hard by me which I tooke alyue in my hande: so that I myght well perceaue that they were as bigge as sardynes and of the same quantitie, hauynge two wynges or quylles growyng owt of theyr fynnes, lyke vnto those wherwith all fysshes swymme in ryuers. These wynges are as longe as the fysshes theym selues. As longe as theyr wynges are moyste, they beare them vp in the ayer. But as soone as they are drye, they can continewe theyr flyght no further then as I haue sayde before, but faule immediatly into the sea, and so ryse ageyne, and flye as before from place to place.
               
                  In the yeare. A thousand fyue hundreth fiftene. when I came fyrst to informe your maiestye of the state of the thynges Indya, and was the yeare folowynge in Flaunders in the tyme of youre moste fortunate successe in these youre kyngedomes of Aragonie and Castyle, wheras at that vyage I sayled aboue the Iland Bermuda otherwyse cauled Garza,
                  The Iland of Bermuda. beynge the furtheste of all the Ilandes that are founde at thys daye in the worlde, and arryuynge there at the deapthe of eight yeardes of water, and dystant from the land as farre as the shotte of a piece of ordynaunce, I determined to sende sume of the shyppe to lande as well to make searche of suche thynges as were there, as also to leaue in the Ilande certayne hogges for increase. But the tyme not seruyng my purpose by reason of contrarye wynde, I could bryng my shyppes no nearer the Ilande beinge twelue leaques in lengthe and syxe in breadth and about thyrty in circuite, lying in the thyrtie thre & degre of the northe syde. Whyle I remayned here, I sawe a stryfe and combatte betwene these flyinge fyshes and the fyshes named gylte heades, and the foules cauled seamewes and cormorauntes, whych suerlye seemed vnto me a thynge of as greate pleasure and solace as coulde bee deuysed, whyle the gylte heades swamme on the brymme of the water and sumtymes lyfted their shulders aboue the same to rayse the swymmynge fysshes owt of the water to dryue them to flyght, and folowe them swymming to the place where they faule to take and eate them sodaynlye. Agayne on the other syde, the seamewes and cormorantes, take manye of these flying fysshes: so that by thys meanes theye are nother safe in the ayre nor in the water.Not to hie for the pye nor to lowe fro: the crowe. In the selfe same perrell and daunger doo men lyue in thys mortall lyfe wherin is no certayne securytye nether in hygh estate nor in lowe.

But to returne to the hystorye: these byrdes and foules whych I sawe, were of the Ilande of Bermuda nere vnto the whych I sawe these flyinge fysshes. For they coulde bee of no other lande, forasmuche as they are not accustomed

to wander farre frome the coastes where they are bredde.

The selfe same Ocean sea in the fyrme lande newly founde, in the coastes of the same lyynge towarde the Northe, dothe neyther ryse nor faule, nor lykewise in the Ilandes of Hispaniola and Cuba and all the other Ilandes of the same sea lyinge towarde the northe,

                  IT hath byn an opinion amonge the Cosmographers and Pylottes of late tyme, and other which haue had practise in thynges touchynge the sea, that there shulde bee a straygh

hath not byn seene nor founde to this daye. And suerlye yf there be any suche strayght▪ we that inhabite those partes do thynke the same shulde bee rather of lande thē of water. For the fyrme lande in sum partes therof is so strayght and narrowe that the Indyans saye that frome the mountaynes of the prouynce of Esquegua or Vrraca,
                  Esquegua and vrrace.

And ageyne lookynge the contrarye waye, may on the other syde towarde the Southe, see the sea of Sur and the prouynces whyche confyne with it, as doo the territoryes of the twoo Lordes or kynges of the sayde prouinces of Vrraca and Esquegua. And I beleue that if it bee as the Indyans saye, of al that is hetherto knowen, this is the narowest strayght of the fyrme lande, whiche sume affyrme to bee full of rough mountaynes. Yet doo I not take it for a better waye, or so shorte as is that whyche is made from the porte cauled Nomen dei (whiche is in the Northe sea) vnto the newe citye of Panama beynge in the coaste and on the banke of the sea of Sur.

                     Panama.
                   Whiche waye is likewyse very rough ful of thicke wods, mountaines, ryuers, valleys, and verye diffyculte to passe through, and can not bee doone withowt greate laboure and trauayle. Sum measure this waye in this part, to bee from sea to sea .xviii. leaques, whych I suppose to bee rather .xx. not for that it is any more by measure, but bicause it is rough and dyffyculte as I haue sayde, and as I haue founde it by experyence hauynge nowe twyse passed that way by foote: countyng from the porte and vyllage of Nomen Dei vnto the dominion of the Cacique of Iuanaga otherwyse cauled Capira .viii. leaques: And frome thense to the ryuer of Chagre,
                  The ryuer of Chagre. other .viii. leaques. So that at this ryuer beinge .xvi. leaques from the sayde porte, endeth the roughnesse of the way. Then from hense to the maruelous brydge are two leaques: And beyonde that, other twoo vnto the port of Panama: So that all togyther in my iudgemente, make .xx. leaques. And if therfore this nauigation may bee founde in the South sea for the trade of spices (as we trust in God) to bee brought from thense to the sayde porte of Panama (as is possible enough) they may afterwarde easly passe to the Northe sea notwithstaddynge the difficultie of the waye of

the .xx. leaques aforesayde. Whiche thynge I affirme as a man well trauayled in these regions, hauynge twyse on my feete passed ouer this strayght in the yeare .1521. as I haue sayde. It is furthermore to bee vnderstode, that it is a maruelous facilitie to bryng spices by this way which I wil now declare. From Panama to the ryuer of Chagre, are foure leaques of good and fayre way by the which cartes may passe at pleasure by reason that the mountaynes are but fewe and lyttle, and that the greateste parte of these foure leaques is a playne grounde voyde of trees. And when the cartes are coomme to the sayde ryuer, the spices may bee caryed in barkes and pinnesses. For this ryuer entereth into the North sea fyue or .vi leaques lower then the port of Nomen dei, and emptieth it selfe in the sea nere vnto an Ilande cauled Bastimento,
                  The Ilande Bastimento. where is a very good and safe port. Yowr maiestie may now therfore consyder howe great a thynge and what commoditie it maye bee to conuey spices this way, forasmuch as the ryuer of Chagre hauyng his originall only two leaques from the South sea, contineweth his course & emptieth it selfe into the other North sea. This ryuer runneth fast and is very greate, and so commodious for this purpose as may be thowght or desyred. The marueilous bridge made by the worke of nature,The maruelous bridge. being two leaques beyonde the sayd ryuer, and other twoo leaques on this syde the porte of Panama, so lyinge in the mydde way betwene them both, is framed naturally in such sort that none which passe by this viage see any such bridge or thynke that there is any such buyldyng in that place vntyll they bee in the toppe therof in the way toward Panama. But as soone as they are on the brydge, lookynge towarde the ryght hande, they see a lyttle ryuer vnder them which hath his chanell distante from the feete of them that walke ouer it, the space of twoo speares length or more. The water of this ryuer is very shalowe, not passyng the depth of a mans legge to the knee: and is in breadth be

creatour of all thynges. But to returne to speake sumwhat more of the conueying of spices, I say that when it shal please almyghty god that this nauigation aforesayde shal bee founde by the good fortune of yowre maiestie, and that the spices of the Ilandes of the South sea (which may also bee otherwyse cauled the Ocean of the East India in the whiche are the Ilandes of Molucca) shalbe browght to the sayd coaste and the porte of Panama,
                  The Ilandes of Molucca. and bee conueyed from thense (as we haue sayde) by the firme lande with cartes vnto the ryuer of Chagre, and from thense into this owr other sea of the North, from whense they may afterward bee browght into Spayne, I say that by this meanes the vyage shall bee shortened more then seuen thousande leaques,The commoditie of this viage. with muche lesse daunger then is by the viage nowe vsed by the way of Commendator of Aysa capitayne vnder yowre maiestie, who this present yeare attempted a vyage to the place of the sayde spyces. And not only the way is thus much shortened, but also a thyrde parte of the tyme is abbreuiate. To conclude therfore, if any had hetherto attempted this vyage by the sea of Sur, to seeke the Ilandes of spyces, I am of firme opinion that they shuld haue byn founde longe sence, as doubtelesse they maye bee by the reasons of Cosmographie.

               Euen so may it bee that Tygers are lyght in sum region as they wryte, and maye neuerthelesse bee slowe and heauy in these Indies of yowr maiestie wherof we speake. The sheepe of Arabie drawe theyr tayles longe and bigge on the ground,Sheepe. and the bulles of Egypt haue theyr heare growynge towarde theyr headdes: yet are those sheepe and these bulles.Bulles. Men in sum countreys are hardy and of good courage, and in other naturally fearefull and brutyshe. All these thynges and many more which may bee sayde to this purpose, are easy to bee proued and woorthy to bee beleued of suche as haue redde of the lyke in autours or trauayled the worlde, whereby theyr owne syght may teache theym thexperience of these thynges wherof I speake. It is also manifest, that Iucea wherof they make theyr breade in the Ilande of Hispaniola,

The bats of Spayne although they bite,Battes. yet are they not venemous. But in the firme lande many dye that are bytten of them. And in this fourme may so many thynges bee sayde that tyme shall not suffice to wryte, wheras my intent is only to proue that this beast may be a Tiger or of the kind of Tigers although it be not of such lyghtnesse and swiftnes as are they wherof Plinie and other autours speake,Plinie. discrybynge it to bee one of the swyftesse beastes of the lande, and that the ryuer of Tigris for the swift course therof was cauled by that name. The first Spaniardes which sawe this Tyger in the firme lande, dyd so name it. Of the kynde of these was that which Don Diego Columbo the Admirall sent yowre maiestie owte of newe Spayne to Toledo.the Tiger. Theyr heades are lyke to the heades of Lyons or Lionesses, but greater. The reste of all theyr boddies and theyr legges, are full of blacke spottes one nere vnto an other and diuided with a circumference or frynge of redde colour shewinge as it were a fayre woorke and correspondent picture. Abowt theyr croopes or hynder partes, they haue these spots bydgest: and lesse and lesse towarde theyr bellies, legges, and

headdes. That which was brought to Toledo, was younge and but lyttle, and by my estimation, of thage of three yeares But in the firme lande there are many founde of greater quantitie. For I haue seene sum of three spannes in heyght, and more then fyue in length. They are beastes of greate force, with stronge legges, and well armed with nayles and fanges which we caule dogge teeth. They are so fierce that in my iudgement no reall lyon of the byggest sorte is so stronge or fierce. Of these, there are many founde in the firme land whiche deuour many of the Indians & do much hurte otherwyse. But syns the comming of the Christians, many haue byn kyld with Crossebowes after this maner. As soone as the archer hath knowlege of the haunt of any of these Tygers,The huntyng of tigers. he gothe searchynge theyr trase with his crossebowe and with a lyttle hounde or bewgle and not with a greehounde, bycause this beast wolde soone kyll any dogge that wolde venter on hym. When the hounde hath founde the Tyger, he runneth about hym bayinge continually, and approcheth so neare hym snappynge and grynnynge with so quicke flyinge and returnyng, that he hereby so molesteth this fierce beaste that he dryuethe hym to take the next tree, at the foote whereof he remayneth styl baying and the Tyger grynnyng and shewyng his teeth, whyle in the meane tyme the archer commeth neare, and .xii. or .xiiii. pases of, stryketh hym with the querel of his crossebowe in the breste, and flyeth incontinent, leauynge the Tyger in his trauayle for lyfe and death, bytynge the tree and eatynge earth for fi

                  ❧ Of the maners and customes of the Indians of the firme lande, and of theyr women.
               
                  THe maners and customes of these Indians, are dyuers in diuers prouinces. Sum of them take as many wyues as them lyste, and other lyue with one wyfe whome they forsake not without consent of both parties, which chauncethe especially when they haue no chyldren.The Indian women. The nobilitie aswel men as women, repute it infamous to ioyne with any of base parentage or strangers, except Christians, whom they count noble men by reason of theyr valientnes, although they put a difference betwene the common sorte and the other to whom they shewe obedience, countynge it for a great matter and an honorable thyng yf they bee beloued of any of thē. In so much that yf they knowe any Christian man carna

                  ly, they keepe theyr fayth to hym, so that he bee not longe absent farre from them. For theyr intent is not to bee widowes or to lyue chast lyke religious women. Many of theym haue this custome, that when they perceaue 
                     •
                  hat they are with chylde, they take an herbe wherwith they destroy that is conceaued. For they say that only wel aged women shulde beare chyldren, and that they wyl not forbeare theyr pleasures and deforme theyr boddies with bearynge of chyldren, wherby theyr teates becoome loose and hangynge which thynge they greatly disprayse. When they are delyuered of theyr chyldren they go to the ryuer and washe them. Whiche doone, theyr bludde and purgation ceaseth immediatly. And when after this they haue a few days absteyned frō the company of men, they becomme so strayght as they say which haue had carnall familiaritie with them, that such as vse them, can not without much difficultie satis

The principal men beare theyr priuities in a holowe pype of golde: but the common sorte haue theym inclosed in the shelles of certeyne great welkes, and are bysyde vtterly naked. For they thynke it no more shame to haue theyr cods seene then any other parte of theyr boddies. And in many prouinces bothe the men and women go vtterly naked without any such couerture at al. In the prouince of Cueua they caul a man Chuy, and a woman Ira: which name is not greately disagreeable to many both of theyr women and of owres.
               These Indians gyue great honour and reuerence to theyr Cacique (that is) theyr kynges and rulers. The principall Cacique,

Two of them cary hym syttyng vppon a longe piece of woodde which is naturally as lyght as they can fynd The other tenne folowe nexte vnto hym as foote men. They keepe continually a trottynge pase with hym on theyr shulders. When the twoo that cary hym are wery, other twoo coomme in theyr places without any disturbance or stey. And thus if the way bee playne, they cary hym in this maner for the space of .xv. or .xx. leaques in one day. The Indians that are assigned to this office, are for the moste parte slaues or Naboriti, that is, such as are bounde to continuall seruice.
               I haue also noted that when the Indians perceaue them selues to bee troubled with to much bludde,Lettinge of bludde. they lette theym selues blud in the calfes of theyr legges & brawnes of theyr armes, This doo they with a very sharpe stone, and sumtymes with the smaule toothe of a vyper, or with a sharpe reede or thorne
               All the Indians are commonly without beardes:They haue no beardes. In so much that it is in maner a maruayle to see any of them eyther men or women to haue any downe or heare on theyr faces or other partes of theyr boddies. Albeit, I sawe the Cacique of the prouince of Catarapa who had heare on his face and other partes of his boddie, as had also his wyfe in suche places as women are accustomed to haue.They paynte theyr bodies. This Cacique had a great part of his body paynted with a blacke colour which neuer fadeth: And is much lyke vnto that wherwith the Mores paynt them

selues in Barberie in token of nobilitie. But the Moores are paynted specially on theyr vysage and throte and certeyne other partes. Likewyse the principall Indians vse these payntynges on theyr armes and brestes, but not on theyr vysages, bycause amonge them the slaues are so marked. When the Indians of certeyne prouinces go to the battayle (especially the Caniball archers) they cary certeyne shelles of greate welkes of the sea which they blowe and make therwith great sounde muche lyke the noyse of hornes.The Canibales.

Lykewyse those kynd of date trees that beare dates:Dates. and dyuers other trees and plantes which were brought owt of Spayne thyther.
               Beastes doo also increase in lyke abundaunce:Beastes. and especially the heardes of kyne are so augmented both in quantitie and number, that there are nowe many patrones of cattayle that haue more then two thousand heades of neate:Greate heardes of catta

And trewth it is, that this Iland hath better pasture for such cattayle then any other countrey in the worlde:good pasture. also holsome and cleare water and temperate ayer, by reason whereof the heardes of such beastes are much bygger, fatter, and also of better taste then owres in Spayne bycause of the ranke pasture whose moysture is better digested in the herbe or grasse by the continuall and temperate heate of the soonne,The effecte of continual and moderate heate. wherby being made more fatte and vnctuous, it is of better and more stedfast nuryshement.The cause of fatte nurisshemente. For continuall and temperate heate, dooth not only drawe muche moysture owt of the earth to the nuryshement of such thynges as growe and are engendered in that clyme, but dooth also by moderation preserue the same from resolution and putrefaction, digestynge also and condensatynge or thyckenynge the sayde moyste nuryshemente into a gummie and vactuous substaunce as is seene in all suche thinges as growe in those regions. And this is the only naturall cause aswell that certeyne great beastes and of longe lyfe (as the Elephante and Rhinoceros with such other) are engendered only in regions nere vnto the Equinoctiall,Beastes of longe lyfe

That is in effecte: peares growynge vppon peares, and fygges vppon fygges. Plinie also wryteth, that suche trees are neuer infected with the disease of trees that the Latines

               In this Ilande furthermore, are many sheepe and a great number of hogges:Shepee and hogges of the which (as also of the kyne) manye are becoome wyld: And lykewyse many dogges and cattes of those which were brought owt of Spayne.Dogges and cattes becom wylde These (and especially the dogges) doo much hurte amonge the cattayle by reason of the negligence of the hearde men.

Sum places of the Ilande are inhabyted, although not so many as were requisite: Of the whiche I wyll saye no more but that all the regions of the Ilande are so well situate that in the course of tyme all thynges shall coomme to greater perfection by reason of the rychnesse and pleasauntnesse of the countrey and fertilitie of the soile.
               But nowe to speake sumwhat of the principall and chiefe place of the Ilande, which is the citie of San Domenico:The citie of sandomenico I saye that as touchynge the buildynges, there is no citie in Spaine so muche for so muche (no not Barsalona whiche I haue oftentymes seene) that is to bee preferred before this generallye. For the houses of San Domenico, are for the moste parte of stone as are they of Barsalona: or of so stronge and well wrought earth that it maketh a singuler & stronge byndyng. The situacion is muche better thē that of Barsalona by reason that the

are much larger and playner▪ and without comparyson more directe and streyght furth. For beinge buylded nowe in owr tyme, bysyde the commoditie of the place of the foundation, the streates were also directed with corde, compase and measure, wherin it excelleth al the cities that I haue sene. It hath the sea so nere, that of one syde there is no more space betwen the sea and the citie then the waules. And this is about fyftie pases where it is furthest of. On this syde, the waters of the sea beate vppon the naturall stones and fayre coaste. On the other parte, harde by the syde and at the foote of the houses, passeth the ryuer Ozama whiche is a marueylous porte wherin laden shyppes ryse very nere to the lande and in maner vnder the house wynd

In the myddest of this space in the citie, is the fortresse and castle, vnder the which and twentie pases distant from the same, passe the shippes to aryse sum what further in the same ryuer. From the enteraunce of the shyppes vntyll they cast anker, they sayle no further from the houses of the citie then thyrtie or fortie pases, bicause of this syde of the citie the habitacion is nere to the ryuer. The port or hauen also,The hauen is so fayre and commodious to defraight or vnlade shyppes, as the lyke is founde but in fewe places of the worlde. The chymmeis that are in this citie, are abowt syxe hundreth in number, and such houses as I haue spoken of before: Of the which sum are so fayre and large that they maye well receaue and lodge any lorde or noble manne of Spayne with his trayne and famelie. And especially that which Don Diego Colon viceroy vnder your maiestie hath in this citie, is suche that I knowe no man in Spayne that hath the lyke by a quarter in goodnesse consyderynge all the commodities of the same. Lykewyse the situation thereof, as beinge aboue the sayde porte and altogyther of stone and hauynge many faire and large roomes with as goodly a prospect of the lande and sea as may be deuysed, seemeth vnto me so magnificall and princelyke that yowr maiestie maye bee as well lodged therin as in any of the mooste exquisite builded houses of Spayne.

There are furthermore three monasteries bearyng the name of saynt Dominike, saynt Frances, and saynt Marie of Mercedes: The whiche are all well buylded althoughe not so curiouslye as they of Spayne. But speakynge without preiudice of any other religious monasterie, yowre maiestie may bee well assured that in these three monasteries, god is as wel serued as in any other religious house with men of holy lyuynge and vertuous exemple. There is also a very good hospitall for the ayde and succour of pore people,An hospitale. whiche was founde by Michaell Passament threasurer to yowr maiestie. To conclude, this citie frō day to day increaseth in welth and good order, aswel for that the sayde Admyrall and viceroy with the lorde Chaunceloure and counsayle appoynted there by yowr maiestie, haue theyr continuall abydynge here, as also that the rychest men of the Ilande resort hyther for theyr moste commodious habitation and trade of such marchaundies as are eyther brought owt of Spayne or sent thyther from this Iland which nowe so abundeth in many thynges that it serueth Spayne with m

               The people of this Ilande are commonlye of sumewhat lesse stature then are the Spanyardes, and of a shynynge or cleare browne coloure. They haue wyues of theyr owne, and absteyne from theyr dowghters, systers, and mothers. They haue large forheades, longe blacke heare, and no beardes or heare in any other parts of theyr bodies aswel mē as women,The people except very fewe as perhaps scarsely one amonge a thousand. They go as naked as they were borne, excepte that on the partes which may not with honestie bee seene, they weare a certeyne leafe as brode as a mans hande, which neuerthelesse is not kepte close with suche diligence but that sumtymes a man may see that they thynke sufficiently hydde.
               In this Iland are certeyne glo woormes that shyne in the nyght as doo owres.Glo wormes But are muche bygger and gyue a greater lyght: In so much that when the men of the Ilande goo any iorneys in the nyght, they beare summe of these woormes made fast abowt theyr fiete and heade, in suche sorte that he that shulde see them a farre and ignorant of the thinge, wolde bee greatly astonyshed therat. By the lyght of these also, the

women woorke in theyr houses in the night. These woormes they caule Cleuas. Theyr lyght lasteth for the space of three dayes, and diminissheth as they begynne to drye vp.

               As touchynge other thynges of this Ilande whereof Peter Martyr hath more largely intreated in his Decades, I haue thought it superfluous to repeate the same ageyne owte of this hystorie of Gonzalus Ferdinandus: but haue here gathered only suche thynges as eyther are not touched of Peter Martyr or not so largely declared: as I haue doone the lyke in all other notable thynges which I haue collected owt of this Summarie of Gonzalus.

               In Cuba, is a certeyne kynde of Partyches beinge verye little, with theyr fethers much of the colour of turtle dooues:Partriches. but are of muche better taste to bee eaten. They are taken in great number. And beinge brought wylde into the houses, they becoome as tame within the space of three or foure dayes as though they had byn hatched there. They becoomme exceadynge fatte in short space, and are doubtelesse the most delicate and pleasaunt meate that euer I haue eaten. But to let passe many other thynges that myght here bee sayde, and to speake of two maruelous thynges which are in this Iland of Cuba: wherof the one is,Pellettes for gunnes wrought by nature. that a valley conteynynge twoo or three leaques in length betwene two mountaynes, is full of a kynde of very harde stones of suche perfecte roundenesse and lyke vnto pellettes of gunnes that no arte can make better or more exactly polysshed. Of these, sum are as smaule

as pellettes for handegunnes: and other so increasynge bygger and bygger from that quantitie, that they may serue for all sortes of artyllerie althoughe they bee of byggenesse to receaue one or two or more quintales of pouder, euery quintale conteynyng one hundreth weyght: or of what other quantitie so euer they bee.

               THe vyage made by the Spanyardes rownde abowt the worlde, is one of the greatest and moste marueylous thynges that hath bynne knowen to owre tyme. And althoughe in many thynges we excell owre aunciente predicessours, in this especiallye wee so farre exceade all theyr inuentions, that the lyke hath not heretofore byn knowen to this day. This viage was written particularly by Don Peter Martyr of Angleria being one of the counsayle of Themperours Indies,Don Peter Martyr. to whom also was commytted the wrytyng of the hystorie and examination of al suche as returned from thense into Spayne to the citie of Siuile, in the yeare .M. D. xxii. But sendynge it to Rome to bee prynted in that miserable tyme when the citie was sacked it was lost and not founde to this day or any memory remaynynge therof,Rome sacked sauynge suche as sum that redde the same haue borne in mynde. And amonge other notable thynges by hym wrytten as touchynge that vyage, this is one, that the Spanyardes hauynge sayled abowt three yeares and one moneth,A day lost in three yeares and one moneth. and the most of them notynge the dayes, day by day (as is the maner of all them that sayle by the Ocean) they founde when they were returned to Spayne, that they had loste one daye: So that at theyr arryuall at the porte of Siuile beinge the seuenth day of September, was by theyr accompt but the sixth day. And where as Don Peter Martyr declared the strange effecte of this thynge to a certeyne excellente man who for his singuler lernynge was greately aduaunced to honoure in his common welthe and made Themperours ambassadoure, this woorthy gentelman who was also a greate Philosopher and Astronomer, answered that it coulde not otherwyse chaunce vnto them hauynge sayled three yeares continually, euer folowynge

the soonne towarde the West. And sayde furthermore that they of owlde tyme obserued that all suche as sayled behinde the soonne towarde the West, dyd greatly lengthen the day. And albeit that the sayde booke of Peter Martyr is perysshed, yet hath not fortune permitted that the memorie of so woorthy and marueylous an enterpryse shulde vtterly bee extincte: forasmuch as a certeyne noble gentleman of the cytie of Uincenza in Italie, cauled master Antonie Pigafetta (who beinge one of the coompanie of that vyage and after his returne into Spayne in the shyppe Uictoria,Antonie Pigafetta. was made knyght of the Rhodes) wrote a particular and large booke therof which he gaue to Themperours Maiestie, and sente a coppie of the same into Fraunce to the lady Regente moo

                hauyng longe studyed in Italy, wyllynge him to translate it into the Frenche toonge. This booke therefore was printed fyrst in the frenche toonge and then in the Italien, with also an epistle to the Cardinall of Salsepurge as touchynge the same viage, written by Maximiliane Transiluane secretarie to Themperours Maiestie,Maximilian Transiluane in the yeare .1522. And doubtelesse amonge al the cities of Italie, the citie of Uicenza may herein much glorie, that beside the ancient nobilitie and many excellent and rare wyttes whiche it hath browght furth aswell in learnynge as discipline of warre, it hath also had so woorthy and valiaunt a gentleman as was the sayde master Antonie Pigafetta, who hauing compased abowte the ball or globe of the worlde, hath lykewyse described that vyage particularly.

From the whiche Ilandes they are brought in shyps or barkes made withowt any iren tooles, and tyed togyther with cordes of date trees: with rounde sayles lykewise made of the smaule twigges of the branches of date trees weaued togyther.

But as soone as the three fyers cauled saynte Helen, saynte Nycolas, and saynt Clare, appered vppon the cabels of the shyppes, suddeynely the tempeste and furye of the wyndes ceased.
               Departynge frome hense, they sayled to the .49. degree and a halfe vnder the pole Antartyke:The .xlix. degree of the south pole. where beinge wyntered, they were inforced to remayne there for the space of two monethes, all which tyme they sawe no man except that one daye by chaunce they espyed a man of the stature of a giante,Giantes. who came to the hauen daunsyng and syngynge, and shortly after seemed to cast dust ouer his heade.

Uppon his cheekes were paynted two hartes, and redde circles abowt his eyes. The heare of his headde was coloured whyte, and his apparell was the skynne of a beaste sowde togyther. This beaste (as seemed vnto vs) had a large heade and great eares lyke vnto a mule, with the body of a camel and tayle of a horse. The feete of the g

He had also a bundell of longe arrowes made of reedes fethered after the maner of owrs, typte with sharpe stones in the steade of iren heades. The Capitayne caused him to eate and drynke, and gaue him many thynges, and amonge other a greate lookynge glasse: In the which as soone as he sawe his owne lykenesse, was suddeynely afrayde and started backe with such violence that he ouerthrewe two that stoode nearest abowte hym. When the Capitayne had thus gyuen hym certeyne haukes belles and other great belles, with also a lookynge glasse, a combe, and a payre of beades of glasse, he sente hym to lande with foure of his owne men well armed.
               Shortely after, they sawe an other giaunte of sumewhat greater stature,An other giante. with his bowe and arrowes in his hande, As he drewe neare vnto owre menne, he layde his hande on his heade and poynted vp towarde heauen, and owr men dyd the lyke.

But he maruayled muche more when the capitaine tould hym by thinterpretoure howe he founde the straight by the compasse and lode stone, and howe many dayes they were without sight of any lande. Then askynge licence to departe, the capitayne sente two of his men with him, of the whiche Antonie Pigafetta was one. When the kynge sawe Antonie Pigafetta write the names of many thinges, and afterwarde rehearse them ageyne, he maruayled yet more, makynge sygnes that suche men descended from heauen. The Kynge brought them firste to his pallaice where he interteyned them honorably and gaue them manye gyftes, as dyd also the Prince in his pallaice beynge in an other Ilande named Caleghan.

He had his heare long downe to his shulders, and very blake, with a vaile of silke rowled abowte his head,The kynge of Buthuan. and two greate ringes of golde hanginge at his eares. He had abowte hys myddle, a clothe wroughte of cotton and silke impaled wyth golde, and reacheinge downe to his knees. On his one syde, he had a long dager with a hafte of golde, and the shethe of a fayre kynde of carued woodde. He had on euery finger, three ringes of golde, and had his bodie annoynted with oyle of storax and Beniamin. The natural coloure of his face was like vnto the coloure of an oliue: And all his bodye bysyde paynted with diuers colours. The kynges name was Raia Colambu, and the Prince was cauled Raia Siagu.
               The laste day of Marche neare vnto Easter, the capitaine caused his preeste to say masse,Masse. and sente to the kinge by thinterpretoure, that his commyng a lande at that tyme was not to dyne with hym, but only to heare masse. The Capitayne came alande with fyftie of his men in theyr best apparel with owte weapons or harnesse, and all the resydue well armed. Before the boates came to lande, he caused sixe pieces of ordinaunce to be shotte of in token of peace, and so came aland, where the two kinges embrased hym, and accompanyed hym to the place appoynted for masse to be sayde not farre frome the sea syde. Sumwhat before the beginnynge of masse, the Capitayne sprinkeled the Kynges with damaske water.
               When the preeste was at mid masse at the offitorie, the kings profered them selues to go to kysse the crosse with the capytayne, but offered nothynge. At the tyme of sacringe when the preeste lifted vppe the bodie of Christ, and the Christians kneeled downe and helde vppe their handes ioyned togither, the kinges dyd the like also wyth greate reuerence. In the meane tyme, whyle certeyne of the Christians were at the communion, a handegunne was shotte of to signifie vnto theym that were in the shyppes, to discharge all theyr ordinaunce.
               When masse was fynysshed, the Capitaine caused certeyne of his men to put on theyr harnesse and to make a combat with theyr naked swoordes,A combatte. wherat the kynges tooke great pleasure.

When thinterpretour had sayde these woordes, one of the sayde marchauntes (who was a Moore) spake to the kynge in this maner. CATACAIA Chitae: that is. Take hede syr. For these men are they that haue conquered Calicut,Calicut. Malaca,

As they wente towarde the courte, they mette the kynge commyng in the streete accompanied with many of his chiefe men.

They entered into greate amitie, and had large communication of many thynges. The Capitayne persuaded them to the Christian fayth, which they gladly embrased, and tooke suche pleasure in hearynge the articles of owre beliefe, that the teares fell from theyr eyes for ioye. They were baptised,The kynge of zibut is baptised. and shortely after all the people of the Ilande. They esteeme nothyng more precious then drynking glasses of Uenice woorke.
               When they came to the citie, they founde the kyng in his pallaice sittynge vppon a floure or stuorie made of the leaues of date trees wrought after a curious diuise lyke a certeyne kynde of mattes. He had vppon his body, none other apparell but only a cloth of bombasine cotton hangyng before his priuie partes.The kynge of zubut his apparell. On his heade, he had a vayle of needle worke: and abowte his necke a chaine of greate price. At his eares, hunge two rynges of golde wherein were inclosed many precious stones. He was but of smaule stature, but sumewhat grosse, and had the residue of his body paynted with dyuers coloures wherof sum were lyke vnto flamynge fyre. Before hym, he had two vesselles made of the fine earth cauled Porcellana, with sodden egges. Also four vessels of Porcellana full of wyne made of date trees, and couered with many odoriferous herbes. The prince brought them to his house, where he had foure doughters verye well fauoured and whyte lyke owres.well fauored women. He caused them to daunce all naked, and therwith to synge, and play on certeyne tymbrelles made of metall.
               At this tyme it so chaunced that one of the Spanyardes dyed in one of the shyppes. And when certeyne of theyr coompanye desyred the kynge to gyue them leaue to burie hym on the land, he answered that forasmuch as he and all his, were at the commaundement of theyr kynge and master, how much more ought the grounde so to bee.
               They greatly marueyled at the cerimonies perteynyng to the maner of owre funeralles, and honoured the crosses whiche were set at bothe thendes the graue.
               They lyue with iustice, and vse waightes and measures. Theyr houses are made of Timber and sawne boordes: and

are so buylded aboue the grownde vppon proppes and pyles, that they ascende to the same by certeyne stayers. Under theyr houses, they keepe theyr hogges and hennes.
               When they came to barterynge,Barterynge they gaue golde, rysse, hogges, hennes, and dyuers other thynges for sume of owre tryfels of smaule value. They gaue tenne Pesos of golde for xvi. poundes weyght of men.Pesus what. One pesus is in value a ducate and a halfe. The sunday folowynge, the kynge was baptysed with great solemnitie. At which tyme, the Capitayne admonysshed him before not to bee afrayde at the shootyng of of the ordinaunce, bycause it was theyr custome so to doo at such solemne feastes. After this, the Capitayne caused theym to breake all theyr Idoles,They breake theyr Idoles and erecte the crosse. and to set vppe the crosse in dyuers places, prayinge to the same bothe mornynge and euenynge kneelynge on theyr knees and holdynge vp theyr handes ioyned togyther. The kinge in his baptisme, was named Charles after the Emperours name, and the Prince, Ferdinando after the name of his maiesties brother. The kynge of Messana was named Iohn, and the Moore Christopher. To all other they gaue such names as are commonly vsed in Christendome. And thus beefore masse was begunne, were fiue hundreth men baptised.Fyue hundreth men baptised. When masse was fynysshed, the Capitayne inuited the kynge to dyne with him in his shyppe, and at his commynge, caused the ordinaunce to bee discharged.
               
                  The queene of zubut.The queene was also baptised with fortie of her gentlewomen, and her doughter the Princes wife. The queene was very younge and fayre, hauynge her body couered with a white cloth. Her lyppes were redde, and she had on her head a hat, on the toppe wherof was a triple crowne much lyke the papes This crowne & the hat, were made of the leues of dates trees.
               Within the space of .viii. dayes, thinhabitauntes of the Ilande were baptised excepte one vyllage of Idolaters who wolde not herein obey the kynges commaundement. Wheruppon the Capitayne sent certeyne of his menne thyther, who burnt the towne and erected a crosse in that place bycause the people of the vyllage were gentyles (that is) Idolaters. But if they had byn Moores (that is Machumetistes) they wold haue erected a pyller of stone, bycause the Moores are more stooberne and harder to bee conuerted then are the gentyles.
               When the queene came to the place where shee shuld heare

masse, shee came surth with great pompe and solemnitie, hauynge goinge before her three younge damoselles and three men with theyr cappes in theyr handes,The queenes apparell. whom shee folowed apparelled in whyte and blacke, with a great vayle of sylke vppon her heade fringed abowte with golde, whiche couered her hatte and hunge downe to her shoulders. Shee had also a great trayne of women folowynge her, beinge all barefooted and naked, excepte that vppon theyr heades and priuie partes, they wore certeyne vayles of silke, and hadde theyr heare spredde.
               Before the kynge of Zubut was baptised, he was named Raia Humabuon. When the Capitayne demaunded of hym why all the Idoles in the Ilande were not burnt accordynge to his promesse, he answered that they esteemed thē no more as goddes, but only made sacrifice to theym for the Princes brother who was very sycke, and as noble and wyttie a man as was in the Ilande. The Capitayne answered that if he wolde burne a

                   his Idoles and beleue faythfully in Christ, and bee baptised, he shulde be immediatly restored to health, and that he wolde els gyue them leaue to stryke of his heade. By these woordes and persuasions of the Capitayne, he conceaued such hope of health, that after he was baptised he felt no more greefe of his disease. And this was a manifest myracle wrought in owre tyme wherby dyuers infidels were conuerted to owre fayth,A miracle. and theyr Idoles destroyed, and also theyr altares ouerthrowen on the whiche they were accustomed to eate the sacrifyced flesshe. The people of the Ilande pay the kynge a portion of vittayles for theyr tribute by all theyr cities and vyllages.
               Not farre from this Ilande of Zubut, is the Iland of Mathan,
                  The Iland of Mathan. whose inhabitauntes vse maruelous cerimonies in theyr sacrifices to the soonne and burying the deade. They weare rynges of golde abowt theyr priuie members. The Ilande is gouerned by two Princes wherof the one is named Zula, and the other Cilapulapu. And wheras this Cilapulapu refused to pay tribute to the kynge of Spayne, the Capitayne went ageynst hym in his owne person with .lx. of his menne armed with coates of mayle and helmettes. Cilapulapu diuided his army into three battayles, hauynge in euery battaile two thousand and fiftie men armed with bowes, arrowes, dartes and iauelins

hardened at the poyntes with fyer. This continued longe and sharpe. But the Capitayne beinge a valient man and presynge hym selfe in the brunte of the battayle, was sore wounded and slayne,The capitaine Magellanus is slayne. forasmuch as the moste of the Barbarians directed all theyr force ageynst hym. Besyde the Capitayne, were slayne of owre men abowt .viii. or .ix. Of the Barbarians, were .xv. slayne and many sore wounded. After the death of the Capitayne, they chose two other in his place, of the which one was Odoardo Barbessa a Portugale, and the other Iohn Serrano who was shortely after betrayde by thinterpretour and taken prisoner with dyuers other.
               Certeyne dayes before the Capitaynes death, they hadde knowleage of the Ilandes of Molucca whiche they chiefely sought. Departynge therfore from the Ilande of Mathan, they sayled farre and came to the cape of an other Ilande named Bohol.
                  The Iland of Bohol. In the myddest of this mayne sea (whiche they named Archipelagus) they consulted to burne the shyppe named Conception,They burnte one of theyr shyppes. bycause they were nowe fewe in number, and to furnyshe the other two shyppes with thartillerie therof. Thus directynge theyr course towarde Southewest, they came to an other Ilande named pauiloghon, where they founde blacke men lyke vnto the Sarasins. Shortly after, they arryued at an other great Iland,Blacke men. whose kyng named Raia Calauar, intreated them very frendely in all thynges as dyd the kyng of Messana. This Ilande is ryche in golde, and hath plentie of rysse, gynger, hogges, goates, hennes, and dyuers other thynges. It is named Chippit,

This Ilande is very greate, and in maner vnhabited. The people are moores, and were banyssshed owt of the Ilande of Burnei whiche sum caule Porne.

Beinge therfore ioyfull and gyuyng thankes vnto god, they discharged all theyr ordynaunce. In the coaste of all these Ilandes, euen vnto the Ilandes of Molucca, soundyng with theyr plummet, they founde the deapthe of the sea to bee no lesse then a hundreth and two yardes, which is contrary to the saying of the Portugales who affyrme that no shyppe can passe that way with out great daungioure by reason of the shalownes and rockes or shelues:The Portugales are reproued. and for the darkenesse which the clowdes cause in the heauen.

               FOrasmuch as in dyuers places of this historie, mention is made of precious stones, I haue thought good to declare sumewhat aswell of theyr prices as of the places of theyr generation, that wee may not vtterly bee ignorant of the thinges which we so greately esteeme and bye so deare.
            
               Of the Rubie.
               THe Rubies growe in India: and are founde for the most parte in a ryuer named Pegu. These are of the best kind and fineste, whiche they of the lande of Malabor caule Nunpuclo, and are well soulde if they bee fayre and cleane without spottes. The Indians to know theyr finenesse, put them vppon theyr toonges, coumptynge that to bee best that is couldest and most harde. And to see theyr finenesse, they take them vp with a piece of waxe by the sharpest poynt: and lookynge ageynst the lyght, espie in theim euery smaule spot or flake. They are also founde in certeyne diepe fosses or pittes which are made in mountaynes that are beyonde the said ryuer. They are scoured and made cleane in the countrey of Pegu. Yet can they not square and polyshe them. But for this purpose sende them to dyuers other contreys, and especially to Paleatate, Narsinga, Calicut, and the region of Malabar, where are many cunnynge Lapidaries.
               And to gyue yow intelligence of the value of these stones, ye shall vnderstande that this woorde Fanan, signifiethe a weight sumwhat more then two of owre carattes: And .xi. Fanans and a quarter, is one Mitigal: And .vi. Mitigales and a halfe, make one vnce. This Fanan,One caratte is iiii. graines is also a kynde of money which is in value, one ryale of syluer.

Yet are they very coulde and harde. The perfectesse of theym are greatly esteemed amonge the people of the Ilande, and reserued only for the kynge hym selfe if they bee of any great quantitie.

               THese Diamundes are founde in the fyrste India in a kyngdome of the Moores named Decan, from whense they are brought to other regions. There are also founde other Diamundes whiche are not so good, but sumewhat whyte, and are cauled Diamundes of the newe myne which is in the kyngedome of Narsinga. They of the owlde myne, are not polyshed in India, but in other places. There are made lykewyse in India, other false Diamundes of Rubies, Topases, and whyte Saphires, whiche appere to bee fine: and are also founde in the Ilande of Zeilam. These stones differ in none other, sauynge that they haue loste their naturall colour. Of these, summe are founde that haue halfe the coloure of Rubies, and other of Saphires: other also of the coloure of a Topase. Other haue all these coloures mengeled togyther. They bore a fine hole in these throughe the myddest, wherby they appere lyke the eyes of a catte. Of the whytest, they make many smaule diamundes whiche can not bee knowen from the trewe, sauynge by touchinge of such as are skylfull in that practise. They are soulde by a poyse or weight which they caule Mangiar, which wayeth two Tarre, and two thyrdes, which amount to two thyrdes or thirde partes of one caratte. For foure Tarres, wey one fanan whiche is abowt two carattes.

stone, which the Moores take of in smaule pieces, and carye them to the Iland of Ormus, from whense they are brought to dyuers partes of the worlde by sea and by lande. The Indians caule them Perose. They are soft stones, of smaule weight and not much coulde. And to knowe that they are good and trewe, in the day they shall appere of the verye colour of the Turquesse: and in the nyght by the lyght, they shall appere greene. They that are not so perfect, doo not so change there colour to the sight. If these stones bee cleane and of fine colour, they haue vnderneth in the bottome, a blacke stone, vppon the which they growe. And if any lyttle vayne ryse vppon the sayde stone, it shalbe the better. And to knowe more certeynely that they are trewe Turquesses, they put on the toppes of them a lyttle quicke lime tempered with water after the maner of an oyntment. So that if the quicke lime appere coloured, they are iudged perfecte, and are of value as foloweth.

               SMaragdes growe in the countrey of Babilon, where the Indians caule the sea Dieguan. They grow also in other partes of India. They are stones of fayre greene colour, and are lyght and tender. Of these stones, many are conterfecte. But lookyng on them curiously towarde the lyght, the conterfectes shewe certeyne burbuls, as doot

                   glasse. But in the trewe, there is no such seene. But rather there appeareth to the eye a certeyne verdour shynynge lyke the beames of the soonne. And beinge rubbed vppon the touche stone, they leaue the coloure of copper. And the Smaragde of this sorte is the best and most trewe: And is in value in Calicut, as much as a diamunde and sumwhat more: And this not by weyght, but by greateness, bycause the diamunde quantitie for quantitie, is of greater weyght then the Smaragde. Ther is lykewyse founde an other kynde of Smaragdes, whiche are greene stones, but not so much esteemed. Neuerthelesse, the Indians reserue these to set them foorth with other precious stones. They leaue not any greene coloure vppon the touche.

This Ilande was discouered four score yeares sence by the nauigations of the Portugales and was vnknowen to the owlde wryters. It lyeth in the greate goulfe of Affrike in the .30. degree of longitude from the West to the East, and is in maner rounde. It is of largenesse from side to syde .lx.

And so departed threatenyng to sley the Castilians as many as they shulde fynde in the Ilandes of the Malucas.The Portugales threaten death to the Castilians For they knewe ryght well that theyr contreymen the Portugales had alredy taken the shyppe cauled the Trinitie and had also taken the Castilians in Tidore.

            ¶ The cause and autoritie wherby they diuided the Indies.
            
               THe Castilians and Portugales had longe debated and reasoned abowt the golde myne of Guinea which was found in the yeare of owre lorde 1471,The golde myne of Guinea. in the tyme of the reigne of Don Alonso Kynge of Portugale the firste of that name.Alonso kynge of Portugale.
            
            This was a matter of greate importaunce. For the negros or blacke Moores,Gold for thynges of smaul value. for thynges of no value, gaue golde by hole handefuls whyche was at that tyme when the sayde Kynge of Portugale pretended title and clayme to the kingedome of Castile in the right of his wyfe Queene Iohn (cauled the excellent) ageynste the Catholike princes Isabel and Don Fernando whose it was in deede.Contention for the kyngdome of Cast
                     •
                  le. But that stryfe was ended as sone as Don Fernando had vanquisshed Don Alonso at a place cauled Temulos not farre from Toro, which place Don Fernando chose rather to make warre ageinst the Moores of Granada,warre agenst the Moores of Granada. then to bye and sell with the blacke Moores of Guinea. And thus the Portugales remained with the conquest of Affryke from the streightes forwarde:The conquestes of the Portugales in Affrike. whiche began where the infante of Portugale Don Henrique (sonne to kynge Iohn the bastarde and master of Auis) dyd bebynne to enlarge it. When pope Alexander the .vi. (beinge a valentinian borne) had knowleage hereof,Pope Alexander. he mynded to gyue the Indies to the kinges of Castile withowt any preiudice to the Portugales who had conquered the sea coastes of Affryke.

These Indies, the pope gaue of his owne mynde withowte the motion of anye other, with this burden and charge that they shulde conuert the Idolatours to the faythe of Chryste: And commaunded a line or meridian to bee drawen Northe and south from one hundreth leaques Westwarde beyond one of the Ilandes of Cabo Uerde towarde the Weste,The pope maketh the diuision. bycause the Spanyardes shulde not meddle in Affryke perteynynge to the conquest of the Portugales, to thauoydynge of all stryfe betw

               ne them. Kynge Iohn of Portugale,The kynge of Portugale refuseth to stand to the Popes bull. the seconde of that name, was greatly offended when he redde the bull and donation of the pope, althowgh his owne ambassadours had made the selfe same request vnto his holynesse. He also found hym selfe agreeued with the Catholyke princes Isabell and Fernando, that they had shortened the course of the landes he had discouered, depriuynge hym of the rychesse which belonged to hym. And therfore refused to stande to the popes bull in this case: desyrynge the Catholyke princes Isabell and Fernando to graunt him three hundreth leaques more to the Weste, besyde the one hundreth which they had graunted before: and therwith sent his shyppes to kepe the coastes of Affryke. The princes Catholyke were content to satisfie his mynde and to please hym accordynge to theyr gentle nature and for the aliance that was betwene theym: And in fine, with the consent and agreement of the pope,The agreement of the last diuision graunted twoo hundrech .lxx. leaques more then the bull made mention of: At Tordefillas the .vii. day of Iune, in the yeare of owr lord 1494. And wheras owr kynges thought that they shulde haue lost grounde in grauntynge so many leaques that way, they woonne by that meanes the Ilandes of the Malucas with many other ryche Ilandes. The kynge of Portugale also, herein deceaued him selfe or was deceaued of his whom he put in trust,wherin the Portugales were deceaued. hauynge no certeyne knowleage of the situation of the Ilandes of the riche Spicery in demaundyng that which the kynge dyd demaunde. For it hadde byn better for hym to haue requested the three hundreth and .lxx. leaques rather Eastwarde from the Ilandes of Cabo Uerde then towarde the west. And yet for all that, I doubte whether the Malucas shulde haue faulen within his conquest accordynge to the ordinarie accoumpte and dimension which the pylotes and Cosmographers doo make. And after this maner they

diuided the Indies betwene them by thautoritie of the pope for the auoydynge of further stryfe and contention.
         
         
            
               ❧ Howe and by what occasion Themperoure layde the Ilandes of the Malucas to pledge to the kynge of Portugale.
            
               WHen the kynge of Portugale Don Iuan the thyrde of that name, had knowleage that the Cosmographers and pylottes of Castile hadde drawen the line from the place before named, and that he could not denye the truth, fearing also therby to liese the trade of Spices, made sute and request to Themperoure that he shulde not send furth Loaisa nor Sebastian Cabote to the Malucas,Sebastian Cabote. and that the Castilians shulde not attempte the trade of spices nor see such euyls and miseries as his capitaynes had shewed in those Ilandes to them that aduentured that viage with Magalanes. Which thynge he greatly couered, although he payde all the charges of those two fleetes, and made other great bargens. In the meane tyme, Themperoure maryed the Lady Isabell syster to kynge Iohn: and kynge Iohn maryed the lady Catharine syster to Themperour:Themperour and the kinge of portugale ioyned i

                   aliance by mariage. whereby this matter waxed coulde although the kynge ceased not to speake hereof, euer mouynge the particion. Themperour by the meanes of a certeine Biscaine that was with Magallanes in the gouernours shyppe, had knowleage what the Portugales had doone to the Castilians in the Iland of Tidore,The portugales robbe the Castilians wherof he tooke great displeasure, and brought the sayde maryner face to face before thambassadours of Portugale, who denyed all that he sayde, one of them beinge the chiefe capitayne and gouernour of India when the Portugales tooke the Castilians in Tidore and robbed them of theyr Cloues and Cinamome and such other thynges as they had in the shyppe named the Trinitie. But as the kynge of Portugales trade was greate, and owre necessitie greater, in the meane tyme Themperoure (who was nowe goinge into Italie to bee crowned in the yeare .1529) gagied the Malucas and the spicerie to the kynge of PortugaleThe coronation of Themperour.
               
for three hundreth and fiftie thousande ducades withowt any tyme determyned otherwyse then the controuersie was defined vppon the brydge of the ryuer of Caya:The gageing of the Ilands of Malucas. zamatra and Malaca. for the which thynge, kynge Iohn punyshed the licentiate Azeuedo bycause he payde the money withowt declaration of the time. The couenaunt of the pledge was blyndely made and greatly ageynst the myndes of the Castilians, as men that wel vnderstode the profite, commoditie, and rychesse of that trade: Affirmynge that the trade of spices myght haue byn rented for one yeare or for two, for syxe tymes as much as the kinge gaue for it. Peter Ruiz of Uillegas who was twyse cauled to the bargeyne, as once at Granada and an other tyme at Madrid, sayde that it had byn muche better to haue pledged Estremadura or Serena, or other greater landes and cities, rather then the Malucas, Zamatra, or Malaca, or other riche landes and ryuers in the Easte not yet well knowen: forasmuche as it maye so chaunce, that eyther by continuaunce of tyme, or aliance, the pledge myght bee forgotten as thowgh it perteyned to the ryght of Portugale. In fine, Themperour considered not the iewel that he pledged, nor the kyng what he receaued. Themperour was often tymes counsayled to release the pledge of those Ilandes in cōsideration of the great vantage he myght haue therby in fewe yeares. Furthermore, in the yeare .1548. the procuratoures of Cortes being in Ualladolid, made peticion to Themperour to surrender the spice

But Themperour beinge then in Flaunders, sente woorde to the counsayle that they shulde not assēt to Cortes his request, nor speake any more hereof. Wherat, sum marueyled, other were sory, & all held theyr peace.

From whense directynge owre course towarde the South pole by the Southwest, we sawe no more land for the space of three moonethes and three dayes. Of whiche tyme durynge .xl. dayes, we had cruell fortune: In so muche that for that space,A tempest. the heauen in maner neuer ceased thunderyng rorynge, and lyghtenynge with terrible noyse, and fearefull syghtes of fyery exhalations flyinge abowt in the ayer, and in maner continuall showers of rayne with darke clowdes couerynge the heauen in such sorte that aswell in the day as in the nyght we coulde see none otherwyse but as when the moone giueth no lyght by reason of thicke and darke clowds The sea was in lyke case vnquieted with surgies and monsters. After these greuous & cruel days, it plesed god to haue cōpassion on owr liues. For wee suddenly espied land wherby we recouered owr spirites and strength. This land which wee founde, is from Capo Uerde .700. leaques, although Isuppose that we sayled more then .800. by reason of the cruel tempest and ignoraunce of the Pylottes and mariners whereby wee were lyke to haue byn cast away.The ignorance of Pylots and mariners. For wee were in suche daungerous places wanderynge in vnknowen coastes, that if I had not byn skylfull in the science of Cosmographie we had suerly peryshed,The vse of Cosmographie. forasmuch as there was not one pylot that knewe where wee were by the space of fiftie leaques.

This firme lande begynneth beyonde the Equinoctiall line .viii. degrees towarde the pole Antartike. Wee sayled so farre by the sayde coaste that wee passed the wynter Tropyke towarde the pole Antartike by xvii. degrees and a halfe,The pole Antartike. where we had the Horizontal line eleuate fiftie degrees. Such thynges as I sawe there, are not yet knowen to men of owre tyme: as the people, theyr customes and maners, the fertilitie of the lande, the goodnes of the ayer, the fauourable influence of heauen and the planettes, and especially the order of the starres of the eyght sphere in the inferioure hemispherie or lower halfe circle of heauen towarde and abowt the South pole,The starre

Amonge other, I sawe three starres cauled Canopi, wherof two were exceadynge cleare, and the thyrde sumwhat darke. The pole Antartike hath nother the greate beare nor the lyttle as is seene abowte owre pole.Notable stars in the inferiour hemispherie.

After these, succeade three other shynynge starres, whereof that which is in the myddest, is of measure .xii. degrees and a halfe in circumference.Most bright and shynynge starres. And in the myddest of these, is seene an other bryght Canopus. After this, folowe .vi. other shynynge starres which in bryghtnesse passe al other that are in the eyght sphere. Of these, that that is in the middest in the superficiall part of the sayde sphere, hath the measure of his circumference .xxxii. degrees. After these foloweth an other great Canopus, but sumwhat darke. All these are seene in the parte of heauen cauled Via Lactea,

But Aristotle in his booke intiteled Meteora,

All which summe, maketh the number of .lxxxx. beinge the fourth part of the greatest circle accordynge to the trewe reason of the number tawght by the owlde autours. And by this demonstration it is manifest that wee measured the fourth parte of the worlde: Forasmuch as we that dwell in Lisbona on this syde the Equinoctial line abowt .xl. degrees towarde the Northe, sayled frome thense lxxxx. degrees in lengthe meridionale angularly by an ouerthwart line, to thinhabitantes .l. degrees beyond the Equinoctiall.

For by theyr inuasions were extinguyshed all artes and sciences, and all trades of Marchaundies that were vsed in dyuers partes of the worlde.

For speakynge of the greatnesse and ryches of the citie of Alexandria in Egypte (gouerned then as a prouince of the Romanes) he wryteth thus.

The first that attempted this thynge, was Sesostre kynge of Egypte: and after hym Darius kynge of the Persians, whome Tolomeus folowed,The largenesse and lengthe of the trenche. who made a trenche a hundreth foote large, & .xxx. foote diepe, beinge three hundreth myles in lengthe vnto the lakes named Amari, and durste proceade no further for feare of inundation, hauynge knoweleage that the redde sea was hygher by three cubites then al the countrey of Egypt. Other say that this was not the cause: but that he doubted that yf he shulde haue let the sea coome any further, all the water of Nilus shulde haue byn therby corrupted, which onely mynystreth drynke to all Egypte. But notwithstandynge all these thynges aforesayde, all this vyage is frequented by lande

from Egypte to the redde sea,The viage bilande from Egypte to the red sea. in which passage are three causeis or hyghe wayes. The fyrst begynneth at the mouth of Nilus named Pelusio. All which way is by the sandes: In so much that if there were not certeyne hyghe reedes fyxt in the earth to shewe the ryght way, the causei coulde not be founde by reason the wynde euer couereth it with sande. The second causei is two myles from the mountayne Cassius. And this also in thende of .lx. myles, commeth vppon the way or causey of Pelusius, inhabited with certeyne Arabians cauled Antei. The thyrde begynneth at Gerro, named Adipson: and passeth by the same Arabians, for the space of .lx. myles sumwhat shorter, but full of rowgh mountaynes and great scarsenesse of water.

This Ptolomeus was the fyrst that searched al that parte of the red sea which is cauled Trogloditica. Of this trenche described of Strabo and Plinie, there are seene certeyne tokens remaynynge at this present as they affirme which haue byn at Sues beyonde the citie of Alcayr otherwyse cauled Babylon in Egypte. But the marchauntes that of later dayes trauayle this viage by lande, ryde through the dry & baren desertes on camels both by day and by night: directynge theyr way by the starres and compase as do maryners on the sea, and caryinge with them water sufficient for many dayes iorneys.Alcayre. The places of Arabie and India named of Strabo and Plinie,The viage to Easte Indya frequented in owlde tyme. are the selfe same where the Portugales practise theyr trade at this daye, as the maners and customes of the Indians doo yet declare.The custōes and maners of the Indyans. For euen at this presente theyr women vse to burne theym selues alyue with the deade bodies of theyr husbandes. Which thynge (as wryteth Strabo in his .xv. booke) they dyd in owlde tyme by a lawe, for this consideration that sumtyme being in loue with other they forsooke or poysoned theyr husbandes. And forasmuch as accordynge to this custome, the owlde poete Propertius (who lyued abowt a hundreth yeares before thincarnation of Chryst) hath in his boke made mention of the contention that was amonge the Indian women which of them shuld bee burned aliue with theyr husbandes, I haue thought good to subscribe his verses, whiche are these.

Then taking the globe in his hande, he made demonstration that this vyage shulde bee very shorte in respect of that which the Portugales nowe folowe, and also of that which the Spanyardes may attempte to the Ilandes of Moluca. He declared further more that the citie of Lubyke beinge rych and of great poure,The citie of Lubyke. and situate vppon the sea of Germanie, and also accustomed with continuall nauigations to trauayle the sea of Norwaye and Gothlande, and lykewyse the ryght noble kynge of Polonie whose dominions with his realme of Lituania,The kyng of Polanie. extende to the sayde sea, shulde be apte to discouer this secreate: But that aboue all other, the duke of Moscouia,The duke of Moscouia. shulde performe the same with greater commoditie and more facilitie then any other Prince. And here steyinge a whyle, he began to speake ageyne and sayde. Nowe forasmuch as we are coome to this passe, mee thynke it shulde seeme a great discurtesie if I shuld not shewe yowe all that I knowe as touchynge this vyage, wherof I greatly mused with my selfe many yeares by occasion of the woordes of Plinie. Whereas therefore beinge a younge man, I was in Germanie in the citie of Augusta, it so chaunsed that in those dayes there came thyther an ambasadour of the duke of Moscouia,An ambassadour from the duke of Moscouia. a man singularly learned both in the Greeke toonge and the Latine, and of good experience in worldely thynges, hauyng byn sent to dyuers places by the sayde Prince, and one of his counsayle. Of whose learnyng beinge aduertised, I sought his acquayntaunce. And talkynge with hym one day of these Indians dryuen by fortune to the coastes of Germanie, and of the vyage that myght bee discouered by the North sea to the Ilandes of spices, I perceaued that at the fyrste he marueyled exceadyngely, as at a thynge that he coulde neuer haue imagined. But restynge a

whyle in maner astonysshed in his secreate phantasie, he toke great pleasure therin, and sayde.The woordes of thambassadour of Moscouia Forasmuch as the Portugales haue nowe compased abowt all the south partes supposed in owlde tyme to bee inaccessable by reason of great heate, why shulde wee not certeinely thynke that the lyke maye bee done abowt this parte of the north withowt feare of coulde, especially to men borne & brought vp in that clime? Yet procedyng further, he said, that if his Prince and master, had men that wolde animate hym to discouer this vyage, there was no Prince in Christendome that myght do it with more facilitie. Then caulynge for a mappe in which was the description of Moscouia and the prouinces subiecte to the same,The way frō Moscouia to the north Ocean & Cathay. he declared that from the citie of Moscouia or Mosca going towarde the northeast for the space of .lx. myles, they come to the ryuer of Uolochda,Uolochda. and afterwarde by that, and folowyng the course therof, to the citie of Usting,Ustiug. so cauled bycause the ryuer of Iug fauleth into the ryuer of Succana,Succana. where they lose theyr owne names and make the great ryuer Duina:Duina. And by that, leauyng on the ryght hande the citie of Colmogor,Coimogor. they sayle vnto the north Ocean.The north Ocean. The which waye, althoughe it bee a longe tracte, as more then .800. myles, neuerthelesse he sayde that in sommer it myght commodiously bee sayled: And that wheras it fauleth into the sea, there are infinite woods of goodly trees apte to make shyppes.Greate wooddes. And the place so conuenient for this purpose, that shipwryghtes and other skylful workemen for all thynges hereunto apperteynynge, may easely coome owt of Germanie. Also that the men which are vsed to trauayle the sea of Germanie abowte the coastes of Gothlande,Gothlande. shulde bee best and most apte to attempte this enterpryse, bycause they are indurate to abyde coulde, hunger, and laboure. He sayde furthermore, that in the court of his Prince, they haue much knowleage of the great cane of Cathay,The Moscouites haue knowleage of the greate cane of Cathay. by reason of the continuall warres they haue with the Tartars, of whō the greatest part gyue obedience to the said great Cane as to theyr chiefe Emperoure.

He also affirmed, that if shippes shulde bee made on the coastes of the sayde sea, and sayle on the backe halfe of the coast therof (which he knewe by many relations made to his Prince, to reach infinitely toward the northeast) they stulde doubtelesse in folowynge the same, easely discouer that countrey. Unto these woordes he added, that although there were greate difficultie in Moscouia,Difficult trauaylynge in Moscoula. by reason that the waye to the sayde sea is full of thicke wooddes and waters which in the sommer make great marysshes and impossible to bee trauayled, aswell for lacke of vyttayles whiche can not there bee founde, not for certeyne dayes, but for the space of certeyne monethes, the place beinge desolate withowt inhabitauntes, neuerthelesse he sayde that yf there were with his Prince, only two Spanyardes or Portugales to whome the charge of this vyage shulde bee commytted,Commendation of the Spania

And I remember that when I was in Flaunders in Themperours courte,The discouerynge of the northwest partes. I sawe his letter wrytten in the yeare .1541. and dated from Mexico: wherin was declared howe towarde the northwest, he had fownd the kyngedome of Sette Citta (that is) Seuen Cities, whereas is that cauled Ciuola by the reuerend father Marco da Riza: & howe beyonde the sayde kyngedome yet further towarde the Northwest, Capitayne Francesco Uasques of Coronado, hauynge ouerpassed great desertes,Shyps saylynge from Cathay by the north hyperboreā sea to the coastes of the northwest part of the lande of Baccaleos. came to the sea syde where he found certeyne shyppes which sayled by that sea with marchaundies, and had in theyr baner vppon the proos of theyr shyppes, certeyne foules made of golde and syluer which they of Mexico caule Alcatrazzi: And that theyr mariners shewed by signes that they were .xxx. dayes saylynge in commynge to that hauen: wherby he vnderstode that these shippes could bee of none other countrey then of Cathay,Cathay. forasmuch as it is situate on the contrary parte of the sayde lande discouered.

And doubtlesse yf the Frenche men in this theyr newe Fraunce, wolde haue passed by lande towarde the sayd northwest and by north, they shuld also haue founde the sea wherby they myght haue sayled to Cathay. But aboue all thynges, this seemed vnto me moste woorthy of commendation,A notable booke. that the sayde master Antonie wrote in his letter that he had made a booke of al the natural

and marueylous thynges whiche they founde in searchynge those countreys, with also the measures of landes and altytudes of degrees: A worke doubtlesse which sheweth a princely and magnificall mynde, wherby wee may conceaue that yf god had gyuen hym the charge of the other hemispherie, he wolde or nowe haue made it better knowen to vs. The which thynge, I suppose no man doth greatly esteeme at this time: beinge neuerthelesse the greatest and most glorious enterprise that may bee imagined.A great and glorious enterprise.
            
            And here makynge a certeyne pause, and turnynge hym selfe towarde vs, he sayde: Doo yow not vnderstande to this purpose howe to passe to India toward the northwest wind, as dyd of late a citizen of Uenese, so valiente a man, and so well practysed in all thynges perteynynge to nauigations and the science of Cosmographie, that at this present he hath not his lyke in Spayne, in so much that for his vertues he is preferred aboue all other pylottes that sayle to the west Indies,Sebastian Cabote the grād pylot of the west Indies. who may not passe thyther withowt his licence, and is therfore cauled Piloto Maggiore (that is) the graunde pylote. And when wee sayde that wee knewe him not, he proceaded, sayinge, that beinge certeyne yeares in the citie of Siuile,Commendation of Sebastian Cabote. and desyrous to haue sum knowleage of the nauigations of the Spanyardes, it was toulde hym that there was in the citie a valient man, a Uenecian borne, named Sebastian Cabote,Sebastian Cabote tould me that he was borne in Brystowe, & that at .iiii. yeare owld he was caried with his father to Uenice and so returned ageyne into England with his father after certeyne yeares: Wher by he was thought to haue bin born in Uenice. who had the charge of those thynges, being an expert man in that science, and one that coulde make cardes for the sea with his owne hande. And that by this reporte, seekynge his acquaintaunce, he founde hym a very gentell person, who enterteyned hym frendly and shewed him many thynges, and amonge other a large mappe of the worlde with certeine particular nauigations aswell of the Portugales as of the Spanyardes. And that he spake further vnto hym, in this effecte. When my father departed from Uenese many yeares sence to dwell in Englande to folowe the trade of marchaundies, he tooke me with him to the citie of London whyle I was very yonge, yet hauynge neuerthelesse sum knowleage of letters of humanitie and of the sphere. And when my father dyed in that tyme when newes were browght that Don Christopher Colonus Genuese, had discouered the coastes of India, whereof was great talke in all the courte of kynge Henry the seuenth

who then reigned: In so much that all men with great admiration affirmed it to bee a thynge more diuine then humane, to sayle by the Weste into the East where spices growe, by a way that was neuer knowen before. By which fame and reporte, there increased in my harte a greate flame of desyre to attempte sum notable thynge. And vnderstandyng by reason of the sphere, that if I shulde sayle by the way of the northwest wynde, I shulde by a shorter tracte coomme to India, I thereuppon caused the kynge to bee aduertised of my diuise, who immediatly commaunded two carauels to bee furnysshed with all thynges apperteynynge to the vyage,The fyrst vyage of Sebastian Cabote. which was as farre as I remember, in the yeare .1496. in the begynnynge of sommer. Begynnyng therfore to saile towarde Northwest, not thynkyng to fynde any other lande then that of CATHAY, and from thense to turne towarde India. But after certeine dayes, I founde that the lande ranne towarde the Northe, which was to me a great displeasure. Neuerthelesse, sayling alonge by the coast to see if I could fynde any goulfe that turned, I founde the lande styll continent to the .56. degree vnder owre pole. And seinge that there the coast turned toward the East, dispayringe to fynd the passage, I turned backe ageyne, and sayled downe by the coast of that lande towarde the Equinoctiall (euer with intent to fynde the sayde passage to India) and came to that parte of this firme lande whiche is nowe cauled FLORIDA.

Where, my vyttayles fayling, I departed from thense and returned into England, where I founde great tumultes amonge the people, and preparaunce for warres in Scotlande: by reason whereof, there was no more consideration had to this vyage: Wheruppon I wente into Spayne to the Catholyke kynge,The seconde vyage of Cabote to the land of Brasile, and Rio

After this, I made many other vyages which I now pretermitte. And wexynge owlde, I gyue my selfe to rest from such trauayles bycause there are nowe many younge and lusty pylotes and mariners of good experience, by whose forwardenesse I doo reioyse in the frutes of my labours, and rest with the charge of this office as yowe see. And this is as much as I haue vnderstoode of master Sebastian Cabote, as I haue gathered owte of dyuers nauigations wrytten in the Italian toonge.
            And whereas I haue before made mention howe Moscouia was in owr tyme discouered by Richard Chanceler in his viage toward Cathai by the direction and information of the sayde master Sebastian who longe before had this secreate in his mynde,The vyage to Moscouia. I shall not neede here to describe that viage, forasmuche as the same is largely and faythfully written in the Laten tonge by that lerned young man Clement Adams scole mayster to the Queenes henshemen, as he receaued it at the moutht of the sayde Richard Chanceler. Neuerthelesse I haue thought good here to speake sumwhat of Moscouia as I haue redde in the booke of Iohn Faber written in the Latin toonge to the ryght noble Prynce Ferdinando Archeduke of Austria and Infant of Spaine,The hystory
                     •
                   of Moscouia of the maners and religion of the Moscouites, as he was partely instructed by the ambasadours of the duke of Moscouie sent into Spayne to Themperours maiestie in the yeare .M.D.XX.V. He wryteth therfore as foloweth.
            I thynke it fyrste conueniente to speake sumewhat of the name of this region wherby it is cauled at this day,The dyuer

                   names of Moscouia. and how it was cauled in owlde tyme. Conferrynge therfore the moste ancient of the Greeke and latine monumentes with the histories of later tyme, I perceaue it to bee a thynge which requireth no smaule iudgement of wytte and lernynge. For we see in howe shorte tyme the names of thynges are chaunged, as are also the maners of men. I fynde therfore that those people whom at this day wee commonly caule Moscouites, were in tyme past (as wytnesseth Plinie) cauled Roxolani,
               Roxolani. whom neuerthelesse by chaungynge one letter, Ptolomie in his

            They were also many yeares cauled Rutheni:
               Rutheni. And are that people which sumtyme fought manfully ageynst the Capitaynes

of Methridates as Strabo wryteth. They were cauled Moscouites of the chiefe citie of al the prouince named Moscouia or Mosca: or (as Uolaterane saith) of the riuer Mosco.The ryuer Mosco. They were sumtyme gouerned by duke Iohan, whose wyfe was Helena of the lynage of Themperours of Constanstinople of the noble famelie of the Paleologi. Beyonde these Roxolanos, Strabo sayth there is no lande inhabited. These Ruthenians therfore or Moscouites, are people of the northeaste parte of the worlde from vs: And are determined with the limettes of the great ryuer Boristhenes of Scithia,The ryuer Boristhenes. on the one syde with the Lituanians and Polonians, and on the other syde with the Tartars who cease not to vexe them with continuall warres and incursions. Especially the great Emperour Cham of Cathay the chiefe Prince of the Tartars,Themperour of Cathay. residente by the sea syde in Taurito Chersoneso, molesteth theim with sore warres. They are towarde the north syde inclosed with the frosen sea,The frosē sea the lande of whose coastes beinge verye large, perteyneth in maner all to the dominion of the duke of Moscouie. This sea is it which the owlde wryters caule Lacus Cronicus,
               Lacus Cronicus. so named of the Greeke worde Cronos, which the Latines caule Saturnus whom they fayne to bee an owlde man,Saturnus. of complexion coulde and slowe, and thereby name all such thynges as are coulde and slowe, Cronica, as by lyke reason they dyd this northe sea which beinge in maner euer frosen, is slowe and coulde and in maner immouable. And for lyke consideration (as saythe Plinie) Hethens nameth it in the Scythian toonge, Amaltheum,Amaltheum. whiche woorde signifieth as muche as congeled or frosen. But that I wander not farre frome my purpose: Thempire and dominion of the duke of Moscouie recheth so farre that it comprehendeth certeyne partes of Asia and also of Europe.The dominiō of the duke of Moscouia.

Also Blescouia, Nouogradia, Smolne, and Otifer, al which, theyr ambassadours affirme to bee of princely and magnificall buyldynges, and strongely defended with waules bothe of brycke and square stone. Of these, Blescouia is strongest and enuironed with three waules. Other which they haue innumerable are not so famous as are these wherof this duke of Moscouie

And this is the tytle whereby the sayde ambassadours saluted yowre maiestie in the name of great Basilius when they began theyr oration.Duke Basilius. This prince of Moscouie hath vnder hym princes of many prouinces and those of great poure: Of the which, that owlde whyte bearded man whom this Emperour of the Ruthians sente for his ambassadoure to Themperours maiestie into Spayne,Their poure. is not one of the least. For euen he when necessitie of warre requyreth, is accustomed to make for his Emperour a bande of .xxx thousande horsemen. But this is to theyr singular commendation that they are so obedient to theyr prince in al thynges,Theyr obedience to theyr prince. that beinge sommoned by hym by neuer so meane an hearald, they obey incōtinent as if it were to god,Theyr wars & conquestes. thynkynge nothyng more glorious then to dye in the quarell of theyr prince. By reason of which obedience, they are able in short tyme, to assemble an army of two or three hundreth thousande men ageynst theyr enemies eyther the Tartars or the greate Cham: And haue hereby obteyned great victories and triumphes aswell ageynst the Turkes as the Tartars by the exceadyng multitude of theyr horsemen and continual experience in warres. At such time as Themperour Maximilian made a league with them, they kept warre ageynst the kynge of Polonie.Gunnes. They vse not only bowes and dartes after the maner of the Parthians, but haue also the vse of gunnes as we haue. And to bee briefe, onely the Moscouites maye seeme that nation whiche hath not felte the commodities of peace:On

Uolaterane wryteth that the Ruthenians vse money vncoyned.Theyr money And inquirynge further, I was informed that the money of Hungary is much currant with them. But this is chiefely to bee consydered,They ēbrase the Christian fayth whiche thei receaued of the Apostles. that they imbrase the Christian fayth which they affirme to haue byn preached to them fyrste by saynt Andrewe thappostle and broother to Simon Peter. Such doctrine also as vnder Constanstine the greate, in the yeare .CCC.xviii. was concluded in the fyrst generall counsayle holden in the citie of Nicene in Bithynia,The coūsaile of Nicene. and there determyned by .CCC.xviii. bysshoppes, and also such as hath byn wrytten and tawght by the Greeke doctoures Basilius Magnus and Chrisostomus,Basilius Magnus.

Before the patriarche of Constantinople was oppressed by the Tiranni of the Turkes,The patriarke of Constantinople. this Archebysshoppe recognised hym as his superioure. In so much that this duke of Moscouia and Emperour

of Russia, not vnmyndefull hereof but a diligente obseruer of his accustomed religion, dooth at this daye yearely sende a certeyne stypende in maner of almes to the patriarche of Constantinople,A notable exemple of a Christian prince. that he may with more quiete mynd looke for thende of this his Egiptian seruitude vntyll it shal please almyghty god to restore hym to his former churche and autoritie. For he iudgeth it much impietie, if he shulde nowe forsake hym whose predicessoures haue ruled and gouerned so many churches, and of whom the fayth and religion of so many regions and prouinces haue depended.
            But to speake briefely of theyr religion,Theyr religion. they agree in many thynges with vs, and in sum thynges folow the Greekes. They haue munkes and religious men.

Such as committe adulterie or fornication, are greeuously punysshed by the bysshoppes and depriued of the benefices.Masse. They celebrate masse after the maner of the Greekes which differeth from owres in dyuers thinges,A mysterie. as in fermented breade after the maner of the Greekes. They put in the chalesse as much water as redde wine, which water they vse to heate, bycause (not withowt a great mysterie) there isshewed furth of the syde of owre lorde, both blud and water, which wee ought by good reason to thynke was not withowt heate: for els shulde it scarsely haue byn iudged for a miracle.The primatiue church. In fine, they affirme that all theyr customes and rytes are accordynge to thinstitutions of the primatyue church and the doctrine of Basilius Magnus, and Chrisostomus.A straunge custome. In this thynge they dyffer greately from vs, that they minister the communion to younge children of three yeares of age, which they doo with fermented breade dipte in a sponefull of wyne, and gyue it them for the bodye and bludde of Chryste.

the bowes of trees, so that it shall not bee necessarie to caule them togyther or charme theym with the sounde of basens. There are oftentymes founde greate masses of hony combes, conserued in trees of the owlde hony forsaken of bees, forasmuch as the husband men can not seeke euery tree in so great and large wooddes: In so much that in the stockes or bodies of exceadynge great and holowe trees, are sumtymes founde great pooles or lakes of hony. Demetrius thambassadour of the duke of Moscouia whom he sent to the bysshop of Rome not many yeares sence,Lakes or pooles of hony. made relation that a husbande man of the contrey not farre from the place where he remayned, seekynge in the wooddes for hony, descended into a greate hollowe tree full of hony into the which he slypte vp to the brest,A man almost drowned in hony. and lyued there only with hony for the space of two dayes, caulynge in vayne for helpe in that deserte of wooddes. And that in fine dispayrynge of helpe, he escaped by a marueilous chaunce,A marueilous chaunce. beinge drawen owt by a great beare that descended into the tree, with her loynes downewarde after the maner of men. For when the man (as present necessitie and oportunitie serued) perceaued the beare to bee within his reache, he suddeinly clasped her abowt the loynes with his armes, and with a terrible crye prouoked the beast to inforce her strength to leape owt of the tree, and therwith to drawe hym owt, as it chaunced in deede.
            These regions abounde with beares whiche euery where seeke both hony and bees,Beares feede of hony and bees. not only herewith to fyl theyr bellies, but also to helpe theyr syght. For theyr eyes are oftentymes dulled, and theyr mouthes wounded of the bees: both which greefes are eased by eatynge of hony. They haue weakest heades, as lions haue strongest. In so muche that when (beinge therto inforced) they caste theim selues downe headelonge from any rockes, they couer theyr heades with theyr fiete, and lye for a tyme astoonysshed and halfe deade with knockes.

            Before fiue hundreth yeares, the Moscouites honoured the goddes of the gentyles:The religion of the Moscouites. And then fyrste receaued the Christian faith when the bysshoppes of Grecia began to discent from the churche of the Latines: and therfore receaued the rites of the Greekes. They minister the sacrament with fermented breade vnder both kyndes: And thinke that the soules of deade menne are not helped with the suffragies of preestes, nor yet by the deuotion of theyr frendes or kinsfolkes: Also that the place of Purgatorie is a fable. In the tyme of the diuine seruice, the hystorie of the miracles of Christe and the Epistels of saynt Paule are rehearsed owt of the pulpitte. Beyonde Moscouia, are manye people whiche they caule Scythians, and are partely subiecte to the Prince of Moscouia.The Scythians subiecte to the duke of Moscouia. These are they which duke Iuan subdued, as are the people of Perm, Baskird, Czriremissa, Iuhra, Corela, and Permska. These people were Idolatours before the duke compelled theym to baptisme, and appoynted a bysshop ouer them named Steuen, whom the Barbarians after the

departure of the duke, fleyde alyue and slewe. But the duke returnyng shortly after, afflicted them sore and assigned them a newe bysshoppe.
            It is here also to bee noted that the owlde Cosmographers fayned that in these regions towarde the Northe pole, there shuld bee certeyne great mountaynes which they cauled Ripheos & Hyperboreos, which neuerthelesse are not founde in nature. It is also a fable that the ryuers of Tanais and Uolham doo sprynge owt of hygh mountaynes,It was then an opinion that al riuers spronge owte of montaines wheras it is apparent that both these ryuers and many other, haue theyr originall in the playnes.

                  e of much hony in could regiōs▪ Gummes and spices in hot countreys.And forasmuche as many doo maruaile that suche plentie of hony shuld bee in so coole a contrey, I haue thought good to declare the reason and naturall cause hereof. It is therefore to be considered that lyke as spices, gums, & odoriferous frutes are engendered in hot regions by continuall heate duryng al the hole yeare withowt impression of the mortifying qualitie of could wherby al thynges are constrayned as they are dilated by heate,Floures in coulde regiōs euen so in could & moyst regions (whose moysture is thinner & more waterysshe then in hot regions) are dowres engendered more abundantly as caused by impression of lesse and faynter heate woorkynge in thynne matter

of waterysshe moisture lesse concocte then the matter of gummes and spices and other vnctuous frutes and trees growing in hotte regions. For althoughe (as Munster saithe here before) the region of Moscouia beareth nother vines or oliues, or any other frutes of sweete sauoure by reason of the couldenesse therof, neuerthelesse forasmuch as floures (wherof hony is chiefely gathered) may in sommer season growe abundantly in the playnes,Floures of trees. marysshes, and wooddes, not onely on the grownde but also on trees in coulde regions, it is agreeable to good reason that great plentie of honye shulde bee in suche regions as abounde with floures, which are brought furthe with the fyrst degree of heate and fyrst approch of the sonne, as appeareth in the sprynge tyme not onely by the springinge of floures in fyeldes and gardeynes, but also of blossomes of trees spryngynge before the leaues or frute,Blossoomes of trees. as the lyghter and thynner matter fyrste drawne owte with the loweste and leaste degree of heate,An exemple of the degrees of heate. as the lyke is seene in the arte of styllynge wherby all thinne and lyght moystures are lyfted vp by the fyrste degree of the fyre: and the heuyest and thickest moystures are drawne owt with more vehement fyre. As we may therfore in this case compare the generation of floures to the heate of May,The generation of floures by moderate heate. the generation of gummes to the heate of Iune and spices to the heate of Iuly. Euen so in suche coulde regions whose soommer agreeth rather with the temperate heate and moysture of May then with thextreeme heate of the other monethes, that heate is more apt to brynge foorth abundance of floures as thynges caused by moderate heate, as playnely appeareth by theyr tast and sauoure in which is no sharpe qualitie of heate eyther bytynge the toonge or offendyng the head as is in spices, gummes, and frutes of hotte regions. And as in could and playne regions, moderate heate with abundance of moisture, are causes of the generation of floures (as I haue sayde) so lykewyse the length of the dayes and shortnesse and warmenesse of the nyghtes in sommer season in suche coulde reg

Cardanus wryteth in his booke De Plantis, that bramble & fearne growe not but in could regions,Bramble and ferne. as dooth wheate in temperate regions. And that spices and hotte seedes,Spices. can not growe in coulde regions, forasmuch as beinge of thinne substaunce, they shulde soone be mortified & extinct by excessiue could. For (as he sayth) nothing

can concocte, rype, and attenuate the substance of frutes with owt the helpe of ayer agreable to the natures of such thynges as are brought foorth in the same, althowgh it may doo this in rootes. But in maner all floures are of sweete sauour,The sauoure o

            Plinie, althowgh in the .xi. booke of his naturall hystorie. Cap. viii. he wryteth that hony is gathered of the floures of all trees and settes or plantes,what plinie wryteth of hony. except sorell and the herbe cauled Chenopode (whiche sume caule goose foote) yet he affirmeth that it descendeth from the ayer: for in the .xii. chapyture of the same booke, he wryteth thus.

By the whiche woordes of Plinie, and by the principles of naturall philosophie, it dooth appere that abundaunce of hony shulde chiefely bee engendered in such regions where the heate of

soommer is temperate and continuall aswell by nyght as by day as it is not in hotte regions where the nyghtes be longe and coulde as is declared in the Decades.hot nyghtes in coulde regions. For lyke as suche thynges as are fyned by continuall heate, mouynge, and circulation,A similitude. are hyndered by refrigeration or coulde (as appereth in the art of styllynge and hatchynge of egges) euen so by the action of temperate and continuall heate withowt interposition of contrarie and mortifyinge qualitie, crude thynges are in shorte tyme made rype, sower made sweete, thicke made thinne, heauie made lyght, grosse made subtyle, harde made softe, deade made lyuynge, and in fine bodies made spirites,Natural heat dooth subtyle and digest all thynges. as manifestly appeareth in the marueylous woorke of dygestion of lyuyng beastes, wherby the finest part of theyr nurisshement is turned into bludde, and the finest of that bludde conuerted into spirites, as the like is also seene in the nurysshement of trees, plantes, and herbes, and all other thynges that growe on the grounde, all whiche are moued, digested, subtiliate, attenuate, ryped, and made sweete by the action of this continuall heate wherof I haue spoken. To conclude therfore, if hony bee eyther the sweete of the starres, or the iuise of the ayer pourginge it selfe (as plinie writeth) or other wyse engendered of subtyle and fine vapoures rysinge frome the earth, and concocte or digested in the ayer by the sayd continuall and moderate heate,Subtyle vapours digested by heate it may seeme by good reason that the same s

               OF this matter, Ziglerus in his booke of the Northe regions in the description of Scondia wryteth as foloweth.Ziglerus.
            
            Wee wyll intreate of this matter, not as puttynge the same in question as dyd the owld wryters, nor gatherynge iudgement deducted of reasons in way of argument, forasmuch as wee are alredy more certeyne by hystorie that these coulde regions are inhabited. Wee wyll fyrst therfore shewe by naturall reason and by consideration of the sphere, declare how by the helpe of man and arte, coulde regions are inhabited withowt domage or destruction of lyuynge beastes: And wyll fyrste speake of the qualitie of sommer,The qualitie of soomer in could regiōs. declarynge howe it is there augmented Yet intende I not to comprehende all that maye bee sayde in this matter, but only rehearse such reasons and similitudes as are most apparent and easy to bee vnderstoode.
            In such regions therfore, as are extended from the burnt line or Equinoctiall towarde the north, as much as the sonne rysethe hygher ouer theim,The course of the sonne. so muche are they the more burnte with heate, as Affrica, bycause it ryseth hyghest ouer them as they are nearest to the Equinoctiall: and taryinge with theim so much the shorter time causeth shorter days, with longer & coulder nyghtes to restore the domage of the day past by reasō of the moisture consumed by vapour.Uapours. But in such regions ouer the which the sonne ryseth lower (as in Sarmatia) it remayneth there the longer in the day, and causeth so much the shorter and warmer nyghtes,Short and Warme nyghtes. as reteynynge warme vapoures of the day past, which vapours helpe the woorke of the day. I speake as I haue founde by experience, saythe Upsaliensis. For I haue felt the sommer nyghtes scarsely tollerable for heate in Gothlande,Gothlande wheras I felte them coulde in Rome.
            This benefite of thincrease of the day, doth augment so much the more in coulde regions as they are nearer the poles: and

ceaceth not vntyll it coome directly ouer the center or poynte of the ares or axceltree of the worlde, where the sonne beinge at the hyghest in sommer,One day of .vi monethes. is eleuate abowt .xxiiii. degrees: In which regions, one continual day consisteth of .vi. monethes from the sprynge tyme by the standynge of the soonne (cauled Solstitium) in the signe of Cancer to Autumne. The soonne therfore, withowt any offence of the night, gyueth his influence vppon those landes with heate that neuer ceasethe durynge that tyme, which maketh to the great increase of soommer by reason of continuance.howe the sommer is increased in could regiōs. We haue now therfore thought good to gather by a certeyne coniecture howe greately wee thinke the soommer to bee increased hereby.
            Wee haue before declared howe hyghe the soonne is eleuate ouer the regions that are vnder the poles at the staye of the soonne: And so manye partes is it eleuate in Rome at the stay of the soonne in wynter (that is) at the shortest day in the yeare.Rome. But here, in the mydde wynter, the soonne at noone tyde is beneficiall, and bryngeth foorth floures, roses, and ielefloures. I haue gathered sum in wynter in the moneth of December, not procured at home by humane arte, but growinge 
                  •
               n open gardenes in maner in euery bedde vnder the bare heauen, browght foorth only by the soonne. But this benignitie of the soonne,Could nights in hot regiōs. continueth not past fiue houres in the naturall day, forasmuch as thoperation therof is extinct by the couldenesse of the nyght folowynge. But if this benefite myght bee receaued withowt hinderaunce of the nyght, as it is vnder the poles, and so continue many monethes in hot regions vnto winter, it shulde suerlye brynge foorthe manye woonderfull thynges, if moysture fayled not. And by this condition thus propounded, wee may well conceaue that the Romane winter,The Roman

And thus by a similitude of the height of the soonne vnder bothe places, and of the knowen qualitie of the Romane heauen, and by thaccesse of the soonne to such places where the longest day continueth certeyne monethes, wee maye gather that soommer in places vnder the pole, is lyke vnto and equall with the full Romane sprynge.
            But the more difficulte question, is of the tyme of the .vi moonethes in the whiche the soonne leaueth those regions,One nyght of vi. monethes

For they say that at that tyme, those regions are deformed with horrible darkenesse and nyghtes not increased, which may bee the cause that beastes can not seke theyr foode. And that also the coulde shulde then bee in
                  •
               ollerable: by which double euyls all thynges constrayned shulde dye, so that no beaste were able to abyde thiniuries of wynter and famen insuinge therof: but that all beastes shulde perysshe before the sommer folowynge, when they shulde bringe furth theyr broode or succession: And that for these causes, the sayde coulde clime shulde bee perpetually desolate and vnhabitable. To al which obiections, we answere in this maner
            As touchynge the nyghtes not increased, I saye, that it was not conuenient to assume that for any reason. For not as the soonne fauleth, so suddeynly commeth the darke night but that the euenynge dooth substitute and prolonge the day longe after,The twylyghtes. as also the day sprynge or dawnynge of the daye gyueth a certeyne lyght before the rysinge of the soonne: After the whiche, the residue of the nyght that receaueth no light by the sayde euenynge and mornynge twilightes, is accomplysshed by the lyght of the moone,The lyght of the mone. so that the nyghtes are seldome vnaugmented. Let this bee an exemple proued by owre temperate regions, wherby we may vnderstande the condition of the nyght vnder the pole.

                  he myght vnder the pole. Therfore euen there also the twilightes helpe the nyght a longe tyme, as we wyl more presently demonstrate. It is approued by the Astronomers, that the soonne descendynge from the highest halfe sphere by xviii. paralels of the vnder horizon, makethe an ende of the twylight,A demonstration. so that at the lengthe the darke nyght succedeth: And that the soonne approchynge, and rysynge aboue the hyghest halfe sphere by as many paralels, dooth diminysshe the nyght and increase the twylyght. Ageyne, by the position or placeinge of the sphere vnder the pole, the same is the horizontall that is the Equinoctiall. Those paralelles therefore that are paralels to the horizontal line, are also paralels to the Equinoctiall. So that the soonne descendynge there vnder the horizon, dooth not brynge darke nyghtes to those regions vntyll it coomme to the paralele distant .xviii. partes from the Equinoctiall.
            
               Other demonstrations hereof are made by certeyne fygures of Astronomie, whiche I wolde haue added hereunto but that I coulde not gette the same grauen or cutte.
            Durynge the tyme of these sayde syxe moonethes of darkenesse vnder the pole, the nyght is destitute of the benefite of the soonne and the sayde twylyghtes, onely for the space of three moonethes, in the whiche the soonne goeth and returneth by the portion of the ouerthwart circle. But yet neyther this tyme of three moonethes is withowt remedy frome heauen. For the moone with her full globe increased in lyghte,The Moone. hath accesse at that tyme, and illuminateth the moonethes lackynge lyght, euery one by them selues, halfe the course of the moonethe: by whose benefite it coommeth to passe that the night, named as vnaugment

               d, possesseth those regions no longer then one mooneth and a halfe, neyther that continually or al at one tyme: but this also diuided into three sorts of shorter nyghtes, of the whiche euery one endureth for the space of twoo weekes, and are illuminate of the moone accordyngly. And this is the reason conceaued of the poure of the sphere wherby we testifie that the sommers and nyghtes vnder the pole, are tollerable to lyuynge beastes.
            But wee wyll nowe declare by other remedies of nature and arte,Remedies of nature & art. that this coulde so greatly feared, is more remisse & tollerable then owre opinion: so that compared to the nature of such beastes as liue there, it may bee abydden. And there is no doubt but there are autours of more antiquitie then that age in the which any thynge was exactly knowen or discouered of the north regions. The owlde wryters therfore persuaded onely by naked coniecture, dydde gather what they myght determine of those places: Or rather by the estimation of heauen, the which, bycause they felte it to bee hardely tollerable to them selues, and lesse to men borne in the clyme of Egypte and Grecia, tooke therby an argument of the hole habitable earth. The hystorie of Strabo is knowen, that a potte of brasse which was broken in sunder with frosen water,A brasen pot broken with frost. was brought from Pontus and shewed in Delphis in token of a greuous wynter. Here therfore, they that so greatly feared the winter (such as chaunceth to the earth vnder the xlviii. paralele) and therefore consecrated that broken pot to the temple of Apollo, what coulde such men trewly define vppon regions so farre withowt that paralele, whether they

were inhabited or not? But such as folowed these, being contented with thinuentions of the owlde autours, and borne in maner vnd

But we with better confidence and faithe (forasmuch as we are not instructed with coniectures) intend to stande ageynst the sentence of the owld autours: Affirming the north regions within the coulde clime to bee inhabyted with hearynges,Fysshes of the North seas. coddes, haddockes, and brettes, tunnyes, and other great fysshes, with thinfinite number wherof, tables are furnysshed through a great parte of Europe: Al whiche are taken in the north sea extended beyonde owr knoweleage.The North sea.

But this is founde so tractable, that in the diepe wynter, both that increase is brought furth, and fysshynge is also exercised. The lande is lykewise inhabited with lyke plentifulnesse.The lande But that we wander not to farre: Let the fayth hereof rest in thexposition folowynge, wherin we intend to declare howe by the poure of nature and industry of man, this commoditie may coomme to passe. Therfore as touchynge nature, wee suppose that the diuine prouidence hath made nothynge vncommunicable,The diuine prouidence in moderatynge the elements but to haue gyuen such order to all thynges wherby euery thynge maye bee tollerable to the nexte. The extremeties of the elementes consent with theyr next. The ayer is grosse abowt the earth and

But oyle, by a certeyne natiue heate, is of propertie agreable to fyre. The sea then, beinge all of such qualitie,Salte. poureth furth it selfe far vppon thextreme landes, whereby by reason of the saltenesse therof, it moueth and stereth vp generatiue heate,Generatiue heate. as by fatnesse it noryssheth the fecunditie of thynges generate.

This thyng dooth more appere by this exemple, that the mountaynes of Norway and Suethlande are fruteful of metals, in the which, syluer and copper are concocte and molten into veynes, which can scarsely bee doonne in fornaces. By this reason also, the vapours and hotte exhalations perceinge the earthe and the waters,Uapours and exhalations. and throwghe both those natures breathynge furth into the ayer, tempereth the qualitie of heauen and maketh it tollerable to beastes, as wytnesseth the huge byggenesse of the whales in those seas,whales. with the strength of bodye and longe lyfe of suche beastes as liue on the lande:Beastes. whiche thynge coulde not bee, excepte all thynges were there commodiously nurysshed by the benefite of the heauen and the ayer.

But wheras the wryters of these thinges haue made Scondia greater then Suetia, & that the Gothes and Lumbardes came frome thense,The Gothes and Lumbardes. they seeme in my opinion to comprehende these three kyngedomes as it were in one body, only vnder the name of Scondia, forasmuch as then, that parte of lande that lyeth betwene the sea Balthrum (whiche floweth by the coastes of Finlandia) and the frosen sea, was vnknowen: And that by reason of so many marisshes, innumerable ryuers, and intemperatnesse of heauen, it is yet rude vncultured, and lyttle knowen.

And albeit as touchynge the mooneth of Iuly,Cabote tould me that this Ise is of fresshe water, and not of the sea. I wyll contend it is not well rehersed, no althowghe he had sayled vnder the pole, for such reasons as wee haue declared before to the contrary, neuerthelesse, that at sum tyme he sayled by Ise, this testifieth in that he sayled not by the mayne sea, but in places nere vnto the lande comprehendyng and imbrasyng the sea in forme of a goulfe,A commixtiō of salt water and fresshe. wheras for the same cause, the goulfe of Gothland is frosen bycause it is streyght & narow, in the whiche also the lyttle quantitie of salt water is ouercoome by the abundance of fresshe water of many and greate ryuers that faule into the goulfe.

For suche as are neare vnto the poles, are vexed with to much coulde: And such as are vnder the line where the soonne is of greateste force, are oppressed with heate. Such as are in the myddest betwene both, are nearest vnto temperatnesse. Under the pole, it is impossible

that there shulde bee populous cities bycause the lande is baren, and the cariage or conueyaunce of frutes, vyttayles, and other necessaries, is incommodious. By reason wherof, it is necessarie that thinhabitauntes of suche regions lyue euer in continuall wanderynge from place to place, or els in smaule vyllages. Suche as inhabite temperate regions, haue meane cities, aswell for that they haue more commodious conueyaunce for necessaries, as also that they may dwell better and more safely togyther then in vyllages by, reason of fortifying theyr townes with walles, and exercisynge of artes and occupations whereby the one maye the he

                  •
               uence thyther, and not the greatnesse of the walles. But it is necessarie that the greatest cities bee in hotte regions: fyrste, for that in such regions, parte of the soile is eyther barren yf it lacke water, or els most frutefull if it abounde with water. And for this inequalitie, when they fynde any place meete to susteyne a multitude, it foloweth of necessitie that greate cities bee buylded in such places by reason of great concourse of people resortynge to the same. An other greate cause is, that wheras in such regions, marchauntes come very farre to such commodious places, they passe through many deserte and perelous regions: So that it shalbe necessary for theyr better securitie, to coome in great companies as it were grea

                armies. And therfore whereas such a societie is once knytte togyther in a commodious place, it shulde bee great hinderance aswell to thinhabitantes as to marchauntes if they shulde wander in incommodious places. And by this confluence, both of suche as dwell neare to suche places, and also of straungers and such as dwell farre of, it is necessarie that in continuance of tyme, smaule townes becoome greate c

And beinge growne to mans age, executed thoffice of an ambassadour into dyuers Christian prouinces.

This is the most famous citie in Moscouia, aswell for the situation thereof beinge in maner in the myddest of the region, as also for the commodious oportunitie of ryuers, multitude of houses, and stronge fense of so fayre and goodly a castell. For the citie is extended with a longe tracte of buyldynges by the bankes of the ryuer for the space of fyue myles. The houses are made all of tymber, and are diuided into parlers, chambers, & kichins of large roomes: yet neyther of vnseemely height or to lowe, but of decent measure and proportion.Richard chast celer toulde me that these mastes are sumwhat holowe on the one syde, and that the hole syde of the next entereth into the same wherby they lye very close For they haue greate trees apte for the purpose browght from the foreste of Hercinia? of the which, made perfectly rounde like the mastes of shippes, and so layde one vppon an other that they ioyne at the endes in right angles, where beinge made very faste and sure, they frame theyr houses thereof of maruelous strength with smaule charges and in verye short tyme. In maner all the houses haue priuate gardens aswell for pleasure as commoditie of herbes, wherby the circuite of the dispersed citie appeareth very greate. All the wardes or quarters of the citie, haue theire peculiar chappells. But in the chiefest and highest place therof, is the Church of owre ladi of ample and goodly workemanshyppe, whiche Aristoteles of Bononie, a man of singular knowleadge and experience in architecture, buylded more then .lx. yeares sence.

Almost three partes of the citie is inuironed with two ryuers, and the resytus with a large mote that receaueth plentie of water frome the

sayde ryuers. The citie is also defended on the other syde with an other ryuer named Iausa, whiche fauleth also into Moscus a little beneath the citie. Furthermore Moscus runnyng towarde the South, fauleth into the ryuer Ocha or Occa muche greater then it selfe at the towne Columna,The ryuer Ocha. and not very farre from thense Ocha it selfe increased with other riuers, vnladeth his streames in the famous riuer Uolga,Uolga. wher at the place where they ioyne, is situate the citie of Nouogrodia the lesse,Nouogrodia. so named in respecte of the greater citie of that name from whense was browght the firste colonie of the lesse citie.

These are aboue Moscouia betwene the Northe and the West, and sende furthe from them almost all the ryuers that are dispersed into dyuers regions on euery syde, as wee see of the Alpes from whose toppes and sprynges descend the waters of whose concourse the ryuers of Rhene, Po, and Rodanum, haue theyr increase. For these marysshes in the steade of mountaynes ful of sprynges, minister abundant moysture, forasmuch as no mountaynes are yet founde in that region by the longe trauayles of men, in so much that manye that haue byn studious of the owlde Cosmographie, suppose the Ryphean and Hyperborean mountaynes so often mentioned of the ancient writers,The Ryphean & hyperborean mountaynes. to bee fabulous. From these marysshes therfore, the ryuers of Dwina, Ocha, Moschus, Uolga, Tanais, and Borysthenes, haue theyr originall.

               Of the Princes that nowe reigne in Russia,The P
                        •
                     inces of Russia. the chiefe is the great Duke of Moscouia who possesseth the greatest part therof. The seconde is the great duke of Lithuania: and the thyrde the kynge of Polonie, who nowe obteyneth the dominion of Polonie and Lithuania.
               In autoritie and dominion ouer his subiectes, the prince of Moscouie passeth all the monarkes of the worlde.The duke of Moscouia. For he depriueth all his noble men and gentelmen of al theyr holdes and munitions at his pleasure. He trusteth not his owne brotherne, but oppresseth all with lyke seruitude. In so muche that whome so euer he commaundeth eyther to remayne with hym in the courte, or to goo to the warres, or sendeth on ambassage, they are compelled to bee at theyr owne charges, excepte the younge gentelmen the soonnes of the Boiarons, that is, the noble men of the lowest degree. He vsurpeth this autoritie aswell ouer the spiritualtie as the temporaltie: constitutynge what him lysteth of the goods and lyfe of al men. Of his counsilers there is not one that dare dissente from hym in any thynge. They openly confesse that the wyl of the prince is the wyll of god: and therfore caule hym the key bearer and chamberlen of god, and beleue him to bee the executor of gods wyll. By reason wherof, the prince hym selfe when any peticion is made to hym for the deliuerie of any captiue, is accustomed

accustomed to aunswere: When god commaundeth he shalbe deliuered. Lykewyse when any asketh a question of an vncerteyne or doubtefull thynge, theyr custome is to answere thus: God knoweth and the greate prince. It is vncerteyne whether the crueltie and fiercenes of the nation doo requyre so tyrannous a prince, or whether by the tyranny of the prince, the nation is made so fierce and cruell.
               Basilius the soonne of Iohn, was the fyrst that tooke vppon hym the name and title of a kynge in this maner: The great lorde Basilius, by the grace of god kynge and lorde of all Russia and the greate duke of Uuolodimaria, Moscouia, Nouogardia. &c.

                     couia was cauled an Emperour I haue thought good to shewe the tytle and cause of this errour. Note therfore that Czar in the Ruthens tounge signifieth a kynge, wheras in the language of the Slauons, Pollons, Bohemes, and other, the same woorde Czar, signifieth Cesar by whiche name Themperours haue byn commonly cauled. For bothe they and the Slauons that are vnder the kyngdome of Hungarie, caule a kynge by an other name: as sum Crall, other Kyrall, and sum Koroll: but thinke that only an Emperoure is cauled Czar. Whereby it came to passe that the Ruthene or Moscouite interpretours hearynge theyr prince to bee so cauled of straunge nations, began them selues also to name hym an Emperour, and thinke the name of Czar to bee more worthy then the name of a kynge, althowgh they signifie all one thynge. But who so wyl reade all theyr hystories and bookes of holy scripture,The greate Turke. shall fynde that a kynge is cauled Czar, and an Emperour Kessar. By the lyke erroure Themperour of the Turkes is cauled Czar, who neuerthelesse of antiquitie vsed no hygher tytle then the name of a kynge, expressed by this woorde Czar. And hereof the Turkes of Europe that vse the Slauon tounge, caule the citie of Constantinople Czargead, (that is) the kynges citie.
               Sum caule the prince of Moscouie the whyte kynge,The whyte kynge. whiche I thinke to proceade of the whyte cappes, or other tyrementes they weare on theyr heades, lyke as they caule the kynge of Percia Kisilpassa (that is) redde headde.The duke of Mo

greate master of Prussia and Liuonia, and also to the greate Turke as I haue byn credably informed: but he is not cauled kynge of any of them, excepte perhappes of the Liuons. Yet by reason of his later conquestes, sum haue thought hym worthy the name of a kynge or rather of an Emperour bycause he hath kynges vnder his Empire.
               To the kynge of Polone, he vseth this tytle: The greate lorde Basilius by the grace of god, lorde of all Russia, and greate duke of Uuolodimeria, Moscouia, Nouogardia. &c. leauynge owt the tytle of a kynge. For none of them vouchesafeth to receaue the letters of the other augmented with any new tytle, as I knewe by experience at my being in Moscouia, at which tyme Sigismundus the kynge of Polone sente hym his letters augmented with the tytle of the duke of Masouia, wherwith he was not a lyttle offended.

               As in other matters,Dyuers maners of dyuers people in the ware. euen so in thorder of warrefare ther is great diuersitie amonge men. For the Moscouian as soone as he begynneth to flye, thinketh of none other succoure but putteth all his confidence therein. Beinge pursued or taken of his enemie, he neyther defendeth him selfe nor desirethe perdon.
               The Tartar cast of from his horse, spoyled of al his armure & weapons, and also sore woūded, defendeth hym selfe with handes, feete, and teethe, and by all meanes he may, vntyll his strength and spirite fayle hym.
               The Turke, when he seeth hym selfe destitute of all helpe and hope to escape, doth humbly desyre pardon, casting away his weapons & armure, and reching furth to the victourer his handes ioyned together to be bounde, hopynge by captiuitie to saue his lyfe.
               The Moscouites in placeinge theyr armye chuse them a large playne where the best of them pytch theyr tentes & the other make thē certen arbours of bouwes fyxt in the grounde,The Moscouytes army. bendyng together the toppes therof, whiche they couer with theyr clokes to defende them selues, theyr bowes, arrowes, saddyles, and other theyr necessaries from rayne.

               It may perhappes seeme straunge howe he maynteyneth hym and hys so longe with so smaule an armye as I haue sayde.howe he maynteyneth his army. I wyll nowe therfore brefely declare theyre sparynge and frugalitie. He that hath syxe or sumtymes more horses, vseth one of them as A packe horse to beare all theyr necessaryes,

eyes. He hath also in a bagge of two or three spanes longe, the floure or meale of the grayne cauled mylle: and .viii. or x. poundes weyghte of swynes flesshe poudered. He hathe lykewyse A bagge of salte, myxte with pepper if he bee ryche. Furthermore euery man caryeth with hym A hatchet, A fyre boxe, and a brasen potte: so that if they chaunce to coomme to any place where they can fynde no frutes, garlyke, onyons or flesshe, they kyndle a fyre and fylle theyr pottes with water wherunto they put a spoonefull of meale with a quantitie of salte, and make pottage therof, wherwith the master and all hys seruauntes lyue contented. But if the master bee very hungary he eateth all alone, and the seruantes are sumtymes inforsed to faste for the space of two or three dayes. And yf the master intende to fare sumwhat more delycately, then he addeth therto a lyttle portion of swynes flesshe. I speake not thys of the best of them, but of suche as are of the meane sorte. The gouernours and capytaynes of tharmye, doo sumtymes bydde the poorer sorte to theyre tables: where theye feede them selues so wel, that they fast two or three dayes after. When they haue frutes, garlyke, and onyons, theye can well forbeare all other meates. Procedynge forwarde to the battayle, they put more confydence in theyr multitude, and with what greate armyes they assayle theyr enemyes, thē eyther in the strengthe and valyantenesse of theyr souldyers, or in well instructynge theyr armye: and fyght better afarre of, then at hande: and therfore study howe to circumuent or inclose theyr enemyes and to assayle them on the backe halfe.
               
                  Instruments of warre.They haue many trumpiters: The which whyle they blow all at once after theyr maner, make A meruelous straunge noyse. They haue also an other kynde of instrumentes which they caule Szurna. These they blowe withowte seasynge for the space of an houre togither, so temperyng the same and holdyng in the wynd whyle they drawe more, that the noyse seemeth continuall withoute intermyssion.The Moscouites and Tartars apparell.
               
               They vse all one maner of appareyle: as longe coates withowte pleyghtes and with narrowe sleaues after the maner of the Hungaryans. These the Christians vse to butten on the ryght syde: and the Tartars (vsinge the lyke) butten them on the lefte syde. They weare redde and shorte buskyns that reache not to theyr knees: and haue the soules therof defended

with plates of Iren. In maner all theyr shyrtes are wroughte with dyuers colours aboute the necke: and haue the collars and ruffes bysette with lyttle rounde baules lyke beades, of syluer or gylted copper, and sumtyme perles also. They gyrde them selues beneth the bellye euen as lowe as theyr priuy members, that they may seme more boorely which they greately esteme, as doo at thys day the Spanyardes, Italyans, and Almaynes.
               The prouince of Moscouia is neyther very large nor frutfull,The prouince of Moscouia. forasmuche as the fertylytye is hyndered with sandye grounde which eyther with to muche drynesse or moyster kylleth the corne. Furthermore the immoderate and sharpe vntemperatenesse of the ayre while the coulde of the wynter ouercommethe the heate of the soonne,Extreme coulde. sumtymes dothe not suffer the corne to rype. For the coulde is there sumtyme so extreame, that lyke as with vs in sommer by reason of heate, euen so there by extreame coulde the yearth hath many great chynkes or breaches. Water also cast into the ayre, and spettle faulyng from ons mouthe, are frosen before they touche the grounde. I my selfe, when I came thether in the yeare 1526. sawe the braunches of frutefull trees wythyred by the coulde of the wynter before, which was so extreame that many of theyr wagoners or caries (whom they caule Gonecz) were founde frosen to deathe in theyr sleades. There were sum that at the same tyme leadyng and dryuyng theyr cattayle from the nexte villagies to Moscouia, dyed by the way with theyr beastes through thextremytie of the coulde. Furthermore, the same yeare many players that were accustomed to wander aboute the contrey with daunsyng beares, were founde dead in the high wayes. Wylde beares also inforced therto by famyn, lefte the wooddes and ranne here and there into dyuers villagies and houses: At whose commyng while the men of the countrey forsooke theyr houses and fledd into the fieldes, manye of them perysshed throughe the vehemencie of the coulde. Agayne, it sumtymes so chaunceth that in sommer the heate is as extreame:Extreme heate in cold regions. as in the yeare .1525. in the which almost al kynds of pulse and grayne were scorched and burnte: and such a derth of corne folowed that drought, that that which before was bowght for three dengas, was afterwarde soulde for .xx, or .xxx. Furthermore also, manye

villagies, wooddes, and stackes of corne, were sette on fyre by thextreame heate: The smoke wherof so fylled the regyon, that the eyes of many were sore hurte therby. There arose also as it were a darke and thycke myst without smoke which so molested the eys, that many loste theyr sight therby.
               They sowe and narysshe the seades of melons with great diligence in certeyne raysed beddes myxte with doonge: wherby they fynde a remedy both ageynst extreame could and heat. For if the heate exceade, they make certeyne ryftes in the beddes as it were breathyng places least the seades shulde be suffocate with to muche heate. And if the coulde bee extreme it is tempered with the heate of the mucke or dunge.
               
                  Lyttle beastes.Theyr beastes are muche lesse then owres: yet not all withowt hornes as one hath written. For I haue there sene oxen, kyne, goates, and rammes all with hornes.
               Not farre from the citie of Moscha, are certeyne monasteries which a farre of, seeme lyke vnto a citie. They saye that in thys citie is an incredible number of houses:The citie of Mo

And that the syxte yeare before my commynge thyther, the prince caused them to bee numbered, and founde them to bee more then one and fortye thousande and fyue hundreth houses. The citie is very large and wyde: and also very slabby and myrie. By reason wherof it hath many brydges and causeys.
               The ayre of the regyon is so holsome,holsome ayer. that beyond the sprynges of Tanais, especially towarde the north and a great parte also towarde the Easte, the pestylence hath not byne harde of sence the memorye of man. Yet haue they sumtimes a disease in theyr bowells and headdes not much vnlyke the pestylence. Thys disease they caule a heate: wherwith suche as are taken, dye within fewe dayes.

In thys Ilande is made greate plenty of salte: and it hath in it a monasterie into the which it is not lawfull for any woman or virgyn to enter.

               Demetriowe, is a citie with a castel, distante from Moscouia xii. leaques declining from the west sumwhat toward the north. By this runneth the ryuer Lachroma that runneth in to the ryuer of Sest. Sest also receaueth the ryuer Dubna which vnladeth it selfe in Uolga. And by the commoditie of thus many ryuers, many riche marchaundies are browght without great laboure or difficultie from the caspian sea by the ryuer Uolga to Moscouia and dyuers other prouynces & cities abowte the same.The trade from Moscocouia to the Caspian sea.
               
               Bieloiesero, a citie with a castell, is situat at a lake of the same name. For Bieloiesero in the Moscouites toung, signifieth a white lake.Bieloiesero or the whyte lakes. The citie standeth not in the lake as sum haue sayd. Yet is it so enuironed with marysshes that it may seeme to bee inexpugnable: In consideration wherof, the princes of Moscouia are accustomed to keepe theyr treasure there. Bieloiesero is from Moscouia, a hundreth leaques, and as muche from Nouogardia the great. The lake it selfe, is .xii. leaques in length and as much in breadth: and hath (as they say) three hundreth ryuers faulynge into it. Thinhabitauntes of this place, haue a peculyar language, although nowe in maner all speake the Moscouites tounge. The longest day here in the soommer Equinoctial,Diuersitie of temperament in smaul dystance. is sayde to consyste of .xix. houres. A man of greate name and credite toulde me, that at the begynnyng of the sprynge when the trees began nowe to bee greene, he wente in poste from Moscouia to Bieloiesero: And passynge ouer the ryuer Uolga, founde the region there so couered with Ise and snow, that he was fayne to dispatch the residue of his iorney on fleades. And although the wynter bee longer there, yet doo the frutes waxe rype and are gathered euen at the same tyme that they are in Moscouia. With in an arrowe shotte of the lake,A lake of brymstone. there is an other lake that bryngeth furth brymstone. which a certē ryuer running owt of

the same, caryeth with it in great quantitie flotyng aboue the water lyke a scoomme. Yet through the ignorance of the people, they haue no commoditie therby.

                  Note that wheras here before the autour numbereth but fyftie werstes from Moscouia to Uuolochda, it semeth that the place is corrupted by the Printers mystakynge one worde for an other, as Quinquaginta, which is fyftie, for Quingenta, whiche is fyue hundreth. For the distance is no lesse from Moscouia to Uuolochda, then is frō Uuolochda to Ustiug, which is fyue hundreh werstes.

And albeit that the autour of thys iorney, sayd that many nations of Lucomorya are subiecte to the prynce of Moscouia, yet for asmuch as the kyngdome of Tumen is neare therunto,Tumen. whose prince is a Tartar and named in theyr toung Tumenski Czar (that is) a kynge in Tumen, and hath of late doone great domage to the prynce of Moscouia, it is moste lyke that these nations shulde rather bee subiecte vnto hym.

Not farre from that citie, the ryuer Occa maketh an Ilande named Strub which was sumtym a great dukedome, whose prince was subiect to none other. Thys prouince of Rezan is more frutfull then any other of the prouynces of Moscouia: In so muche that in thys (as they saye) euery grayne of wheate bryngethe furthe two and sumtymes more eares: whose stalkes or strawes growe so thycke that horses can scarsely go throwgh them, or quayles flye owt of them.

For Tanais here at other tymes of the yeare doth not so abounde with water as to heare

Schat towarde the Weste receauynge into it the ryuer of Uppa, runneth into the ryuer of Occa betwene the West and the north. But Tanais at the fyrste runneth directly East: and continueth his course betwene the kyngdomes of Casan and Astrachan within syxe or seuen leaques of Uolga:Casan.

Foure dayes iorney aboue this, is a towne cauled Achas,Achas. situate harde by the same ryuer:Frutefull regions abowt Tanais. whiche the Moscouites caule Don.

Furthermore the souldyers whiche the prince of Moscouia maynteyneth there yearely to oppresse thincursion of the Tartars, beinge of me demaunded hereof, answered that they neuer sawe or harde of any such thynge.

The iorney by lande can scarcely bee trauayled thyther but in wynter by reason of many ryuers, marysshes,Marysshes in sommer. and fennes. But in sommer, this iorney is dispatched with more facilitie in boates or smaule shippes by Uuolochda, Ustiug, and the ryuer Uitzechda

But they that go from Permia to Ustiug, muste sayle vp the ryuer Uischora ageinst the course of the streame: and passing ouer certeyne ryuers, sumtymes also conueyinge theyr boates into other ryuers by lande, they come at the length to Ustiug three hundreth leaques distant frome the citie of Permia. There is smaule vse of breade in this prouince. For theyr yearely tribute,Tribute. they pay to the prynce furres & horses.Furres and horses.

This Steuen afterwarde when Demetrius the sonne of Iohn reigned, was taken for a saynte amonge the Ruthens. Of these people there yet remayne many Idolatours here and there in the woods, whom the moonkes and heremites that go thyther,Monkes and heremites. doo not cease to conuert from theyr vayne errour. In the wynter they iorney in Artach as they doo in many places of Russia. Artach, are certeyne longe patentes of woodde of almost syxe handfuls in length,Patentes. whiche they make faste to theyr fiete with latchettes, & therwith performe theyr iorneys with great celeritie.Marcus Paulus wryteth that these dogges are almost as byg as Asses: and that they v

They vse for this purpose greate dogges in the steade of other beastes, with the which they cary theyr farthels on sleades, as other doo with hartes in other places, as we wyll further declare hereafter. They say that that prouince toward the East confineth with the prouince cauled Tumen, perteynynge to the Tartars.
               The situation of the prouince of Iugaria,Iugaria. is apparente by that which we haue sayde before. The Moscouites caule it Iuhra with an aspiration: and caule the people Iuhrici. This is that Iugaria from whense the Hungarians came in tyme paste,hungaria. possessed Pannonia,Pannonia. and vnder the conduct of Attila,Attila. subdued many prouinces of Europe: wherin the Moscouites doo greatly glory, that a nation subiecte to them, inuaded and wasted a great parte of Europe. Georgius Paruns a greeke borne, and a man of reputation with the Prince of Moscouia, wyllynge to ascribe to the ryght of his prince the great dukedome of Lithuania, and the kyngedome of Polonie with certeyne other dominions, toulde me that the Iuharici

or Iuhgary, beinge subiectes to the great duke of Moscouia, came furth of theyr owne countrey, and fyrste inhabited the regions abowt the fennes of Meoris, and then Pannonie which was afterwarde cauled Hungarie,The hygher or superyor Hungarye, is cauled Austria. by the ryuer of Danubius: Also that in fine they possessed the region of Morauia so named of the ryuer: and lykewyse Pollonie,Polonie. so cauled of Polle, which signifieth a playne. Furthermore that Buda was so cauled after the name of the brother of Attila.Buda. They say also that the Iuhgari vse the same tounge that doo the Hungarians. The which whether it be trew or not, I do not knowe. For althowgh I haue made diligent inquisition to knowe the truth hereof, yet coulde I fynde no man of that region with whom my seruaunt beinge expert in the Hungarian tounge myght speake. They also pay furres for theyr tributes to the prince of Moscouia.Furres. And albeit that pearles and precious stones are brought frome thense to Moscouia,Pearles and Precious stones. yet are they not gathered in theyr Ocean, but in other places: especially about the coast of the Ocean nere vnto the mouthes of Dwina.

               The Tartars are diuided into companies which they caul Hordas, of the which the Horda of the Sawolhenses is the chiefe in fame and multitude.horda. For it is sayde that the other Hordas had theyr ofsprynge and original of this. And albeit that euery Horda hath his peculiar name, as the Sawolhenses, Precropenses, and Nahays with dyuers other being all Machumetans, yet doo they take it euyll and count it reproch to bee cauled Turkes: but wyll them selues to bee cauled Besermani,Besermani. by the which name also the Turkes desyre to bee cauled.

And as the Tartars inhabyte many prouynces reachynge far on euery syde, euen so in maners and order of lyuynge doo they not agree in all thynges. They are men of meane stature,The stature of the Tartars. with broade and fat faces, holowe eyde, with roughe and thyck beardes, and poulde heades. Onely the noble men haue longe heare, and that exceadyng black, which they wreath on both sydes theyr eares. They are stronge of body and stoute of mynde: prone to leacherye, and that vnnaturall.

Theyr horses (wherof they haue great aboundaunce) are but smaule, and with short neckes: but very strong and such as can wel away with labour & hunger. These they fede with the branches & barkes or ryndes of trees & the rotes of hearbes and weedes, wherby they accustome them to hard feedynge, and exercyse them to contynuall laboure: by reason wherof (as say the Moscouytes) theyr horses are swyfter and more durable then any other. These kynde of horses, they caule Pachmat. They haue none other saddells and steroppes then of woodd,Saddels and styrrops of woodde. except suche as they eyther bye of the Chrystians, or take from them by vyolence. Least theyr horse backes shulde bee hurte with theyr saddells, they vnderlaye them with grasse and leaues of trees. They also passe ouer ryuers on horsbacke. But if when they flye, they feare the pursuynge of theyr enemyes, then castynge away theyr saddells, apparelle, and all other impedymentes, reseruyng only theyr armoure and weapons they flye amayne and with greate ceelrytye. Theyr women vse the same kynde of apparell that doo the men withowt any dyfference except that they couer theyr heades with lynnen vayles,The Tartars women. and vse lynnen hose muche lyke vnto maryners sloppes.

The other multytude of the common sorte that lyueth here and ther in the feeldes, haue theyr apparell made of sheepes skynnes, which they chaung not vntyll they bee worne and torne to fytters. They tarye not longe in one place, iudgyng it a great mysery so to doo:The Tartars curse. In so muche that when they are angrie with theyr chyldren, the greatest curse that they can gyue them, is that they maye remayne perpetually in one place, and drawe the stynshe of theyr owne fylthynesse as doo the Chrystyans. When they haue consumed the pasture in one place, they go to an other with theyr droues of cattayle and theyr wyues and chyldren whom they euer cary about with them in Wagons: albeit the Tartars that dwell in cities and townes, vse an other order of lyuynge. If they be inclosed with any daungerous warr

For in howe much the longer viage they haue attempted for this intent, so much the more doo they therby declare that this desyre hath byn ardent in them.

An other thyng is also greatly to bee noted as touchynge these Indians. And this is,Curld heare and baldnes. that theyr heare is not curlde as is the Moores and Ethiopians that inhabite the same clime: neyther are they balde excepte very seldome, and that buy lyttle.

               ¶ Why they were cauled Indians.
               
                  SUm thynke that the people of the newe world were cauled Indians bycause they are of the colour of the Easte Indians.The colour of the East Indians. And althowghe (as it semeth to me) they dyffer much in colour and fasshions, yet is it trewe that of India they were cauled Indians.East India. India is properlie cauled that great prouince of Asia in the which great Alexander kepte his warres: and was so named of the ryuer Indus: and is diuyded into many kyngedomes confynynge with the same.

The sayde Indians preuayled so much, that they vtterly changed the customes and name of that lande, and cauled it India:Ethyopia cauled India. by reason wherof, Ethiopia also hath of longe tyme byn cauled India. And hereuppon came it that Arystotell, Seneca, and certeyne other oulde autours sayd that India was not farre from Spayne.India not far from Spayne After this also, of later dayes owre West India was so cauled of the sayde India of Prester Iohn where the Portugales had theyr trade. For the pylot of the caruell that was fyrste dryuen by forcyble wynde to an vnknowen lande in the Weste Ocean,Prester Iohn knowen to the Portugales. cauled the same India bycause the Portugales so cauled such landes as they had lately discouered Eastwarde. Chrystopher Colon also after the sayde pylot, cauled the west landes by the same name. Albeit, sum that take Colonus for an expert Cosmographer, thynke that he so named them of the East India, as to be the furthest and vnknowen ende therof reachynge into the Weste vnder the other hemispherie or halfe globe of the earthe beneathe vs:At the furthest Easte, begynneth the west. affirmynge that when he fyrst attempted to dicouer the Indies, he went chiefely to seeke the ryche Iland of Cipango,The Iland of Cipango. which fauleth on the parte of great China or Cathay as wryteth Marcus Paulus Uenetus and other:China.

               ☞ The fyrste discouerynge of the Weste Indies.
               
                  A Certeyne caruell saylynge in the weste Ocean abowt the coastes of Spayne, had a forcyble and continuall wynde from the East wherby it was dryuen to a land vnknowen and not descrybed in any mappe or carde of the sea:A harde begynnyng. and was dryuen

styl alonge by the coaste of the same for the space of many dayes vntyll it came to a hauen: where in a shorte tyme the most parte of the maryners beinge longe before verye weake and feeble by reason of hunger & trauayle, dyed: So that only the pylot with thre or foure other remayned alyue. And not only they that dyed dyd not inioy the Indies which they fyrst discouered to theyr mysfortune, but the resydue also that lyued had in maner as lyttle fruition of the same: not leauynge or at the least not openly publyshynge any memorie therof, neyther of the place, or what it was cauled, or in what yeare it was founde. Albeit, the faute was not theyrs, but rather the malice of other, or the enuie of that which wee caule fortune. I doo not therefore marueyle that the auncient hystories affirme that great thynges proceade and increase of smaul and obscure begynnynges,Great thinges proceadyng of smaule and obscure begynnynges. syth wee haue seene the same verefyed in this fyndyng of the Indies, being so notable and newe a thynge. Wee neede not bee curious to seeke the name of the pylot syth death made a shorte ende of his doinges. Sum wyl that he came from Andaluzia, and traded to the Ilands of Canaria and the Ilande of Madera when this large and mortal nauigation chaūced vnto hym.The pylotte that fyrst founde the Indies. Other say that he was a Byscayne, and traded into Englande and Fraunce. Other also, that he was a Portugale: and that eyther he wente or came from Mina or India:Mina. which agreeth well with the name of these newe landes as I haue sayde before. Ageyne, sum there bee that say that he browght the carauel to Portugale: or to the Ilande of Madera, or to sum other of the Ilandes cauled delos Azores. Yet doo none of them affirme any thynge, althowgh they all affirme that the pylotte dyed in the house of Chrystopher Colon, with whome remayned al such wrytynges and annotacions as he hadde made of his vyage in the sayde carauell, aswell of such thynges as he obserued both by lande and sea, as also of the eleuation of the pole in those landes whiche he had discouered.
            
            
               
               ¶ What maner of man Chrystopher Colon was: and howe he Came fyrst to the knowleage of the Indies.
               
                  CHristopher Colon was borne in Cugureo, or (as sum say) in Nerui, a vyllage in the territorie of Genua in Italie. He descended as sum thynke, of the house of the Pelestreles of Placentia in Lumbardie. He beganne of a chylde to bee a maryner: of whose arte they haue great exercise on the ryuer of Genua.Thus also began Rychard chaunceler. He traded many yeares into Suria and other partes of the East. After this, he became a master in makynge cardes for the sea, whereby he had great vantage. He came to Portugale to knowe the reason and descr
                     •
                  ption of the south coaste of Affrica and the nauigations of the Portugales, thereby to make his cardes more perfecte to bee solde. He maryed in Portugale as sum say: or as many say, in the Ilande of Madera, where he dwelt at suche tyme as the sayde caruell arryued there, whose pylot suiorned in his house, and dyed also there, bequethynge to Colon his carde of the description of suche newe landes as he hadde founde, wherby Colon had the fyrst knowleage of the Indyes. Sum haue thowght that Colon was well lerned in the Latine tounge and the science of Cosmographie:Colon was not much lerned. and that he was therby fyrst moued to seeke the landes of the Antipodes and the ryche Ilande of Cipango whereof Marcus Paulus wryteth. Also that he had redde what Plato in his dialoges of Timeus and Cricias, wryteth of the greate Ilande Atlantide,The Ilande 
                        •
                     tlantide. and of a great lande in the West Ocean vndiscouered beinge bygger then Asia and Affrica. Furthermore that he had knowleage what Aristotell and Theophrastus saye in theyr bookes of maruayles, where they wryte that certeyne marchauntes of Carthage saylyng from the streyghtes of Gibraltar towarde the west and south,The lande found by the Carthaginenses. founde after many dayes a greate Ilande not inhabited: yet replenyshed with al thinges requisite, and hauynge many nauigable ryuers. In deede Colon was not greately lerned: yet of good vnderstandynge. And when he had knowleage of the sayde new landes by the information of the dead pylot,Colon conferred with lerned men. made relation thereof to certeyne lerned men with whom he conferred as touchynge the

lyke thynges mentioned of owlde autours. He communicated this secreate and conferred chiefely with a fryer, named Iohn Perez of Marchena that dwelt in the monastery of Rabida. So that I verely beleue, that in maner all that he declared, and many thynges more that he lefte vnspoken, were wrytten by the sayde Spanyshe pylot that dyed in his house. For I am persuaded, that if Colon by science atteyned to the knowleage of the Indies, he wolde longe before haue communicate this secreate to his owne contrey men the Genueses, that trauayle all the worlde for gaynes, and not haue comme into Spayne for this purpose. But doubtelesse he neuer thought of any such thyng before he chaunced to bee acquainted with the sayd pylot who founde those landes by fortune,Chaunce and arte. accordynge to the sayinge of Plinie: Quod ars docere non potuit, casus inuenit. That is: That arte coulde not teache, chaunce founde. Albeit, the more Chrystian opinion is,A Christian opinion. to thinke that god of his singuler prouidence and infinite goodnesse, at the length with eyes of compassion as it were lookynge downe from heauen vpon the sonnes of Adam so longe kepte vnder Sathans captiuitie, intended euen then (for causes to hym only knowen) to rayse those wyndes of mercy whereby that caruell (herein most lyke vnto the shyppe of Noe whereby the remanent of the hole world was saued as by this caruel this newe worlde receaued the fyrst hope of theyr saluation) was dryuen to these landes.The caruel cōpared to the ship of Noye. But wee wyll nowe declare what great thynges folowed of this smaule begynnynge, and how Colon folowed this matter reueled vnto hym not withowte goddes prouidence.
            
            
               ¶ What labour and trauayle Colon tooke in attemptyng his fyrst vyage to the Indies.
               
                  AFter the death of the pilot and mariners of the Spanyshe caruell that discouered the Indies, Chrystopher Colon purposed to seke the same. But in howe muche more he desyred this, the lesse was his poure to accomplishe his desire. For, besyde that of him selfe he was not able to furnysshe one shyppe, he lacked also the fauour of a kynge vnder whose protection he might so enioy the riches he hoped

to fynde, that none other myght take the same from hym or defeate hym therof. And seinge the kynge of Portugale occupied in the conquest of Africa and the nauigations of the East which were then fyrst attempted,The kinge of Portugale. the kynge of Castyle lykewyse no lesse busyed in the warres of Granada,The kyng of Castile. he sent to his brother Bartholomewe Colon (who was also priuie to this secreate) to practise with the kynge of Englande Henry the seventh beinge very ryche and withowt warres:Kynge Henry the seuenth. promysynge to brynge hym great ryches in short time if he wolde shew him fauour and furnysshe hym with shippes to discouer the newe Indies wherof he had certeyne knowleage. But neyther here beinge able to brynge his sute to passe, he caused the matter to bee moued to the kynge of Portugale Don Alonso the fyfte of that name: at whose handes he founde neither fauour nor money, forasmuch as the licenciate Calzadilla the byshop of Uiseo,Barnarde knewe not all thynges. and one master Rodrigo men of credit in the science of Cosmographie, withstoode him and contended that there neither was nor coulde any golde or other ryches bee founde in the west as Colon affirmed. By reason whereof he was very sadde and pensiue: but yet was not discouraged or despaired of the hope of his good aduenture which he afterward found This done, he tooke shippinge at Lisburne, and came to Palos of Moguer where he cōmuned with Martin Alōso Pinzō an expert pylot, who offered hym selfe vnto hym. After this disclosynge the hole secreates of his mynde to Iohn Perez of Marchena (a fryer of thorder of saynt Frances in Rabida, and wel lerned in Cosmographie) & declarying vnto hym how by folowyng the course of the son by a temperate vsage, rich and great landes myght be founde, the fryer greatly commended his enterpryse, and gaue him counsayle to breake the matter to the duke of Medina Sidonia Don Enrique of Guzman a great lorde and very ryche:The duke of Medina Sidonia. And also to Don Luys of Cerda the duke of Medina Celi,The duke of Medina Celi. who at that tymes had great prouision of shippes well furnyshed in his hauen of Santa Maria. But wheras both these dukes tooke the matter for a dreame and as a thynge diuised of an Italian deceauer who (as they thought) had before with lyke pretence deluded the kynges of Englande and Portugale, the fryer gaue hym courage to go to the courte of the Catholyke princes Don Ferdinando and lady Isabell princes of Castile: affirmynge that they

wolde bee ioyfull of such newes. And for his better furtherance herin, wrote letters by hym to fryer Ferdinando of Talauera the queenes confessor. Chrystopher Colon therfore, repayred to the court of the Cathollike princes, in the yeare .M.CCCC.lxxxvi. and delyuered vnto theyr handes the peticion of his request as concerninge the discouerynge of the newe Indies. But they beinge more carefull, and applyinge all theyr mynde howe they myght dryue the Moores owt of the kyngdome of Granade,The cōquest of Granada. which great enterpryse they had alredy taken in hande, dyd lyttle or nothynge esteme the matter. But Colon not thus discouraged, found the meanes to declare his sute to such as had sumtymes priuate communication with the kynge.what men knowe not they count funtasticall. Yet bicause he was a stranger and went but in simple apparell, nor otherwyse credited then by the letter of a gray fryer, they beleued hym not, neyther gaue eare to his woordes: wherby he was greatly tormented in his imagination.Colon his interteinmente. Only Alonso of Quintanilia the kynges chiefe auditour gaue hym meate and drynke at his owne charges, and hard gladly such thynges as he declared of the landes not then founde: desyrynge hym in the meane tyme to bee contente with that poore enterteynemente, and not to despayre of his enterpryse: puttynge hym also in good conforte that he shulde at one tyme or other, coome to the speache of the Catholyke princes. And thus shortly after by the meanes of Alonso of Quintanilia, Colon was browght to the presence and audience of the Cardinall Don Pero Gonzales of Mendoza, archbysshop of Toledo,The archbysshop of Toledo. a man of great reuenues & autoritie with the kynge and queene, who brought hym before them after that he well perceaued and examyned his intent.Colon is brought to the kynges presence. And by this meanes was his sute harde of the Catholyke princes, who also redde the booke of his memorials which he presented vnto them. And although at the fyrst they tooke it for vayne and false that he promysed, neuerthelesse they put hym in good hope that he shulde bee well dispatched when they had fynyshed the warres of Granada which they had now in hand. With which answere, Colon beganne to reuyue his spirites, with hope to bee better estemed and more fauorably to bee hard amonge the gentelmen and noble men of the court, who before tooke hym only for a craftie felowe and deceauer: and was nothynge dismayde or discouraged when so euer he debated

the matter with them, althowghe many iudged hym phantasticall,The iudgement of ignorant folkes. as is the maner of ignorant menne to caule all such as attempte any thynge beyonde theyr reach and the compa

But to returne to Colon: So hotte and vrgente was the siege of Granada, that they presentely graunted hym his demaunde to seeke the newe landes,Colon is dispatched. and to brynge from thense golde, syluer, perles, precious stones, spices, and suche other rych thynges. They gaue hym also the tenth parte of all the reuenues and customes dewe vnto the kynge of al such landes as he shulde discouer,Colon his rewarde. not doynge preiudice in any thynge to the kynge of Portugale. The particulars of this agrement were made in the towne caused Sanera Fe: and the priuilege of the rewarde, in Granada the .xxx. daye of Aprell the same yeare that the citie was woonne. And wheras the sayde Catholyke princes had not mony presently to dispatch Colon, Luys of s. Angell the kynges secretary of accomptes, lente theym syxe quentes of marauedes, whiche in a grosse summe make .xvi. thousande ducades. Two thynges are herein chiefely to be noted:One quent is .x hundreth thousand
                        •
                     . wherof the one is, that for so smaule charges they haue increased the reuenues of the crowne of Castyle as much as the Indies are in value. The other is, that endynge the conquest of the Moores who possessed the kyngdome of Granada eyght hundreth yeares, they immediately beganne the conquest of the Indies, as though the nation of the Spanyardes were euer appoynted to feyght ageynst infidels and enemies of the fayth of Iesu Chryst.
               
                  By this trauayle of Colonus in so noble an enterpryse and so harde successe, dooth the sayinge of Plinie appere to be most trew, wher in the preface of his natural hystory wryttē to thēprour Uespasiā he writeth ī this maner.

In the ryuer lyeth an Ilande whiche Iohn Dias named Martinus Gratias bycause a pylot of his so cauled,The Ilande Martinus Gratias. was buryed there.

This Ilande is situate in the myddest of the ryuer: and is dystant from the mouth of the same abowt fortie leaques.

Perceauynge therfore that by reason of this chaunce he could by no meanes performe his vyage attempted, he intended to expugne the sayde Ilande, and theruppon to conueygh his vytayles to land, to prepare his soldiers to thinuasion, to plant colonyes, and to erect for tresses by the ryuers syde wherby the Spanyardes myght bee defended from the violence of the barbarians. But before he attempted this, he was aduertised that the Ilande was riche in golde and syluer.

as thowgh a man trauayle neuer so far eyther by land or sea, he seemeth euer to passe as it were by a ryght line with out any such circuite or compassynge, ascendynge or discendynge, as perteyneth to all the partes of a rounde forme. The which obiection, as it is grose and simple, proceadyng of the narownesse of the vnderstandyng of such as can not conceaue the large circumference of the lande and sea, euen so may it be answered with this simple demonstration. In a rynge that serueth for the fynger of a mans hande,A rynge. A circle. the space of halfe an ynche or lyttle more, is halfe a cyrcle. But in a rynge or cyrcle of bygger circumference, as in the hoope of a tubbe, halfe an ynche appeareth in maner a ryght line, althowghe it bee not so in deede, forasmuch as it is not possible for any parte of a circle to consist of a ryght line, neyther any parte of a line to consyst of a cyrcle, sithe the partes must needes bee conformable to the hole, consystynge of such vniforme partes as are in mathematicals. But not to wander to farre in these subtylties, the greater that yow can imagen the circle to bee, so shal a greater parte therof seeme a ryght line or playne forme: As for exemple, imaginynge a circle whose diameter (that is measure from syde to syde) consysteth of a myle: in this circle a pole length or more, may seeme a ryght line, as yowe may otherwyse multiply of the like infinitely: wherby it shal appere that the large circumference of the earth well consydered, a muche greater part of the circle therof then the eye of man conceaueth, may seeme to bee a ryght line, and he contynually to walke vppon a playne forme forasmuch as euery part of a circle is lyke vnto other as I haue sayde. This may suffice for a simple and briefe demonstration and induction for suche as are desyrous to seeke furth to knowe the truth hereof.
            
            
               ¶ What credit owght to bee gyuen to wryters as touchynge the woorkes of nature.
               
                  THe moste auncient wryter Diodorus, Siculus, in the fourth booke of his Bibliotheca, wryteth in this maner. If any man for the maruelous straungenes and noueltie of such thinges as are descrybed in owre bookes, wyl not perhappes gyue credyt to owre hystorie, let hym

with ryght iudgement consider the difference that is betwene the ayer of the Scythians and the Troglodytes compared to owres,The diuersitie of ayer in dyuers regions. and he shall the easelyer perceaue the woorkes of nature and approue owre wrytynges. For owre ayer dyffereth so much from theyrs, that it myght seeme incredible if experience were not more certeyne then doubtfull reason. In sume regions the coulde is so extreme that greate ryuers are so frosen,Extreme colde. that laden cartes and armies of men passe ouer the immouable ise. Wine also and other moist thynges are so conieled that they may bee cutte with knyues. But this is more marueylous, that thextreeme partes of suche apparell as menne weare, are so bytten with coulde that they faule of. Mens eyes are also dymmed: the fyre gyueth not his natural bryghtnesse: and brasen vesselles and images are broken. Sumtime by reason of thicke cloudes, thunders and lyghtnynges are neyther seene or harde in such regions. Many other thinges more marueylous thē these hath nature wrought, which may seeme incredible to the ignorant: but easy to such as haue experience. In the furthest partes of Egypt and Trogloditica, the heate of the soonne is so extreme abowt noone,Extreme heate. that noo man can se hym that standeth by hym, by reason of the thicke ayer caused by the vapoures and exhalations raysed by the heate. None can go withowt shoos but haue theyr fiete suddeynly blystered and exulcerate. Such as are a thyrst, dye immediatly except they haue drynke at hande, the heate so faste consumeth the moysture of theyr bodyes. Meate put in brasen vesselles, is sodde in short space by the heate of the soonne withowt other fyre.The force of education. Yet they that are borne and browght vp in such regions, had rather wyllyngely susteyne these incommodities then bee inforced to lyue otherwyse: such a loue of theyr natiue countrey hath nature gyuen to all men: custome of continuance from younge yeares being also of force to ouer comme the maliciousnesse of the ayer. Neuerehelesse,Extreme heate & colde in A smale distance. these places of such contrary natures wherby suche strange effectes are caused, are not farre in sunder or diuided by any great distance. For, from the marysshes of Meotis or Meotides where certeyne Scythians dwell in extreme coulde,Frome Scythia to Ethiopia. many haue sayled with shyps of burden to Rodes in the space of ten dayes: and from thense to Alexandria in foure dayes. From whense passynge throwgh Egypte by the ryuer of Nilus, they haue

                of Metals.
            
               TO this booke of the Indies and nauigations I haue thowght good to adde the booke of metals, for three causes especially me mouynge: whereo
                  •
                the fyrst is, that it seemeth to me a thynge vndecent to reade so much of golde and syluer, and to knowe lyttle or nothynge of the naturall generation thereof, beinge neuerthelesse thynges not onely most desyred, but also such withowt the which at this age the lyfe of man can not bee passed ouer withowt many aduersities, forasmuch as pouertie is hatefull to all men, and vertue no further esteemed then it is supported by ryches, syth nowe that lady that reigned in Saturns dayes, is becomme the slaue to hym that was then her bondeman in that golden worlde, so named, not for the desyre that men had to golde, but for thinnocencie of lyuynge in those dayes, when Mars was of no poure, and men thought it crueltie by breakynge the bones of owre mother the earth, to open a way to the courte of infernal Pluto from thence to get golde and syluer the seedes of al mischiefes and angels of such a god, whom the antiquitie (not without good consyderation) paynted blynde, affirmynge also that of hym golde and syluer haue receaued the propertie to blynde the eyes of men. But syth it is nowe so that we shalbe inforced to seke ayde by that which was sumtymes a myschefe, it resteth to vse the matter as doo cunnynge phisitians that can mynister poyson in proportion with other thynges in such sort qualyfyinge the maliciousnesse therof, that none shall therby bee intoxicate. Forasmuch therfore as golde and syluer haue obteyned this prerogatiue that they are suche necessarie euyls

which the lyfe of man can not lacke withowt detriment, not only they but other metals also perhappes more necessarie althowgh not so precious, are thynges woorthy to bee better knowen then only by name, syth they are thinstrumentes of 
                  •
               ll artes, the prices of all thynges, the ornamentes of al dignities, and not the least portion of nature, wherby the contē
               plation of them is no lesse pleasaunte then necessary. But forasmuch as it is not here my intent to intreate much of metals, I wyll speake of the seconde cause: which is, that if in trauaylyng strang and vnknowen countreys any mans chaunce shalbe to arryue in such regions where he may knowe by thinformation of thinhabitauntes or otherwyse, that suche regions are frutefull of riche metals, he may not bee without sum iudgement to make further searche for the same. The thyrde cause is, that althowgh this owre realme of Englande be ful of metals not to bee contemned and much rycher then men suppose, yet is there fewe or none in Englande that haue anye greate skyll thereof, or any thynge wrytten in owr tounge, whereby men maye bee well instructed of the generation and fyndyng of the same: as the lyke ignorance hath byn amonge vs as touchynge Cosmographie and nauigations vntyll I attempted accordinge to the portion of my talent and simple lernynge to open the 
                  •
               yrst dore to the enteraunce of this knoweleage into owre language, wherin I wolde wyshe that other of greater lernynge wolde take sume peynes to accomplysshe and bringe to further perfection that I haue rudely begunne, not as an autour but a translatoure, leaste I bee iniurious to any man in ascrybyng to my selfe the trauayles of other. And wheras as concernynge the knowleage of metals, I was once mynded to haue translated into Englyshe the hole woorke of Pyrotechnia wherof I fynysshed .xxii. chapitures nowe more then three yeares sence, and lefte the copie therof in the handes of one of whom I coulde neuer get it ageyne (omyttynge to speake of other ingratitudes) I was therby discouraged to proceade any further in that woorke. Neuerthelesse, sythe this hystory of the Indies hath ministred occasion to intreate sumwhat of metals, I haue ageyne translated three of the fyrst chapitures of that booke, which seeme most necessary to bee knowen in this case. And hereof to haue sayde thus much in maner of a preface it may suffice.
         
         
            
            Of the generation of metalles and their mynes with the maner of fyndinge the same: written in the Italien tounge by Vannuccius Biringuczius in his booke cauled Pyrotechnia. To his louynge frende Master Bernardino Moncellese, greeting.
            
               WHereas I promysed yow to wrytte of the natures of metalles in particular, I am nowe inforced to declare euery thinge in generale, and especially of the places of their generation and their order, with the forme and maner of woorkynge in the same, and the instrumentes therto perteyninge. Yowe shall therefore vnderstande, that mynes of metalles are founde in the moste partes of the worlde, more or lesse according to the diligence of witti searchers: and shew them selues standinge in the grounde in maner in suche sorte as the veynes of bludde are disparsed in the bodies of lyuing beastes,The mineral tree. or like vnto the braunches of trees spredde foorth diuers wayes. Wherfor, the diligent searchers of mines, willing by a certeyne similitude declare howe the mynes are placed in the mountaynes, haue figured a greate tree full of branches planted in the myddeste of the base of a mountayne, frome the whyche are diriued dyuers and many bouwes and branches, sum greate and sum smaule, muche like vnto verye trees that are in owlde woddes.The mynes doo growe. They will also that in growynge, they euer ingrose them selues and reache towarde the heauen, conuertynge into theyr nature the moste disposed and neare matter, vntil the toppes of theyr braunches extend to the highest parte of the mountayne, and there shewe furthe theyr selues with manifeste apperaunce, puttinge furthe in the steade of bouwes and floures, certeyne fumosites of blewe or greene coloure, or marchasites with smaule veynes of ponderous matter,Marchasites. or suche other compositions of tinctures. And when by this means they shewe thē selues vnto vs, we may make firme coniecture that suche mountaynes are minerall, and that accordinge to the demonstrations they shewe more or lesse, they are richer or porer of myne. Therefore the searchers, according to thapperaunces which they fynde,Signes of metals. take good courage vnto them: and with hope and securitie of profecte, apply al their possible diligence with witte and expenses to digge or gette

owte such ethynges as the signes and owtewarde apperaunces declare vnto them. And by this maner of fynd
                  •
               nge of mynes, it hath often tymes chaunced that many haue byn exalted to the highest degree of riches. Wheras therfore by this meanes men enter into the mountaynes with the eys of consideration and right Iudgemente, and see the places where the mineralles are ingendered and comprehende in maner theire quantitie, they adapte theyr caues or fosses accordynge therevnto, wheras they shulde otherwyse wander by chaunce, because no man can by any other meanes knowe where the mines are in the mountaynes, although he were of neuer so good iudgement, and shulde make searche for the same neuer so curyously by litle & litle. It shal therfore in this case be necessary to folow the certificat & aperaūces of signes,Signes and tokens of metals. & to encoūtre the same as nere as may be, with eys & eares euer attentiue where they maye hope to fynde any tokens of metalles, especially by enquyringe of shepardes and other anciente inhabitauntes of such regions in the which
mineralls are engendered. And this I speake the rather for that I am perswaded that at the first sight of a mountaine,Mountaynes in the which metals are engendered. by reason of the greate barrennesse and roug
                  •
               nes therof, and also by reason of the great aboundance of waters that are engendered in the same, a right good iudgemente shall not suffice to coomme to certayne knoweleage that metall is contayned in such mountaynes, vntill the searchers haue with charges and trauail caused miners in sundry places to discouer the same. And therfore I also beleue that one man althowgh he bee neuer so stronge, wyttie, and farre castinge, shall not be able in a newe and straunge contreye, to searche by smaule portions not onlye all the mountaynes of one or moo prouinces which may bringe furth minerals, but shall with muche difficultie scarsely suffice to searche the secreates of only one mountayne:Ageynst seeky

But I wolde that these necromancers shulde tell me why this theire arte helpeth theym no further in the woorke after that they haue once founde the myne, if it be trewe that they say.Negromācie, Why (I say) doth it not helpe them furthe as at the begynnynge to fynde the myne, so consequently in the myddest and

But forasmuch as such effectes are so fearefull and terrible, that they owght not or can not be practised of al men, and also perhappes bycause such maner of woorkynge is not knowen, I thinke it not good to be vsed: but thinke rather by good reason that this arte is so much the more to be omytted and contemned, in howe much we are accustomed in the begynnyng

                of dyggynge of mynes, especially to caule for the grace of god that it may please hym to be presente with his ayde to owre doubtfull and traualious woorke. Lettynge passe therefore this deuylysshe diuise of such beastly and fearefull men, I exhorte yowe to folowe the practise by the foresayde signes minystred vnto yowe by the benignitie of nature, bothe grounded vppon the foundation of truth and approued by thexperience of many practicionars, not consystynge in woordes or promysses of thynges vayne and incōprehensible. With these signes therfore shall yow searche the bankes and sides of the valleys, with the clyffes and ryftes of the stones, and the backes, toppes, or ridges of the Montaynes: Also the beddes, chanels, and courses of ryuers, lookynge diligently amonge theyr sandes,The maner of searchyng for mynes. and the ruines of theyr fosses, amonge the whiche yow shall often tymes espie marchasites or smaule sparkes of mynes, or other dyuers tinctures of metals, whereby yow may be certified that certeyne mynes are in such places, which yowe shall exactly fynd by diligent and curious searchyng the clyffes of theyr ryftes and dry places. After these aduertisementes, take this for a generall signe,A generall signe. that all suche places and moūtaynes are mineral, owt of the which many springes and great abundaunce of crude water dooth isshewe, hauyng with theyr clearenes a certeyne minerall taste, and such as at variable seasons of the yeare chaunge theyr qualitie, beinge warme in the sprynge tyme and coulde in sommer. And this thynge owght yow to beleue the more when yow shall see the aspecte of such mountaynes to be rough,Rowgh and barren moun

wythered and dryed. And albeit that sumtymes also, mines are founde in mountaynes hauynge earth and frutefull trees in the toppes therof, yet are they for the most part found in such wherof we haue spoken. Of these other, there maye fewe signes be gyuen, except to go by lyttle and lyttle to seke the bankes of theyr sydes. But amonge all these, the best and most certeyne signe that may bee gyuen,The best signe. is wheras on the superficiall parte of the earth eyther on hyghe or belowe, the myne dooth shewe it selfe apparente to syght. Sum there are that for a good signe do greately commende the residences which certeyne waters make wher they haue rested for a time and beinge dryed vp of the heate of the sonne,The residēce of waters. do often times shewe in certeyne partes of theyr residencies dyuers tinctures of mynerall substaunce. Summe other are accustomed to take such waters, and in a vessell of earth or glasse or other matter, cause them to boyle and vapoure away vntyll the dregs or residence remayne in the bottome well dryed in the likenes of a grose earth, of the which they make an assaye eyther by the ordinarie tryall of fyer, or after sume other maner as lyketh them best. And by this meanes (althowgh they attayne not to thexacte knowleage of the truth) yet do they approche to a certeyne knowleage of the thyng wherby they haue sum intelligence of what sufficiencie and goodnesse the myne is which they seeke, before they be at any great charges in folowynge the same: Prouydynge alway that with all diligent aduertisement the places neare vnto the rootes of the confine mountaynes be curiously searched, with also the bankes and sydes of the selfe same mountayne, and all such superficiall partes therof, where any stones are founde discouered eyther of theyr owne proper nature or by the course of water: presupposynge euer that it is in maner impossible but that yf suche mountaynes contayne any mynes, they muste needes shewe furth sum floures, tinctures, or colours of theyr exhalations.Marchasit

                  tions. Yet yf it shulde so chaunce that they do not this, the goodnes of the mine may be the cause hereof forasmuche as eyther it is not of vaporable nature, or to be of smaule quantitie, or els perhappes bycause the mountayne is greate and the myne very low or so farre with in, that it is not sufficient to put furth any signes of fumosities. The cause also hereof maye bee that sum stone lyke vnto that cauled Albasano (which I thynke to be

of that kynde which we caule the greete stone) or blacke and whyte marble of thycke and resystynge nature, may be found to lye betwene and so to stoppe the passages,Metals in frutful mountaynes. that the sayde fumosities may therby be hyndered to arryue to the vppermoste parte of the earth: by reason wherof, it is possible that suche mountaynes may brynge furth trees and herbes forasmuche as the earth therof dooth reteyne his vertue and may nuryshe theyr rootes not beinge incinerate or burnte with hotte and venemous vapours of the mynes: so that the shoures of rayne or fluds with their courses can not cary away the earth as in such places wher the same is found sore dryed. And therfore vppon such mountaynes I haue seene great wooddes of chestnutte trees, beeches also and okes, with well cultured and frutfull fieldes. So that to conclude, by the signes of the rowghnesse or barennesse of the mountayne, is not taken away but that other places may also haue plentie of mines whiche ought to be searched and folowed. But forasmuch as these signes are of the natures of minerals, I wyll speake more determinately of theym in the places where I entreate of theyr proper mynes: Not intendynge here to saye muche of these thynges in generall, but only to induce yow to sum clearnesse of the fyrst lyght. And therfore that yow may gyue the more diligent aduertisment, I saye vnto yowe that all the mynes which yow shall fynde by such signes, by what meanes so euer they shall coome to yowre handes, whether they be found in stones,howe the signes are to bee consydered. earth, or sande, after that at the fyrste syght they haue shewed them selues to bee mynes of metals, yow owght to consyder of what ponderositie or weyght they are: The which the greater that it is, so much the more dooth it shewe both the perfection and goodnesse of the substaunce, and also the more quantitie of the mine. And thus presupposyng that by the signes or other meanes yow haue founde the mine, not yet fully perceauynge of what kynde of metall it myght be, to certifie yowe hereof and also of what quantitie it is, or howe it is accompanyed or myxt with other, or lykewyse of what puritie it is of it selfe, or of what euyll disposition or malice it is founde to bee, it shall herein be necessary before yow be at any further charges therwith, to proue the same by twoo or three assayes or mo,The assay of the mines. as I wyll further declare in the particular place of assayes. Beinge therfore certifyed of the myne,

and of what metall it is, and also what quantitie it conteyneth, fyndynge it by accompte to bee so profitable as to beare the charges, I exhorte yowe bouldely to gyue the fyrste attempte to faule to mynynge, and with all possible diligence to folowe yowr enterpryse: assurynge yowre selfe, that of what so euer mynerall matter yow shall take assay accordyng to the proportion of that pice which yow tooke of the vppermost or owtmost parte of the mine for that purpose, yow shall fynde that to bee muche better and rycher whiche is further within the mountayne.The richer myne further within the montayne. And thus being certified by the assay of what quantitie the thynge is that appered by the signes, and of all other reasonable consyderations apperteynyng to the worke, yow shall with all celeritie dispose yowr selfe to faule to dyggynge, to thintent that yowe may shortely eyther here enioye the frute of yowre trauell, or els where with better successe proue yowre good fortune.

Yet who so consydereth the thynge well, shall vnderstande that the later myners haue better conceaued the reason of this woorke, in respecte (as is to see) of many more commodities and securities which insue rather of this maner of woorkynge then of the other: as the difficultie to descende and ascende the caue, & the daungiour lest it bee stopped vp by many ruines, bysyde the traualyous labour to draw owt the mine with the rockes & fragmentes of stones: And aboue al thynges, that they shal not bee able to drawe owt the waters whiche are often tymes so abundaunt that they greatly increase the charges and trauayles of the patrones of the mynes by reason of the greate ayde and helpe which shalbe requisite to haue in that case and also for the makynge of wheeles, troughes, pypes, & pumpes,Abundanu

                betweene Isprue and Alla where I contynued manye yeares, I sawe a large vale enuironed with a greate number of mountaynes,Mynes of copper and leade holdīg syluer. by the middest wherof a ryuer passed through of greate aboundaunce of water: and in maner in all the montaynes that are there abowt, is digged great plentie of mine, wherof the moste parte are of copper or leade, althoughe also in maner euery of them is founde to holde sum portion of siluer. Amonge these mountaynes, I sawe one in the whyche thinhabitauntes of the countrey dwellyng there abowt, allured by the sight of many signes, beganne to digge a caue after the maner wherof we haue spoken: In so muche that (as it appered vnto me) from the place where they begane the caue, they had digged litle lesse then two myles before they sawe any sparke or shadowe of any myne And beinge arryued with the caue in maner perpendicularly vnder the signes they folowed,A caue of two myles. they were encountered with a veyne of the harde stone cauled Albazano, of a yarde and a halfe thicke, which they passed through with greate trauayle and longe tyme, and with the helpe of commodious instrumentes of iren hardened to woorke in suche stones. And when they had thus passed through this quarrey of stone,A large caue of the myne of copper holdinge siluer. they chaunced vppon a verye great veyne of the myne of copper of such sorte that when I was there, lookinge betweene the one and the other, I sawe on euery syde as it were a waule of the hard stone of Albazano, and therin a voyde place of suche largenes from the one syde to the other that more then two hundreth men al at one time,

had sufficiente roome to stande labouringe frome the hygheste parte to the lowest, hauynge non other lyght then of candells,Candle light. and makinge certeyne markes in euery place where they saw the vre or myne shewe it selfe: and thus ceased not to woorke continually both day and nyght, course by course, a thynge suerly maruelous to be holde. Without the mouth of the caue, I sawe great abundaunce of mine partely mixt with the stone of the vre, and partely chosen and seperated. Amonge these pieces, there was one consistynge of a hole masse of pure mine of suche biggnes and weyght,A greate masse of pure myne. that two good horses with a light carre coulde scarsely drawe it away. This myne was of copper as I haue sayde. But to magnifie it, they cauled it syluer, bycause it helde suche plentie thereof that it surmounted the charges, whereas they had also the copper for aduantage. Yowe shall further vnderstond that in the myddest of the caue, there was a chanell or gutter whyche gathered togyther the waters that fell into it continually on euery syde from the ruptures or broken places and cliffes.Abundaunce of water in the mynes. These waters ranne through the chanel with so vehemente a streme, that I suerly beleue that it might well suffice to dryue and greate mylle.

By reason wherof, such men of vnderstandynge as haue searched the natures of these thynges, argue hereby and take it for a generall rule,A general rule. that all those mountaynes owt of the whiche spryngeth great abundaunce of water, doo also abounde with myne. The which thynge well consyderynge, and weyinge the greatnes hereof, I faule into this accompte with my selfe, that if to the patrones of the sayde caue, the charges of the same hadde byn a hynderaunce or greefe, eyther for the length therof, or for despayre that they shuld not haue found that they sought, they wolde surely haue forsaken it. And beinge nowe comme to this harde stone after they had susteyned so great charges bysyde the trauayle both of mynde and body, if they shulde then haue lefte of theyr enterpryse,Great rich is obtayned by searchinge of mynes. they shulde not haue come to such ryches whereby they haue obteyned

Neyther yet shulde they haue byn so wel able to helpe theyr poore neyghbours as they haue doone by the meanes of the valientnesse of theyr constant myndes and persistynge in so good and commendable an enterprise. Wherfore to conclude, yow that wyll begynne to attempt any such thynge,Magnanimitie & paciēce. must be of good courage and much pacience to folowe that yow haue begunne, at the least vntill yow knowe by the signes what the thynge is: hopinge euer that in goynge forwarde, the day folowynge (as it is possible) shal discouer the thynge that yowe seeke and content your desyre: Wherof yow may bee the better assured, if yow well consyder that the moothers and matrices of moste estemed ryches, and the myntes of al treasures, are the mountaynes:The mounta

The whiche way surely is muche rather to be folowed, then eyther the warres full of trowbles and miserie, or the carefull trade of marchaundies with wanderynge abowt the worlde, or suche other fastidious cares perhappes vnlawfull for a good man.

And yet shal not this only suffice withowt sufficiencie of money able to susteyne the charges and continue the woorke: to thende that if yow can not fynysshe it with yowr owne expenses, yow maye supplye the same by the ayde of other, eyther patrones or parteners. But let vs nowe cease to reason any further of these thinges.

Presupposyng therfore that yow haue alredy passed the charges, and haue not only founde the myne yow sought, but also haue brought furth to lyght a great quantitie therof, it shal then bee needeful (as a thyng chiefely to be consydered before yow begin to dygge) wel to ponder & examen both the cōmodities of such thynges as shall occurre,Necessarie aduertismētes. and also of such wherof yow shall haue neede: as tymber and woodde of all sortes, with water and vyttayles: of all the whiche, yow must haue great plentie: and especially of woodde,Plentye o

Diligent consideration must lykewyse be had to the situacion of the place where the buyldynges shalbe erected:The situaciō of the place. as that the plotte therof bee commodious with abundaunce of water hauynge a good faule. Also not onely of plentie of woodde and cole nere vnto the myne, but of such as may serue the turne. And of all other incommodities, yowe muste chiefely auoyde the lacke of water,The vse of water, as a thynge of greatest importaunce and most necessarie in this effecte. For by the force and weyght of the course hereof, wheeles and dyuers other ingenious instrumentes are adapted with ease to lyfte vppe greate bellowes to make fyers of great poure, to beate with hammers of great weyght, and to turne myghtie and stronge eugens, by the force whereof the trauayles of men are so much furthered, that withowt such helpe, it were in maner impossible to ouercome suche tedious trauayles or to arryue to the ende of the woorke, forasmuch as the force of one wheele may lyfte more, and that more safely then the paynefull labour of a hundreth men. It shal therfore be needefull to haue great consyderation hereof, not only to make these edifies or houses of office, but also to make them commodious for the purpose, as for the cariage of myne and cole with other necessaries. For if any of these effectes shulde be wantynge, the coste, tyme and trauayle, shulde bee cast away: forasmuch as these thynges doo so much the more relieue the one the other as they are ioyned togyther,Necessarye considerat

owght to wey with yowr selfe which of the twoo serueth for mo necessarie vses, as eyther to haue the cole or the mine most commodious to the houses, and accordinge there vnto to place the houses nere vnto the same if the commoditie of water wyll so permytte.
            Albeit, if it were possible, it shulde be much better if al these necessarie commodities were ioyned togyther, whereas otherwyse yowe muste contente yowre selfe as occasion serueth. Nowe therefore to conclude, bysyde that whiche I haue declared vnto yow of the findinge of the myne and the digging thereof with other considerations, I exhorte yowe further to faule to practyse with sum myne of your owne, that yow may therby take occasion to ryse to the degree of ryches whyche yow desire. And therfore I aduertise yow that after yow haue founde the mountayne and begun to digge, yow shal euer go forwarde with a boulde mynde and stoute corage, woorkyng with witte and Iudgement, forasmuche as in this effecte the one serueth the other in the steede of eys to enter where they can not. Gyue no credit to that whiche many ignorante folkes doo say and beleue,A false opiniō
                affirminge that in digging for metals, they are founde rather by chaunce then by arte. The which although it were trewe, yet owght we to trust more to art and practyse then to chaunce. And when yow are nowe entered into the mountayne, beare well in memory that yow haue presently with yow the tallie or ruler of the caue, wherby yowe may trauerse the veyne of the myne when yow are coomne to it.The trauersinge of the veyne. For if yow shulde folowe it by the course as it lyeth, it is possible that yowe mighe folowe it a greate way not paste the biggnesse of a mans finger and perhappes lesse: By reason wherof, it might happen that yow shuld lose it and neuer find it ageyne. The like shuld chaunce vnto yow if after that yow haue begun to digge a caue, it shulde repent yow of the charges, and that for the basnes therof yowe shulde forsake it, as many haue doone who bycause they coulde not fynde the mine at the first stroke,Continuaunce in the worke. despayringe that they shulde neuer fynde it, haue forsaken it as a thyng vnprofitable, thynking that they haue woonne enough in that they were not at further charges with that which they accompt losse and domage: And thus furiously leaue of their enterprise, not regardinge that they may leaue the frute of theyr expenses and trauaile to an other

that may folowe their begynninges, and perhappes fynde the myne within the distance of a cubet, a spanne, or a finger. We may say therfore that suche men doo willinglye forsake theyr good fortune as many haue doone. He therfore that hath begune to digge a caue, let hym determine to folowe it, puttinge away thestimation of the basenes therof, and not to feare the streyghtnesse of the way, but rather to applye all his possible diligence withowt remorse, hopynge thereby no lesse to obteyne honour and ryches, then to auoyde shame and infamie for omyttynge so profitable an enterpryse. And that yow may the more circumspectly behaue yowr selfe in all thynges, besyde the former instructions, I further aduertise yowe to set euer fresshe men a woorke by course in such order,Fresshe mē. that in euery sixte or eyght houres (accordynge to the number of the myners) yow appoynt such to the woorke as haue reposed or taken theyr rest, that yow may by this meanes the sooner come to thende yow desyre, whereunto (after yowe haue layde so sure a fundation) I exhorte yow to runne withowt a brydle. And wheras to these effectes it shalbe necessarie to haue many instrumentes adapted for the purpose, I can none otherwyse speake of them then in generall, consyderynge that according to the nature of the place and the myne, it shalbe necessary to vse instrumentes and iren tooles of dyuers formes,Instrumētes. as there ought to be difference in such wherwith yow shall dygge in mynes engendered in marble, greete stone, and harde freese stone, or such other. For the dyggynge of such as are found in deade and tender stones, as Alabaster and marle, it is requisite to haue apte and stronge instrumentes, as greate beetels, mattockes and spades of iren, also great & longe crowes of iren to lyfte great burdens: lykewyse greate and smaule picke axes sum of iren and sum of steele: furthermore greate maules with handels and withowt handels, and such other bothe of iren and fine steele hardened, if the hardenes of stone shall so requyre. But as for such as shall serue to dygge the mynes which are engendered in tender and softe stones, I neede make no mention of them, forasmuch as the tooles of the common sorte may suffice, and necessitie shall dayly furthe instructe yow to diuise such as shal serue for yowre purpose. Albeit, for the moste parte, they are beetels, maules, mattockes, pikes, shouels, spades, and such lyke. But as well for

the softe stones as for the harde, it shalbe necessarye to haue great plentie of al sortes, to thende that the myners may lose no tyme, and that the woorke may go the better forwarde to the comfort of the patrones of the mine. Bysyde these before named, it shall also be requisite to haue plentie of greate baskettes, spades, sh

It shall furthermore be requisite to haue greate quantitie of vnctuous liquours to maītayne fire:Fyre in the caue. as are the oiles of oliues, of nuttes, of line seede and hempe seede: Lykewise the rootes of putrified trees, or talowe of beastes, or fatte and oyle of fysshes. For withowt the lyght of fyre, it is not possible for the labourers to woorke:The cōueyance of eyer. Nor yet can any fyre be mayntayned in the caue except it receaue the ayer by sum respiracle or breathynge place by the meanes of a funnell or trunke of woodde or such other open instrument wherby the ayer maye be conueyed into the caue.

By reason wherof, I also the more to honour it, wyll fyrst speake of this before I entreate of any other metall, and declare in particular the conception with the most apparēt qualities therof. The which although it be a metal most knowen, desyred also and sought for of all kyndes of men, yet are there not many that do care to knowe of what substaunce or natural mixtion it consisteth. But that yow shulde not be one of theim that knowe it onely by name or by superficiall apparence,The orginall & substaunce of golde. I certifie yow that the originall and proper matter therof, is none other then elementall

substaunces with equall quantitie and qualitie proportionate the one with the other, most perfectly purified by the subtyle woorke of nature. For of these beinge thus ioyned togyther (and of equall force) is engendered an am

The which (as I haue sayd) by his much temperatenes, purenes, and perfect mixtion, is condensate and made thicke, in such sorte that the elementes therof can not be vnbounde or loosed, so that it remayneth in maner incorruptible: The cause wherof is, that it eyther conteyneth in it no maner of super

Lykewyse the sayde perfecte vnion or mixtion, causeth it to be a body withowt steame, and withowt vnctuous or fat superfluitie:The bewtie of golde. which is the cause that it euer remayneth in the natiue bryghtnes and fayrenes of coloure, in so much that when it is rubbed vppon any thynge, it leaueth not behynde it the tincture of any blacke or yelowe colour, as doo in maner all other metals: Nor yet hath it any taste or sauour that may be perceaued to the sence. Furthermore, if it be eaten eyther wyllyngly or by chaunce, it is not venemous to the lyfe of man, as are sum of the other metals: but is rather a medicine curynge dyuers diseases.Golde is medicinable. In so much that nature hath gyuen vnto it of peculiar propertie, a vertue and priuileage to conforte the weakenes of the harte, and to gyue ioyfulnes and myrth to the spirits, disposynge thereby the mynde to magnanimitie and attemptes of great enterpryses.Golde is confortable. Which singular qualities, sum wyse men affirme that it hath receaued by thinfluence of the sonne, and that it is therfore of such grace and poure to helpe men: especially such

as haue many great bagges and chesses full therof. To conclude therfore, this metall is a body tractable and bryght, of coloure lyke vnto the soonne: And hath in it inwardely such a naturall attractiue or allurynge vertue, that beinge seene, it greatly disposeth the myndes of men to desyre it and esteme it as a thyng most precious:The attractiue qualitie of golde. although many there are whiche crye owt ageynst it and accuse it as the roote and sede of most pestiferous and monstrous couetousnesse, and the cause of many other myscheues. But whether it bee the cause of more good or euyll, we entende to lette passe this disputation as a thynge vnprofitable. To proceade therfore as I haue begun I say (as before) that the woorthynesse whiche is founde in it, hath caused me to entreate of it before any other metall. And this the rather for that thorder of this presente worke meth so to requyre, that I may the better descende to the degrees of other metals, to thende that in these owre partes of Italy, yow may haue sum instruction of practise, whiche may redounde from yow to other, whereby the myndes of all men may receaue sum lyght: beinge well assured that newe informations, wilbe the seedes of other newe wittie diuises in the vnderstandynges of suche men as with these keys shall open theyr wyttes to arryue to suche places whyther they can not els coomme or by any meanes approche. And nowe therfore, bysyde that which I haue sayde vnto yowe in generall, I wyl further in particular declare the nature hereof and the generation of the same, with also the signes whiche it sheweth furth, that I do not omytte any thynge. Last of all, I wyll shewe yowe howe it owght to bee pourged from superfluous earthynes of the mine, after that I shal haue expressed the maner howe it is founde.

And herein may yow not do as in Lapis Laxuli, or other stones, or as the maner is to do with that which is found in the sāds of ryuers: the which the more it is wasshed, the more it fauleth to the bottome: & in meltynge with the mother of his earthines, doth incorporat it selfe therwith in a brickle substāce But in fine,Ryuers in the which gold is founde. with much pacience and by one meanes or an other, or by the helpe of quickesyluer, it is drawen owt.

But not euery where in the beddes of theyr chanels, but in certeyne particular places where in certeyne cloddes the sande is discouered in the tyme of the ouerflowynge of the ryuers when the water leaueth behynde it a fine sande wherwith the sayde golde is myxte in the forme of certeyne smaule scales,The wasshīg and pourgeing

And this is the exacte maner of drawynge golde owt of the sandes of riuers, which many haue vsed to theyr great commoditie: And that the rather bycause that in folowyng this order of woorke in the pourgynge and diuydynge of golde, it shall not bee requisite as in other maner of practises, to bee at greate charges by reason of many men which shall be needefull,From whēse golde is deriued into the sandes of ryuers. with manye murals, fornaces, fiers, and dyuers artificers: wheras in woorkyng after this sorte, one man may suffice with one table and one holowe shoouell, with a lyttle quickesyluer and sufficient abundaunce of water. But lettyng passe to speake any further of these thynges: perhappes summe man wolde here demaunde from whense this golde is deryued into the sandes of the sayde ryuers, and whether it be browght thyther by the water, or engendered there. As touchynge which question, I haue oftē tymes deliberated with my selfe not withowt great marueyle: and especially of that which is founde in the sandes of the ryuers of Tesino, Adda, and Po, bicause (wheras I haue sayde before that it is browght thyther by the course of the water) I can not perceaue from whense it shuld be browght, forasmuch as there is no myne of golde, or of any other metal that is knowen, nere to any of those places. By reason wherof, my iudgemente is in maner confounded, seinge also that it is thoppinion of certeyne wryters, that it is engendered euen where it is founde: The which, if it so be, it is not trewe that it is browght thyther by the water. Ageyne, if it be engendered there, it seemeth to me a dyfficult thyng to comprehend whether it be brought furthe there by the vertue of the water or the earth, or the heauen.That golde is not engendered in the 
                        •
                     andes of riuers. If furthermore any of these shuld be the cause of the generation hereof, it seemethe agreable to reason that it shulde bee both founde and engendered through owt all the beddes of such riuers, and at al tymes. And if the influence of heauen be the most prepotent cause of this effecte, then it seemeth to me that it shuld woorke immediatly, bicause it can not otherwyse obserue thorder whiche nature vseth in the generation of metals: fyrst brynginge it furth to the open

shewe, in the place where aboundeth the continuall isshewe of water, which owght also to be of such force as to remoue the earthy substaunce thereof from place to place, and not to intermixte such great inequalitie of couldenesse and moistnes. And albeit that this composition begunne in this order, shuld not be disseuered or broken by the waters of the ryuers, yet it appeareth to me that the showers of rayne and increase of fiuddes, shulde be of sufficient poure to distemper, breake, and vtterly destroy all such compositions as shulde be engendered in such places, forasmuch as al thynges are conceaued by rest and quietnesse after the commixtion of the fyrste elementes. And therfore if this golde of the ryuers, bee there engendered where it is founde, I wolde it were declared vnto me why it is engendered only in these places and not in other: and why in lyke maner, syluer, copper, leade, or any other metals are not also engendered there as well as golde, beinge matters of an easyer composition of nature then it is, by reason of the perfecte vnitie and concordaunce with puritie of substaunce & perfecte concoction which is in golde aboue all other metals: whereas also in many places in the territories of Rome, there are founde many sparkes of the mine of

                  ren of blacke colour amonge the sandes of certeyne smaule ryuers: And yet these only in certeyne particular places of the sayde riuers: wherby it appeareth that these also, shulde not bee engendered where they are founde. By all which reasons and apparent effectes, it seemeth most agreable to truth that the golde which is foūd in such sandes,This mater is apparent ī the golde founde in the ryuers in the Indies. is rather brought thyther by the water, then engendered there. And therefore to declare my mynde more playnely herein, I suppose that this chaunceth only in great ryuers which receaue abundaunce of waters of dyuers springes, fosses, and other ryuers, engendered partly of the meltynge of snowe and partly of great showers of rayne, whiche faulyng in certeyne chanels from the toppes and sydes of minerall mountaynes, wasshe away parte of the earth of theyr bankes and the ouerchanginge and holowe rockes which may conteyne the substaunce of golde:The

Yet consyderynge thautoritie of so greate a clerke, with the force of the superiour causes and the maruelous poure of nature, I had rather gyue fayth hereto then rasshely to contemne the iudgement of so greate a clarke.

               THat these vyages to Guinea are placed after the booke of Metals as separate from other vyages, the cause hereof is, that after I had delyuered the sayde booke of metalles to the handes of the printers, I was desyred by certeyne my frendes to make summe mention of these viages, that sum memorie therof myght remayne to owr posteritie if eyther iniquitie of tyme consumynge all thinges, or ignoraunce creepynge in by barbarousnesse and contempte of knoweleage, shulde hereafter bury in obliuion so woorthy attemptes, so much the greatlyer to bee estemed as before neuer enterprysed by Englysshe men, or at the leaste so frequented as at this present they are and may bee to the greate commoditie of owre marchauntes, if the same be not hyndered by thambision of such as for the conquestynge of fortie or fyftie myles here and there, and erectynge of certeyne fortresses or rather blockhouses amonge naked people,Ambition▪
                thinke thē selues woorthy to bee lordes of halfe the worlde, enuying that other shulde enioy the commodities which they them selues can not holy possesse. And although such as haue byn at charges in

               uilegies, preeminencies, and tributes for the same, yet (to speake vnder correction) it may seeme sumwhat rigorous and ageynst good reason and conscience, or rather ageynst the charitie that owght to bee amonge Chrysten men, that such as violentely inuade the dominions of other, shuld not permit other frendely to vse the trade of marchandies in places neuer or seldome frequented of them, wherby theyr trade is not hindered in such places where they them selues haue at theyr owne election appoynted the martes of theyr trafike. But forasmuche as at this presente it is not my intent to accuse or defend, approue or improue, I wil cease to speake any further hereof, and proceade to the descrip

               iō of the fyrst viage as briefely and faythfully as I was aduertised of the same by thinformation of such credible persons as made diligent inquisition to knowe the truth hereof as much as shalbe requisite, omyttynge to speake of many particular thynges not greatly necessarie to be knowen: whiche neuerthelesse with also thexact course of the nauigation, shal be more fully declared in the second vyage. And if herein fauoure or frendshyppe shall perhappes cause sum to thinke that sum haue byn sharpely touched, let them laye a parte fauoure and frendshippe and gyue place to truth, that honest men may receaue prayse for well doinge, and lewde persons reproche as the iust stipende of theyr euyll desertes, whereby other may bee deterred to do the lyke, and vertuous men encouraged to proceade in honest attemptes.
            But that these vyages may bee more playnely vnderstode of al men, I haue thowght good for this purpose before I intreate hereof, to make a breefe description of Affrica beinge that greate parte of the worlde,Africa. on whose Weste syde begynneth the coast of Guinea at Cabo Uerde abowte the .xii. degrees in latitude on this syde the Equinoctiall line,The coast of Guinea. and two degrees in longitude from the measurynge line, so runnynge from the north to the south and by east in sum places within v.iiii. and .iii. degrees and a halfe within the Equinoctiall, and so furth in maner directly east and by north for the space of .xxxvi. degrees or there abowt in longitude from the West to the East, as shall more playnely appere in the descryption of the seconde vyage.
            
               
               ¶ A breefe description of Affrike.
               
                  IN Affrica the lesse are these kyngedomes: The kyngedome of Tunes and Constantina which is at this day vnder Tunes,Tunnes. and also the region of Bugia,Bugia. Tripoli,Tri

                     •
                  zzab. This part of Afrike is very baren by reason of the great desertes, as the desertes of Numidia and Barcha.Numidia. The principall portes of the kyngedome of Tunes are these: Goletta, Bizerta, Portofarnia, Boua, and Stora. The chiefe cities of Tunes, are Constantia and Boua with dyuers other.Ilandes of Tunnes. Under this kyngedome are many Ilandes, as Zerbi, Lampadola, Pantalarea, Limoso, Beit, Gamelaro, and Malta where at this presente is the greate master of the Rodes.Malta. Under the southe of this of kyngdome, are the great desertes of Libia.The disertes of Libia. Al the nations this Africa the lesse, are of the secte of Machomet and a rusticall people lyuynge scattered in vyllages. The beste of this parte of Afrike, is Barbaria lyinge on the coaste of the sea Mediterraneum.Barbarie.
               
               Mauritania (nowe cauled Barbaria) is diuided into two partes,Mauritania. as Mauritania Tingitania, and Cesariensis. Mauritania Tingitania, is nowe cauled the kyngdome of Fes and the kyngedome of Marrocko. The principall citie of Fes, is cauled Fessa: and the chiefe citie of Marrocko,The kingdōs of Fes and ma
                        •
                     rock. is named Marrocko. Mauritania Cesariensis is at this day cauled the kyngedome of Tremisen,Tremesin. with also the citie cauled Tremisen or Telensin. This region is full of desertes, and reacheth to the sea Mediterraneum to the citie of Oram with the porte of Massaquiber.Oram.
                  Nassaquiber The kyngedome of Fes reachethe vnto the Ocean sea from the West to the citie of Argilla: and the porte of the sayde kyngedome is cauled Salla.Sa

                     la.
               
               The kyngedome of Marrocko is also extended aboue the Ocean sea vnto the citie of Azamor and Azafi whiche are aboue the Ocean sea towarde the West of the sayde kyngdome.Azamor. In Mauritania Tingitanea (that is to say in the two kyngedomes of Fes and Marrocko) are in the sea, the Ilandes of Canarie cauled in owlde time the fortunate Ilandes.The Ilandes of Canarie. Toward the south of this region, is the kyngedome of Guinea,Guinea. with Senega, Iaiofo, Gambra, and manye other regions of the blacke Moores cauled Ethiopians or Negros,Ethiopians. all whiche are watered with the ryuer Negro cauled in owlde tyme Niger.

In the sayde regions are no cities: but only certeyne lowe cotages made of bouwes of trees plastered with chauke and couered with strawe: In these regions are also very great desertes.
               The kyngedome of Marrocko hath vnder it these seuen kyngedomes: Hea, Sus, Guzula, the territorie of Marrocko,Marrocko. Duchala, Hazchora, and Telde. The kyngedome of Fes hath as many: as Fes,Fes. Temesne, Azgar, Elabath, Errifi, Garet, and Eicauz. The kyngedome of Tremisen hath these regions:Tremesin. Tremisen, Tenez, and Elgazaet, all which are Machometistes. But all the regions of Guinea are pure Gentyles and Idolatours withowt profession of any religion or other knowleage of god then by the lawe of nature.Guinea.
               
               Africa the great,Africa the great. is one of the three partes of the worlde knowen in owlde tyme and seuered from Asia, on the East by the ryuer Nilus: On the West, from Europe by the pillers of Hercules. The hyther part is nowe cauled Barbarie, and the people Moores. The inner parte is cauled Libia and Ethiopia. Afrike the lesse is in this wyse bounded:Affrike the lesse. On the west it hath Numidia: On the east Cyrenaica: On the north, the sea cauled Mediterraneum. In this countrey was the noble citie of Carthage.Carthage.
               
               In the East syde of Afrike beneth the redde sea, dwelleth the greate and myghtye Emperour and Chrystian kynge Prester Iohan,Prester Iohn. well knowen to the Portugales in theyr vyages to Calicut. His dominions reache very farre on euery syde: and hath vnder hym many other kynges both Chrystian and hethen that pay hym trybute. This myghty prince is cauled Dauid Themperour of Ethiopia. Sum wryte that the kynge of Portugale sendeth hym yearely .viii. shyppes laden with marchaundies. His kyngedome confineth with the redde sea, and reacheth farre into Afrike towarde Egypte and Barbarie. Southwarde it confineth with the sea towarde the cape de Buona Speranza:Cape de Buona Speranza. and on the other syde with the sea of sande cauled Mare de Sabione,
                  The sea of sande. a very daungerous sea, lyinge betwene the great citie of Alcaer or Cairo in Egypte and the countrey of Ethiopia:Alcair. In the whiche way are many vnhable desertes continuinge for the space of fyue dayes iorney. And they affirme that if the sayde Chrystian Emperour were not hyndered by those desertes (in the which is great lacke of vittayles

and especially of water) he wolde or nowe haue inuaded the kyngedome of Egypte and the citie of Alcayer. The chiefe citie of Ethiope where this great Emperour is resydent, is cauled Amacaiz beinge a fayre citie, whose inhabitauntes are of the coloure of an olyue. There are also many other cities, as the citie of Saua vppon the ryuer of Nilus where Themperoure is accustomed to remayne in the soommer season. There is lykewyse a great citie named Barbaregaf: And Ascon from whense it is sayde that the queene of Saba came to Ierusalem to heare the wysdome of Salomon.From whēse the queene of Saba came. This citie is but lyttle, yet very fayre and one of the chiefe cities in Ethiope. In the sayde kyngdome is a prouince cauled Manicongni,Manicongni. whose kynge is a Moore and tributarie to Themperour of Ethiope. In this prouince are many excedynge hyghe mountaynes vppon the which is sayde to be the earthly Paradyse:The earthly Paradyse. And sum say that there are the trees of the soonne and moone whereof the antiquitie maketh mention:The trees of the soonne and moone. Yet that none can passe thyther by reason of greate desertes of a hundreth dayes iorney. Also beyonde these mountaynes, is the cape of Buona Speranza. And to haue sayde thus much of Afrike it may suffice.
            
            
               ¶ The fyrst vyage of Guinea.
               
                  IN the yeare of owre Lorde .M.D.LIII. the xii. day of August, sayled from Porchemouth two goodly shyppes, the Primrose and the Lion,The prymrose
                  The Lyon. with a pynnesse cauled the moone:The Moone beinge all well furnysshed aswell with men of the lustiest sorte to the number of seuen score, as also with ordinaunce and vyttayles requisite to such a vyage: Hauynge also two capitaynes, the one a straunger cauled Antoniades Pinteado a Portugale,Pinteado. borne in a towne named the porte of Portugale, a wyse, discrete, and sober man, who for his cunnynge in saylynge beinge aswell an expert pylot as polytyke capitayne, was sumtyme in great fauoure with the kynge of Portugale, and to whom the coastes of Brasile and Guinea were commytted to bee kepte from the Frenchemen to whom he was a terroure on the sea in those partes:Brasile.
                  Guinea. and was furthermore a gentleman of the kinge his masters house. But as fortune in maner neuer fauoureth but flattereth,The flatteryng of fortune. neuer

promyseth but deceaueth, neuer rayseth but casteth downe ageyne, and as great wealth and fauour hath alwayes companions emulation and enuie, he was after many aduersites and quarels made ageynst hym, inforced to come into Englande: where in this golden vyage he was euyll matched with an vnequall coompanion and vnlyke matche of most sundry qualities and conditions with vertues few or none adourned, with vices dyuers and many fowly spotted,The euel conditions of Wyndam. knowen of many with out profyte, and desyred of fewe or none for his wyckednes: whose smaule acquayntaunce was profitable to all men, and his familiar conuersation an vndoinge, that happye was the man or woman that knewe hym not, he for his gooddes and shee for her name. In fine, vnfortunate was the coompany that had owght to doo with hym: in so much that it was no maruayle that so goodly an enterpryse with so noble a furniture of men, shyppes, and ordina
                     ••
                  ce of all sortes, with all kynde of vyttayles and that of so

                  reat abundaunce, had so smaul successe: which could be none otherwyse wher so foule a spotte dyd blemysshe, ye rather deface the rest. Thus departed these noble shyppes vnder sayle on theyr vyage. But first this capitayne Wyndam, puttyng furth of his shyp at Porchmouth, a kynseman of one of the headde marchauntes, and shewynge herein a muster of the tragical partes he had conceaued in his brayne, and with such smaule begynninges nurysshed so monstrous a byrth, that more happy, yea and blessed was that younge man beinge lefte behynde then if he had byn taken with them, as sum doo wysshe he had doonne the lyke by theyrs. Thus sayled they on theyr vyage vntyl they came to the Ilandes of Madera where they toke in certeyne wynes for the store of theyr shyppes,The Ilandes of Madera. and payde for them as they agreed of the price. At these Ilandes they met with a great galion of the kynge of Portugale full of men and ordinaunce:A galeon of the kinge of Portugale. yet suche as coulde not haue preuayled if it had attempted to withstande or resyst owre shyppes, for the which cause it was set furth, not only to lette and interrupte these owre shyppes of theyr purposed vyage, but all other that shulde attempte the lyke. Yet chiefely to frustrate owre vyage. For the kyng of Portugale was sinisterly informed that owre shyppes were armed to his castel of Mina in these parties,The castel of Mina. wheras nothing lesse was ment.
               
                  After that owr shyppes departed from the Ilandes of Madera forwarde on theyr vyage, began this woorthy capitaine Pinteados sorowe as a man tormented with the company of a terrible hydra who hytherto flattered with hym and made hym a fayre countenance and shewe of loue.howe Wyndā abused Pinteado. Then dyd he take vppon hym to commaunde all alone, settynge nowght bothe by capitayne Pinteado with the reste of the marchaunte factours: sumtymes with opprobrious woordes and sumtymes with threatenynges most shamefully abusynge them, takinge from Pinteado the seruice of the boys and certeyne mariners that were assigned hym by thorder and direction of the woorshypfull marchauntes, and leauynge hym as a common maryner, which is the greatest despite and greefe that can be to a Portugale or Spanyarde to be diminysshte theyr honoure which they esteeme aboue all rychesse. Thus saylyng forward on theyr vyage, they came to the Ilandes of Canarie,The Ilandes of Canarie. continuynge theyr course from thense vntyll they arryued at the Ilande of saynt Nicolas where they vyttayled them selues with fresshe meate of the flesshe of wylde goates whereof is great plentie in that Ilande and in maner of nothynge else.The Ilande of. s.

From hense folowynge on theyr course, and taryinge here and there at the deserte Ilandes in the waye, bycause they wolde not coome to tymely to the countrey of Guinea for the heate,Guinea. and taryinge sumwhat to longe (for what can bee wel mynystred in a common wealth where inequalitie with tyrannie wyll rule alone) they came at the length to the fyrst lande of the countrey of Guinea where they fell with the great ryuer of Sesto where they myght for theyr marchaundies haue laden theyr shyppes with the graynes of that countrey,The ryuer of 
                        •

                  Graynes. which is a very hotte frute, and much lyke vnto a fygge as it groweth on the tree. For as the fygges are full of smaule seedes, so is the sayde frute ful of graynes which are lose within the codde, hauynge in the myddest thereof a hole on euery syde. This kynde of spice is much vsed in coulde countreys, and may there be solde for great aduantage for thexchaunge of other wares.The thrist of golde. But owr men by the persuasion or rather inforcement of this tragicall capitayne, not regardynge and settyng lyght by that commoditie in comparason to the fine gold they thristed,The castel of mena. sayled an hundreth leaques further vntyl they came to the golden lande: where not attemptinge to come nere the

castell perteynynge to the kynge of Portugale, whiche was within the ryuer of Mina,The quantite of golde. made sale of theyr ware onely on this syde and beyonde it for the golde of that countrey to the quantitie of an hundredth and fiftie poundes weyght, there beinge in case that they myght haue dispatched al theyr ware for golde, if the vntame brayne of Wyndam had or could haue gyuen eare to the counsayle and experience of Pinteado. For when that Wyndam not satisfied with the golde whiche he had (and more myght haue had if he had taryed abowt the Mina) commaundynge the sayde Pinteado (for so he toke vppon hym) to leade the shyppes to Benin beinge vnder the Equinoctial line and a hundreth and fiftie leaques beyonde the Mina where he loked to haue thyer shyppes laden with pepper:Benin.
                  Pepper. And beinge counsayled of the sayde Pinteado consyderynge the late tyme of the yere for that tyme to go no further but to make sale of theyr wares such as they had for golde wherby they myght haue byn great gayners. But Wyndam not assentynge hereunto, fell into a suddeyne rage, reuilynge the sayde Pinteado,Furie admitteth no counsayle. caulynge hym Iewe with other opprobrious woordes, sayinge. This horson Iewe hath promised to brynge vs to such places as are not, or as he can not bring vs vnto. But if he doo not, I wyl cut of his eares and naile them to the mast. Pinteado gaue the forsayde counsayle to goo no further for the safegard of the men and theyr lyues, which they shulde put in daungioure if they came to late for the rossia which is theyr wynter,The Rossia. not for coulde but for smotherynge heate with close and cloudy ayer and storminge wether of such putrifyinge qualitie that it rotted the cotes of theyr backes.Rottinge heate. Or els for coommynge to soonne for the scorchynge heate of the sonne which caused them to lynger in the way.Scorchinge heate. But of force and not of wyll, browght he the shyppes before the ryuer of Benin:Benin. where rydynge at an anker, sente their pinnesse vp into the ryuer fiftie or threscore leaques, frō whense certeyne of the marchauntes with capitayne Pinteado, Francisco a Portugale,Francisco. Nicolas Lambert gentleman,Nicolas Lambert. and other marchauntes were conducted to the courte where the kyng remayned .x. leaques from the ryuer syde: whyther when they came,The kyng of Benin his court. they were browght with a greate company to the presence of the kynge who beinge a blacke moore (althoughe not so blacke as the rest) sat in a great houge haule longe and

wyde, the walles made of earthe withowte wyndowes, the the roofe of thynne boordes open in sundry places lyke vnto louers to lette in the ayer.
               And here to speke of the great reuerence they gyue to their kynge,Reuerence towarde the kynge. beinge such that if wee wolde gyue as much to owr sauiour Chryst, we shuld remoue from owr heades many plages which w
                     •
                  e dayly deserue for owre contempte and impietie.
               So it is therfore, that when his noble men are in his presence, they neuer looke hym in the face, but syt courynge, as wee vppon owre knees so they vppon theyr buttockes with theyr elbowes vppon theyr knees and theyr handes beefore theyr faces, not lookynge vppe vntyll the kynge commaunde them. And when they are commynge towarde the kynge as farre as they do see him, do they shewe such reuerence sytting on the grounde with theyr faces couered as before. Lykewise when they depart from hym they turne not theyr backes towarde hym, but go creepynge backewarde with lyke reuerence.
               And nowe to speake sumwhat of the communication that was betwene the kynge and owre men,The communication betwene the kynge of Benin and owr men. yowe shall fyrst vnderstande that he hym selfe coulde speake the Portugale tounge which he had lerned of a chylde. Therfore after that he had commaunded owre men to stande vp, and demaunded of them the cause of theyr commynge into that countrey, they answered by Pinteado that they were marchauntes trauaylynge into those parties for the commodities of his countrey for exchaunge of wares which they had browght from theyr countreys, beinge such as shulde bee no lesse commodious for him and his people. The kynge then hauynge of owlde lyinge in a certeyne store house thirtie or fortie kyntals of pepper (euery kyntall beinge an hundreth weyght) wyllynge them to looke vppon the same,Pepper. and ageyne to brynge hym a syght of suche marchaundies as they had browght with them. And theruppon sent with the capitayne and the marchauntes certeyne of his men to conducte them to the warers syde, with other to brynge the ware from the pinnesse to the courte. Who when they were returned and the wares seene, the kynge grewe to this ende with the marchauntes,The kynges gentlenesse towarde owr men. to prouyde in thirtie dayes the ladynge of all theyr shyppes with pepper.
               And in case theyr marchaundies wolde not extende to the value

of so muche pepper, he promysed to credite them to theyr nexte returne: and thereuppon sente the countrey rounde abowt to gather pepper, causynge the same to be browght to the courte: So that within the space of .xxx. days they had gathered foure score toonne of pepper.
               In the meane season owre men partly hauynge no rule of them selues,The disorder and death of owre men. but eatyng withowt measure of the frutes of the countrey, and drynkyng the wyne of the palme trees that droppeth in the nyght from the cutte branches of the same, and in such extreeme heate runnynge continually into the water, not vsed before to such suddeyne and vehement alterations (then the which nothynge is more daungerous) were therby browght into swellynges and agues. In so much that the later tyme of the yeare cōmyng on, caused thē to dye sū
                  
                     •
                  ymes iii. & sūtimes .iiii. or .v. in a day. Then Wyndam perceauyng the tyme of the .xxx. dayes to be expyred, & his men dying so fast, sent to the court in poste to capitayne Pinteado and the rest to come away and to tary no longer. But Pinteado with the rest, wrote backe to hym ageyne, certifyinge hym of the great quantitie of pepper they had alredy gathered and loked dayly for much more: Desyrynge hym furthermore to remember the great prayse and name they shulde wynne if they came home prosperously, and what shame of the contrary. With which answere Wyndam not satisfied, and many of theyr men dyinge dayly, wylled and commaunded them ageine eyther to coomme away furthwith, or els thretened to leaue them behynde. When Pinteado harde this answere, thynkynge to persuade hym with reason, tooke his way from the court towarde the shyppes beinge conducted thyther with men by the kynges commaundement.
               In the meane season Windam all rageinge,The furie of Wyndam. brake vppe Pinteados Caben, broke open his chestes, spoyled suche prouisyon of coulde stilled waters and suckettes as he hade prouided for his health, and lefte hym nothynge neyther of his instrumentes to sayle by, nor yet of his apparell. And in the meane tyme faulinge sycke hym selfe, dyed also.The death of Wyndam. Whose death Pinteado comminge aborde, lamented as muche as if he had byn the derest frend he had in the worlde. But certeyne of the maryners and other officers dyd spette in his face,Pinteado euil vsed of the maryners. sum caulynge hym Iewe, saying that he had browght them thether

to kylle them: And sum drawynge theyr swordes at hym makynge A shewe to sley hym. Then he perceauinge that they wolde nedes away, desyred them to tary that he might fetch the reste of the marchauntes that were fefte at the court. But they wolde not graunte his request. Then desyred he them to gyue hym the shippe boate with as muche of an owlde sayle as myght serue for the same, promisynge them therewith to bringe Nicolas Lamberte and the rest into England: But all was in vayne. Then wrotte he a letter to the courte to the marchauntes informynge them of all the matter, and promysynge thē if god wolde lende hym life to returne with al hast to fetche them. And thus was Pinteado kepte a bordeshippe ageynste his wyll, thrust amonge the boyes of the shippe, not vsed like a man, nor yet like an honest boy: But glad to find fauoure at the cokes hande. Then departed they, leauing one of theyr shippes behynde them, whiche they soonke for lake of men to cary her. After this within sixe or seuen days saylinge, dyed also Pinteado for very pensiuenesse and thowght that strooke hym to the harte:The death of Pinteado.

His snowte or troonke is so longe and in such forme that it is to hym in the steede of a hande. For he neyther eateth nor drinketh but by bryngynge his troonke to his mouth. Therwith he helpeth vp his master or keeper: therwith he ouerthroweth trees. Bysyde his two greate tuskes, he hath on euery syde of his mouth foure teethe wherwith he eateth and gryndeth his meate. Eyther of these teeth, are almost a span in length as they growe alonge in the lawe: and are abowt two inches in height and almost as much in thickenesse. The tuskes of the male are greater then of the female. His tounge is verye lyttle, and so farre in his mouth that it can not bee seene. Of all beastes they are moste gentyll and tractable. For by many sundry ways they are taught and do vnderstand: In so much that they learne to do due honour to a king, and are of quicke sence and sharpenes of wyt. When the male hath once seasoned the female, he neuer after toucheth her. The male Elephante lyueth two hundreth yeares, or at the leaste one hundreth and twentie. The female almost as longe: but the floure of theyr age, is but .lx. yeares as sum wryte. They can not suffer wynter or coulde. They loue ryuers and wyll often go into them vp to the snowte wherwith they blowe and snuffe, and play in the water: but swymme they canne not for the weyght of theyr bodyes. Plinie and Soline wryte that they vse none adulterie. If they happen to meete with a manne in wyldernesse beinge owt of the way, gentylly they wyl go before hym and brynge hym into the playne waye. Ioyned in battayle, they haue no smaule respecte vnto thē that be wounded. For they brynge them that are hurt or wery into the middle of the army to be defended. They are made tame by drynkynge the iuse of barley. They haue continuall warre ageynst dragons which desyre theyr bludde bycause it is very coulde. And therfore the dragon lyinge awayte as the Elephant passeth by,Debate betwene the Elephant and the dragon. wyndeth his tayle (beinge of exceadynge length) abowt the hynder legges of the elephant: and so steying hym, thrusteth his heade into his tronke and exhausteth his breth, or els byteth hym in the eare wherunto he can not reach with his troonke. And when the elephant waxeth faynt, he fauleth downe on the serpente beinge nowe full of bludde: and

with the poyse of his body breaketh hym: so that his owne bludde with the bludde of the elephant, runneth owt of hym mengeled togyther: whiche beinge coulde, is congeled into that substaunce which the apothecaries caule Sanguis Draconis,

He also wryteth in his .xii. booke, that in oulde tyme they made many goodly woorkes of Iuery or elephantes teeth:workes of Iuery. as tables, tressels, postes of houses, rayles, lattesses for wyndowes, Images of theyr goddes, and dyuers other thynges of Iuery both coloured and vncoloured and intermyxte with sundry kyndes of precious wooddes, as at this day are made certeyne chayres, lutes, and virginalles.
                  
                     They had such plentie therof in owlde tyme, that (as farre as I remember) Iosephus wryteth that one of the gates of Hierusalem was cauled Porta Eburnea, (that is) the Iuery gate. The whytenesse thereof was so muche esteemed that it was thought to represent the naturall fayrenesse of mans skynne: In so much that such as went abowt to set furth (or rather corrupte) naturall bewtie with colours and payntynge, were reproued by this prouerbe: Ebur atramento candesacere. That is: To make Iuery whyte with ynke. The poettes also describynge the fayre neckes of bewtifull virgins, caule them Eburnea colla: That is: Iuery neckes. And to haue sayde thus much of elephantes and Iuery, it may suffice.

                  It is also woorthy to bee noted that summe of them that were at this vyage toulde me. That is, that they ouertooke the course of the soonne, so that they had it north from them

at noone the .xiiii. day of Marche. And to haue sayde thus much of these vyages it may suffice. For (as I haue sayd before) Wheras the parteners at whose charges this booke is prynted, wolde longe sence haue me proceaded no further, I had not thought to haue wrytten any thynge of these vyages but that the liberalitie of master Toy encoraged me to attempt the same.

            ¶ The maner of fyndynge the Longitude of regions by dyuers wayes after the description of Gemma Phrysius.
            
               PErceauynge what contention is and longe hath byn not only amonge the pylottes that by trauaylynge the sea haue obserued the starres, but also amonge sum men that are skylfull in mathematicall sciecens, wherof many affirme that the longitude (that is to meane, the course from the East to the Weste) can not be perfectely knowen, I haue thowght good for the better satisfying of such as desire to haue sum knowleage hereof, to interprete such demonstrations as I haue redde of the declarynge of the same in Gemma Phrysius, who as touchynge this matter hath added to thinuentions of other, a more certeyne way of his owr diuise wherby (as he sayth) he can fynde the longitude of regions although he were dryuen owt of the way a thousande myles into places vnto hym vtterlye vnknowen and of vnknowen distance. He wryteth therfore as foloweth.
            When yow haue founde the place of the mone,By the mone. yow ought to consyder the houre when she occupyed that place. Then eyther by the Ephimerides or by the tables of Alphonsus yowe owght to knowe in what houre the moone entereth into the same signe of the Zodiake in an other region or towne whose longitude is well knowen. Then reducynge the houres to xxiiii. the lesse number of houres is to be deducted out of the greater number. Then the remanent of the houres & mynutes is to be brought to degres in this maner. Multiplie the hours by .xv. and diuide the minutes of the houres by foure: so shall appere the degrees of the Equinoctial conteyned betwene two

Set directly vnder the meridian, the place whose longitude is knowen in the globe.howe to fynd the longitude by the globe Then directe the poynte or style that moueth abowt the pole, to the houre in the whiche the moone occupyeth the place assigned in that region. Then turne the globe vntyll the style that sheweth the houre, be coomme to the houre in the whiche yowesowght the vnknowen place of the moone. And so shall the degrees of the Equinoctiall distaunte or diuyded frome the moueable meridian, declare the longitude of the region which yow seeke. Neuerthelesse, the more certeine way wherby the differences of longitudes may bee founde, is by sum one thynge that in one moment appeareth in all regions, as by the eclypses of the moone.The Eclipses of the moone. For the dyuers houres beinge knowen in the whiche the sayd eclypses chaunce in dyuers regions, the longitudo maye thus aswell be knowen by geometrie and arithmetike, as it is founde by the rule here before. But forasmuch as this doth neyther appere at al tymes nor to all men, and the other way is sumwhat difficult, neyther at al tymes redy by reason of the cōiunctions of the mone and furthermore also sumtymes vncerteyne and varying sum what from the truth for the dyuers aspectes and l

For no certentie doubtlesse can be knowen by such commensurations as are made in the wanderynge turnynges and wyndynges of such vyages, as Ptolome affirmeth in the first booke of his Cosmographie. I wyll therfore adde herevnto sum thynge of myne owne inuention whereby by an easy way and at all tymes the longitudes of regions may bee founde in all vyages and nauigations.
         
         
            
            ¶ A newe maner of fyndynge the Longitudes of regions.
            
               WEe see that in these owre dayes certeyne lyttle clockes are verye artificially made the whiche for theyr smaule quantitie are not comberous to be caryed abowt in all vyages.Little clocke

By the helpe therfore of these the longitude may bee founde after this maner. Before wee enter into any vyage, wee muste fyrste foresee that the sayde clocke exactly obserue the houres of the place from whense we departe: And ageyne that in the way it neuer cease. Accomplysshynge therfore .xv. or .xx. myles of the vyage, if wee desyre to knowe howe much in longitude we are dystant frome the place of owre departure, we must tary vntyll the poynt or style of the clocke do exactly come to the poynt of sum houre: and at the same moment by owr Astrolabie or globe,By the Astrolabie and globe. owght wee to seeke the houre of the place where we bee: The which yf it agree in minute with the houres which the Horoscopium or ascendent dooth shewe,horoscopus or the Ascendent. then is it certeyne that wee are yet vnder the same Meridian or the same Longitude: and that owre course hath byn towarde the south or north. But if it dyffer one hour or any mynute, thē are the same to bee reduced to degrees or minutes of degrees as we haue tought in the chapiture here before.
            And so shall the longitude bee founde. And by this arte can I fynde the longitude of regions althowgh I were a thousand myles owt of my attempted course & in an vnknowen distance, but the latitude must fyrste bee perfectely knowen.The latitude.
