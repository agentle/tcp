            To the Reader.
            TOo ſoone and too late, this work is publiſhed: Too ſoone, in that it was in the Preſſe, before J had notice of it, by which meanes ſome faults may eſcape in the Printing. Too late, for that it was not publiſhed when the general voice of the people had ſeald it for good, and the newneſſe of it made it much more deſired, then at this time: For Plaies in this Citie are like wenches new falne to the trade, onelie deſired of your neateſt gallants, whiles the' are freſh: when they grow ſtale they muſt be vented by Termers and Cuntrie chapmen. I know not how this labor will pleaſe, Sure J am it past the cenſure of the Stage with a generall applauſe, now (whether vox populi be vox dei or no) that I leaue to be tried by the accute iudgement of the famous ſix wits of the Citie: Farewell.

            IF for opinion hath not blazd his fame,
            Nor expectation filld the generall round,
            You deeme his labors ſlight, you both confound
            Your grauer iudgement and his merits.
            Impartiall hearing fits iudicious ſpirits▪
            
            Nor let the fruit of many an hower fall,
            By enuies tooth, or baſe detractions gall.
            Both which are tokens of ſuch abiect ſpirits,
            Which wanting worth, themſelues hate other merits:
            Or els of ſuch, which once made greate by fame,
            Repine at thoſe which ſeeke t'attaine the ſame.
            From both we know all truer iudgements free
            To them our muſe with bluſhing modeſtie
            Patiently to her intreats their fauour,
            Which done, with iudgement praiſe, or els diſlike the labour.

                     TRickes and ſhowes; proteſtations with men are like teares with weomen, forgot ere the cheeke be drie: Gerardine is a gentleman, his Lands be in Statutes: A is not for thee nor thou for him, a is a Gallant, and yong thoughts be moſt vnconſtant.

                     But old veynes the beſt, beleeue not theſe great breecht gallants, they loue for profit, not for affection, if a brings thee to a fooles paradice, a will forſake thee.

                     Faith weake and limber, weake and lymber: nothing but pride and double dealing, vertue is vices lacky; beggars ſuck like horſſe leaches at the hart of bounty, and loues theame ſo tyerd and ſpurgald, that he can be no longer ridden with honeſty.

                     VVell fare the City yet: there vertue rides a cockhorſſe cheriſht and kept warme in good ſables, and Fox furre, and with the breath of his noſtrills, driues pride and couetouſnes before him, like's owne ſhaddow: beggers haue whipping cheare, bounty obliges men too't, giues mony for Scrips and Scrolls, & liberality ſeald with ſtrong Armes and Herauldry, to out liue mortality: loue there wil ſee the laſt man borne, neuer giue ouer while ther's an Arrow i'th Quiuer.

                     Now we talke of loue, I do know not far hence ſo good a ſubiect for that humor, that if ſhe would weare but the ſtanding collor, and her things in faſhion, our Ladies in the Court were but browne ſugarcandy, as groſſe as grocery to her.

                     I, if ſhe would let her Ruffes ſtreame out a little wider; but J am ſure ſhe is ominous to me, ſhe makes ciuill wars and inſurrections in the ſtate of my ſtomach: J had thought to haue bound my ſelf from loue, but hir purging comfets makes me looſe body'd ſtill.

                     J, I feare ſhe takes too much of that Lectuary to ſtoope to loue, it keeps her body ſoluble from ſinne, ſhe is not troubled with carnall crudities, nor the binding of the fleſh.

                     Not I: I am too ſhallow to ſound her, ſhee's out of my Element, if I ſhew paſſion, and diſcourſe of loue to hir, ſhee tells me I am wide from the right ſcope, ſhe ſayes ſhe has an other Obiect, and aymes at a better Loue then myne.

                     No, no, ſhe ſpeakes pure deuotion, ſhees impenitrable, no gold, or Oratory, no vertue in hearbs, nor no phyſick will make her loue.

                     Omitting their outward graces, Ile ſhow you only one inſtāce which includes all other: they loue their neighbors better then themſelues.

                     Yes better then themſelues, for they loue them beter then their huſbands, and huſband and wife are all one; therefore better then themſelues.

                     I thinke egregious ignorance will goe neere to ſaue this age, their blindnes takes me for a coniurer: yeſterday a Iuſtice of peace ſalutes me, with profer of a brace of Angells to helpe him to his footcloth, ſome 3. dayes before ſtoln, and was faine to vſe his mans cloake in ſtead on't.

                     I can ſee nothing but his eies; the reſt of him is ſo rapt in cloake, that it ſuffers no view.

                     A diſcontent indeed Maſter Doctor, which to ſhake off, J muſt haue you extend your Art to the vtmoſt bounds: you Phyſitiās are as good as falſe dores behind hangings to Ladies neceſſary vſes: you know the very hower in which they haue neither will to deny, nor wit to miſtruſt: faith now by the way, when are women moſt apt.

                     You may ſmell a man after a purgation indeed: Sir, tis ſhe: Now for that ſame hath bruted you to be a man expert in negromancy, I would endeauour my ſelfe to you for euer, would you vouchſafe to let one of your Spirits bring Miſtriſſe Purge into ſome conuenient place, where I might enioy her: I haue heard of the like, can you performe this.
                  
                  
                     Do. Gli.
                     With much facility I aſſure you: but you muſt vnderſtand, that the apparition of a ſpirit is dreadfull, and with all couetous, and with no ſmall ſumme of gold hyred to ſuch feates.

                     Walke you into that roome, I will bethinke my ſelfe for your good, and inſtantly reſolue you; let the gentleman come in: Lipſalue in loue with my veſſell of eaſe? come to me to helpe him to a morſell moſt affected by mine owne pallat? No more but ſo, I haue ſhapt it, the conceit tickles me.
                     Enter Gudgin.
                     Sir, as a ſtranger J welcome you, what maſter Gudgin haue J caught you: J thought it was a gallant that walkt muffled, Come, let me behoulde you at full, heere are no Sergeants man.
                  
                  
                     Gud.
                     Maſter Doctor, this my obſcure comming requires an action more obſcure: and in briefe this tis; Sir, you are held a man far ſeene in natures ſecrets, I know you can effect many things almoſt impoſſible; know then I loue miſtriſſe Purge, and oportunity fauours me not, nor indeed is ſhe ſo tractable as I expected, if either by medicine, or your Art magikall, you can worke her to my will, J haue a poore Gallants rewarde ſir.
                  
                  
                     
                     Doct, Gliſt.
                     Thats iuſt nothing. But how ſir would you haue me to procure you acceſſe to miſtriſſe Purge, you neuer knew a phyſition a bawde.
                  
                  
                     Gud.
                     Why by coniuration (I tell you) wherin you are ſaid to be as well practiz'd, as in Phiſick; heer's the beſt part of my preſent ſtore to effect it.
                  
                  
                     Do. Gliſt.
                     Not a penny for my ſelfe, but my Spirits indeede they muſt be fed; walke you by here, while I thinke vpon a ſpell. What myſtery ſhould this be, Lipſalue and Gudgin both in loue with miſtriſſe Purge, and come to me to helpe 'hem by Art magicke? Tis ſome gullery ſure; yet if my inuention hold, ile fit them:
Enter one.
Whoſe within there, fetch me in all haſt two good whips, I thinke you may haue them not far hence; Jt ſhall be ſo, now tell me maſter Gudgin does no man know of your loue to miſtriſſe Purge:
                  
                  
                     Gud.
                     Not a man by my Gentry.
                  
                  
                     Do. Gliſt.
                     Then ſir know ile effect it; but vnderſtand withal, the apparition will be moſt horrid, if it appeare in his proper forme, and will ſo amaze and dull your ſences, that your appetite will be loſt and weake, though miſtriſſe Purge ſhould attend it naked Now ſir, could you name a friend with whome you are moſt conuerſant, in his likeneſſe ſhould the ſpirit appeare.
                  
                  
                     Gud.
                     Of all men liuing, my conuerſation is moſt frequent with Lipſalue the Courtier.
                  
                  
                     Doct. Gli.
                     Tis ynough: ile to my Spirit— are theſe whips come there?

                     Doct. Gliſt.
                     So lie thou there; my noble gallants ile ſo firke you: Sir my Spirit agrees in Lipſalues ſhape; to morrow twixt the howres of foure and fiue, ſhall miſtriſſe Purge be rapt with a whirlwind into Lypſalues chamber, thats the fitteſt place: for by the breake of day Lipſalue ſhall be mounted, and forſake the City for three dayes, ſo my Spirit reſolues me▪ Now ſir, by my Art, at that very houre ſhall his chamber doore fly open,

into which boldly enter in this ſort accoutered: put me on a pure cleane ſhirt, leaue off your doublet, (for Spirits indure nothing polluted) take me this whip in your hand, and being entred you ſhall ſee the Spirit in Lipſalues ſhape, in the ſelfe ſame forme that you appeare; ſpeake theſe words here ready written, take three bold ſteps forward, then whippe him ſoundly, who ſtraight vaniſheth and leaues miſtris Purge to your will.
                  
                  
                     Gud.
                     I but ſhall your Spirit come arm'd with a whippe too?
                  
                  
                     Do. Gliſt.
                     He ſhall, but haue no power to ſtrike.
                  
                  
                     Gud.
                     Is this infallible, haue you ſeen the proofe?
                  
                  
                     Do. Gliſt.
                     
                        Probatum vpon my word, I haue ſeene the experience, if it fayle, ſay I am a foole, and no Magician.
                  
                  
                     Gud.
                     Maſter Doctor I would you had ſome ſuite at Court, by the faith of a Courtier, J would beg it for you: Fare you well Sir, I ſhall reporte of you, as I find your charme.

                     What vnheard of accident preſents
                     Thy vnexpected ſelfe, and giues my heart
                     Matter of ioy, mixt with aſtoniſhment.

                     That cruelty giues fuell to deſire,
                     For loue ſuppreſt fares like a raging fire
                     which burnes all obſtacles that ſtop his courſe,
                     And mounts aloft; the Ocean in his ſource
                     May eaſier hide himſelfe, and be confynd,
                     Then Loue can be obſcurd; For in the mind,

                     How? no roome for me nor my familiarity? why whats the difference between a familiar brother, and a brother in the Family? O I know: J made eclipſes of in, in this place where it ſhould haue bin expreſt, ſo that the want of in, put me cleane out; or let me ſee: may it not be ſome myſterie drawne from Arithmetick? For my life theſe Familiſts loue no ſubſtraction, take nothing away, but put in and ad as much as you will, and after addition followes multiplication of a moſt Pharaſithipocriticall crue. VVell for my part I like not this family, nor indeed ſome kind of priuate lecturing that weomen vſe: looke toot, you that haue ſuch gadders to your wiues: ſelf willd they are as children, and yfaith capable of not much more then they peeuiſh by cuſtome, naturally fooles. J remember a prety wodden ſentence in a preamble to an exerciſe, where the Reader prayed: that men of his Coate might grow vp like Cedars to make good waynſcot in the houſe of ſincerity, would not this waynſcot phraſe be writ in Braſſe, to publiſh him that ſpake it for an Animall: why, ſuch wodden pellets out of earthen Trunks, doe ſtrike theſe females into admiration, hits 'hem home, ſometimes (perhaps) in at one eare, and out at tother, and then they depart in opinion, wiſer then their neighbours, fraught with matter, able to take down and mortifie their huſbands. VVell ile home now, and bring the true word next time: I ſhall expect my wife anon red hot with zeale, and big with melting teares; and this night do I expect, (as her manner is) ſhe will weepe me a whole Chamberpot full, Loquor Lapides? do J caſt pills abroad? tis no matter what I

ſay, J talke like a Pothicary (as I am) I haue onely purgd my ſelfe of a little choller and paſſion, and am now armd with a patient reſolucion, but how? to put my Hornes in my Pocket? no:
                     VVhat wiſe men beare is not for me to ſcorne,
                     Tis a hornorable thing to weare the horne.

                     It can ſcarce be harty, for phyſitians are rather glad to ſee men ill, then well.
