               In this ſayd dolorous ſonge
               I dyde me put for to haue peaſe
               Force it was in to be thronge
               Yet wente I not in with myne eaſe
               But my wyfe me to dyſpleaſe

               Than came her mother to hous
               That founde her how ſhe was wepynge
               And ſoone ſhe ſayd my nowne ſone dous
               Why maketh ſhe that waymentynge
               And ſayd it was not her lernynge
               To haue her doughter ſo to be chydde
               And that ſhe had a perceyuynge
               That I had her ſo an angred
            
            
               By my faythe ſayd I good mother
               Nought haue I done nor her myſſayde

               So alwaye for to threten her
               For ywys ſhe was neuer taught
               For to werke therfore dele ſofter
               But ſhe wyll do well here after
               Wherfore ſpeke no more I you praye
