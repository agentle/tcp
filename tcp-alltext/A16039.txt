the tyme of theyr consecracyon
            by the Reuerende fader in god Iohan Alcok bysshop of Ely.
            ¶I aske the banes betwix the hyghe and moost
myghty prynce kyng of all kynges sone of almyghty
god and the virgyne Mary in humanyte Cryste
Ihesu of Nazareth of the one partye. And. A. B.
of the thother partye / that yf ony man or woman
can shewe ony lawfull Inpedyment other by ony
precontracte made or corrupcyon of body or soule
of the sayd. A. B. that she ought not to be maryed
this daye vnto the sayd myghty prynce Ihesu that
they wolde accordynge vnto the lawe shewe it.
            
               GOod syster we are here gadred before
almyghty god and all his sayntes
in heuen in his chirche here mylytaūt
to solempne this noble spowsage
bytwene the sayd sone of almyghty
god and you / whiche spowsage
muste be of your partye desyred with all your
hoole herte & free wyll / not compelled by none of
your frendes / nor for cause of worldly worshyp nor
ease of your body / but oonly for the loue & seruyce
ye owe to the sayd myghty prynce / to serue hym &
obeye hym & kepe his cōmaundementes / and all other
men & worldly worshyp renounce and forsake

and hym to loue aboue all thynge / & his preceptes
to performe and all other thynge to do that perteyneth
to a good wyfe. How moche be ye boūde vnto
hym that wyl consent that ye be maryed vnto hym
so grete a prynce & almyghty / and ye a wretche his
creature & of a poore lynage. For the cōmon vsage
is kynges to mary togydre. Dukes and Erles togydre / 
and poore people togydre / and seldome seen
the ryche and the poore mary togydre / and yet this
moost myghty prynce lorde of heuen & of erthe for
the loue he bereth vnto you to make you his quene / 
his fader of heuen to be your fader his moder to be
yours. And so by this maryage all your kynred shal
be of cosynage by affynyte to the fad
                  
                     
                  
                  er
                of heuen / our
lady all the angels with all the hole Genelogy of
Cryste / to whiche honour and excellence no carnall
spowsage coude exalte you. Therfore yf ye contynue
his faythfull & true spowse cōmyttynge your
mynde your wyll & all your werkes to obserue his
cōman̄dementes / your rewarde shall be as in your
Ioynter & dowery excede all rewardes that can be
thought & may be geuen vnto man.
            FYrste syster yf ye wyll be spowsed to this noble
prynce & so be determyned in your mynde.
I saye thyse wordes to you of the holy ghoost.
(Audi filia et vide & inclina aurem tuā et obliuiscere
populum tuū et domū patris tui) That is to

saye / doughter here see and gyue humble attendaūce / yf
ye wyll be spowsed to this myghty prynce / 
ye muste forgete and relynquysshe Ioye and felycyte
of this worlde / and the house of all your generacyon / 
your fader and moder and all your carnall
frendes / and ye muste folowe hym in condycyons / 
and leue your olde name and condycyons
and to be called after his name▪ his name is Ihesus
Nazarenus. And soo ye muste be called Nazarena.
It is wryten (Nazarei candidiores niue interpretantur
virgulti vel floridi siue custodientes
aut separati a mundo vel vncti siue sancti aut consecrati)
That is to saye. Ye muste be as a yonge
grene braunche and as a floure and as a keper of
the tresour of your husbonde and seuered from the
worlde as a noynted holy and consecrate quene / 
for thyse propertees amonge other hath your spowse.
Fyrste ye muste be as a yonge grene braunche / 
the whiche loseth his fayre beaute whan he is seuered
from the rote. The rote of all Relygyon is
Ihesu of Nazareth that is charyte (Quia deus caritas
est) And who soo euer is not in charyte he departeth
hymselfe from almyghty god. Soo ye
muste loue your spowse Ihesu aboue all thynge / he
muste be in your mynde / in your soule / in your herte / and
in all your werkes. And of hym specyally
ye muste speke / for yf ye haue ony pleasure for to
speke of ony other thynges of the worlde or of ony

other man / thenne wyll he be wrothe. For as saynt
Gregory sayth (Prouidendū ergo nobis est quia
intueri non debet quod non licet concupisci. Et iohannes)
Cryste sayth (Qui studet eligantes facies
inspicere ipse fornacem passionis accendit) For
he wyll that ye kepe oonly and entyerly vnto hym
your fyue wyttes / to haue noo pleasure for to loke
vppon man or woman / nor to here of noo worldely
thynges / nor speke of noo concupyscence / nor
handell noo contagyous thynges / but oonly that
shall be to his pleasure and seruyce. For as saynt
Ierom sayth. There was neuer man soo Ielous
of his wyfe and taketh hede of his werkes and dedes
as our lorde your spowse wyll take hede of you
For ye can thynke noo thought but he knoweth it / 
nor speke noo worde but he hereth it / nor be in noo
place but he is there presente / nor noo thynge can
dysceyue hym / therfore ye muste loue hym aboue
all thynge and be in parfyte charyte with all your
systers and his people and seruauntes. Also Cryste
Ihesu is called (Flos campi) The floure of Nazareth / the
beaute of this excedeth all other vertues
and it is so noble a tresoure that it can not be praysed / 
and therfore virgynyte is honoured in almyghty
god. And Cryste the heede and the leder
therof and the fyrste thynge that he dyde in erthe
whan he became man he sette vp his housholde of
virgyns and men of chastyte for to serue hym and

his chirche here in erthe / as he was by virgyns the
angels serued in heuen / his moder was and is perpetuall
virgyne. Iohan Euangelyste his Secretary
a virgyne. Iohan the Baptyst a virgyne. Ieremye
the prophete a virgyne / and angeles in heuen
virgyns and Innumerable there syngynge and
folowynge the lombe of god the seconde persone / 
and euer newe songes of Ioye and glorye. The
angels of heuen honoureth virgyns as theyr brethern
and systern And as it is wryten (Apocal .xix)
The angell of god wolde not suffre saynt Iohan
Euangelyste to worshyppe hym / for loue he was a
virgyne as he was and angell and man of the erthe.
And therfore Saynt Bernarde sayth. What
is more full of beaute than is chastyte (Quid castitate
decorius. Que mundum de inmundo conceptum
semine de hoste domesticum de homine angelum
facit) The angels worshypped saynt Agnes
and cladde hyr in a garment of chastyte / crowned
saynt Cecylye / saynt Agas shewed hyr holynesse / 
saynt Katheryne buryed / and delyuered from
deth Susanne. And as it is wryten Numeri .xxxi.
(Omnes feminas virgines reseruare alias omnes
iubentur interfici) That is to saye. That where
all the people sholde be destroyed and slayne for
synne / yet god almyghty commaunded to spare
virgyns. And therfore sayth saynt Ancelme (Don
est salus nisi quem tu virgo peperisti) Saynt Margarete

hadde the deuyll vnder hyr feete and bounde
hym / and he cryed & sayd / leue ye yonge mayde
ye destroye me. And in lyke wyse Saynt Iulyan
bette hym and putte hym to grete rebuke / and
therfore the deuyll worshyppeth virgynyte as it is
radde in Thobye the sixte chapytre. For ryght as
the deuyll hath power of all vnclene lyuers / ryght
soo he honoureth virgyns and feereth theym bycause
of the angelles. And therfore Saynt Iohan
Crysostomus sayth (Castitas est res angelica per
quam solum singulariter homines angelis assimulantur)
And that angels haue in heuen by felycyte.
A man or a woman beynge theyr in virgynyte
haue by grace and by grete labour. Virgynyte
by grace hath dyuerse preuyleges. Fyrste it replenyssheth
paradyse (tricesimasecunda questione

.i. Nupcie) Moders of childern of the worlde

hath grete besynes and sorowe for to brynge forthe
theyr childern / a virgyne is in quyetnesse and bryngeth
forthe hyr children in grete Ioye as it is wryten

                  rum
               
secundo. Sicut lilium inter spinas sic amicamea
inter filias) Virgynyte is lykened vnto a lely
the leuys of the lely that conserued the beaute therof
is sobrenesse of mete and drynke / the contrarye
therof is shewed in Loth beynge dronken fyled his
owne doughters (Genesis decimonono .xv. q. i.
Inebriauerunt) Iheronimus (Uirgo binum fugiat
pro veneno) As who sayth / a virgyne sholde
hate wyne as venym.
            
               ¶Custos.
               YE muste also be a custos / a keper of all suche
thynges as this daye shall be delyuered
vnto you in the name of your spowse & folowe hȳ
therin. For and ye kepe not all thynges in theyr
beyuge as he hath made theym / they sholde forthwith
be destroyed / and therof Dauyd sayth (Nisi
dominus custodierit ciuitatem &c.) So ye muste
kepe the tresour of your spowse Cryste perteynynge
to his fayth & to haue in your remembraunce &
wyll to kepe the foure thynges that shall be delyuerd
vnto you this daye / your veyle & your mantyll
both beynge of blake & a rynge wt a lyght of waxe
berynge in your honde / and in kepynge of thyse it

shal be shewed as ye loue your husbonde. This veyle
and mantyll remembred ryght well the virgyne
saynt Agnes whan she sayd (Posuit signū in faciem
meā vt nullū amatorē preter cum admittam)
That is to saye. He hath couerd my soule Inwarde
and myn heede with a veyle / that and yf I wyll
loue ony man better than hym I shall goo to the
colour of my veyle and that is euerlastynge deth.
In lyke wyse she shewed that hyr spowse Cryste

(Anulus) Also I haue by the auctoryte geuen vnto
me by Cryste Ihu to delyuer vnto you this daye
a rynge in token of maryage Indyssolyble to be
made betwix you & hym. For as saynt Poul sayth / 
ye muste herafter remembre no thynge but that is
godly / & therfore the sayd saynt Agnes cryed with
a grete voyce agaynst the deuyll & hym that tempted
hyr to vnclenly desyres sayenge (Discite a me

with a mery voyce (Anulo suo subornauit me

wedde me and hath crowned me with a crowne of
euerlastynge Ioye yf I kepe truly my loue & spowsage
vnto hym.
            
            
               ¶Lumen.
               ALso remembre the lyght that ye brȳge with
you / that sygnefyeth Cryste Ihesu that is
(Uera lux que illuminat omnem hominē venientem

taught you ye muste entyerly kepe & se your lyght
go not out but be brennynge in your soule and in
your mynde by the blessyd Incarnacōn / passyon / resurreccyon / 
and the moost blessyd lyfe of our sauyour
Cryste Ihesu / and that ye falle in none erthely
synne / heresye nor errours by ony mānes techynge / 
nor dyspute not the rules of your relygyon / but wt
all reuerence and obedyence that ye may do ye take
theym / obeye theym / and obserue theym. And what
so euer your abbesse or the rewlers of your relygyon
commaunde you to do / byleue it is for the helth of
your soule and accordynge to your relygyon / and
honour and loue theym as your fader and moder / ye
must be pacyent amonge your systers and suffre

theym / ye muste be meke / ye muste ete and drynke
suche metes and drynkes as ye be cōmaunded / and
whan ye haue not halfe slept ynough ye muste ryse / ye

moost swetest and clere / soo ye haue a swete deuocyon / ye
muste serue your systers and wesshe theyr

vnto was obedyent to his fader and suffred deth / 
and wesshed also he god and man the feete of his
dyscyples poore fysshers.
            
            
               ¶Nazarena.
               ALso ye muste be Nazarena / that it to saye / 
deseuered from the worlde / as Ihesus Nazarenus
sayth hymself (Regnū meum nō est in hoc
mūdo) But though your body be here in this worlde
corporally / your mynde & your soule to be with
Cryste Ihesu / and soo take the worlde in all thynge
therin and saye with saynt Poull. The worlde
is to me a payne / and I to the worlde / my Ioye is
oonly in Cryste crucefyed. So syster your pleasure
and conuersacyon muste oonly be in the crosse of
Cryste / that is penaunce / in fastynge / prayer / and
mortyfycacyon of your enemy the flesshe / and let it
not haue his wyll / kepe you within your monasterye
and departe not therfro (.xvi. q. i. placuit. n.)
For ryght as a fysshe deyeth that is without water
ryght soo a man or woman of Relygyon beynge

without theyr cloyster is deed in theyr soules. Remembre
the storye of the bybell that Dena Iacobs
doughter she wolde not kepe hyr within / not close
as she was cōmaunded / but wolde go forth amonge
yonge people and soo was corrupte and rauysshed / and
therof folowed Infenyte manslaughter
and murdre. Moyses beynge in monte of Relygyon
he spake with god / without he spake but with man
(.xxxvi. di. c. Si) A woman of Relygyon or a man
beynge in theyr cloyster in prayer they speke with
god / without they speke with the deuyll / & therfore
an holy fader sayd / ryght as an henne yt hath egges
leueth hyr egges shall of them neuer come chekens
So shall none be good Relygyous man or woman
that leueth the place of Relygyon. And as it is rad
in (Vitis patrū) Ther was a monke by longe space
tempted by the deuyll & he resysted hym sore / at
the laste he brought the monke to the dore where he
sholde departe from the place of Relygyon / he made
there a crosse and cryed to the deuyll / thou haste
pulled me hyder / pulle me now ferder & thou canst
but it shall neuer lye in thy power.
