               ple of god that thou may haue euerlaſtyng lyfe and lyue ī to worlde of worldis. Amen. Thanne the chylde is brought to the fonte and the preſt callyth it by name and ſeyth. Abranuucio ſatane & omnibus operibus eius et omnibus pompis eius that is. I for ſake ſatanas that is the deuyl and alle his werkis & alle his pompis or prydes and ye godſibbis ſayth.

And beleueſt thou in the holy ghoſt in holy churche fayth in communion of ſaintes for geuenes of ſynnes the ryſyng of fleſhe and after the euer laſtynge lyfe. And they ſaye

And ſo he plungyth it in the water and commaundyth the goſſipis to ley hōd on ye chyldes heed for they ben wytneſſes of his Baptim & receue ye charge to teach it and ye trewthe of his beleue yt is ye cōmaū

Haue thou a brēnynge lampe vnreprouable. Kepe thou thy baptym & kepe thou ye cōmaūdementis that whā the Lorde cometh to the weddyngis thou mayſt renne agenſt hym as one wyth ſeyntis in ye heuenly halle yt thou haue euer laſtynge lyfe and lyue ī to ye world

of worldꝭ. am̄ Here endith ye reulys of baptī. But alle chriſtē folk ſhulde beſily lerne to know ye gretnes of charge whiche they receue ī ther baptym. For wyth .iiii. thyngis we be chargyd in our Baptī al though blinde preſtis knowe yt not, whan they geue to vs iiii. Elamentis in tokenyng of thē, that is ſalt, & water, and oyle, & fier. The fyrſt charge is that we take ſalt of wyſdom of goddꝭ word and rewle our lyfe ther after and ſalt our ſoules that they ſtynk not in ſynne. For and thys heuenly ſalt fayle fro men they ſhulde be caſt out as chriſt techyth in the goſpel. The .ii. charge is, that our eeris be openyd euer more redy to here chryſtes goſpel and vnderſtande yt. For chriſt ſeyth. He that hath eerys of herynge, Let him here & he yt redyth let him vnderſtande. The

iii. charge is this that we kepe our Baptym that is ye couenaunt of our Baptym and trew beleue in the father and the ſone and the holy ghoſt as the preſt appoſith vs whan we ſaye. Credo. The .iiii. charge is this that we kepe the commaundementis of god, as the preſt commaūdith vs at ye fonte puttyng a candel brē
               nynge in our hand, for as a candille brennynge is waſtyd by fyer: ſo ſynnes in our ſoul ſhulde be waſtyd and deſtroyed wyth kepyng of the commaundementis of god, hauyng deuout loue to hym and to our euen chriſten. And this is the ſeconde Baptym, that ſaynt Iohn. techyth whan he ſayth I Baptyſe in water but a nother ſhall come after me ſtrongir than I and he ſhall Baptyſe you in the holy ghoſt and fyer and wyth out this ſeconde. Baptym

may no man be ſaued, as chriſt ſeyde to Nichodeme truly I ſaye to the: But a mā be born a gen of water and of the holy ghoſt he may not enter in to the Kyngdom of god. Alſo Paul techyth that the fyrſt Baptym in water only, makyth vs not ſaef, But the axinge of a good conſciēce ī god & fayth not fayned ye beleue yt worckyth by charite for chriſt ſayth. He that beleuyth in me flodis of quyk water ſhulde flow fro hys wombe that is the holy ghoſt that chryſt callyth the cōfortour, whyche flowyth euer in to the hertis of meke men that make them redy to die, for that man that ſhall dwelle by fore the bleſſed face of god in heuene, ſhall receue ye erneſt of the holy goſt here in erthe. And this is the ſecond Baptym that fleſhely preſtis and ſwynyſh peple knowyth not, for

ther hertis be ſtoppyd wyth fleſhly luſt, that the flodis of the holy ghoſt may not entre in to them, and therefore preſtis be ī perel that teach not the ſecounde Baptym. For yt ſufficyth not to ſaluaciō of mā to wayſhe his body in water of Baptym and ſuffre his ſoule to ſtynk in ſynne thorow brekyng of the commaū
               demētis of god, for thus preſtis reade in the holy Pſalm. Increpaſti ſuperbos maledicti qui declinant a mādatis tuis, That is to ſeye thou blameſt the proude they be a curſyd that bow a wey fro thyn heſtis. And thus god ſhall blame proude preſtis for they purſewe powre men for the lernynge of the commaundementis the whyche they charge them to kepe in the our of ther. Baptym and all that bere the name of chryſten men ſhulde crie agenſt this errour

For what errour is more vyle in ye ſyght of god than to byende men to alawe and afterwarde purſue them for the ſame lawe and thus for drede of euel preſtis men dar not kepe chryſtis heeſtis and the ghoſtly byrth of our mother holy churche is deſpyſed of proude men that knowe not the bond of ther Baptym.
