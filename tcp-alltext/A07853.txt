            ¶The Prologue of the
Authour.
            
               
                  I
                Do you well to wit that
thys Booke profyteth
greatly to euery Surgion,
for to know in what
ſigne, or in what degree
of the ſigne, the ſunne and the moone
ſitteth euery day in any of the twelue
ſignes, and not only it is profytable to
Surgions, but alſo to Phiſitions and
to al that vſe to giue medicines or laxatiues,
or to vſe any Baſſions, or cutting,
or letting of blood. For as the
Sunne paſſeth through al the twelue
Sygnes by the ſpace of a yeare, abyding
in a ſigne thirtie dayes, righte ſo
doth the Moone paſſe through all the
twelue ſignes, that in thyrty dayes, aabydynge
in a Sygne three ſcore
howers.
            And as the Moone among all Planettes

is next the earth in courſe, ſo
ſhee hath moſt effecte of working in
theſe earthly thinges after the diſpoſytion
of the nature of the ſygns that
ſhe hath her courſe in. And therefore
it is ful neceſſary truely, to know the
ſtate, the courſe, and the nature of the
moone, for thereby a man may know
when it is good to begin manye dyuers
thinges, & when it is not good.
And alſo what weather is moſt likely
to fal, after the nature of the ſigns,
whether drye or moyſt, hote or colde,
there ſhall follow after the nature of
the ſygne that ſhee is in. In dyuers
coniunctions of Planets that is ioyned
therewith, and therefore naturally
in order, I purpoſe me to declare
ſhortly in the ſixt Chapiter,
the nature and the ſtate of
euery ſigne that ſhee
paſſeth by.(⸪)

            ¶Here beginneth the fyrſte parte of
this Booke, that ſheweth dyuers
cauſes how the Peſtilence
may be ingendred.
Capitulo. i.
            
               COnſydering that thys
treatiſe is very needfull
and neceſſarye agaynſt
the ſickneſſe of the peſtilence,
and for a common
wealth & health of the Queenes liege
people, I Thomas Moulton doctour
of Diuinitie, of the order of the Frere
Preachers, the which for to gather
moueth me for diuers cauſes, the one
is prayers of myne owne bretheren.
            Another is cauſe of prayers of many
worthy Gentles.
            And another is compaſſyon that I
haue of the poore people, that was &
is deſtroyed euery day therby, for defaute
of helpe.
            
               
And the fourth cauſe that mooueth
the moſt of all, pure conſcience, for euery
chriſten man, & womā, is bound
by the lawe of conſcience, and they
know their euen chriſten in great perril,
or that is lykely to fal to great miſchiefe,
to helpe them if he maye by his
wit wyth his trauayle, and with hys
goods. And theſe foure cauſes mooued
me to compounde and to gather
this treatiſe, and to ſet it in printe ſo
in engliſh, that euery man both learned
and lewde, riche and poore, maye
the better vnderſtand it, and do therafter.
And ſo euery man, woman, and
chylde to be their own Phiſytion in
time of neede, agaynſt the vengeance
and corruption of the peſtilence, that
now is reigning with other diſeaſes
many mo, and this treatiſe for the peſtilence
is deuyded, and parted in .iii.
partes, and conſequently inſueth the

ſeuen dayes with the Planets, with
the natures and expoſitions of the
xii. ſignes, deuyded by the .xii. months
of the yeare, with the remedyes for
many dyuers other diſeaſes that hurteth
and greeueth the body of man.
            And the fyrſt parte of this booke telleth
dyuers cauſes how the peſtilence
may be gendred.
            The ſeconde part telleth how man,
woman and childe, ſhall preſerue and
keepe themſelues from the peſtilence,
if ſo the man woman or chylde be cutable,
that falleth therein.
            The thyrd parte telleth the remedye,
helpe, and medicine agaynſt the
peſtilence.
            In the fyrſt part I ſay of this treatyſe,
as I tolde, be ſhewed dyuers
cauſes, which may be the grounde of
this Peſtilence that nowe reigneth,
I fynde by the treatinge of fower
Doctoures, the fower Pillers that

vpholdeth holy church, that is to ſaye
S. Auſtē, S. Ierom, S. Gregory, &
S. Ambroſe, where they ſpeke of this
matter, they ſay, that ſyn that raygneth
among the people, and namely
that ſinne that reigneth among head
men, & the gouernours of the church,
and of the law, is cauſe of the Peſtylence
Vengeaunce, taken for ſynne.
Hereof I fynde enſample and Fygure
in holy Wryt, in the ſeconde
booke of Kinges, in the .xxiii. Chapyter.
There ſheweth holye Writ openlye,
that for the ſinne of King Dauid,
God ſent vnto him his Prophet, and
gaue him choyſe of thre things, whether
that he had leuer that GOD
ſhould ſende vpon him for his ſinne,
and of his people, hunger ſeuen yere,
or elſe he had leauer that hee ſhoulde
ſende vpon him purſute of enemies,
and to be ouercome of them thre moneths,
or yet that he had leuer that

he ſhould ſende vpon him Peſtilence
three days & three nights. And than
King Dauid truly choſe Peſtylence,
ſo that from that tyme, that he had
choſen thus peſtilēce, or it was none
of the day, there was dead. xxvii.M.
of his people. And then King Dauid
ſaw that vengeaunce was taken for
his ſinne by peſtylence, mourningly
with great ſorrow & great compaſſyon
of heart, he cryed God almyghtye
mercye, and when he had done,
anon the peſtylence ſeaced. And for
ſynne that raigned in the people, hydyous
peſtilence hath bene taken, as
was ſhewed on Ieruſalē, as telleth
Vincent in ſpeculo Hiſtoriali, & Euſebius
telleth the ſame. Therefore euery
man in what degree or what
ſtate he be, put away ſinne thorough
hartily ſorrow, and very contricion,
aſking of good mekely mercy and forgiuenes
entyrely, and amending

their lyfe, then he putteth away the
cauſe of peſtilence, that in caſe hys
vengeance taken for ſinne, and ſothlye,
ſauing we ought not to deeme
lightly of Gods priuities, this maye
be wel one cauſe of that hydeous peſtilence,
that now is reigning.
            ¶And they ſay generally in thys
realme, and truth it is that many tokens
are ſhewed, that men likely
deme that this ſinne is cauſe in part
of this peſtilence, as the corrupt ayre
and the venime thereof, the whyche
was cauſed by a cōiunction of Saturn
and Iouis, the which Planets
their working within fewe yeares,
and the malyce of thy complection,
and of other ſinne, this lefte in the
ayre and beneath, the which malice
and venime hath his reſpecte and
his influence more in the complection
of man then of beaſt, in as much
as the working of ye cōiunction and

of other ſinne was more principally
in the ſin of mankynd, then in the ſin
of another maner of beaſt. But the
working of other coniunctions dyuers
are before hand had their working
in the ſignes of other beaſtes, &
thir influence in ye cōplections of thē.
And therefore the malice of the coniunctions
was cauſe whye that the
morel fell of ſuch beaſt, more then of
other that time, but this coniunction
aforeſayd, the which was wrought
more principally in the ſinne of mankynd,
more then of any other, whoſe
venime and malice yet reigning, is
the cauſe of the corruptiō of the ayre,
the which ayr corrupt, is cauſe of the
Peſtilence that now is reigning, but
neuertheleſſe if ſo that it bee impoſſyble
by: all Phyloſophers, that the
Elemente of the Ayre, ſhould in hys
owne kynde, and in his owne
ſubſtaunce be corrupt or elſe infecte,

ſythen it is ſymple and cleane is hys
ſubſtance, wrought without any venome
or corruption. Neuertheles yet
by the way of vaporous fumoſytyes
and humors the which that are corrupt
and drawen from the earth beneath,
by vertue at tractife of the bodies
that bene aboue, & minged with
the ayre, ſo by accidentall cauſe is the
ayre corrupt and in part cauſe of this
peſtilēce. But than thou mayſt meue
againſt me, & ſay that if ſo were that
the venemous ayre, and the corruption
thereof ſhould be cauſe of peſtilence:
or elſe man, woman, and child,
ſhuld be infect therby, that it ſemeth
euery man, woman and child, ſhould
be infect & corrupt by the peſtilence.
In the countrey there y• ayre corrupt
is reigning, ſythen the ayre in ſuch a
place is cōmon to al manner of men.
To this anſwered Auicen in his Canon
in the part there he treateth, De

cura februm: that if all the peſtilence
ayre be reygning in a countrey, & if
it be common to all the inhabitantes
of that countrey, yet there ſhall none
be infect therewith, but they that be
repleat, and ful of corrupt humours,
the which corrupte humoures haue
their reſpect, and acording to receiue
the corruption and the venime of the
ayre, elſe in what countrey, or Cittye
that ſuch ayre were corrupt or venomed,
in al manner of men that receiueth
that ayre in the ſame countrey,
or in the ſame cittye, ſhould be venomed
and dead therby, ye ſee wel and
know well, that the Element of the
fyre, hath no predomination nor will
not bren, but matter that is combuſtible,
and according to receiue fyre.
On the ſame wyſe the Elemente of
the ayre that is peſtilence corrupt, in
fecteth neyther man, woman, nor
chylde, but ſuch as haue ſuch venomyd

& corupt humours within them
ſelfe diſpoſed to the ſame, the Peſtylence
thereof in ſuch tyme that ſuch
peſtilence ayre raignech in.
            After dyuerſity of venemous humours
and corruption in men reigning.
And through the working of
that venemous peſtilence ayre or diuers
ſicknes and perillous gendred
in man, woman, and chylde. And
this alteracion in kynd, is wrought
by the malice & influence of the coniuction
aforeſayd, the which malice
of coniunctiō, is likewiſe to be cauſe
of many other wonderfull alteracions
betwixt King and King, Lord
and Lorde, man and man, woman,
and woman, father & ſonne, brother
and brother, and many other. Alſo it
is lykely to bee cauſe of depoſing of
Lordes out of Lorſhippes, and inhaunſing
and inhighing of knaues.
And Emperoures of mighty men,

ſpoyling and deſtroying of Kyngdoms
and Lordſhips. And alſo it is
lyke to be cauſe of great fyres, great
miſts and great water by land. And
cauſe of many great perils by ye ſea.
            Alſo it is lykely to be cauſe of many
wonderful tokenings of great winds,
& many other wonderful things.
Alſo deſtroying of many citties, and
principally of the Sariſins ſect, and
of many other wonderfull ſickneſſe.
Alſo the Siſmy of holye Churche is
lykely to ceaſe, and dyuers ſtates to
ende, and therwith many things is
lykely to fall, by the iudgement of Aſtronomy,
ye which I will not wryte
for dyuers cauſes. But knowe it
well all manner of menne, that theſe
thinges, I rehearſe not as thinges
told by propheſy, but as concluſions
following and ſhowing by Aſtronomy,
and alſo by Aſtrology, for as declareth
Ipocras in his Booke, that

he made (De Epidimia) there ſhall
neuer Phiſytion be true in working
ne ſure Practiſor of Phiſicke, but he
work and practiſe by rules of Aſtronomy,
for Ipocras ſayeth, that it is
impoſſible yt a man ſhall cure a ſickneſſe,
but if he know the cauſe of hys
ſickneſſe, there is ſome ſyckneſſe that
is cauſed by mouing and working of
the bodyes aboue, the which a man
may not know without Aſtronomy
and Aſtrology, than it ſeemeth well
that it is impoſſible to a man to cure
ſickneſſe generally, but he can of Aſtromye
and of Aſtrology. For as I
fynde in Lybro Interprecationem,
all the fower Elements and al other
things beneath, that bene compound
of them, are gendred by the courſe of
the planets aboue, and all the lyuely
bodyes beneath haue in parte, there
being their heale, & the ſickneſſe by
the mouing of the bodyes aboue.
            
            ¶Thus endeth the fyrſt part of this
Peſtilence Treatiſe.
         
         
            ¶Here followeth the ſeconde parte
that ſheweth how man ſhuld preſerue
and keep him from
the Peſtylence.
Cap. ij.
            THe ſecond parte of this Treatyſe
is howe thou ſhalte gouerne and
preſerue thy ſelfe from the mallice of
the Peſtilence ayre, and from the
venime & corruption that is gendred
thereby, the which partye is principall
cauſe of this peſtilence that now
is reigning. The fyrſt and the principall
preſeruation there agaynſt, is
this. To gouerne thee wel and wiſelye,
and for to flie al that may gender
anye Feuer or Ague. Fyrſt, thou
needeth to keepe thee ſeuerally from
all manner of exceſſe and outrage of
meate and drinke, and namely from

all manner of Feuores meates, as
Goſe, Doue, Byrds, Malards, Veniſon,
Lampray, Scate and Eeles.
And alſo other Feuores meats, eate
no great meate, no Onyons, nor
leekes, nor garlike, nor no fruite. For
all theſe gathereth and ingendreth
vnkyndlye heates, and ſo bringeth a
man to an ague, & he be in any wyſe
of nigh diſpoſytion thereto, and vſe
no Bathes nor Stues, ſweat not to
much, for all openeth the pores of a
mans bodye, and maketh the venomous
ayre to enter, and for to infect
the blood, & the ſpiritual members of
man, & for to deſtroy al lyuely ſpirits
in man. Alſo keepe thee from haunting
of lechery, for that both openeth
the pores, and deſtroyeth the kynde
naturall, and alſo enfeebleth the ſpirituall
members, and the liuely ſpyrytes
of man.
            Alſo in the tyme of peſtilence, in no

wyſe ſuffer to greate thirſt, and if
thou thirſt, looke thou drink but meſurably,
and not but for to ſlaken thy
thirſt, and namely ſuch drinkes as
wil abate thy heate, as is Tiſan water
mingled with vyneger, or water
of Borage, water of let uſe, water of
Roſes, water of Scabious, water
of Turmentill, water of Diten mingled
in euen portions, or elſe by them
ſelfe. For theſe drinkes if the Peſtylence
reigne in the heate of the ſommer
bene profytable, and ſoueraynly
to them that bene colorike of complection,
for they be hoater and dryer
thē other, alſo to ſlepe on afternones
and when thou ſhalt go to bed, ſhut
thy dores and thy wyndowes cloſe,
and in an earthen pan full of Charcole
fyre, caſt this powder made of
theſe things, of Lorell leaues, dryed
Roſemary, and dried Frankenſence,
of ech of them a like much, & caſt half

               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
a ſponeful of this powred in the fyre.
            Alſo vſe fyre in thy chamber all the
tymes of the day and of the night, of
theſe things, as fyre of Ienoper and
if yu may not get this Ienoper, make
the fyre of cleane dry Aſhe wood and
vſe to caſt in the fyre alwaye Frankenſēce,
Storax, Calamint, Lapdanum,
and the fumoſities of theſe and
the ſmoke if the aire be corrupt, of the
vertue actractiue of ye liuely ſpirites,
and the ſpiritual members outward
by the vaynes of the hearte, and ſo
inuenomes it, & theſe haſteth a man
to his death. But if the nature of
the Peſtilence be gendred betwixte
the thigh and the body, it is a tokening
that it commeth from infection
of the liuer, & than if the matter appere
in ye ſcher beſide the priuy members,
bleede on the foote in the ſame
ſide, on the vaine that is betwixt thy
great toe, and the nexte toe, for if the

botch be drawing thether. And thou
blede on the arme, the matter thē wil
draw vp agayne to the lyuer, and ſo
to the hart & that is perrillous. And
if the botch be more outward to the
ſyde, and farther frō the preuy members,
blede thē on the vayn betwene
the anckle and the foote, & the heele,
or elſe on the vayne that is vnder the
ankle that is called the Sophem: or
elſe loke yt thou be ſoone ventuſed wt
a vētoſing, beſt beneth the botch, but
that is very paynful. Neuertheles in
caſe that the vayn may not be taken
or elſe that the vayne may not bleed,
it muſt needs be ſuffred, in ſuch perrill
may thou be. If the matter appeare
in the clenſing part of the head
conſyder wel on what ſyde it appeareth,
and bleede on the vayne, or on
the arme the which vayne lieth next
the Cardiacle, the which Cardiacle
lyeth in the midſt of the arme, righte

in the bouth of the arme, or elſe blede
on the vayne that is on the hande,
that is betwixt the thombe and the
nexte finger, or elſe be ventoſed betwixt
the ſhoulders. But take good
heede, that when ſo euer thou haſte
bled of anye of theſe vaynes, take
good heede that thou ſleepe not after
thy blood letting of .xiii. howers. If
thou be riche and may well ſpende,
then it were good to haue this Pomamber,
euermore in thy hand, hold
it to thy noſe that thou may receyue
the ſauour and ſmel therof, for cōforting
of the brayne, (and of all other
Spiritual members, the which thou
ſhalte make thus, take Lapdanum,
pured one ounce ſtorax, calamint, diſolued
Roſes, Cloues, Maces, of ech
one three halfepeny wayght, & make
thē in pouder, that ought to be made
in pouder, & fyue ſponeful of oyle debay,
an ounce of Virgin waxe, and

diſſolue them, and when they be diſſolued,
put all together and myngle
them well, vnto they be cold, & make
thereof a ball the quantitie of a walnutte,
and that is called the Pomeamber,
the ſent or the ſmell thereof
will comforte the lyuely ſpyrites in
man, and if thou rule thee thus as
I haue taught thee, thou may by the
grace of god and by his gouernance
preſerue thy ſelfe from the Peſtylence.
            ¶Thus endeth the ſecond parte of
the Peſtilence treatiſe.
         
         
            And here followeth the thyrd parte
that ſheweth & a man be taken with
the peſtilence, what remedy and medicine
is beſt therfore. Cap. iij.
            HEre the thyrd parte of this treatiſe,
telleth what is agaynſt this
ſickneſſe of the peſtylence, that reigneth
among the people, and what
medicine is beſt therefore. Auicen

in his Canon on the parte, there hee
treateth De dura februm, there is no
ſicknes that falleth in kind but there
is medicine in kynde for it. Therfore
if ſo be it be taken in due tyme, than
if thou ſhalte fall into this ſickneſſe,
looke that thou be letten blood, as I
haue told. And if there be any feuer,
or any ague annexed thereto and the
corrupt blood be drawne awaye, on
this bleeding as I haue tolde. (And
the princypall members ventuſed,)
the heart ought then to be comforted
with good Letwers, or with colde
water ſtilled, the which Letwers be
theſe, that wil withdraw vnkindlye
heates, as conſerue of Vyolets, conſerue
of Borage, conſerue of Buglos
drawn with ſuger, decoct with water
of Turmentill, water of Endiue,
Water of Roſes, water of Borage,
mingled by euen portion. And then
take theſe euery daye, & euery houre

of the day, with water of Turmentil,
water of Scabious, water of Vyolets,
or elſe water of Endiue.
            Alſo it were needefull to haue this
water diſtilled of theſe herbs, of Detan
of Scabious of Turmentill, of
Vyolets, of Endiue, and Letiſe, and
for to drinke theſe mingled wt whyte
wytte of Gaſcan, or elſe of Rochell
witte, and namely, the whilſt that vnkindly
heate reigneth.
            Alſo it were needefull to haue water
of Roſes, and Byttayne to waſhe
thy temples withall, and thy pulſe
withal, of thy Arme and thy hands.
            And alſo it were needeful to take of
the laſt, that is to ſay of Roſe, and of

                  〈◊〉
                and put thereof in a ſaucer
of pewter, or in a ſiluer pece, & chauſe
it of little, and 
                  ••
               p a linnen Cloth .iiij.
wide, and were it therein. And the

                  〈◊〉
                thou arte in thy great heate of
the agrie, lay the linnen cloth were in

the water vpon thy temples, & vpon
thy forehead, and another vpon thy
lyuer. Take alſo two other clothes
lapped and were on the ſame wyſe,
and laye in euerie armehole one, and
thys practyſyng ſhall doe thee great
eaſe, whether thou bee curable & ſhal
lyue, or vncurable, and ſhall die.
            But the moſte nedeefull thyng of
all, if ſo he that this were in any wiſe
aforeſayde, is for to drawe the botch
by craft away frō the clenſyng place
a great ſpace from the hart. And that
ſhall I tell the how, & in all my practiſyng
in Phiſicke this .xviij. yeare, I
wyft it neuer fall but twyſe, and that
was not long of the medicine. And
one other tyme but of other defautes
the which I will not wryte, at thys
tyme, though it will expell, and vorde
it. And looke in the tyme of peſtilence
that thy codmares be alway freſhlye
waſhen, and after the waſhing, loke

that they be dipped in the fyne water
of Roſes, and on the ſame wyſe the
kerchefe that thou lappeſt thy heade
in on nightes, and let it drye by the
fyre: and not by the peſtylence ayre.
And when thou layeſt thee downe to
ſleepe, lay vnder thy head and vnder
the ende of thy pillow that is toward
thy vyſage, Roſemary, Iſope, Souerayn
mynts, Perial, Rial, Lorel leaues,
put in thy mouth Maces, and
Cloues, or elſe Nutmegges, looke euery
day yt thou take of fyne Treacle
proued the quantity of a beane, and a
half. Alſo bere in thy purſe theſe maner
of ſpyces, Maces, Cloues, Duybybes,
Canel, or elſe Cynamon, and
chewe thereof, and eate therof all the
tymes of the day.
            ¶And if thou be a poore man, and
maye not intende to the coſtes of
theſe thinges. Take then euerye
daye faſtinge, myne ſyppes in fyne

vyneger of whyte wyne, or elſe of
read wyne, and drinke to them a ſaucer
full of Vyneger, or thou paſſe out
of thy houſe or place.
            Alſo one of the beſt gouernaunce of
all, is in blood letting, for thou ſhalts
vnderſtand that a man is in ſpirytuall
members principall, that is for to
ſay, the hart, the liuer, and the brayn,
and euery one of theſe hath his place
geuen him by kynde, by the which he
may auoyde al ſuch ſuperfluities, and
cleare himſelfe.
            The heart hath his clenſing place
in the arme hole.
            The cleanſing place of the lyuer, is
betwixt the thigh and the body.
            The cleanſing place of the brayn, is
vnder the eares of the eare rootes,
and the throate.
            Then this ſickneſſe of the peſtilence
commeth thus, when the poores of a
man are open, then fyrſte entreth the

venemous and the corrupt ayre, and
as ſoone as it hath maiſtry, and mingled
with mans blood, then runneth
it to the heart, that is roote & ground
of mans lyfe, for to deſtroy mankind,
and for to infect and deſtroy all lyuely
ſpirites in a man, and ſo fynallye
for to kill and flea him, but the hearte
and the cleane blood, flyeth all that
is noyous, & contrarious vnto kynd.
And in as much as in him is expelled
all ſuch manner of corruption, and
venemous from him, to his clenſyng
place to the armehole: But than for
that place is ſometyme ſtopped that
it may not out, and it paſſeth then all
the principall member, nexte that is
the lyuer for to deſtroy it.
            And then it doth as the heart doth
in hys kynde. And expelleth it from
him to his clenſing place, betwixte
the thigh and the bodye, for it is alſo
ſpared in caſe, and ſtopped it maye

not out, but paſſeth the meates and
the vaynes vnto the thyrd principall
member, that is the brayne, but then
he would expel it to his clenſing place
that is vnder the eares, and it maye
not in caſe out, therfore the ſtopping
and the ſparing of the meates and
poores and for thickneſſe of the foule
and corrupt blood, and the venemous
matter is moouing, that is mingled
therewith, and thus long tyme the
matter is mouing or it reſteth in any
place, ſometyme twelue howers,
and ſometyme .xxiiij. howers, and
ſomtime more & ſometyme leſſe, after
the degree and the gentleneſſe, & the
greatneſſe of the ſicknes corruptions
and venemous that be gendred. But
thē at the laſt ſomtime within .xxiiij.
hours, it paſſeth not out of ye clenſing
place, nor at no other place thorough
bleding, then it feſtures in ſome place
and caſt a mā into an ague & maketh

a botch in ſome of the three cleanſing
places, or elſe nexte to them on ſome
vaine, ye ſhall well wit that a botche
groundeth him euermore and ſetteth
him on a vayne, and letteth the blood
that than it may not haue his kynde
lye courſe by the vayne as he ſhoulde
haue, but it is infect thereby. And ſo
all the principall and ſpyrituall members
are infect, and thus ſleieth men.
         
         
            Thus endeth the thyrde parte of
this Peſtilence treatiſe. And hereafter

an houre of the day, & an houre of the

the one leaueth and the other taketh.
And then take we out Planets from

is night, and about the month
of Decēber, the days haue but eight
houres, artificials of the Clocke, and
they haue twelue temporals, then let

the eyghte howers Artificials be deuyded
in twelue egall partes, and it
ſhall be twelue tymes .lx. minuts, and
euery part ſhal be a temporall houre,
that ſhall be of a fortye minutes, and
no mo, thus in December the temporal
howers of the day haue but forty

haue .lxxx. minutes. For that time the

and is euyll to doe thinges whyche
thou wouldſt ſhould laſt long, for as
much as the Ramme is a beaſt, that

there then ſhoulde no medecyne nor
paſſyon be taken inward, whyle the

medicines and paſſyons receyued
in that tyme, men ſhoulde caſte
them vp agayne, and ſo it falleth in

and ſtably to abyde. It is euill
to begin battayle or to fyghte. For it
cauſeth the tyme to be colde and drye
and the wynde to haue his courſe

abroade by the earth.
            The man that is borne vnder thys

            It is good that time to treate of

friendſhip, and when the moone is in

in the blumes, for Gemini gouerneth
