                  •
               gan,
             and was approued King:
            By force of Armes great Victories won,
             and conquest home did bring:
            Then into Brittaine straight he came,
             where fiftie good and able
            Knights then repaired vnto him,
             which were of the Round-table.
            And many Iustes and Turnaments,
             before him there were brest:
            Wherein both Knights did then excell,
             and far surmount the rest:
            But one Sir Lancelot du Lake,
            
             who was approoued we
                  •
               :
            He in his sight and deeds of Armes,
             all other did excell.
            When he had rested him a while,
             to play and game and sport;
            He thought he would approue himselfe,
             in some aduenturous sort:
            He armed rode in Forest wide, and met a Damsell faire,
            Who told him of aduentures great: wherto he gaue good eare.
            Why should I not (quoth Lancelot tho)
             for that cause came I hither.
            Thou seemist (quoth she) 
                  •
                Knight right good
             and I will bring thee thither,
            Whereas the mightiest Knights doth dwell
             that now is of great fame:
            Wherefore tell me what Knight thou art,
             and then what is thy name:
            My name is Lancelot du Lake.
            
            Quoth shee, it likes me than:
            Here dwels a Knight that neuer was
             e're matcht of any man:
            Who hath in Prison threescore Knights
             and foure, that he hath won?
            Knights of King Arthurs Court they be,
             and of the Table-round;
            She brought him to a riuer then,
             and also to a tree,
            Whereas acopper Bason hung,
             his fellowes Shields to see,
            He stroke so hard, the Bason broke;
            When Tarquin heard the sound,
            He droue a Horse before him straight,
             whereon a Knight lay bound,
            Sir Knight (then said Sir Lancelot tho)
             bring me that Horse-load hither,
            And lay him downe, and let him rest,
             weele try our force togeather:
            For as I vnderstand, thou hast,
             as farre as thou art able,
            Done great despight and shame vnto
             the Knights of the Round-table,
            If thou be of the Table-round,
            (quoth Tarquin speedily)
            Both thee and all thy fellowship,
             I vtterly defie.
            Thats ouermuch (quoth Lancelot tho)
             defend thee by and by,
            They put their spurs, vnto their Steeds,
             and each at other fly:
            They couch their Speares, and Horses run,
             as though there had bene thunder,
            And each stroke there amidst the shield,
             wherewith they brake in sunder:
            Their Horses backs brake vnder them,
             the Knights were both astound:
            To voide their horses they made great haste
             to light vpon the ground:
            They tooke them to their Shields full fast,
             their Swords they drue out then:
            With mighty stroakes most eagerly,
             each one to other can,
            They wounded were, and bled full sore,
             for breath they both did stand;
            And leaning on their Swords a while,
             quoth Tarquin hold thy hand
            And tell to mee what I shall aske.
             say on quoth Lancelot tho.
            Thou art (quoth Tarquin) the best Knight
             that euer I did know,
            And like a Knight tha
                  •
                did hate:
             so that that thou be not he,
            I will deliuer all the rest,
             and eke accord with thee.
            That is 
                  〈…〉
                (quoth Lancelot then)
             but sith it so must be,
            What is that Knight thou hatest so,
             I pray thee shew to mee:
            His name's Sir Lancelot du Lake,
            
             He slew my brother deare:
            Him I suspect of all the rest,
             I would I had him here.
            Thy Wish thou hast, but now vnknowne▪
            
             I am Lancelot du Lake,
            
            Now Knight of Arthurs Table-round,
             King Hand 
               
                  •
               onne of Benwake:
            And I defie thee doe thy worst,
             Ha, ha, (quoth Tarquin tho)
            One of vs two shall end our liues,
             before that we doe goe:
            If thou be Lancelot du Lake,
            
             then welcome thou shalt be:
            Wherefore, see thou thy selfe defend,
             for now I thee defie.
            They hurled them togeather so,
             like two wild Bores, so rashing:
            And with their Swords & Shields they ran
             at one another lashing.

               rinkled was with Blood:
             
               Tarquin began to faint,
            For he gaue backe, and bore his Shield
             so low he did repent.
            That soonee spide Sir Lancelot tho,
             he lept vpon him then:
            He puld him downe vpon his knee,
             and rushed-off his Helmne:
            And then he strooke his necke in two,
             And when he had done so.
            From prison threescore Knight and

               Lancelot deliuered tho.
