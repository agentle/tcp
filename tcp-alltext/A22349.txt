               And that in the meane while, for the preseruation of the peace, and necessary proceedings in matters of iustice, and for the safety and seruice of the State, all the said persons, of whatsoeuer degree or condition, may not faile, euery one seuerally, according to his place, office, or charge, to proceede in the performance and execution of all duties thereunto belonging, as formerly appertained vnto them, and euery of them, while the late Kings Maiestie was liuing.
            And further, His Maiestie doth hereby will and command all and singuler His Highnesse Subiects, of what estate, dignitie or degree, they, or any of them be, to be ayding, helping, assisting, and at the commandement of the said officers and ministers, in the performance, and execution of the said offices and places, as they, and euery of them, tender his Maiesties pleasure, and will answere for the contrary, at their vttermost perils.
            And further, His Maiesties will, and pleasure, and expresse commandement is, That all orders and directions made, or giuen by the Lords of the Priuie Counsell of the late King, in his life time, shall be obeyed; and performed by all, and euery person and persons, and all, and euery thing, and things to be done thereupon, shall proceede as fully and amply, as the same should haue beene obeyed or done, in the life of the said late King, His Maiesties most deare and entirely beloued Father.
            
               Giuen at His Maiesties Court at S. Iames,
