               The two verses, which I rehersid before
               I finde writt

                  n, in the boke of Cato the wyse
               Emongs good precepts, of lyuing a thousand more

               And hartelye I besiche him that hanged on the rode
               That he neuer eate nor drynke, that may do him good
               And that he dye a shamefull dethe sauing my cheryte
            
            
               ¶Careawaie
               I pray god send him suche prosperitie
               That hath caused me to haue all this busines
               But yet syrs you see the charitye of my maistris
               She liueth after a wonderfull cheritable facion
               For I assure you she is alwayes in this passion
               And scacelye on daye throughout the hole yere
               She woll wyshe any man better chere
               And sum tyme yf she well angred bee
               I pray god (woll she saye) y• house may sinke vnder mee
               But maysters yf you happen to see that other I
               As that you shall it is not verye likelye
               Nor I woll not desyre you for him purposelye to looke
               For it is an vncomperable vnhappye hooke
               And if it be I, you might happin to seeke
               And not fynd me out in an hole weeke
               For whan I was wonte to rune a waye

               Houbeit for all this I thinke it be not I
               For to shew the matter in dyde trulye
               I neuer vse to rune awaye in wynter nor in vere

               Wherby a boye maye liue a brod a moneth or two
               This cast do I vse I woll not with you fayne
               Therfore I wonder if he be I sertaine
               But and if he be, and you mete me a brod by chaunce
               Send me home to my waister with a vengaunce
               And shew him if he cume not ere to morowe night
               I woll neuer receyue him agayne if I myght
