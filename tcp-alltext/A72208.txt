and peace, in Chriſt
Ieſus, Amen.
            
               DEare Siſter, you knowe this
World is not your home, but
a Pilgrimage, and a place
wherein God trieth his children:
And I doubt not, but
you haue learned, howe to make right vſe
and profit of the Lord his merciful chaſtiſements:
For, the Lord vſeth many waies and
meanes for the triall of his. I knowe, You
haue heard of the patience of IOB, (as
ſaith the Apoſtle IAMES) and you haue ſeene
in the end, how that God is merciful, patient
and long ſuffering: euen ſo ſay I vnto you,
that you ſhall receiue accordingly, if ſo be
you be patient: that is, if you feare God, ſet

his vvord before your eies, and ſerue him
thereafter: and if hee lay his croſſe on you,
beare it with patience, the which you ſhall
do, when you conſidder it, not according
to the preſent ſenſe, but according to the
end. Heb. 12. And I doubt not, but you
are of the number of them, which are daily
dying to themſelues, and this ſinfull world:
Ye are one of them that lookes for a citie,
whoſe builder and maker is God:
               Heb. 13. 14 Ye are
one of them that knowes your ſelfe and your
being,Geneſ. 15. 13. 14. to be in this earth, but as a Pilgrime
and ſtranger: for heere yee haue no byding
place: Yee are one of them which haue made
a Covenant with God,
               Deut. 29. 14. 15. to forſake your
ſelfe, and this ſinfull World: Yee are one of
them,Mal. 3. 16. vvho ſay, Nay, The Lord hath all
things written in his memoriall book,
for ſuch as feare him & remember his
Name: Yee are one of them, vvhich haue
their Loynes girded about,
               Luk. 52. 35 
               and their
lights burning in their hands: Like vnto
ſervants that wayte vpon their Lordes
comming: Yea, and I am certainlie perſwaded,
that you (and your godly Brethren and

Siſter,) are of the number of them, vvho
haue the Lord for their portion,
               Deut. 32. 
                     •
                  
                which
haue their hope in heaven,
               Col. 1. 27. vvhoſe leader
is Chriſt Ieſus the ſonne of God, and governour
of Heaven and Earth, vnto him is
given all power,
               Mat. 28. 18. he is God almightie with
the Father and the holy Ghoſt, praiſe vvorthie
for euermore.
            Now (deare ſiſter) I partly knowing the
preſent eſtate of your troubled & perplexed
minde, in regard of the want of your greateſt
outwarde comfort, I thoght it good, to
preſent you with this ſweet Sermon (made
by that godly-learned & zealous Paſtor of
Chriſts Church, M. RICHARD GREENHAM)
which by Gods providence came vnto
my handes; containing a comfort for a
troubled conſcience, he being throgh the
mercy of God, a man greatly exerciſed therewith,
and therfore taught the ſame through
his owne experience: hoping, through the
working of Gods holy ſpirit, it ſhal alſo miniſter
comfort vnto your trobled mind. Therfore
(my dear ſiſter) to conclude, I beſeech you
to be inſtāt with our merciful God, by harty

praier, for the ſpirit of wiſdome, knowledge,
humblenes, meeknes, ſobriety & repentance,
which euen the beſt of Gods Children haue
great neede of, becauſe our ſins continuallie
prouokes the Lord our God to be angrie with
vs: but let vs beare his fatherly corrections,
& acknowledge our faults with bitter tears,
and ſorrowfull ſighes: not doubting, but ſo
hee will be mercifull vnto vs in Chriſt: To
whome with the Father and the holy ſpirit,
be all glory, honour, praiſe, and everlaſting
thanks, for euermore. Amen.
            
               Your wel-willer in the Lord
Chriſt.

               PROV. 18. 14.
               
                  The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtaine his infirmitie:
but a wounded ſpirit vvho canne
beare it.
               
            
            
               THIS Scripture is not
onely woorthie to be
grauen in ſteele with
the point of an Adamant,
and in letters of
golde; but alſo to bee
written and regiſtred by the finger of
Gods ſpirit in the tables of the hearte:
which ſentence, brieflie ſpeaketh thus
much vnto vs; that what trouble ſoever

befalleth a man, his mind vnapalled, he
will indifferently beare it out: But if the
ſpirite of a man be once troubled and
diſmaied, he cannot tell how to be deliuered.
And no marvell, for if the minde
of man be that fountaine of comforte,
which miniſters comfort to him in all
other troubles, and if it become comfortleſſe,
what ſhall comfort it? if it be
voide of help, where ſhall 
                  〈◊〉
                be helped?
If the eye which is the light of the bodie,
be darknes; how great is that darknes?
If the ſalt which ſauoreth all things
be vnſauorie, for what is it good? If the
minde which ſuſtaineth all troubles be
troubled, how intollerable is that trouble?
To ſhewe this the better, wee will
firſt declare, howe great a puniſhment
of God this wounde of Conſcience is.
Secondly, we will teach, how this trouble
of mind may be avoided. Laſtly, we
will ſet downe, how Gods children falling
in ſome meaſure into this affliction
of ſpirit, may be recouered out of it.
            For the firſt, the griefe of this maladie

is ſeene, either by ſome due conſideration
of the perſones that haue felt it,
or by ſome wiſe compariſon, made betweene
this griefe of minde, and other
outward griefes incident to a man.
            The perſons, in whome we may conſider
this wounde of ſpirite, are either
meerlie naturall men, or ſuch as be renewed
by the ſpirite of God: the men
meerly naturall, are either the heathen,
ſuch as never knewe God in Chriſt: or
carnall profeſſors, ſuch as haue not proteſted
Chriſtianitie aright: If we looke
among the Heathen, howe many of
them haue willingly gone vnder povertie,
and haue bene content to vnburden
themſelues of all worldly treſures, how
haue ſome of them, whileſt their minds
were vnapalled, ſuffered impriſonment
exile, and extreame tortures of bodie,
rather than they woulde betraye their
Cuntries: &c. How many of them haue
devoured many injuries, and born outward
troubles with ſome eaſe, and with
no reſiſtance, whileſt their minds were

at libertie? and yet look not to the 
                  •••
               
               neſt,
but to the beſt and moſt excellent
men among them, even their wiſe Philoſophers,
ſweet Oratours, and exquiſite
Poets; who in bearing and forbearing,
they thought the chiefeſt point of
vertue to conſiſt: and yet yee ſhall ſee,
when once ſome great diſtreſſe of mind
did wound them; ſome would make an
end of it, by preparing a cup of deadlie
poyſon; ſome would violently and voluntarilie
run on their enemies pykes;
ſome would throwe downe themſelues
from high mountaines; ſome woulde
not ſtick to ſtabbe moſt monſtrouſlie
their own bodies with daggers, or ſuch
like inſtruments of death. All which
men, woulde ſeeme to haue great courage,
in ſuſtaining many harmes, ſo
long as their minds were not ouer maiſtered;
but when that devine and ſupreame
eſſence which they acknowledged,
did by his power croſſe and ouerturne
their wittie deviſes, and head-ſtrong
attemptes, ſo as without hope

of remedy, they were hampered in penſiuenes
and ſorrow of mind: then being
not able to turne themſelues vnder ſo
heauy a burden, they ſhrink down, and
by violent death, would ridde themſelues
of that diſquietnes and impatiencie
of their troubled mindes. But, let
vs come neerer, and whether we behold
the Papiſtes, or the familie of Loue, or
the common ſort of Chriſtians, we ſhal
ſee, they will paſſe quietly through many
afflictions; whether for that they
haue a ſpirit of ſlumbering and numneſſe
caſt on them; whether becauſe
they haue branned themſelues through
ſom ſenſles blockiſhnes, as men hewen
out of hard oaks, or grauen out of marble
ſtones, I knowe not: but yet when
the Lord ſhall let loſe the cord of their
conſcience, and ſhall ſet before their
faces their ſinnes committed, ſee what
fearfull ends they haue: ſo, whileſt ſome
of them by hanging themſelues, ſome
by caſting themſelues into the water,
ſome by cutting their owne throates,

haue ridde themſelues out of their intollerable
griefes. Now, wherein is the
difference, that ſome die ſo ſenſleſlie,
and ſome diſpatch them ſo violentlie?
Surely, the one feeling no ſinne, depart
like brutiſh hoggs: the other ſure charged
with ſin, depart like barking dogs:
But let vs come to the children of God,
who haue in ſome degrees felt this troble
of minde, and it will appeare both
in the members, and in the heade of all
burthens, to be a thing moſt intollerable
to ſuffer a wounded conſcience: and
to begin with, let vs ſet in the firſt ranke
Iob, that man of God, commended vnto
vs by the holy Ghoſt, for a mirrour of
patience; who although for his riches,
he was the welthieſt man in the land of
VZ, and for his authoritie might haue
made afraide a great multitude: whoſe
ſubſtance was the greateſt of all the
men of the Eaſt: yet when the Sabeans
came violently and tooke away all his
cattell; when the fyre of God from heauen
burnt vp his ſheep & his ſervants;

when the Caldeans had taken away his
Camels; when a greate winde ſmote
downe his houſe vpon his children; although
indeede he rent his garments,
which was not ſo much for impatiencie,
as to ſhewe that he was not vnſenſible
in theſe euills: yet it is ſaid, that he
worſhipped & bleſſed the name of the
Lord, ſaying: Naked came I out of my mothers
wombe, and naked ſhall I returne thither:
Howbeit, beholde, when at the
ſtrong conference of his comfortleſſe
friendes, his minde began to be agaſht,
which was not ſo in all his former tryall:
when his Conſcience began to bee
troubled, when he ſawe the Lord faſten
in him ſharp arrowes, and to ſet him vp
as a Butt to ſhoot at: when he thought
God cauſed him to poſſeſſe the ſinnes
of his youth, this glorious patterne of
patience, could not beare his griefe, he
was heauie, and ſo may commend to
all, the image of a wounded ſpirite that
ſhall come after. Dauid, a man choſen
according to the Lords owne heart: Ezeckiah,
               
a pure worſhipper of God, and
a carefull reſtorer of true Religion, Ieremiah
the Prophet of the Lord, ſanctified
and ordained to that office before he
was formed in his mothers wombe,
were rare and ſingular in the graces of
God: yet when they felt this wounde
pearcing them, with grief of hart; they
wer as Sparrows mourning, as Cranes
chattering, as Pellicanes caſting out
fearful cries: they thoght themſelues as
in the graue, they wiſhed to haue dwelt
ſolitarie, they were as bottels parched
in the ſmoke, they were as Doues mourning,
not able without ſighes & grones
to vtter their wordes, their hartes claue
to the duſt, & their tongues to the roofe
of their mouth: but aboue all, if theſe
were not ſufficient to perſwade vs in
this doctrine, there remaineth one example,
whome wee affirme to be the
perfite annotomie of an afflicted mind;
that is, the Lord and Saviour of vs all,
Chriſt Ieſus, the Image of the Father,
the heade of the bodie, the mirrour of

all graces: the wiſedome, righteouſnes,
holines and redemption of all Saints;
who ſuſtained the croſſe, even from his
youth vpwarde, beſides povertie, baſenes,
and hunger, did willingly vndergo
that great trouble of contempt and reproch,
and that among them, where he
ſhould haue had a right deſerued honour,
in reſpect of the doctrine that hee
taught them, and in regard of the manifold
miracles wrought among them:
as the healing of the ſicke; the giuing
ſight to the blinde; and reſtoring life to
the dead: this vnkindnes nevertheleſſe,
did not ſo much ſtick into him; but, at
what time hee was ſet as a ſacrifice for
all, when hee was to beare our infirmities,
and carie our ſorrowes; at what
time hee was plagued, ſmitten of God,
humbled and wounded for our tranſgreſſions;
when hee ſhould be broken
for our iniquities, and the chaſtiſement
of our peace was vpon him, then he cried
out, My ſoule is heauie euen vnto the
death, then hee praieth, O Father, if it be

poſsible, let this cup paſſe from me: but how
praied hee? even with ſweating: howe
ſweated he? even drops of blood: how
often praied he? three times: when ended
his agonie? not till hee was deade:
what ſaid he being ready to depart? My
God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?
was this for his humane death, as ſome
haue imagined? no, wee wicked men
haue died without complaint, whoſe
patience then might haue ſeemed to
exceede his: it was his ſuffering in his
humane ſpirite, which encountered
with the wrath of God, his God-heade
ſuppreſſing it for a while, hee ſuffered
many torments in his bodie, but much
more heavilie did the wrath of God lie
vpon his ſoule: if this conſideration of
an afflicted ſpirite in theſe examples,
doth not ſufficiently ſhew, what a grieuous
thing it is to ſuffer a wounded conſcience,
let vs proceed with the comparing
of this with other euils, which
falleth into the nature of man: there is
no ſickneſſe, but phiſick prouideth it a

remedie: there is no ſore, but Chirurgerie
wil afforde a ſalue: freindſhip helpeth
povertie: there is no impreſonment,
but there is hope of libertie; ſute
and favour recouereth a man from baniſhment:
authoritie and time weareth
away reproch. But what phiſick cureth:
what chirurgerie ſalveth: what riches
ranſome: what countenance beareth
out: what authoritie aſſwageth: what
ſalue delayeth a troubled conſcience?
All theſe banded togeather in league:
though they would conſpyre a confederacie,
cannot help this our diſtres of
a troubled or vnquyet mynde. And yet
this one comfort of a quyet mynd doth
wonderfullie cure, and comfortablie aſwage
all other griefes whatſoeuer. For
if our aſſiſtance wer, as an hoſt of armed
ſouldiers: if our friends were the Princes
and all the governours of the earth:
if our poſſeſſions were as large as betwene
the eaſt and the weſt: if our meat
were as Manna from heaven: if our apparell
were as coſtelie, as the Ephod of

               Aaron: if euerie day were as glorious
as the day of Chriſts reſurrection: yet
our mindes, beeing appalled with the
judgement of God, theſe things would
little comfort vs. Let experience ſpeak,
if a troubled mynd impaireth not helth
& dryeth not vp the blood, conſumeth
not the marrowe, pyneth not away the
fleſhe, and conſumeth the bones: if it
make not all pleaſures painefull, and
ſhortneth not the life: ſurely no wiſedome
can conceale it, no counſell can
adviſe it, no adviſe can aſſwage it, no aſſwagement
can cure it, no eloquence
can perſwade it, no power can overcome
it, no ſcepter will affray it, no Enchanter
can charme it; and yet on the
contrary. If a man languiſh in ſickneſſe,
ſo his heart be whole, and he is perſwaded
of the health of his ſoule; his ſicknes
doth not grieue him. If a man be reproched,
ſo he be precious in the ſight
of God and his Angels, what loſſe hath
he? If a man be baniſhed, and yet doubteth
not, that heaven is his cuntrie, and

that he is a Citizen among the Saints,
it doth not appall him. If a man be in
trouble, and findeth peace of Conſcience,
he wil quietly diſgeſt his trouble:
but if the minde be troubled, who dareth
meete with the wrath of the Lord
of Hoſtes? Who can put to ſilence the
voice of deſperation? Who wil ſtep out
& make an agrement with the higheſt
to ſpare vs? Who dare make a covenant
with the devill, that he would not
lay claime to vs? If then a good conſcience
helpeth all evills, and all other benefites
of this life, in them ſelues cannot
help a troubled conſcience, nor ſee
it true by proofe, which heare it by prouerb,
The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtaine his
infirmitie, but a vvounded ſpirit who can
beare it? Againe, in all other afflictions,
we may haue ſome comfort againſt ſin,
but this is ever accompanied with the
accuſation of ſinne: A man may be ſick,
reproched, impriſoned, and yet in all
theſe haue a cleare conſcience, his own
heart telling him, that there is no ſpirituall

cauſe of theſe croſſes in him, but
that he may ſuffer them for the triall of
his faith, or for righteouſnes ſake and
wel doing: but where the ſpirit is wounded,
there is ſtill a guiltines of ſinne;
and when a mans ſpirit is troubled, hee
ſuſpecteth all his waies, hee feareth all
his ſinnes, he knoweth not what ſinne
to begin with, it breedeth ſuch hurlie-burlies
in him; that when it is day, hee
wiſheth it were night, and when it is
night, he would haue it day: his meate
doth not nouriſh him, his dreames are
fearfull vnto him, his ſleep often tymes
forſaketh him; if he ſpeake, hee is little
eaſed; if hee keepe ſilence, hee boyleth
with diſquietnes of heart: the light doth
not comfort him, the darkneſſe doeth
grieue him; to proſecute our compariſon:
where all other evills are the more
tollerable, becauſe they be temporall
and purſues vs but to death; this not being
cured, endeth not in death, but becommeth
eternallie: for even the Heathen
men thought, that death was the

end of al miſeries: the perſwaſion thereof,
made them being in ſome miſerie,
to make an end of themſelues, and haſten
their owne death; as Sathan doeth
make many now adaies to do, who are
ignorant of the Hells, which is a place
of far greater paine, than any they can
ſuffer in this world whatſoeuer. Howbeit,
a tormented conſcience, if before
it was begun, is now continued; or if it
were not before, nowe beginneth, and
never endeth, world without end. For,
though true it is, that povertie, impriſonment
or baniſhment, haue ended
their times in death, yet a wounded
heart, which was temporall in this life;
that which before death was in hope
recoverable, is after death made both
vncurable, and vnrecoverable. It is
good then to conſidder, if even in this
life, the torment of Conſcience bee ſo
fearefull, how much more grievous it is
to ſuſtaine it in hell, where that is infinite,
which here is finite; where that is
vnmeaſurable, which heere is meaſurable,

where is the ſea of ſorrowe, whereof
this is but a drop; where is the flame
of that fyre, whereof this is but a ſpark:
But to ſhut vp argument, ſome there
haue beene, that throughout their life
time, haue beene free from other troubles;
ſo as either they felt them not at
all, or in very ſmal meaſure, and by that
meanes never knewe their head-ache:
For povertie, never knewe what want
meant: who for diſcredit, were never euill
ſpoken of; who ever put farre from
them the evill daye of the Lord: who
haue made a league with death (as it
were) and a covenant with hell; who
thoght they could crucifie every croſſe
rather than come vnder any, yet they
could never eſcape a wounded conſcience,
either in this life or in the life to
come: true it is, that Gods children by
faith and repentance doe oft eſcape it;
but the wicked and ſuch as are borne to
it, as to their ſure inheritance, the more
they flie from it, the more it purſueth
them. If we tranſgreſſe the civil lawes,

the Iudge by bribes may be corrupted:
If a man haue committed ſome capital
offence by flying his Cuntrie, hee may
eſcape the Magiſtrates hands: But our
conſcience telling vs, that we haue ſinned
againſt God: what bribe ſhall wee
offer, or whither ſhall wee flee? where
ſhall we go from his ſpirite, or whither
ſhall we flee from his preſence? If wee
aſcend into heauen, is hee not there? If
we lie downe in hel, is hee not there? If
wee flie to the vttermoſt partes of the
earth, is he not there alſo? there nedeth
no Paritoure to ſummon vs, there needeth
no Bailife to fetch vs, there needes
no accuſer to giue in verdite againſt
vs: ſinne will arreſt vs, and lieth at the
doore, our owne conſcience will impanell
a queaſt againſt vs, our own hearts
will giue in ſufficient evidence, and our
iniquities will pleade guiltie to our faces:
Thus wee ſee, both by the experience
of them that haue ſuffered the
wound of the ſpirit, and the comparing
it with other evills: what a weight moſt

grievous, and a burthen intollerable it
is, to haue a tormented Conſcience.
Nowe, let vs ſhewe howe we may preuent
it, and by what meanes Gods children
often fall into ſome degrees of it:
but if it rage in extremitie, it is an euill
vnrecoverable, yet many ſafely and quietly
be deliuered from it: and heere a
juſt complaint is to be taken vp; and it
is a woonder to be marked, (if we may
wonder at Gods works) that we ſee many
ſo carefull and watchfull to avoide
other troubles, and ſo few or none take
any paine to eſcape trouble of minde,
which is ſo grievous; we ſee men loving
health, and loathing ſickneſſe; in dyet
temperate; in ſleepe moderate; in phiſick
expert; skilfull to purge; and ſo to
avoid ſuch corrupt humours which in
time many breede, though preſently
they do not bring forth ſicknes: yet to
avoide the diſeaſes of the ſoule, no man
abateth his ſleepe, none abridgeth his
dyet, no man prepareth phiſick for it,
no man knoweth when to be full, and

when to be emptie: howe to want, and
howe to abounde: others, carried away
with the loue of riches, and fearfull to
fall into povertie, will not ſtick to riſe
early, to take ſleepe lately, to fare hardly,
to travell and tyre their fleſhe in labour,
by Land and by Sea, in faire and
fowle weather, by rockes and by ſands,
from farre and from neere: but to fall
into ſpirituall decay, to avoide the pouertie
of Conſcience, noe man taketh
ſuch paines, as though ſalvation and
peace in mind, were a thing not worth
the labouring for: ſome ambitiouſlie
hunting after honour, and not eaſilie
digeſting reproach, behaue themſelues
neither ſluggiſhly nor ſleepily, but are
actiue in every attempt, by loue and by
counſell; by prudence & proweſſe, by
wit and by practiſe, by labour and learning,
by caring & diligence to become
famous, and to ſhun a civill reproch: yet
to be glorious in the ſight of God and
his Angels, to fall before the heavens,
and in the preſence of the Almightie,

to be covered with ſhame and confuſion
of conſcience, wee make none account,
as they, who neuer vſe means to
obtaine the one, nor avoid the occaſions
which may bring the other: others
vnwilling to come within the daunger
of the Lawe, that they may eſcape impriſonment
of the body, or confiſcation
of goods, will be painfull in penall
ſtatutes, ſkilfull in every branch of the
civill lawes; and eſpecially, will labour
to keep themſelues from treaſons, murther,
fellonies, and ſuch like offences of
life and death; yet when the Lord God,
threatneth the loſſe both of ſoule & bodie,
the attaching of our ſouls▪ the confiſcating
of our conſciences; the baniſhing
vs from heauen; the hanging of vs
in hell; the ſuſpending of our ſalvation;
the adjudging of vs to condemnation,
for the breach of his commandements:
no man ſearcheth his eternall Lawe,
no man careth for the Goſpell, neither
the ſentence of an everlaſting devorcement
from the Lord: neither the covenant

of reconciliation is eſteemed of
vs. And to reache out our complainte
one degree farther: beholde, the more
wee ſeeke outward pleaſures, and to auoide
the inward trouble of mind, the
more we haſt and runne into it: and we
ſpeed to plunge our ſelues in a wounded
ſpirit, before we be aware: who poſteth
more to become riche, who hopeth
leſſe to become poore, than the
Marchant man? who adventureth greater
treaſures, who hazardeth his goods,
who putteth in jeopardie his life, and
yet ſuddenly hee ruſheth vpon the rock
of hardnes of heart, or elſe is ſwallowed
vp of the gulfe of a diſpairing mind,
from which happilie, he cannot be redeemed
with a ſhip-full of golde? Wofull
proofe hath confirmed, howe ſome
men whollie ſet vpon pleaſure, ſuch as
could not away to bee ſadde, and hedged
vp alwaies of godly ſorrowe, haue
had their troubles made ſnares vnto
them, and even their exceſſe of pleaſure,
hath brought exceſſe of ſorrowe:

and whileſt they laboured to put the euil
day farre from them, they haue vſed
ſuch follies, as haue bene the bitter and
moſt ſpeedy hangmen of their ſorrowfull
Conſciences. There be ſome of an
other ſorte, who never dreaming of a
troubled mind, haue had their hearts ſet
on nothing, but howe they might get
ſome great fame & renown, and therefore
haue ſlipt into ſuch dangerous attempts
& foule flatteries, as they haue
not onely loſt the peace of their Conſciences,
but alſo fallen moſt deeply into
ſhame, which they ſought to ſhun.
Nowe, as the peace of Conſcience and
joy of mind, is ſuch a treaſure, as the eye
hath not ſeene, the eare hath not heard, nor
the tongue cannot expreſſe, but paſſeth all
vnderſtanding: ſo the wounded ſpirit is
ſuch, as the eye hath not ſeene, the eare
hath not heard, nor the tongue vttered
it, but paſſeth all vnderſtanding▪ and as
they onely knowe what the peace of
minde meaneth that feele it, ſo they alone
can in trueth ſpeake of a troubled

minde, that haue taſted of it by experience.
But let vs ſhew what way is to be
vſed, to keep vs from this wound of ſpirit;
it is the vſe of Phiſick, as to cure vs
from diſeaſes when wee are fallen into
them, ſo to preſerue vs from ſickneſſes,
before it hath taken holde of vs: ſo it is
the power of the word, as to aſwage the
trouble of Conſcience, when it doeth
once preſſe vs, ſo to prevent it before it
hath overtaken vs. It is a chiefe point of
worldly wiſedome, not to tary for the
vſe of phiſick, till we be deadly ſick; but
to be acquainted with Gods mercifull
preſervatiues to defend vs from it: likewiſe,
it is a chiefe pollicie of a godly
Chriſtian, not onely to ſeeke comfort
when the agonie is vpon him, but alſo
to vſe all good helpes, to meet with it
before it comes: and if wee condemne
them of follie, who will not as well labour
to keepe themſelues out of debt,
as to pay the debt when we owe it: ſo it
is a madnes, not to be as circumſpect,
to avoid al occaſions which may bring

trouble of minde vpon vs: as we would
be provident to enter every good way,
which may drawe vs out of this trouble
when wee haue once entered into it:
theſe remedies preſervatiue are firſt the
ſearching of our ſinnes, and then the
examining of our faith: the examining
of our ſinne, is either the due acknowledging
of our ſinnes, or the ſence and
feeling of them, the acknowledging of
ſin, is either of thoſe that be paſt, whether
we haue repented of them, or of
thoſe that are preſent, whether we are
truly greued for them: Thirdly, of thoſe
ſecreet corruptions to come, whether
we are reverently afraid of them: concerning
ſins paſt, we muſt call to mind
the ſinnes done of old in our youth, in
our middle age, and in our old age, that
we judging of our ſelues, may not be
judged of the Lord; that accuſing our
ſelues, Sathan haue no occaſion to accuſe
vs; and throwing downe our ſelues
before the Lord, he may lift vs vp: for
many going quietly away, and ſleeping

ſecurelie in their ſleeues, notwithſtanding
the ſinnes of their youth; and neglecting
to make conſcience of their ſins
done long agoe, ſodainly haue fallen
into ſuch horrour of mind, that the violent
remembrance of all their ſinnes
ſure charging, they haue beene overwhelmed:
this examination doth then
rightly proceed, when it is reached to
the errours of this life, and to the ſinnes
of our youth; becauſe many, even from
their childe-hood, by a civill righteous
life, hauing eſcaped groſſe ſins, wherewith
the world culd never charge them,
haue notwithſtanding caried the burthen
of more ſecreet ſins done in their
youth: David Pſalm. 25. 7. prayeth the
Lord, not to Remember the ſinnes of his
youth: Iob, the man of God confeſſeth,
that the Lord writing bitter thinges againſt
him, made him to poſſeſſe the
iniquities of his youth: what ſhall wee
think, that David, or Iob were giuen to
notorious wickedneſſe in their youth,
no: but they knew they were ſubject to

youthfull wantonnes, and vntamednes
of affections; which though it did not
burſt out, yet it made them leſſe careful
to glorifie God; with looſenes, the way
to lewdnes; with weaknes, the way to
ſtrange vanities; with wantonnes, the
way to open wickednes, is even in the
beſt of Gods Children in the daies of
their youth: which being afterward in
the time of their regeneration, brought
as it were to judgment, and laid before
their conſciences, doth cauſe them to
repent. But heere is a thing to be bluſhed
at, which maketh mens eares to tingle
when they heare it, that many men
no doubt, farre from this true Repentance,
can largely indeede diſcourſe of
the things done in their youth, but with
ſuch a braverie, with ſuch a boſting, &
pleaſing of themſelues therein, as beſides,
that they provoke others to ſinne
in the like, and ſet a flat back of braſſe againſt
Repentance, and this Chriſtian
examination; they ſeeme to renewe the
decaied colours of their old ſinne, with

the freſh ſent of their ſecond pleaſure
therein: But alaſſe, what pleaſure haue
they in thoſe things whereof they haue
no profit? What profite haue they of
thoſe things, whereof they ſhould be aſhamed?
neither in this ſtraint can wee
forget the madnes of them, who may
ſeeme to ſteppe one degree further towards
this examination of ſinne, than
did the former, by thinking that the leauing
of ſin, and the repenting of ſinne
is all one: againſt theſe, both daily experience,
and the word of God doeth
ſufficiently declare. Ioſephs bretheren,
(Iacobs ſons,) who deviſed evill againſt
their brother, put him into the pitte, and
ſolde him to ſtrangers, did ceaſe from this
crueltie; but yet are not read to haue
remembred their ſin with any remorſe;
vntill 13. yeares after this ſin was committed,
as we may ſee in the proceſſe of
the hiſtorie: David had left his ſinnes
of murther and adulterie, as thinking
all quitte, and well the ſpace of a whole
yeare: After which time, being admoniſhed

of the Prophet Nathan, hee repented
of it: and experience hath tryed
in many that haue had ſome-working
of God in them, that though they left
their ſinnes many yeares agoe, yet becauſe
they repented not truly for them,
they haue rebounded vpon them with
terrible ſightes, and fearefull viſions to
humble them, and to bring them to a
ſerious examination of them, beeing
done and lefte long ſince. Examples
whereof, we need not fetch from farre,
ſeing ſo many Preachers as ar acquainted
with fearefull ſpirites, will giue vs
witneſſe hereof: the fruite of which amazed
minds for ſinnes, alredy is ours,
to beware of ſinnes that are to come;
and that other mens harmes may teach
vs bleſſed wiſedome. Let vs labour not
onely to leaue ſinne, which one may do
for profite, for feare, for praiſe, or for
weariſomnes; but alſo to repent of it for
Conſcience ſake. This examination of
our ſinnes paſt, muſt be partly of thoſe
which we committed before, and partlie

of thoſe we haue done after our calling:
every man, eſpeciallie hauing his
reaſon reformed by the word of God,
will graunt an examination of the life,
before our true knowledge of God in
Chriſt, to be moſt needfull: but it may
be thought, we neede not to be ſo preciſe
in the ſearching of thoſe ſins which
were after our knowledge: but ſeing of
al other, thoſe ſinnes bite the ſoreſt, and
pearce deepeſt, for that they are aggrauated
with all the mercies of God going
before▪ and ſin is then moſt ſinfull,
when after we knowe the trueth; after
we haue bene delivered from ſinne; after
we haue beene enlightned with the
good grace of God, we haue fallen into
it. I think that examination moſt eſpecially
is to be had of theſe ſins: wherefore,
to iterate our former examples in
a new matter, as we may ſee the former
kinde of examining: firſt, from ſins before
our calling, in the ſonnes of Iacob:
ſo wee haue a patterne of the latter in
the practiſe of the Prophet David, who

at the hearing of his ſinne was ſo troubled
in his ſpirit, that he could not reſt:
in the Prophets ſpeach, telling him his
ſinne was forgiuen him, but ſtil was diſquieted
as one vtterly forſaken of God,
and as though he could finde no comfort
of Gods ſpirit in him: For, as it fareth
often in ſores, ſo alſo it commeth
to paſſe in ſinnes, we are loath to haue
our woundes often grated on, we cannot
ſo well away to haue our ſores rifeled,
ſeared, lanced, but fedde with healing
ſalues: ſo we are hardly brought to
haue our Conſciences ſeared, or our
ſinnes ranſacked, ſifted and ripped: but
coulde ſtill haue them plaſtered with
ſweet promiſes, and bathed in the mercies
of God: whereas it is farre ſafer, before
incarnatiue & healing medicines,
to vſe coraſiue and mundifying waters:
without which, though our ſores may
ſeeme to cloſe and skinne vp apace, yet
they proue worſe, and being rotten ſtill
at the core, they haue aboue a thinne
skinne, and vnderneath deade fleſh: In

like maner we would cloak, wee would
hide and couer our ſins as it were with
a curtaine: but it is more ſounde Chirurgery,
to prick and parch our conſcience
with the burning yron of the law,
and to cleanſe the wounde of the ſoule,
by ſharp threatning; leſt that a skinne
pulled over the conſcience for a while,
wee do lament the rotten corruption,
which remaineth vncured vnderneath:
and ſo wee be conſtrained to crye out,
that our ſinnes openeth. As it is a folly
then to diſſemble our ſores whilſt they
bee curable, and after to make them
knowne when they be vncurable. So it
is as great folly, to diſſemble our ſinnes
whileſt they may be remedied, and ſo
after be conſtrained with ſhame for to
blaze them abrode, when they are vnremediable.
But of this by the way, becauſe
we ſhall more largely touch it in
the part to come: It is ſufficient to commit
ſinne before knowledge, but after
knowledge to ſinne, breedeth either
hardneſſe of heart, or a troubled heart;

both which we ſhall avoide, if in trueth
we be carefull to watch our affections,
and beware after our deliverie, wee fall
not into ſin againe. Severall men, ſubject
to ſeverall ſinnes, haue their ſeverall
cloggs in their conſciences: ſome
are overcome with wrath, and yet after
the moodie ſitte, they can tell that the
wrath of a man doeth accompliſh the
righteouſnes of God: Some are ſubject
to luſt, and afterward they ſay, it profiteth
them nothing: ſome are giuen to
a continuall courſe of vanitie, whome
notwithſtanding canne ſay, that mans
life hath another end: Some ſleeping
deepe into worldlineſſe, and yet they
be often wakened with terrible checks
of Conſcience: well, bleſſed are they,
whoſe heartes are truely grieved with
ſinne: and let them beware that make
a daliance with ſinne: for either hardneſſe
of heart will overtake them, or a
troubled Conſcience will confounde
them: Wherefore, it oftentimes commeth
to paſſe, that many ſpending of

their bodies on luſt, do lament that euer
they ſo abuſed their ſtrength; many
given too much vnto the pleaſures
of this life, haue great griefe and ſorrowe
comming vpon them, to remember
howe they haue miſpent Gods graces,
lauiſhed his good giftes, and miſſpent
their tyme: or elſe, if they haue
not this griefe, they fall into voluptuouſneſſe,
and drawe ſuch a thick skinne
vppon their heartes, as will cauſe the
moſt ſtrongeſt denouncing of Gods
juſt judgements to redownd, be they
driven on never ſo harde: And ſure it is
the ſinne of this world, when men being
controwled in their owne heartes
and Conſciences; and that whileſt
they are a praying, do feele a ſecreete
charge laide againſt them, to make
them to beware of falſhoode in bying
and ſelling: for, either they haue theſe
checks leſſe and leſſe, and ſo they grow
too prophane; or elſe, afterwarde they
are woonderfullie wounded, that they
haue beene ſo worldlie, ſo greedilie

purſuing earthly things, and ſo coldly
purchaſing heavenly things: thus even
our privie thoghts not profited by, are
breeders of farther trouble. Nowe the
remedie againſt this trouble, is willingly
and wittingly not to cheeriſh ſinne,
to wiſh that the miniſter ſhould touch
our moſt privie and ſecreet ſinnes; to
be glad privatlie to be admoniſhed, to
profit by our enemies when they do reproch
vs; rather to deſire in ſuch a cauſe
to be humbled, than to ſuffer our ſelues
to be flattered: This trying of our ſelues
muſt yet ſtretche it ſelfe further, not only
to the committing of evill, but to the
omitting of good: as when after ſome
good working and feeling of the ſpirit,
we beginne to fight and conflict with
our own conſciences, ſaying: though I
muſt pray, I muſt haue time alſo to prouide
for my Family: If I go to heare the
word, ſurely I ſhall be in danger to loſe
this profite: If I thus attend vpon this
exerciſe of Religion, I ſhall be cut ſhort
of the vſe of my pleaſures. Wherefore,

it ſhall be good to ſearch our heartes,
both in the careles not vſing the means,
ſaying to our ſelues in this manner. I
haue heard a Sermon, but alas! without
any feeling or working of my afflictions:
I haue bene praying, but with no
power of the ſpirit: I haue receiued the
Sacraments, but without thoſe joyes
glorious and vnſpeakable which I was
wont to taſte of: I ſawe the Diſcipline
of the Church executed, but without
any feare of ſinne in my ſelfe, or compaſſion
of the members cenſured: And
heere I dare for my owne obſervation,
aſſuredly affirme, that outwarde ſinnes
haue not bene ſometimes ſo grievous
to Gods children; as that they haue
ſometimes vſed the meanes with little
reverence, and with leſſe fruite: and no
marvell, for we ſhal ſee, that many men
are ſometime not ſo much grieved for
their ſickneſſe it ſelfe, as for that they
haue, either willinglie neglected the
meanes, which might haue preſerued
their health; or they haue abuſed the

Phiſicke, which might haue reſtored
their health to them againe. In like maner
I ſay it fareth with them, who either
vnreverently haue refuſed the meanes
which ſhould keep their ſouls from forgetting:
or elſe vnthankfully haue abuſed
thoſe helpes, which might haue recovered
them againe. From hence it
commeth, that ſome men are as much
grieved, for not vſing their good giftes
to the benefite of Gods Church, as others
are troubled for peſtering of the
Churche with vnprofitable corruptions:
As wee ſhall ſee a rich man ſometimes
as much humbled for not giving
money to the poore, which hee might
haue done: As for heaping vp riches
falſely, which hee ought not to haue
done. And thus many hauing received
good giftes and graces from the Lord,
are received and ſanctified by affliction,
wherby they are taught to put their
giftes in vre, and to offer their ſervice
vnto Chriſt: and others are feared to
hide their gifts; who cannot be without

ſome decay of Gods glory, without any
offence to the weake, without the loſſe
of many ſaints, which otherwiſe might
be woone to the Goſpell; and without
the ſtrengthening the hand of the aduerſarie,
to ſlaunder our dumb and dark
profeſſion: all which things, will in the
end bring terrour of minde; becauſe, if
the Lord cannot worke vpon vs, by taking
away goods, freinds, credite, wife,
children, or ſuch like, to bring vs to repentance;
hee will ſurely whip our naked
conſciences, he will enter even into
our very entralls, & pearce our ſecreete
bowels: As we muſt examine our ſouls
thus for ſinnes paſt, and ſinnes preſent;
ſo muſt we looſe this practiſe in ſinnes
to come, and this is very needefull, for
were it that our life were ſuch, as neither
before nor after our callings, men
might juſtly accuſe it; yet the hidden
corruptions of nature, may threaten
ſom hainous downfall in time to come;
which hath made men of very good report
and converſation, to hang downe

their heades, and feare their ſecreet hypocriſie,
as that which may break faith,
to the ſhame of all the former in time
to come: But becauſe we forget to ſpeak
of them, that in the examining of their
liues paſt, were much grieved for the
want of ſinceritie, and privie vaine glory
in themſelues: Let vs before wee go
to the ſearching of our heart in ſinne,
to come to ſpeak ſomwhat of this, men
traveling for this privie pride are either
touched or not touched. If the vale of
ſinne was ſo great in them, that it hidde
Chriſt from them; it is the good will of
God, that by this ſight of the moſt ſecreet
ſinnes, they ſhould come to ſee
that righteouſnes that is in Chriſt Ieſus,
and ſo they ſhall the better be kept
from being juſticiary Phariſies; for being
a long time well brought vp, and
leading a ciuill life, the devill woulde
perſwade vs of ſome inherent righteouſnes
in vs: It is the wiſedome of our
God to touch vs with the conſcience of
moſt hidden corruptions, as alſo to terriſie

and make knowne vnto vs, that euen
from our birth, there was ever ſecreet
ſeed of ſinne in vs, which without
the Lord watching over vs, wold ſurely
haue broken forth to his diſhonour:
As for them that haue had ſome working
in them, and yet are often plagued
with ſore diſeaſes: this trouble commeth
to them for two ſpecial cauſes, either
for ſome hypocriſie, that they did
more in ſhewe than in trueth: wherefore,
the Lord bringeth them backe againe,
to ſee their corrupt proceeding;
and that they may knowe all their Religion
to be but hypocriſie, all their righteouſnes
to be vnrighteouſnes: or for
the abuſing of their knowledge, in that
they made it but a mask to jugle in, and
that they made their affections to fight
with their dreamy judgment: wee muſt
remedie this, by not thinking of our
ſelues aboue that which is meet, and by
laboring to imbrace the truth in truth:
And heere lette vs note, that many of
Gods children accuſe themſelues of hypocriſie,

when indeede they offend not
in it; for the moſt righteous perſons are
their owne greateſt accuſers; and yet
that accuſation doth juſtly ariſe of ſome
fault of their partes: for though they
haue done things in truth; yet becauſe
with trueth, they laboured not to ſee
their ſecreet corruptions; in ſome other
matters, they ſuſtaine this trouble of
minde; ſo that there is nothing harder,
than to ſift and ſearch our hearts to the
bottome: whether we reſpect our ſinnes
paſt, or our ſinnes preſent; whether we
looke to our privie pride, hidden wants,
or ſecreet corruptions: and to returne
from whence we were digreſſed, to the
examining of our hearts in ſin to come;
Let vs obſerue, that in Gods Children,
there is ſuch a jealoſie, as they tremble
at the firſt motions, & quake at the leaſt
occaſion of ſin: although becauſe vice
will ſit in reſidence very neere vnto vertue;
there may be ſomtime in them too
much ſcrupulouſnes: this feare cauſeth
the deareſt Saintes of God to reaſon in

this ſort: O Lord, I ſee howe many excellent
in giftes and beginnings, whoſe
death were not like to their liues: This
is true, whether we look into the word,
or into the world: and it is a thing that
may much humble vs: For though we
may remember what wee haue beene,
and knowe what we are; yet who canne
tell what may come to him heereafter:
Oh that the ſerious meditation hereof,
woulde dwell longer vpon our Conſciences,
that with an holy jealouſie, wee
might prevent the ſin that is to come:
But alaſſe, there bee ſome venturous
Knights, which think it no maſterie to
offer themſelues to masking, minſtrilſie,
and dauncing: nor to runne into
quarrels, brawles, and contentions: as
though they had their eies, their eares,
their hands, and their feet in their own
power, at commandment to vſe as they
liſt: howbeit, Gods children better fenced
with grace, than thoſe bold buzards
ar afraid of theſe occaſions; as knowing
that their eies may ſoone be provoked

to luſt; their eares may quickly liſten to
vnchaſt delights; their hands may ſuddainly
ſtrike a deade blowe; their feete
may eaſilie be ſnared in carnall pleaſures:
Beware O man, be circumſpect
O woman; that thou proſecute not thy
ſelfe to ſo much libertie: for though in
comming to ſuch laſcivious or contentious
places, thou didſt purpoſe none
evill; yet for thy ventering without warrant,
thou maiſt bee over the ſhoes in
ſinne, and plunged in ſome wicked attempt,
over head and eares ere thou be
aware, & yet becauſe vice is ſo conſine
vnto vertue. Beware alſo of ſuppreſſion,
for ſtill the enemie laboureth, either to
make thee too hardy in ſinne; or elſe he
will cauſe thee to be too fearefull, and
ſuperſtitious; either he will puffe thee
vppe with preſumption, or aſſault thee
with deſperation: to theſe temptations
our nature is very plyable. Firſt, to preſumption,
as may appeare by our common
ſpeaches: Tuſh, the Preacher is
but a man as I am; I am ſure he hath infirmities

as others haue: we are no Angels,
our nature is corrupt, wee are but
men: I am ſure hee would not haue vs
Gods: Thus the Devill commeth to
tempt them; but hee apparelleth himſelfe
in an other ſuite, when hee commeth
to accuſe; and then of a flie, hee
maketh an Elephant; of a prick of a pin,
a globe of the whole earth; of a mouldhill,
a mountaine: and preſſeth ſillie
ſouls with feares and terrors, that they
knowe not how to wind themſelues: If
he can bring them to make no conſcience,
where they ſhould make conſcience:
hee will labour to bring them to
make conſcience, where they ſhoulde
make no conſcience: hee careth not
whether ye will be remiſſe or ſuperſtitious,
ſo ye will be one of them: If hee
cannot get you to followe the Epicure
ſinne of the world, as Libertines in dyet
and apparell, he wil make you ſo preciſe,
as to thinke it an hainous ſinne to
eate one bitte of meat, or to weare one
ragge of cloth more than for neceſſity.

Howe needfull therefore, it is to ſayle
with an even courſe: we may conjecture
by other things, which will bewray the
corruption of our nature: In the time
of a plague, we ſhall ſee ſome ſo bolde,
that without any lawfull calling or godlie
warrant, they will ruſh into places
infected, and then falling ſick, their conſcience
pricks them for their tempting
of God, by an vnadviſed boldnes in the
houre of their death; others plunged as
deeply in a contrary extremity, are too
fearefull, when they do but heare of the
ſicknes, and for very feare haue beene
brought to deaths doore, by imagining
themſelues to haue bin infected, when
they haue bin moſt free, who often hauing
even dyed without any naturall
cauſe, that ever could be knowne, but
only through an immoderate feare, and
the judgment of God comming vpon
them for their infidelitie and vnbeliefe.
Thus it is with vs in our extremitie, in
that as wel the oppreſſing of our ſelues
with too much feare to be overcome,

as the carnall ſecuritie in not fearing to
be overcome, may bring ſinne vpon vs:
Gods children muſt labour for a meaſure,
and that muſt be ſought for in the
word, which wil teach them, howe they
ſhall neither decline on the right hand,
nor on the left; but wil guid them in the
narrowe way; ſhewing in every thing
what is the vertue, and what is the vice;
what is the meane, and what is the extreame:
among many examples let vs
conſider, zeale a moſt precious vertue
in chriſtianitie, ſo long as it is free from
the extreamities: otherwiſe, if wee be
cold in zeale, it is a ſin on the left hand;
if we be zealous without knowledge, it
is prepoſterous, and becommeth a ſin
on the right hand: but cannot we come
to ſom perfection? No, if ye vnderſtand
it for an abſolute vnſpottednes; albeit,
to that perfection, which the ſcriptures
take for ſoundnes, trueth and ſinceritie
of heart, which is voide of careleſſe remiſſion,
wee may come: neither doeth
the Lord deale with vs after our ſinnes,

nor rewarde vs after our iniquities; in
whoſe eies, the moſt glorious actions
of man, are but as waters flowing purely
from the conduit, but defiled by paſſing
through a filthie channel. Wherefore,
though we haue our imperfections,
let vs not ſeeke to be more righteous
than we can be, ſaying for every errour
of this life, Oh, I am none of Gods
ſonnes, I am none of his daughters: for
I cannot finde that perfection which is
to bee required: but let vs comfort our
ſelues in the trueth of our hearts, and
ſinglenes of our deſires to ſerue God,
becauſe he is God, and ſo we ſhal be accepted
of God. I ſpeak this to this end,
that poore ſouls might heare comfort,
and know, that if they abhorre ſinne as
ſinne, if they examine themſelues for
it, if they grone vnder it, if they miſlike
themſelues for it, if they feare to fall into
it, the Lord wil not purſue them with
the rigour of the Lawe, but will giue to
them the ſweetnes of his promiſes, they
are noe more vnder the curſe, but vnder

grace: but farther to inforce our exhortation,
to avoid too ſcrupulous, a feare
which hindereth the true examination
of our hearts: Let vs thinke, that it hapneth
in the ſpirituall conflict, as in ciuill
warres: We reade, that many Citties
lying in great ſecuritie, haue ſuddenly,
beene both aſſaulted and overthrowne:
and alſo how ſome Cuntries,
too much negligent in the warres, thorowe
an exceſſiue fearfulnes, haue encouraged
their enemies with more gredie
violence to praye vpon them: with
which kinde of ſtratagems, our adverſarie
the Devill beeing well acquainted
with, often practiſeth this pollicie, if he
ſeeth vs without all feare, too quietly
to reſt in our ſelues, he thinketh his aſſault
muſt needes be the ſtronger, becauſe
our aſſiſtance is the weaker: Againe,
if hee diſcrieth in vs a cowardlie
feare and fainting of heart, before wee
once begin to joyne battell with him,
he wil ſet vpon our moderate feare, and
as villanouſlie as ſuddenly, ſtabbe vs to

the heart, and make a preſent ſpoile of
vs: common practiſe doth further teach
vs, that when wee can heare the worde
without all trembling at Gods judgements;
when wee can pray without all
feare before the Majeſtie of God; when
wee can come to the Diſcipline of the
Church, without al reverence of the ordinance
of the Lord, al in vaine. Again,
let vs heare with too much trembling,
and we ſhall learne nothing; let vs pray
with too ſervile a feare, and our woorſhipping
of God, will bee without all
comfort, vncheerful. Thus if we neither
leſſen ſin, that is indeede; neither make
ſin of that which is not ſin in trueth; it is
good to proceed to this threefold examination,
& to lay the edge of this doctrine
more neere our afflictions, becauſe
many will be found in this ripenes
of knowledge, and barrannes of conſcience,
to ſpeak and diſpute of all theſe
things very skilfully, which flickring, in
the circumference of the braine, & not
ſetling at the heart, do ſeale vp a more

juſt ſentence of condemnation againſt
them: To help this evill with, we muſt
meditate deeply vpon the law and Goſpell,
togither, with the appertenances
of them both; that finding our ſelues
far from Gods bleſſing, and ſeeing our
ſelues neere to the curſes due vnto the
breakers of the lawe, we may raiſe vppe
ſome ſence of ſin in our ſelues: yet herein
we muſt not ſtay, but go forward: for
whereas many by the diligent viewe of
the law, haue come to the ſenſe of ſin in
themſelues, and ſaw their own condemnation:
yet becauſe they labored not to
ſee their guiltineſſe acquited, by the remiſſion
of ſinne in Chriſt; they plunged
in a bottomles ſea of ſorrowes: others
having paſſed thoſe degrees, & hitherto
made theſe ſteps to avoid the wound
of Conſcience, haue come ſhort of the
mark; who, beſides the ſenſe of ſinnes
pardoned by the deth of Chriſt, felt not
the vertue of his paſſion crucifying ſin
in them, but ſaw, that with remiſſion of
ſins was not joined mortification of ſin;

feared that there was no forgiuenes for
them, but ſtil languiſhing with ſorrow,
they thought their ſoules to ſtand charged
with their former guiltineſſe; yea,
and which more is, for that ſuch men
haue not truly bin inſtructed, nor ſurely
haue bene grounded in the doctrine
of Chriſt his death and reſurrection:
that is, for that they ſawe not aſwell
power flowing from his death to ſley
ſinne in them, as vertue to pardone ſin
in them; for that they felte not aſwell
ſtrength vnto ſanctification, ſtriving
from the riſing again of Chriſt, as they
were perſwaded of juſtification & righteouſnes
therein: They haue lyen ſtill
bleeding at the heart, in ſuch ſort, that
the wound of griefe could hardly or neuer
be ſtopped and ſtanched: wherfore,
let vs ſtrengthen our weake ſoules with
this ſevenfold coard of conſolation, againſt
theſe bitter aſſaults: let vs firſt labour
to know ſinne, then to ſorrow for
ſinne, after to feele our ſinnes in Chriſt
forgiven; farther to looke for power to

crucifie the ſame, then to lay holde on
Iuſtification, by his Reſurrection; and
laſtly, hope for ſtrength, to proceede
from thence to further vs in ſanctification,
and holines of life even vnto the
end. And thus much briefly for that ſecond
thing which we matched in companie
with the examination of ſinne, euen
vnto the triall of faith; both which
rightly vſed, ſhall in ſome meaſure fafegarde
vs from the trouble of afflicted
mindes. Now let vs haſten to the third
part of our diviſion, to ſhew how Gods
children being fallen into this wounde
of ſpirit may be helped out of it: which
God willing we alſo wil performe; after
we haue anſwered a neceſſary objection,
which in this former part might
ſeeme to encounter againſt vs: There is
no man but will graunt, that David, Iacob,
and others of the ſaints of God, had
a ſight of their ſinnes, a ſorrow for their
ſinnes, a taſt of their remiſſion of ſinne:
and yet how commeth it to paſſe, that
theſe men were ſo trobled in mind. To

this I anſwer, that their trouble ſo befel
them, either for failing in ſome of thoſe
former things, or elſe they were rather
afflicted for the triall of their faith, than
for the perſecuting of ſin in them; and
therfore be it alwaies provided, that we
think not every conflict of conſcience,
continually & chiefly to be for the purſuing
of our ſins, but ſometime & principally
for the ſcoring of ſin, as we may
ſee in Iob, wherevpon, let all men be admoniſhed,
when as they ſee good men
thus humbled in minde, to laye their
handes on their mouthes from ſaying:
Surely, theſe men are but Hypocrites,
doubtles theſe men be great ſinners, the
Lord hath found out their iniquitie, the
Lord hath diſcovered their hypocriſie;
for good reaſon there is, that ſuch ſilence
ſhould be vſed: for that the Lord
may aſwell make triall of their faith, as
take puniſhment on their ſinnes: for if
ſuch afflictions ſhould alwaies & chieflie
be ſent for ſinne, then it ſhould followe,
that all others, as they exceeded

them in ſinne, ſhould alſo exceed them
in that puniſhment of ſinne: but nowe
comming to the ſalving of this ſore, I
ſhal ſeeme very ſtrange in my cure, and
ſo much the more to be wondred at, by
howe much in manner of proceeding I
differ from the moſt ſort of men herein;
I am not ignorant, that many viſiting of
afflicted conſciences, cry ſtill, Oh! comfort
them, oh! ſpeake joyfull things vnto
them: yea there be ſome, and that of
the learned, who in ſuch caſes are full
of thoſe and ſuch like ſpeeches: Why
are you ſo heavy my brother, why are
you ſo caſt downe my ſiſter, be of good
cheere, take it not ſo grievouſlie, what
is there that you ſhould feare? God is
mercifull, Chriſt is a Saviour; theſe be
ſpeeches of loue indeed: but they often
do the poore ſouls as much good herein,
as if they ſhould powre colde water
in their boſomes, when as without farther
ſearching of their ſores, they may
aſwell miniſter a malady as a medicine:
For as all nutriture and carnall medecines

are not good for every ſicke perſon,
eſpeciallie, when the body needeth
a ſtrong purgation, then to miniſter
matter reſtoratiue: And as all incarnatiue
medicines may for a time ſtay the
paine of the patient, but afterwardes
the griefe becommeth more grievous:
So comfortable applying of Gods promiſes,
are not ſo profitable for every
one that is humbled; eſpecially, when
their ſoules are rather to be caſt farther
down, than as yet to be raiſed vp: ſo, the
ſugered conſolations, may for a while
over heale the Conſcience, and abate
ſome preſent griefe: but ſo as afterward
the ſmart may be the ſorer, & the griefe
may growe the greater. Heereof enſueth
this effect, that comfort ſeemeth to
cure for a while: but for the wante of
wiſedome, in the right diſcovering of
the cauſe, men miniſter one medicine
for another; and ſo for want of skill, the
latter fit grindeth them ſorer than the
former. Some there are, that without
all precepts and practiſe, will be their

owne Phiſitions; and theſe, ſo ſoone as
the fitte commeth vpon them, thinke it
beſt to chaſtiſe & chaſe away their ſorrowe,
by drinking at Tavernes, by minſtrilſie,
in merry companies, by purgeing
melancholies, in taking phiſick: all
which, may ſeeme to weare away the
paines for a while; but yet after it biteth
more deeplie; when the burning feaver
of their ſpirites ſhaketh them with the
ſecond recourſe: and for that they were
not before trulie ſearched, purged, ſeared
and launced; it comes to paſſe, that
the ſecond relapſe is the more dangerous.
To come to our purpoſe, we muſt
knowe that all griefes are either confuſed
or diſtinct, and ſure it is, that the
mind is appalled, either for ſome cauſe
knowne to vs as certaine, or for ſomething
vnknowne to vs, and vncertaine
to them which are troubled with ſuch
blinde griefes; whereof they can ſee no
reaſon. As oft it hapneth to Gods children
in ſecreet election, who either neuer
knowe God, or elſe had but a generall

knowledge of him. I anſwere, that
as I deny not phiſick to be miniſtred, if
in any parte it proceede of a naturall
cauſe, ſo I require the word eſpeciallie,
to ſhewe the principall and originall
cauſe to beginne in the ſoule: I do the
rather, becauſe I would haue wiſedome
both in the conſidering the ſtate of the
bodie if need ſo require, and in looking
chieflie to the ſoule, which fewe thinke
on: If a man troubled in Conſcience,
come to a Miniſter, it may be, he will
look all to the ſoule, and nothing to the
bodie: If he come to a Phiſition, he onlie
conſidereth of the bodie, and neglecteth
the ſoule: For my part, I woulde
neither haue the Phiſitions counſell ſeuered▪
nor the Miniſters labour neglected:
becauſe the ſoule and bodie dwelling
together, it is convenient, that as
the ſoule ſhould be cured by the word,
by praier, by faſting, by threatning, or
by comforting: ſo the body ſhould be
brought into ſome temperature by phiſick,
by purging, by dyet, by reſtoring,

by muſick, and ſuch other like meanes:
provided alwaies, that it be done ſo in
the feare of God, and wiſedome of his
ſpirite; as we think not by theſe ordinarie
meanes, to ſmother and ſmoke out
our troble, but as purpoſing to vſe them
as preparatiues; wherby both our ſouls
and bodies may be made more capable
of the ſpirituall meanes to follow after:
As wee require theſe thinges to be the
matters of our miniſterie in ſuch a perplexitie;
ſo we would wiſh the perſons
miniſtring, to be men learned, and of
ſound judgment; wiſe, and of godly experience;
meek, and of moſt loving ſpirits:
for when the troubled patient ſhall
be well perſwaded of our knowledge &
diſcretion; and therewithall ſhall perceiue
vs to come in loving and tender
affection: I think an entrance is made,
and all prejudice taken away, ſo as we
may more freely worke vpon that conſcience:
Firſt, bring them to the ſight of
ſinne, as to ſome cauſe of their trouble,
wherein we muſt labour to put away al

confuſion and blindnes of ſorrowe by
wiſedome; to bring the parties wounded
to ſome certaine object and matter
of their troble, and ſo draw out of them
the confeſſion of ſome ſpeciall ſecreet
and ſeverall ſinnes: I ſay ſecreete and
ſeverall ſinnes, becauſe I knowe, howe
that many through a palpable blindenes,
or diſordered diſcerning of ſinne,
talke nothing ſo much as of ſinne, and
yet either they cannot deſcrie ſeverall
ſinnes, or they will not be brought to
acknowledge their ſecreet ſins: whereof
the one proceedeth of the ignorance
of the Lawe of God, the other of ſelfeloue;
which maketh vs loth, even in our
trauell of minde to ſhame our ſelues:
Now, that confeſſion of particular ſins
is requiſite, it may appeare by the 32.
Pſalme, wherein being a Pſalme of inſtruction,
concerning the forgiuenes of
ſinnes: the Prophet by his owne experience
teacheth vs, that he could finde
no reliefe of his ſicknes, vntill hee had
remembred and made confeſſion of his

ſinnes: What ſhall we think of the Prophet
of God, which taught ſo wonderfully
by the word and by the ſpirit, and
did not ſee his ſins before: be it far from
vs, rather let vs, knowe, that he had not
ſeverally and particularlie ripped vppe
his ſinnes before the Lord, in a ſeverall
confeſſing of them, which though the
Lord knowes farre better than wee our
ſelues, yet ſuch kind of ſacrifice is more
acceptable to him. Nowe, in this trouble,
the perſons humbled cannot come
to this particular ſight of ſinne in themſelues:
It is good to vſe the helpe of others,
to whome they may offer their
hearts to bee gaged and ſearched; and
their liues to be examined more deeplie,
by hearing the ſeveral articles of the
Law, laid open before them: whereby,
they may ſquare the whole courſe of
their actions. For as we ſaid before, the
groſſeſt hypocrite will generally complaine
of ſinne; and yet deale with them
in particular pointes of the particular
precepts, and proue them in the applying

of things to bee done or vndone to
them, to their owne conſcience; and we
ſhall ſee many of theſe poore ſouls toſſed
to and fore; nowe fleeting in joyes,
nowe plunged in ſorrowes, not able to
diſtinguiſh one ſin from another. Now,
when we ſhall ſee the wound of the ſpirit,
to ariſe of any certaine and knowne
ſinne: it is either for ſome ſinne already
committed wherein wee lie, or elſe for
ſome ſin yet not committed, but whereunto
wee are tempted. For the former,
it pleaſed God often to bring old ſinnes
to minde, when we haue not throughly
repented of them before, ſo as it nowe
repreſenting them to vs a freſh, we may
fall into a more miſliking of them; and
yet herein is not al, to miſlike our ſelues
for ſome particulars, although it bee
good to be occupied about ſome ſpeciall
ſin: for, as it is not ſufficient for the
avoiding of hypocriſie, to ſee ſin generally:
ſo it is not ynough to eſchew the
damnablenes of the heart, ever to bee
purring in every particular, and to be

forgetfull of the great and generall ſins:
and lette vs learne by the particulars to
paſſe to the generalls. When any ſuch
one ſinne doth purſue the reſt, not onely
therein, but ſay thus rather vnto thy
ſelfe; O Lord, is this our ſinne ſo grieuous,
and doth my God puniſh this one
ſo ſorely? howe great ſhould be my puniſhment,
if thou ſhouldeſt (O Lord) ſo
deale with me for all my other ſinnes?
Let vs labour to haue a ſence, both of
particular and generall ſinnes, leſt in
time our grief paſſe away without any
fruit, whileſt, that not being diſpleaſed
with one ſinne, aſwell as with another,
we either look to ſuch ſpecially and generally.
Concerning thoſe ſins whereunto
we are tempted, as when a man is
noted to think blaſphemouſlie of God
the Father, or to doubt whether there
is a Chriſt or no, or to imagine groſlie
of the holy Ghoſt, or to deny God, or
to doubt of the Trinitie, or to be moved
to adulterie, or ſuch like. In all which
temptations, hee feeleth the ſpirit, oft

checking him for them; ſo as he knoweth
not in this caſe what to doe; that on
the one ſide he dares not liſten willinglie
to ſuch feareful & monſtrous temptations:
and on the other ſide, he feareth,
leſt then by long ſute, he might fal
into them: or at leaſt, for that hee ſeeth
not howe to be delivered from them. I
ſuppoſe, theſe motions are not ſo much
to be diſputed with, as we by them are
to bee provoked to a more inſtant and
extraordinary zeale of prayer: Surely,
theſe are dangerous temptations, and
therefore are not to be kept cloſe with
our nature, which eaſily will incline vnto,
but particularly are to be confeſſed
of vs: for the Deuill will come ſometimes
to thee, to keep thee ſtill in a general
acknowledging of ſinne, and vrge
thee on this manner: Surely, thou muſt
do this ſinne, thou ſeeſt thou canſt haue
no eaſe vntill thou haſt conſented, thou
art ordained to it, the reaſon why thou
art tempted, is becauſe thou doeſt not
thus take thy pleaſure, go to deny God,

beleeue not his word, it is but a pollicie
to keepe men in awe, Religion is no
ſuch matter as men make it: Thus, for
feare of yeelding of the one hand, and
for ſhame of diſcloſing temptations on
the other hand, many men haue pyned
away, and almoſt haue bene overcome
by them: If we ſhould diſcloſe this, ſaith
theſe men, what woulde people ſay of
vs? they would count vs Atheiſts, they
would think vs the wickedſt men in the
world: Well, for inſtructions and conſolations,
let vs learne herein, that theſe
kinde of temptations, are either corrections
for ſome ſinnes paſt, or puniſhment
for ſome ſinne preſent, or forwarner
of ſome ſinnes to come: Wee ſhall
ſee many tempted to adulterie, who no
doubt, can not be brought to commit
it: and becauſe they repented not of it,
it came to them againe, that in their
youth they haue committed it: the like
may be obſerved in theſe, gluttony, and
in other temptations, which are not ſo
much ſeen to vs preſently to overcome

vs; as to put vs in mind, that ſometimes
heretofore, we hauing bene overcome
with them, ſhuld now repent for them:
Sometimes a man ſhal ly in ſome ſins,
whereof, when hee will not be admoniſhed,
neither by the publick and privat
meanes, even then ſome other ſtrange
temptation ſhall fall vpon him, differing
from that wherein he preſently lyeth,
to admoniſh him of that other ſin.
As when a worldling ſhall be tempted
to adulterie, a thing which hee hath no
deſire to doe: yet it is to make him to
look to his worldlines; when he hath ſo
ſtrong and ſo through a liking, whereat,
if he wil not be awaked, he may ſuddainly
fal into that to; and ſo by the puniſhment
of God, in puniſhing one ſin
with another; both his ſinnes vnto his
ſhame ſhall be laid open, and one ſinne
ſhall make known another. Sometime
alſo it commeth to paſſe, that one ſhall
be tempted with ſuch a ſinne, as neither
heretofore nor preſently he hath given
any liking or intertainement vnto; and

yet the Lord by it may forewarne him,
howe he may fal into it hereafter; as alſo
to ſhewe, that he hath ſtoode all his
former life rather by the grace of God,
than by the ſtrength of fleſh and blood:
Wherefore, when thou art mooved to
doubt of God, of Chriſt, of the word, of
juſtification; do not ſo much ſtand wondring
at theſe ſtrange temptations, as
think with thy ſelfe, that it is the mercy
of God by them, to cauſe thee better to
diſcerne of thoſe temptations in others.
When thou ſhalt haue obſerved with
feare and trembling, howe they may
make their firſt entire into a mans hart,
howe they gather ſtrength, howe they
agree with our corrupt nature, in what
degrees they come vnto ſome growth,
how the ſpirit of God doth reſiſt them,
what be the meanes beſt to prevaile againſt
them: and thus if thou make thy
profit by them, thou ſhalt ſo wonderfully
ſearch and deſcrie by ſeverall veines,
the body, age, & ſtrength of theſe temptations
in others, by an holy experience

which God hath taught thee in others;
that beſides that, thou ſhalt lay foorth
mens ſecreete corruptions, as if thou
were in their boſomes, thou ſhalt be able
by the ſeede of ſorrowe in thy ſelfe,
to beget an vnſpeakable joy in others:
who in time may be tempted, as thou
nowe art. Thus moreover and beſides,
that ſuch is the efficacie of ſinne, that
they who nowe are no Papiſtes, Heretikes,
Adulterers or Theeues, may for
their ſecure contemning & fooliſh paſſing
over of theſe temptations ſent vnto
them ſodainly, ſhortly after fall into
them: becauſe they would not ſeeme to
make ſome vſe of them, nor confeſſe before
the Lord, both their pronenes and
worthineſſe to fall into them: But if we
will humble our ſelues in ſuch temptations,
and learne by them, meekly to diſcerne
the corruptions of our heart, we
ſhall not onely deliver our ſelues preſently
from peril; but be further inabled
to aſſiſt others hereafter in the like danger:
but ſome will oppoſe againſt theſe

things which wee haue delivered. Do
you think it is a remedie, to caſt downe
them that are already humbled, this is
rather to be a butcher than a builder of
a mans conſcience? to whome I anſwer,
that I deſire Preachers to be builders,
and not butchers: and it is a thing generally
to apply, and another thing particularlie
to lay the medicine vnto the
wound: It is good to begin the ſore by
the viniger of the Law, and after to ſupply
it with the oyle of the Goſpell; both
which muſt be done in wiſedome, vſing
them to ſome in greter, to ſome in leſſer
meaſure: For, as ſome hauing nothing
but a decay of nature, and no naturall
humour neede rather reſtoratiue
than purging medicines: ſo rather ſome
troubled for ſome ſpiritual wants, than
for groſſe ſinnes, need not ſo much the
ſharpe threatnings of the Lawe, as the
ſweete promiſes of the Goſpell: But if
the body through ſome extraordinarie
repletion, hath gotten ſome gret ſurfet,
not ſo much to the weakning of nature,

as to the thretning of imminent death:
and therfore, doth rather require ſome
ſtrong purgation, than comfortable
and cordiall medicines. Then the ſoule
brought to deaths doore with extraordinarie
ſinne, is rather to be boared and
pearced, with the denounce of God his
judgement than otherwiſe: but becauſe
we would deale more plainly, and leſſe
confuſedly, it is good in our acceſſe to
an afflicted conſcience, to lay theſe two
grounds: Firſt, wee muſt perſwade the
parties humbled, that their ſins are pardonable,
and their ſores curable: and after,
that this viſitation is not ſo much a
ſigne of Gods wrath and anger, as a ſeal
of Gods mercie and favoure: in that it
is not either blinde or barren, but plentifull
in good effects, and fruitful alſo in
godly Iſſue: This ſorrowe, how needefull
it is, the experience of ſo many (almoſt)
as haue bene throwne downe, is
a ſufficient witnes, who haue had this,
as a tagge tyed to their temptations,
that never any wer ſo plunged as they,

none ever had the like temptations:
the Lord will ſurely make an ende of
them in ſome ſtrange and vnknowne
temptation, wherein they are not vnlike
to men fallen into ſome dangerous
diſeaſe, who thinking to be without the
fadome of Phiſitions skill, and not to be
within the compaſſe of things recoverable,
do adde a ſecond and ſorer griefe
to their former: wherfore, as theſe men
ſeeme to be half healed; when any man
of knowledge can be brought, who by
experience hath cured the like malady
in like degrees in others, ſo then the
ſorrowfull ſoules are not a litle by hope
refreſhed and ſtrengthened, for to look
for ſome eaſe, when they canne ſee no
other temptations to haue overtaken
them: then ſuch as hauing fallen into
the nature of man, haue founde mercie
at the handes of God, that he might
be feared. This ground work framed, is
good to build vp and repaire the decayed
joy of the mind; partly by the Lawe,
to make a preparatiue for thoſe joyes:

If the minde not truly humbled, is not
fit truly to be comforted, & namely by
the Goſpell: if the Conſcience kindely
throwne downe, is become a fit ſubject
to apply the ſweete promiſes of God in
Ieſus Chriſt vnto it. And here again, to
anſwer you that deny the Law whollie
or not at all to be vſed, when we would
breed comfort in one. I demaund, whether
it being neceſſary to mantaine the
righteouſnes of Chriſt, it be not alſo as
neceſſarie to maintaine the righteouſneſſe
of the Lawe: ſeing the righteouſnes
of the Lawe of vs not fulfilled, will
driue vs to the righteouſnes of Chriſt,
to vs imputed; which is never throughlie
and truly eſteemed, vntill we ſee the
righteouſnes of the Lawe, of vs to be
vnperformed. Againe, if our Saviour
Chriſt did foreſhew his Diſciples, that
the firſt worke of the holy Ghoſt at his
comming, ſhould convince the worlde
of ſinne: to make men know, that without
Ieſus Chriſt, there is nothing but
ſin: and then that he ſhould rebuke the

world of righteouſnes, that they might
ſee, howe Chriſt died not for his owne
ſinne, but for the ſinne of others. I ſee
not why it ſhould not be very conveniient,
firſt to lay open the righteouſneſſe
of the Lawe, that men may ſee their ſin;
and then the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,
that men may ſee their ſin diſcharged
in him: beſides, where the Lord ſaith by
his Prophet: At what time ſoeuer a ſinner
doth repent him of his ſinne, from the bottome
of his heart, I vvill put all his ſinne
out of my remembrance. It may well bee
gathered, that there muſt a ſounde ſorrowe
for ſinne go before, and then the
true joy of ſin pardoned, may the more
frely, by vertue of this promiſe, be both
hoped for, and looked for afterwarde.
Moreover, ſeeing the whole promiſes
of God in the Goſpell, are commended
to vs vnder the title and tenour of reſtoring
ſight to the blind, hearing to the
deafe, ſtrength to the lame, helth to the
ſick, and life to the dead: It is manifeſt,
not onely that there is no diſeaſe of the

ſoule which Chriſt cannot heale; ſo alſo,
that wee muſt firſt finde our ſelues
blinde, deafe, dumb, lame, and dead; before
he wil medle with vs: becauſe they
that are whole, never need the Phiſition:
and he came to call ſinners, and not the
righteous to repētance. Now, to do this in
wiſedome, by neither preſſing the conſcience
too ſeverely; nor releaſing the
conſcience more vnadviſedlie: it ſhall
be the ſafe way, to vſe the well tempered
ſpeach of the Apoſtle to the Sorcerer,
Repent, that if it be poſsible, thy ſinnes
may be forgiuen thee: where he doth not
wholly diſcourage him, becauſe it may
be, his ſinne may be pardoned: neither
yet too boldly to incorage him, in that
without repentance, hee ſheweth it altogether
impoſsible to bee pardoned:
and that we be not too prepoſterous in
our conſolation, let vs bee warned by
that blaſphemous ſpeach of that deteſtable
Arian; who of late yeares was put
to death at Norwiche: this helliſh heretike,
a litle before hee ſhould be executed,

afforded a few whoriſh teares: asked
whether he might be ſaved in Chriſt or
no: when one told him, that if he repented
he ſhould ſurely not periſh: he breaketh
forth moſt monſtrouſlie vnto this
ſpeache: Nay, is your Chriſt ſo eaſilie intreated
as you ſay, then I defie him and care
not for him: Oh! howe good a thing
had it bene, not to haue caſt this precious
ſtone to this ſwine: Oh! howe ſafe
had it bene, to haue dealt more bitterly
and to haue dealt more vehemently vpon
the conſcience of this Caitife. Now
to attaine ſome diſcretion in curing of
this wounded ſpirit, we learne wiſely to
judge of the perſon afflicted, and of the
nature of his affliction: Firſt, wee may
note, whether it be a man or a woman:
becauſe wee may vrge more carefully,
the vſe of the law to a man as being the
ſtronger veſſell: and as Sathan knewe
her to be moſt eaſie, and framable to be
wrought vpon at his firſt temptation,
ſo hee is not ignorant, that ſhee is the
weaker partie to ſuſtaine accuſation;

then let vs conſidder, whether they that
are thus humbled haue knowledge or
no: becauſe, if they haue no knowledge,
then they think trouble of minde to be
ſo ſtrange a thing, as never any before
had it: If they haue knowledge, then Sathan
is redy to accuſe them of the ſinne
againſt the holy Ghoſt; as though every
ſinne done againſt knowledge were a
ſinne of preſumption: farther, we are to
inquire howe ſtrong or weak they are:
that if they be ſurely ſtricken, wee ceaſe
to humble them any farther: If they be
not ſufficiently wounded, then to touch
them with ſome deep ſenſe of ſinne: alſo,
we muſt be circumſpect to find out,
whether by nature they be more fearefull
& melancholike or no: as alſo, whether
they be vſuall ſinners, or haue fallen
ever of infirmitie; that ſo vpon their
diſpoſition and inclination, wee may
build our ſpeaches the better: To theſe
it is good to adde the conſideration of
the perſons age, eſtate, and abilitie: as
if the party be troubled for worldlines;

whether he be not a great houſholder:
If hee complaine of his eſtate; whether
he be a young man and vnmaried: If he
be humbled with covetouſnes; whether
he be not olde, becauſe divers cuntries,
callings, ages, conditions, and eſtates of
men, haue their divers & peculiar ſins;
which wee muſt rightly diſcerne: howbeit
of what ſects, ſorts, man or woman;

                  ••
                what complexion ſoever they are; of
what knowledge to diſcerne ſinne; of
what degree in committing ſin; of what
age, authoritie, wealth, eſtate, or condition
ſoever they are: It is good to mark,
that there be many, who are more tro
               
                  ••
               led
for the vexation and diſquietnes
of their minde being diſtempered, than
for the vilenes and horriblenes of their

                  ••
               nne committed: who are wounded
more with feare of ſhame, with feare of
being madde, or with the feare of running
out of their wittes, than with the
conſcience of ſinne: which thing, if wee
finde in them, it is our parte to travell
with them; that they may make a leſſe

matter of the outward ſhame, & more
conſcience of the inward ſinne; neither
muſt we herein forget to make a diſtinction
betwene our ſpeaches vſed to the
humbled, in the very time of their extreame
agonie, & burning ague of their
troubles; and thoſe ſpeaches which we
vſe then, the fit being paſt; becauſe the
former requireth more conſolation &
leſſe exhortation than the other; and
the latter wold haue vs more abundant▪
in admoniſhing, and more ſparing in
comforting, when wee may wiſely admoniſh
them to beware of ſinne, which
ſo procureth their own woe in this brething
time. It is alſo expedient to exhort
them, that for ſome ſeaſon, vntill
they ſhall finde greater power in regeneration,
they would tye themſelues to
ſome holy orders & godly vowes: that
thereby, they either may be furthered
in mortifying ſome ſpeciall ſin, which
for that they could finde no power againſt
it, did moſt greue them, or ſtrenthened
in ſome ſpeciall grace, the want

whereof, did alſo wounde them: but before
we launch deep into the ſea of particular
temptations; and begin to ſound
the dangerous paſſages of natural corruptions
and originall ſinne: the troubleſome
froth whereof, doth almoſt ouerwhelme
many poore Pilgrimes: It
ſhall be good to giue this caution, that
both in theſe, and in the former trobles,
men would be ſtil admoniſhed, patientlie
to bear with a wounded ſpirit, albeit
it falleth out ſo, that they be ſomewhat
pettiſh, ſeeing the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh
ſo favorably of them: ſaying, a wounded
ſpirit who can bear it. And ſurely, our practiſe
in other things, by the law of equitie
may vrge this at our handes: For if
men by the light of reaſon, can ſee it to
be a dutie convenient, not frivolouſlie
to travell; but meekly to ſuffer, & wiſely
to put vp vnadviſed ſpeaches of a man,
diſtempered in braine, by reſon of ſome
burning ague, or other vehement ſicknes.
We may eaſily gather even by this
rule of reaſon; not ſo ſeverely to ſenſure

the impatient ſpeaches of him, who by
reaſon of ſome parching feavour of the
ſpirit, is diſquiered in mind; and hath all
the veines of his hart (as it were) in a ſpirituall
agonie vexed: wherefore, both
vnſavorie of godly wiſedome, & vncharitable
for want of Chriſtian loue, are
their murmuring obtractations, which
ſay, What is the godly man? Is this hee
that is trobled for his ſins? why ſee how
pettiſh he is, nothing can pleaſe him, no
body can ſatisfie him. Conſider O man,
if thou canſt bear with a frail body, that
thou muſt much more bear with a fraill
mind: conſider, that this his pettiſhnes
doth more wound him to the hart, than
any injurie thou couldeſt pearce him
with: and therefore, ſeeing he afflicteth
his own ſoule for it, thou muſt not adde
any thing to his afflictions, and to exaſperate
his ſmart: conſidder, that it is a
bleſſed thing, mercifullie to bethink vs
of the ſtate of the needy: and that to rub
a freſh wound, and to ſtraine a bleeding
ſore, is nothing elſe, but that which Iobs
               
friendes did, to bring a newe torment
where there is no neede of it. If the wiſe
Father, rather doeth pittie than rebuke
his child, when by reaſon of ſicknes the
appetite is not eaſilie pleaſed: ſo if wee
purpoſe to do any good with an afflicted
mind, we muſt not be auſtere in reprehending
every infirmitie; but patient
in conſidering of it, as tender frailtie:
neither do I ſpeake this, to nouriſh
pettiſhnes in any, but wold haue them
to labour for patience, and to ſeeke for
peace: which though they finde not at
the firſt, yet by praier they muſt wait on
the Lord; and ſay, Lord, becauſe there is
mercie with thee, that thou maieſt bee
feared: I will wayte vpon thee, as the eye of
the ſervant waiteth vpon the eye of his maſter:
I will condemne my ſelfe of follie,
and ſay: O my ſoule, why art thou ſo heavy,
vvhy art thou ſo caſt downe within me,
ſtill truſt in the Lord for he is thy
helpe and thy ſalvation.
            
            FINIS.
