            Pyers Plowmās exhortation to
the Parlyamenthouſe.
            
               IT behoueth vs erneſtly to pray
vnto God / that lykewyſe as he
hath geuē vnto the king of this
realme / a feruēt zele to ſet furth
his truth / & ſtrengthened him with a right
worthy protectour & mooſt prudēt counſellours
for ye ſetting furth of the ſame / euē
ſo that he will vouchſafe to ſēde our ſayde
kyng lyke zeale and ſtrength to make / ſet
furth / and cauſe to be kepte ſuch good polytike
lawes and ſtatutes as this Realme
may be therby replenyſhed wyth iuſtice requitie
and wealth, that in all regions wher
as it ſhalbe reported how that we of thys
realme haue expelled all vayne tradicions
of men / and receyued the true religion of
Chriſt / that there alſo it may be ſayd howe
that we haue therto receyued the fruteful
bleſſing of God, promyſed vnto the followers
of his woorde. But except many inconueniences
in this realme be redreſſed / 
it is rather to be feared leaſt that the Goſpell
be ſlaundred through vs. Neuertheles
euen as in the time of oure greateſt errour
& ignoraunce, the fatte prieſtes wo
                  〈…〉
               
neuer confeſſe that any thing concernin
                  •
               
               
our religion was amis, worthy to be reformed
/ euen ſo now at this daye there be
many fatte marchaūtes which wold haue
no reformation in the comon wealth affirming
that therin al thinges be wel / but
he that wyll be conuerſaunt with the comē
ſorte of the poore comens, ſhal (if he ſtop
not his eares, nor hyde not his eyes) both
heare ſe & ꝑceyue the caſe to be farre other
wiſe. He ſhal heare tel that afewe riche mē
haue ingroſſed vp ſo many fermes & ſhepe
paſtures / & haue decayed ſo many whole
townes / that thouſandes of the poore comens
can not get ſo muche as one ferme / 
nor ſcant any litell houſe to put their head
in. It is not agreable with the goſpel that
a fewe parſons ſhall lyue in ſo great aboū
               daunce
of wealth / ād ſuffer ſo many their
chriſtē brothers to lyue in extreme pouertie.
It is contrary to the humanitie vſed euen
amongeſt the heythen infidels, one mā
to holde ſo great a quantitie of grounde / 
that by meanes therof hys other neyghboures
ſhall not haue whervppon to get
their liuing. It is not vſed amongeſt the
worſt kinde of rauening beaſtes, that one
ſhall ſnatche from an other that thing whiche
he ſtandeth no nede of, and whiche he

neuer ſhal be able to ſpend. But what may
I lyken it vnto / when a fewe men for the onelye
greadines of gathering ſuperfluous
thinges / ſhall kepe in their hādes ſo muche
groūd / & ſo many whole townes & feldes / 
that therby al theyr owne natiue countrey
ſhal come vnto vtter ruine & decay? I wold
not that thoſe ydell mēbres of this realme,
which for ye mayntenaūce of their ydelnes
wold haue al thīges in cōmen / ſhuld think
that I do now harpe of that ſtring: farre
be ſuch madnes fro me / for that confuſion
wold vtterly extinguiſh all induſtry vnto
all maner of good artes ād qualities / and
reduce vs vnto a beſtly trade of life. But I
wolde rather wiſh that they wich now in
this realme be the auctours of that opinion
/ ſhuld be ſharpely puniſhed by the maieſtrates
/ as deteſtable enemies vnto the
comon wealth / for he which bringeth into
a Realme ſedicion or diſcorde / bryngeth in
the mooſt pernicious thinge that can be
poſſible. And what thing can ſoner moue
ſedicion, than to go about to take from all
good menne / all thoſe their poſſeſſions ād
goodes / which they and their auncetours
haue by their prowes / vertue and induſtry
obtayned and gotten / and to participate

the ſayd lādes and goodes / vnto the ſlouthfull,
vicious ād ydell parſons? But admit
that (which is impoſſible / ) all men wolde
willinglye conſent vnto the taking awaye
of the proprietye of goodes / yet is ther no
lykelyhod yt thys realme coulde be ſo gouerned
& defended from enemies: for it any
realme could be ſo maynteined / it ſhuld
haue bene in experience before thys tyme
in ſome coūtries. But Ariſtotle in his politica,
writing of all the ſūdry kindes of gouernmentes
of commēwealthes in ye vniuerſall
worlde, could not finde ſo much as
one lytell Citie gouerned in ſuch ſorte: it is
much more impoſſible yt ſuch a realme as
this / being ſo populous, & much of the people
being ſo naturally geuē to ſlouth / vyce
& ydelnes / ſhulde be well ordered by ſuche
meanes. Bnt theſe menne wolde fayne
perſwade their opiniō by ſcripture / ſaying
that two or thre places in the ſcripture make
euidētly for their purpoſe / yet wil they
not cōfer therwt all yoſe other places wc be
innumerable / yt make directly to the contrary.
Wold you not thinke hī to be a mad
taylour which wold go about to ꝑſwade
you to take a coate of his makyng / becauſe
one ſleue of the coate is fyt inough for you / 

all the reſide we of the coate / being ſo ſcāte
& vnfyt that it can by no meanes be put vppon
your backe. And are not they muche
madder / wt findīg one or two textes in the
ſcripture wc ſemē to take awaye propriety
of goodes / and do not regarde how their opiniō
agreeth wt the eight cōmaundemēt / 
which ſayth: thou ſhalt not ſteale / ād with
the tenth / which inhibiteth vs to couetour
neyghbours houſe / or our neighbours wife
/ his ſeruaunt / his mayd, his oxe / his aſſe
or any thing that is our neighbours. And
if their ſhulde be no proprietie / I pray you
to what purpoſe ſhall theſe wordes ſound
which ſhalbe ſpoken by Chriſt at the daye
of iugemēt. Whan I was hungry ye gaue
me meate / and whan I was athruſt ye gaue
me drinke &c. Or wherfore doth Chriſt
in ye. vi. chap. of mat. wil vs / whē we giue
our almes to giue it ſecretly? If I ſhuld here
rekē vp al ye places in ſcripture wc make
directly agaīſt this fōd opiniō / I might be
accōpted more thē halfe mad to beſtowe ſo
much time in a matter ſo manifeſt: therfore
wiſſhīg yt ye manteynours of this franricke
opiniō may be well kept ī a cloſe houſe
vntill their wittes be better comē vnto
thē I wil returne to my purpoſe & declar / 

vnto you one other inconuenience / whych
onely if it be not remedied / is able to bring
this whole Realme vnto vtter ruine: for
by the meanes of it / the mooſt parte of all
thoſe poore comōs of thys realme / whych
haue no landes of theyr owne / are lyke by
all lykelyhod of reaſon, wythin proces of
fewe yeres to be brought vnto extreme pouertie.
And for the profe herof, let the naked
trueth ſet furth it ſelfe. Whan all the
great numbre of Abbays did ſtand here in
Ingland, a great parte of the men of thys
Realme / were Monkes / Chanons / Fryers,
Chauntryprieſtes / Pardonners / Heremites
& ſuch as had Idle liuīgs / by thoſe
monkes / chanōs / fryers & chaūtriprieſts.
And to thintent yt my meaning herin may
be ye better perceyued: admit yt theſe Idle
parſōs wc the tyme which the reſidue of yo
inhabitaūtes of this realme did beſtow in
going of pilgrimages / in caruing painting
& gylding of Images, in makīg of torches
ād waxcādels / in keping of ſo many ſuperſticious
holy days: admit all theſe to counteruayle
as thogh the thyrd part of ye men
of this realme had then cōtinuallye lyued
in Idelnes as touching any neceſſary buſines,
ād that the other two partes had then

done all the neceſſary worke wc was to be
done in ye whole realme / that is to ſay / manured
ye ground to bryng furth corne / and
victuall / and done all the labour for the taking
of fyſh / for the makīg of cloth making
of garments ād all other thīges neceſſary / 
both for thē ſelues & for all thoſe other Idell
parſōs ād for the whole realme. And
it is not to be ſuppoſed the cōtrary / but yt
there ſhalbe as many people in the realme,
whē all thoſe parſōs wc were mōkes / chanons
/ fryers & chaūtriprieſts ſhalbe dead / 
as there were at ſuch time whē all ye ſayd
Abbeys dyd ſtand: but the. ij. partes of ye
mē of this realm keping no ſuperſticious
holydays / & ſpending no tyme in pilgrimages
nor ſuch vanities / wilbe ſtill able to do
all the neceſſary worke in the realme / then
the other iij. part muſt lyue in Idelnes except
ſome other worke be deuiſed for them
But this gret nōbre of people ſhall thē nether
haue lādes nor pencions to maīteyne
them lyuīg in Idelnes. Therfore if more
woorke be not prouided for theym / what
can enſue but extreame pouertie / beggery
ād miſerie? For when the forſayd Abbays
did ſtand / that Huſbandman whych had
two or thre Sonnes, wold for the mooſte
parte / finde one of thē at Scoole for a yere

or two vntill he might read the maſſe boke / 
and then make him eyther a monke hanō
               trier
or chauntriprieſt, which many times
alſo ſhuld helpe his other brethern to ſome
parte or their liuinge, but nowe there is no
ſuch refuge: all muſt be put to labour. And
lyke as thre ſcore men can not be all ſufficientlye
armed for the warres with fourtye
harneyſſes / ne thre ſcore womē can not all
be ſpinning at home vppō fourty wheles,
no more can all thoſe parſons in this realme
which muſt nowe hereafter haue their
liuinges vppon labour be continuallye ſet
to work / except they may haue more groūd
totylle or more of ſom other thīg to worke
vppon. And beſides all thys they whiche
were profeſſed in theſe ſuperſticious / relygions
did abſtayne from matrimonye / ſo yt
now when mariage ſhall be fre for all men
ther is lyke to be a greater īcreaſe of chyldren
then was in thoſe dayes. But to this
ſome menne wyll ſaye / that although they
had no wyues of their owne / yet they lyued
not chaſte. I graunte that fewe of
them lyued chaſte. And yet I deny that
the Roylme was anye thynge ſo muche
replenyſhed wyth Chyldren by their vnchaſtnes,
as it wold haue bene if they ſhuld

haue had wifes of their owne / for it is to
be cōſidered yt the mooſt parte of them are
but comen aduouterers. And thoſe women
wc lygh wt more mē then one / do not
therfore bring furth the more childrē. All
theſe thinges cōſidered it is no ſmall numbre
of people that muſt now hereafter liue
by labour / ouer that there was whā thabbeys
did ſtande / ſo yt if ſome other prouiſion
be not made / it is like to come to paſſe,
yt ſhortly after the warres (for the warres
haue hitherto foūd a great ſorte occupied / 
and cleane ryd vs of a great nōbre of them
wc ſhulde els haue bene eyther beggers or
theues) but whē ye warres be done / & they
which be now chyldrē comen vnto mens
eſtate / by the reaſon before declared, there
ſhalbe ſo many wtout fermes ād diſirous
to haue fermes / that they them ſelues by
their high proffers ſhall cauſe them to be
yet agayne hygher inhaunced / ſo that he
onelye ſhalbe able to lyue vppon the ſayde
fermes / whyche hath no charge of chyldren
/ and he whyche ſhal haue any charge
of chyldren / ſhal not be able (bryngyng vp
his children) to lyue vppon any of them / 
but ſhall euery day be poorer and poorer
vntyll he and all hys chyldren / be at

playne beggery. And lykewyſe then the labouringe
man, beinge then ſo many of thē / 
they ſhalbe retayned for ſo litel wages (hauīg
now reſpect vnto the high price of victuall
and cloth / and to the high rēt of their
houſes) that he which ſhalbe in health & hauīg
no childer, ſhal barely get by his labour
to finde him ſelfe his neceſſary ſuſtenaunce,
ſo that he which ſhall haue any children / 
ſhall not by his labour be able to finde him
ſelfe and his chyldren. And thus ſhall the
mooſt parte of the Realme be in pouertie / 
one not able to helpe an other. Is it lyke
thē that thoſe fewe parſons which ſhal haue
the aboundaunce of riches / wil euery yere
cōtinually departe from ſo great ſōmes
of money as will ſerue for the releafe of ſo
great a nōber? no ſurely, for whē they haue
had a farre ſmaller nōbre / they ſuffred thē
to dye for hunger in the ſtretes. And for ye
mooſt parte, ye wicked & the couetous parſōs
ſhalbe ye greateſt poſſeſſours of goods,
whoſe propertye is alwayes to gather, and
neuer to diſtribute / redy in takīg / but ſlacke
in geuing. When ſo many ſhalbe thus fallen
into ſuch extreame pouerte / what may
then follow / it greueth me to declare. But
what nede I to declare it / whē euery man

may ſo eaſely perceyue it whych thīge if it
ſhulde come to paſſe (as God forbyd) then
wold our great enmy ye biſſhop of rome &
all his adherentes, inſulte and triumph ouer
vs / imputing our diſtruction / as a puniſhment
/ for the ſuppreſſīg of abbayes ād
chauntries. And ſo might it well be accōpted
/ if we ſhuld / whē they were ſuppreſſed / 
beīg ſatiſfied and ſtayed with their worldly
goodes, procede no further in redreſſing
other abuſes / nor in the prouiding of liuinges
for them wc were cōmonly wont to go
into abbeys / or other wiſe to haue their lyuinges
by thē and by ſuch other like kinde
of ydelnes. Adde vnto this alſo that there
is now at this day fewer ſeuerall fermes
for the huſbandeman to lyue vppon / and
leſſe worke for the labourīge mā / thā was
in thoſe dayes when the foreſade abbeyes
did ſtande. For a greate parte of the ſayde
abbeylandes be eyther geuen, ſolde or leaſed
vnto ſuche lordes and Gentelmen / as
had landes before of their owne. And for
as much as it is wel nygh impoſſyble for
them to ouerſee ſo manye ſeruauntes as
might kepe ſo great quantitie of grounde
in tyllage / and deſiringe to haue the whole

profight of their grounde them ſelues / 
they are driuē (by their infaciable couetouſnes)
to conuert al their groundes vnto the
paſturing of ſhepe & ſuch kynde of beaſtes
as they maye receyue the whole proffyght
with very litell charge of ſeruauntes / ſo yt
one man hauing in his occupying ſo much
ground as fiue hundreth parſons haue heretofore
with their labour gayned their lyuinge
vppon / ſhall kept perchaunce ten or
twelue ſhepehardes and fower or fyue netherdes.
So yt although there be all ready
and ſhalbe hereafter manye more parſons
which muſt get their liuīges vppon labour
then there was when thabbeys did ſtand:
yet yt not wt ſtanding / their is at this 
                  pſent
                  present
               
much leſſe grounde put in tillage / thē was
whē they ſtode. And by this meanes ſhall
this realme come much the ſoner vnto decaye
/ if remedye be not had. For as the
number of menne encreaſe, which muſte
lyue by Laboure / ſo onght it to be forſene
that they may haue whervppō to labour.
For that ſhepemaſter which ſuffereth one
flocke of hys ſhepe to encreaſe muche in
numbre / and doth not regarde to prouide
ſuffyciente of Paſtoure for them accoraccording

to the nōbre of his encreaſe / he
ſhall not onely haue no profight by thyncreaſinge
of his ſhepe / but ſhal alſo put al
the reſide we of yt flocke in daunger of the
hūgerrotte. This flocke of labourers, are
like dayly to encreaſe / but the paſtour they
ſhulde liue vppon / which is worke / doth
dayly deminiſh. And is lyke hereafter vppon
other occaſiō wc I haue not here reherſed
/ euer more & more to be deminiſhed.
Hitherto I haue declared certeyne cauſes
why it is requiſite yt more work ſhuld be
deuiſed: deſiringe you my lordes with the
knightes & burgoiſſes of ye parlyamēthouſe
yt ye will accepte this my rude boldnes
in good parte, & not to impute it to arrogancy
for that I enterpriſe amōgeſt men
of ſo high wiſdome / to reaſon in matters
of ſo great importaunce. For lyke as the
mooſt expert mariners / in a great tempeſtuous
wether / wil not diſdayne ſomtime
to be admoniſſhed by an inferioure Parſon
/ by cauſe that ſome thinges may then
come to ther emembraunce of ſome one
mā, wc at that time an other thynketh not
vppon / euen ſo the mooſt wyſe Councellours
& Maieſtrates / in the commē affayres
of ye Realme, wyl ſomtime voucheſafe

to heare the deuiſe of a ſimple Subiect.
            Therfore / after pardon obteyned for my
bold enterpryſe and for my rude language.
I intende (vnder the correction of other
better experienced) to ſhewe my ſimple opinion
by what meanes all the for ſayd nō
               bre
of people maye haue plentie of woorke
And then what proffit maye therby enſue
vnto the Royalme / and vnto the Kynges
Maieſtie. For theſe inconueniences
and this imminent miſcheafe maye bee ſo
met wyth / and in ſuche ſorte remedyed &
redreſſed / that beſydes the proffit / whych
is taken by the Landes and goodes of the
the ſayde Abbayes Priories / Chauntries
and Pilgrimages, the ſuppreſſing of them
and of ſuche lyke Idelnes and Idell workes,
maye be turned moreouer vnto an other
the greateſt Commoditie yt euer came
vnto this Royalme. That is onelye / if
all that multitude of People / which was
wonte to lyue ſo in Idelnes, maye alwayes
haue woorke. And by two ſundrye
meannes maye it be broughte to paſſe that
there may be more plentie of work throghout
this realme: one is, by the conuertīg
into paſtour or Arable waiſte and deſolate
groundes, nowe beinge ouerflowen wyth

water or ouergrowen wyth Brome / Ferrne
whinnes or Fyrres / & by the reſtrayninge
of the forſayde Shepemaſters and
ingroſſers of Fermes, that they doo not
hereafter conuert ſo muche grounde vnto
Shepepaſtours / & thē to ſuffer all maner
of corne to be yerelye tranſported ouer the
ſeas as well as anye other kynde of marchaundiſe.
And for theſe purpoſes I haue
drawen furth certeyne rude Bylles to be
exhibited to you of ye Parliamēthouſe / truſtinge
that by your wyſdomes / learninge
& knowledge / ſayd of the ſame rude bylles
may be reduced into the due forme of good
ſtatutes. An other waye to cauſe the forſaid
great numbre of people to haue more
woorke, is by the cauſing of all ſuch maner
of thynges being comonlye worne / occupyed
& ſpent within this realme / nowe
vſed to be brought from the parties of beyonde
the ſeas / & being poſſible to be made
wrought or had wythin thys realme. As
linē cloth / flax / ād all thyng made of flaxe
or hempe: all things ready made of Ironſope
/ rapeoyle / ſaye / ſtamin / worſteds / caps hattes
& all ſuch other thinges to be made
and wrought within thys royalme / which
thing may be brought to paſſe / by the ſettīg

of a great ſubſidy / as a ſubſidy of fower or
fiue ſhillīges of euery pounde valure / of all
ſuch kinde of wares coming into this realme
from the parties of beyonde the ſeas.
            This maye be beſt done when a ſubſidye
ſhulde be els graunted vnto the kinges maieſty
for the mayntenaunce of his warres,
wc thing ſhuld be alſo ſome parte of puniſhment
vnto our enemies, if we ſhall chaūce
to haue any beyond the ſeas, for aſmuch as
they ſhal therby haue the leſſe vent of their
wares / thorow which their reames ſhalbe
the more enfebled. And ſurelye this kynde
of ſubſidy for the mayntenaunce of the kinges
maieſtyes warres / ſhulde not onely be
more for the common wealth, but alſo much
eaſelyer borne then ſuche taxes & ſubſidies
as were heretofore wont to be leuyed / for
no man ſhall pay any thing in this kinde of
ſubſidy but they onely which of their owne
voluntary will, ſhall bye ſuch wares cō
               ming
frō beyōde ye ſeas: but if we ſhall not
haue occaſion to haue any ſubſidye graunted
for the mayntenaūce of warres / yet for
this forſayde conſideracion the Subſidye
may be inhaunced vpon all ſuch wares cō
               ming
inwarde. And the ſubſidye which is
is now payd vpō leade / tinne corne & cloth

going outwarde / maye be in conſyderacion
therof remitted / which ſhalbe alſo a greate
cauſe that the more leade linne / cloth and
corne ſhalbe wrought / made and laboured
for within this realme, but if it ſo be that
the kinges maieſty hauing no warres will
not ſet any higher ſubſidy vpō ſuch wares,
yet at the leaſt way for aſmuch as the price
of all maner of wares is highlye riſē ſyth
the time of the makinge of the laſte rate: it
is reaſon that the wares coming inwarde
be rated agayn at the value that they nowe
be ſolde for, or els the cuſtume which ſhall
be hereafter payde vppon lynen cloth and
ſuch kinde of wares comīg into this realme
ſhalbe ſo lytell in reſpect of ye price they
be here ſolde for, that men ſhall not haue ſo
good cauſe to be driuē vnto the making of
lynen cloth and ſuch other thinges within
this realme as they had when the ſayde rate
was firſte made. It is no maruayle
though this my ſaying concerning the ſetting
of a greater ſubſidy vppon wares inwarde
and alſo ſome of the forſayde bylles
ſhalbe vnto ſome men at the firſt very harde
to digeſt, but like as vnto thoſe mē euery
thing is pleaſaunt that ſauoureth of lucre,
ſo cā they not abyde the taſte of ought that

ſmelleth any thinge agaynſt their ſinguler
profight. And yet if they pondred the matter
throughly well / and wolde make a true
definicion of vtilyte / they ſhulde finde that
it were not agaīſt their profight. But they
be ſo farre blynded in couetouſnes yt they
can not or els will not forſee the true ende
of thinges. Therfore you of the parliamēt
houſe muſt do vnto them as the louing parentes
do vnto their chyldrē when they cō
               ſtrayne
thē to drinke wormeſedes or ſuch
other bitter medecines for the preſeruatiō
of their lyues / although the chylderen / for
the bitternes of the medycyne / be neuer ſo
lothe to receyue it. Nor I maruayle not
though ſome of you the lordes knightes &
burgoyſes of the parlyamenthouſe be not
at the firſt ſyght parſwaded vnto all theſe
my ſayinges. For I being altogether ignoraunt
of the arte of rethorycke / haue not
conningly let furth this matter but onely
layde before you the naked trueth in rude
wordes, which onely bare truth if you ſubſtancially
wyll ponder / I dout not but you
ſhall thē eaſely perceyue that by theſe meanes
the ſayde great number of people whiche
before were wont to liue in Idelnes / 
ſhall not onely gayne their owne liuynges

but alſo they ſhall both cauſe great ſūmes
of money to be yerely brought īto this realme
for ſuch corne as ſhal encreaſe by their
labour vppon tyllage. And furthermore
cauſe greate ſummes of money to be kept
within this realme / which was wont here
to fore to be exchaunged into other Royalmes
for ſuche lynen cloth and ſuche other
thinges. And for aſ much as I doubt leaſt
yt my meaning herein be not ſo eaſy of all
men to be perceyued: to make the matter
more playne / admit yt when the foreſayde
Abbays did ſtande, we ſent ouer ye ſeas yerely
into other Realmes in woll, leade tinne
corne cloth and all other kinde of marchaundiſe,
ye value of fower hūdreth thowſande
pounde, and yt we did then receyue agayne
into the realme from ye ſayde parties
of beyōd ye ſeas yerely ye value of other
fower hundreth thowſande pounde in other
kynde of Marchaundiſe / admit alſo
yt for aſ much as all thoſe people which before
were wont to liue Idelly in Abbays / 
Priories and chauntries / adding thervnto
the time which was accuſtumed heretofore
to be Idelly beſtowed in goīg of pylgrimages
/ in keping of newe founden holydayes
/ in caruing, paynting and gilding

ymages in makīg of copes / torches & waxs
candels / all this time before ſpent in idelnes
ād in vnproffitable labours, hereafter
imployed vppon the tillage o
                  •
                the waſte &
deſolate groundes, and in making & working
of ſuch thinges as we hertofore were
wont yerely to receyue from the parties of
beyond the ſeas / admit (I ſay) that by the
encreaſe of the corne coming of this tillage
we maye ſende ouer into the parties of beyonde
the ſeas yerely / the value of one hū
               dreth
thouſande pounde more in corne, thē
we heretofore were comēly wōt to do: & yt
by the meanes of the linē & ſuch other thī
               ges
being wrought within this realme, we
ſhall nede hereafter to receyue agayn in all
thoſe kynde of marchaūdiſes comīg frō beyōd
ye ſeas / the value of one hūdreth. M.
pounde leſſe then we hertofore were wont
yerely to receyue / then ſhall therebe caried
ouer ye ſeas yerely in all kinde of marchaū
               diſe
the value of fiue hundreth thouſande
pounde / and receyued agayne yerely in all
kinde of marchaundyſe but the value of
thre hundreth thouſande pounde / ſo yt the
other two hundreth thouſande pound muſte
yerely be brought into thys realme eyther
in golde or ſiluer. And for aſmuch as

they haue nowe much gaynes beyonde the
ſeas / and this realme not a litell therby in
domaged / in that they do counterfayte our
new coyned ſiluer beyond the ſeas & send
it hither. It therfore good prouiſion and
narrowe ſearch be made that none of the
ſayde counterfayted money be connuayed
hither / then ſhulde all the foreſayde ſūmes
of money which ſhall come yerelye frome
beyond the ſeas for the foreſayd ouerplus
in wares / be brought into this royalme in
ſuch gold & ſiluer as ye kīges maieſty may
take advauntage by the coynage. Thus
ye may perceyue that by theſe forſayd meanes
the realme maye be wonderfully enriched
/ the kinges maieſty haue great gaynes
in his mintes, and euery man that liſteth
to laboure / may gaine him ſelfe an honeſt
liuing. Yet I wolde not that any mā ſhuld
thinke it poſſible by any worldly policy to
defend thys realme from vtter diſtructiō / 
except we amend our ſinfull liuing. For
if God be determined to plage vs / for our
offences / what can worldly policy preuayle
to the contrary? And is their any hipocriſye
more like to ꝓuoke ye wrath of god:
or any blaſphemy more worthy of his indignacion
/ thē buſuly to pretend the moſt

holy Goſpell, and yet neuertheles to be ſo
voyde of all charite / yt it ſhalbe takē but for
a ſmall matter / and for a common practiſe
amongeſt vs / one mā to encroche ſo much
grounde in to his handes that he ſhal ther
by expell fower or fiue hundreth parſons
frome their liuinges? How doth this trade
of liuing agre with the Goſpell / ſeing yt
the chefe poynte of our religion / yea ād as
Chriſt him ſelfe ſaith / all our religion conſyſteth
in Louinge of GOD aboue all
thīges / and our neyghbour as our ſelues?
The more knowlege yt we haue of ye truth,
the greater is our offence / and the more aboundant
yt the goodnes of god hath bene
towardes vs / the more deteſtable is our in
gratitude towardes him. For theſe iniuries
that we do vnto the poore membres of
Chriſt / we do vnto hī ſayth he. Therfore
after ſuch euident knowledge of the ſcripturs:
& after ſo manifeſt admoniciō by ye
preachers: what can ſolowe but the iuſt
bengeance of God? if reformacion be not
had. If youre Childeren hadde ſo muche
vnderſtāding to foreſee the plage and vengeaūce
of God / ready to be powred doune
vppō the whole realme / for this cruell oppreſſiō
of the pore / which ſo frely is ſuffe-suffered

here to reygne amongeſt vs / wolde
they not altogether knele vpō their knees
with the teares runnīg downe by their chekes rufullye 
loking towards you of the
