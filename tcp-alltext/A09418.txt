            And it is to bee learned of ignorant people, that they may be fit to hear Sermons with profit, and to receiue the Lords Supper with comfort.

            To all ignorant people that desire to bee instructed.
            
               
                  POore people, your manner is to sooth vp your selues, as though ye wer in a most happy state: but of the matter come to a iust trial, it will fall out farr otherwise▪ For yee lead your liues in great ignorance, as may appeare by these your common opinions which follow.
            
            1 That faith is a mans good meaning & his good seruing of God.
            2 That God is serued by the rehearsing of the ten commaundements, the Lords praier, and the Creede.
            3 That yee haue beleeued in Christ euer since you could remember.
            4 That it is pitie that he should liue which dooth any whit doubt of his saluation.
            5 That none can tell whether hee shall bee saued or not certainly: but that all men must be of a good beliefe.
            6 That howsoeuer a man liue, yet if hee call vpon God on his death bedde, and say, Lord haue mercy on me, & so goe away like a Lambe, he is certainly saued.
            7 That, if ani
                  •
                be strangely visited, hee is either taken with a Planet, or bewitched.
            8 That a man may lawfully sweare when hee speakes nothing but the truth: & sweares by nothing but that which is good, as by his faith or troth.
            
               9 That a Preacher is a good man no longer than he is in the pulpet. They thinke all like themselues.
            
            10 That a man may repent when hee will, because the Scripture saith, At what time soeuer a sinner doth repent him of his sinne, &c.
            
            11 That it is an easier thing to please God than to please our neighbour.
            12 That yee can keepe the Commandements, as well as God will giue you leaue.
            13 That it is the safest, to doo in Religion as most doo.
            14 That merry ballads & bookes, as Scoggin, Beuis of Southampton, &c. are good to driue away time, & to remoue hart quames.
            15 That yee can serue God with all your hearts: and that yee would be sorie else.
            16 That a man neede not heare so many Sermōs, except he could follow them better.
            17 That a man which cōmeth at no Sermons, may as wel beleeue, as he which heares all the sermons in the world.
            18 That yee know al the Preacher can tell you: For he can say nothing, but that euery man is a sinner, that we must loue our neighbours as our selues, that euery man must bee saued by Christ: and all this ye can tell as well as he.
            19 That it was a good world when the old Religion was, because all things were cheap.
            20 That drinking and bezeling in the alehouse or tauerne is good fellowship, & shews a good kinde nature.
            
               21 That a man may sweare by the Masse, because it is nothing now: and byr Ladie, because she is gone out of the country.
            22 That euery man must be for himselfe, and God for vs all.
            23 That a man may make of his owne whatsoeuer he can.
            24 That if a man remember to say his praiers in the morning (thogh he neuer vnderstād them) he hath blessed himselfe for all the day following.
            25 That a man prayeth when hee saith the ten Commaundements.
            26 That a man eats his maker in the Sacra.
            27 That if a man be no adulterer, no theef, nor murderer, and do no man harme, he is a right honest man.
            28 That a man need not haue any knowledg of religiō, because he is not book learnd.
            29 That one may haue a good meaning, when he saith and dooth that which is euill.
            
               These and such like sayings, what argue they but your grosse ignorance? Now, where ignorance raigneth, there raignes sinne: & where sinne raignes, there the deuil rules: and where he rules, men are in a damnable case.
            
            
               Ye will reply vnto me thus, that yee are not so bad as I would make you: if need be you can say the Creede, the Lords prayer, & the 10. cō
                  mandements: and therefore ye will be of Gods beleefe say all men what they will, and you defie the deuill from your hearts.
            
            
               
               I answere againe, that it is not sufficient to say all these without booke, vnlesse ye can vnderstand the meaning of the words, and bee able to make a right vse of the Cōmandements, of the Creede, of the Lords prayer, by applying them inwardly to your hearts and consciences, and outwardly to your liues & conuersations. This is the very point in which ye faile.
            
            
               And for an helpe in this your ignorance, to bring you to true knowledge, vnfained faith, and sound repentance: here I haue set downe the principall points of Christian Religion in sixe plaine & easie rules, euen such as the simplest may easily learne: and hereunto is adioyned an exposition of them word by word. If ye do want other good directions, then vse this my labour for your instruction:
               A direction for the ignorant. 
               In reading of it first learne the six principles, & when ye haue them without booke, & the meaning of them withall, then learne the exposition also: which being well conceaued, & in some measure felt in the heart, ye shall be able to profite by Sermons, whereas now ye cannot: and the ordinarie parts of the Catechisme, namely, the ten Commandements, the Creede, the Lords praier, and the institution of the two Sacraments, shall more easily be vnderstoode.
            
            
               Thine in Christ Iesus, William Perkins.

            Question. WHat doest thou beleeue concerning God.
            
            I. There is 1. Cor. 8.6.one Rom. 1.20. act. 14.17. God Heb. 11.3. gen. 1.1. creator and Math. 10.30. pro. 15.3.gouernour of all things, Matth. 3.12. 1. Iohn. 5.7. distinguished into the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost.
            Q. What doest thou beleeue concerning man: and concerning thine owne selfe.
            
            II. Rom. 3.10.All men are wholly corrupted withEph. 4.17, 18. gen. 6.5. sinne through Rom. 5.12. 
               Adams fal: & so are become Eph. 2.2. heb 2.14. 2. Cor. 4.4. slaues of Sathan, and Gal. 3.10. guilty of eternall damnation.
            
               Q. What meanes is there for thee to escape this damnable estate?
            
            III. Iesus Christ Iohn 1.14. heb 2.16. the eternall sonne of God, being made man, by his Esay 53 5. death vpon the Crosse, and by his Rom. 5.19. 2 cor. 5.21. righteousnes, hath perfectly Acts 4.1. alone by himselfe, accomplished all things that are needefull for the saluation 1. Iohn 2.2 of mankinde.
            Q. But how mayest thou be made partaker of Christ & his benefites.
            
            IIII. A man Esay 57.15▪ psa. 51.17 of a contrite and humble spirit Mar. 5.13 by faith alone, Iohn 1.12. & 6.35 apprehending and applying Christ with all his merits vnto himself, is iustified Rom. 4.3, 6, 7 act. 15.9 1. Cor. 1.30 before God and sanctified.
            Q. What are the ordinary meanes for the obtaining of faith.
            
            
               V. Faith Rom. 10.14. prouer. 28.19. hosea 4.6. commeth onelie by the preaching of the word, and increaseth daylie by it, as also Rom. 4.11. 1. cor. 10.1.by the administration of the Sacraments, andRom. 10.13. praier.
            Q. What is the estate of all men after death?

Pet. 2.7. ezech. 9.4.the godly Matt. 25.32. shal possesse the kingdome of Heauen: but vnbeleeuers and reprobates shal be Matt. 25.41. in hel tormented with the diuel and his Angels, for euer.
         
         
            
            
            The Exposition of the Principles.
            
               I.
               
                  Question.
               
               
                  WHat is God?
               
                  A. GOD is a
                     Ioh. 4.24. 
                  spirit, or a spirituall substāce, most wise, most holie, eternall, infinite.
               
                  Q How doo you perswade your self that there is such a God.
               
                  A. Besides the testimonie of the Scriptures, plaine reason will shew it.
               
                  Q. What is one reason?
               
                  A. When I consider 
                     Rom. 1.20. act. 14.17. the wonderfull frame of the world, me thinks the silly creatures yt be in it could neuer make it: neither could it make itselfe: and therefore besides al these, the maker

of it must néedes bée God. Euen as when a man comes into a strange Countrey, and sees faire and sumptuous buildings, and yet findes no liuing creatures there beside birds and Beasts, hee will not imagine that either Birds or Beasts reared by those buildings, but he presently conceiues that some men either were or haue been there.
               
                  Q. What other reason haue you?
               
                  A. 
                  
                     Rom. 2 15. gen. 38.10. & 13, 14. A man that commits any sinne, as murder, fornication, adultery, blasphemie, &c. albeit he dooth so conceale the matter, that no man liuing know of it, yet oftentimes he hath a griping in his conscience, and feeles the verie flashings of hel fire: which is a strong reason, to shew that there is a God, before whose iudgement seate he must answere for his fact.
               
                  Q. How many Gods are there?
               
                  A. No 1. Cor. 8.6. more but one.
               
                  Q How doo you conceiue this one God in your minde?
               
                  A. Not 
                     Deut. 4.16. amos 4.13.by framing any image of him in my minde (as ignorant folkes

doo, that thinke him to be an olde man sitting in heauen) but I conceaue him by his properties and works.
               
                  Q. What be his chiefe properties?
               
                  A. First, he is 
                     Iob. 12.13. 
                  most wise, vnderstanding all things aright, and knowing the reason of them. 
                     Esay. 6.3. exod. 20.5.6.Secondly hee is most holy, which appeareth in that hee is most iust and mercifull vnto his creatures. Thirdly, hee is eternall, 
                  
                     Isay. 41.4. without either beginning or ende of dayes. Lastly, hee is infinite, 
                  
                     Psal. 139. all
                   both because hee is present in all places, and because hee is of power sufficient to doo whatsoeuer hee 
                     Iob. 9.4. deut 10.17.will.
               
                  Q. What be the workes of God?
               
                  A. 
                  
                     Iere. 10.12. psal. 33.6.The creation of the world, and of euery thing therein, and the preseruation of them beeing created by his speciall prouidence.
               
               
                  Q. How knowe you that God gouerneth euery particular thing in the world by his speciall prouidence.
               
               
                  A. To omit the 
                     Matt. 10 30. prou. 16.33. Scriptures, I see it by experience: 
                     Leuit. 26.26 matt. 4.4. Meate, Drinke, and cloathing being void of life, could

not preserue the life of man, vnlesse there were a speciall prouidence of God to giue vertue vnto them.
               
                  Q. How is this one God distinguished?
               
                  A. 
                  1 Iohn 5.7. matth. 3.12.Into the Father which begetteth the Sonne: into the Sonne who is begotten of the Father: into the holie Ghost, 
                  
                     Ioh. 15.26. who proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne.
            
            
               II.
               
                  Q. Let vs now come to our selues, and first tel me what is the natural estate of man?
               
                  A. Euerie man is by nature, 
                     Ephes. 2.1. 1. tim. 5.5.dead in sinne as a loathsome carrion, or as a dead corps lieth rotting and stincking in the graue.
               
                  Q. What is Sinne?
               
                  A. Any 1. Ioh. 3.4. rom. 
                     
                        •
                     .7. gal. 3.10. breach of the Lawe of GOD, if it bee no more but the least want of that which the Lawe requireth.
               
                  Q How many sortes of sinne are there?
               
                  A. Sinne is either 
                     Coloss. 3.9. psal. 15.5. the corruption

of nature, or any euil actions that proceede of it as fruites thereof.
               
                  Q. In whome is this corruption of nature?
               
                  A. In all men, 
                     Rom. 3.10, none excepted.
               
                  Q. In what part of man is it?
               
                  A. In euerie 
                     Gen 6.5. 1. thess. 5.23. part both of bodie and soule, like as a Leprosie that runneth from the crowne of the head, to the sole of the foote.
               
                  Q. Shew mee how euerie parte of man is corrupted with sinne?
               
                  A. First, in the 1. Cor. 2.14. rom. 8.5. mind there is nothing but ignorance and blindnesse concerning heauenlie matters. Secondly, 
                     Tit. 1.15. ephe. 4.18. esay. 57.20. the cōscience is defiled, being alwaies either benummed with sin, or els turmoyled with inward accusations and terrours. Thirdly, 
                     Phi. 2.13. iob. 15.16. the wil of man only willeth and lusteth after euill. Fourthly, the 
                     Gal. 5.24. affections of the heart, as loue, ioy, hope, desire, &c. are moued & stirred to that which is euil to embrace it, and they are neuer stirred vnto that which is good, vnlesse it be to eschewe it. Lastly, the 
                     Rom. 6.19. members of the bodie are the instruments

and tooles of the minde for the execution of sinne.
               
                  Q. What be those euil actions that are the fruites of this corruption?
               
                  A. Euill 
                     Gen. 6.5.thoughts in the mind
                     •
                   which come either by a mans own conceiuing, or by the 
                     Ioh. 13.2. act. 5.3. 1. chro. 21.1. suggestion of the Diuell: euill motions and lusts sturring in the heart, and from thes
                     •
                   arise euill words and deedes, when any occasion is giuen.
               
                  Q. How commeth it to passe that al
                     •
                   men are thus defiled with sinne?
               
                  A By 
                     Rom· 5.12.18, 19. gen. 3. 
                  Adams infidelitie and disobedience, in eating the forbidden fruite
                     •

                     •
                   treason doo not only hurt themselues but also staine their bloud, & disgrac
                     •
                   their posteritie.
               
                  Q. What hurt comes to man by his sinne?
               
                  A. 
                  
                     Gal. 3.10. He is continually subiect to th
                     •
                   curse of God in his life time, in th
                     •
                   end of his life, and after this life.

                     Heb. 2.14. ephe. 2.2. 2. cor. 4.4. luk. 11, 21. 
                  bondage is when a man is the slaue of the Diuell, and hath him to raigne in his heart as his God.
               
               
                  Q. How may a man knowe whether sathan be his God or not?

                  Q. What is the cursse due to man in the end of his life?
               
                  A. 
                  
                     Rom. 5.12. Death, which is the seperation of bodie and soule.

               III.
               
                  Q. If damnation be the reward of sinne, then is a man of all creatures most miserable. A Dog or a Toade when they die, all their miserie is ended: but when a man dieth, there is the beginning of his woe.
               
                  A. It were so indeede, if there were no meanes of deliuerance. but God hath shewed his mercie in giuing a Sauiour to mankinde.

                  Q. What is Iesus Christ?
               
                  A. The 
                     Heb. 2.16. ioh. 1.14. eternall Sonne of God made man in all things, euen 
                     Heb. 5.7. mar. 13.18. in his infirmities like other men, saue onelie in sinne.

                  A. He 1. Tim. 2.5.6must be a man: because man hath sinned, and therefore a man must die for sinne to appease Gods wrath: hee must bee God to sustaine and vphold the manhood, to ouercome and vanquish death.
               
                  Q. What be the offices of Christ to make him an al-sufficient Sauiour.

                  A. A death vpon the Crosse, peculiar to him alone: for 
                     Esay 53.5. ioh. 12.9. reuel. 19.15. luk. 22.44. besides the seperation of body and soule, hee felt also the panges of hell, in that the whole wrath of God due to the sinne of man, was powred foorth vpon him.

                     Math. 7.7. esay. 65.24. according to his merciful promise, lets the poore sinner feele the assurance of his loue wherewith hee loueth him in Christ; which assurance is a liuely faith.
               
                  Q. Are there diuers degrees and measures of true faith?
               
                  A. 
                  
                     Rom. 1.17. luk. 17.5. Yea.

                  Q. How doo you know that such a man hath faith?
               
                  A. These 
                     Rom. 8.23.24 gal. 4.6. matt. 5.6 
                  desires and prayers are testimonie of the spirit, whose propertie it is to stirre vp a longing and a lusting after heauenly things, with sighes and groanes for Gods fauour

and mercie in Christ. Nowe 
                     Rom. 8.9. ephe. 3.17. where the spirit of Christ is, there is Christ dwelling: and where Christ dwelleth, there is true fayth how weake soeuer it be.
               
                  Q. What is the greatest measure of fayth?
               
                  A. When a man is fully perswaded of GODS loue in Christ towardes himselfe particularly,
                  
                     Rom. 8.38, 39 cant. 8.6, 7 and of the forgiuenes of his owne sinnes.
               
                  Q. When shall a Christian heart come to this full assurance?
               
                  A. Not 2. Tim. 4.7, 8 psal. 23.6. with 1, 2, 3, 4, at the first, but in some continuance of time, when hee hath been well practized in repentaunce, and hath had diuers experiences of Gods loue vnto him in Christ: then after them will appeare in his heart the fulnes of perswasion: which is the ripenes 
                  
                     Ro. 4.20, 21. and strength of faith.
               
                  Q. What benefites doth a man receiue by his fayth in Christ?
               
                  A. Hereby 1. Cor. 1.39. act. 15 9 rom. 4.3. hee is iustified before God and sanctified.
               
                  Q. What is this to bee iustified before God?
               
                  
                  A. It 
                     Rom 8.33. compreheneth two things the first, to be cleared from the guiltinesse and punishment of sinne: the second, to bee accepted as perfectly righteous before God.
               
                  Q. How is a man cleared from the guiltines and punishment of his sinne.

                     Collos. 1.22. 1. pet. 2.25. 1. ioh. 1.17 sufferings and death vpon the Crosse.

                  2 Cor. 5.21.
                  A. By the righteousnes of Christ imputed to him.
               
                  Q. What profit comes by being thus iustified?
               
                  A. Hereby 
                     Rom. 4.17. apoc 21 27 and by no other means in the world, the beleeuer shall bee accepted before Gods iudgement seate, as worthie of eternall life by the merits of the same righteousnesse of Christ.
               
                  Q. Doo not good works then make vs worthie of eternall life?
               
                  A. No: for GOD who is perfect righteousnesse it selfe, will finde in the best workes wee doo, more matter of damnation than of saluation: & therefore 
                     Psal. 143.2 esay. 64.6 wee must rather condemne our

selues for our good works, than looke to be iustified before God thereby.
               
                  Q. How may a man know, that hee is iustified before God?
               
                  A. He neede not ascend into heauen to search the secret counsell of God: 
                     Rom. 8.1 1. iohn. 3.9. but rather descend into his own hart to search whether he be sanctified or not.
               
                  Q. What is it to be sanctified?
               
                  A. It comprehendeth two things: the first to be purged from the corruption of his owne nature: the second to be indued with inward righteousnes.
               
                  Q. Howe is the corruption of sinne purged?
               
                  A. By the 
                     Rom. 6.4. 1. pet. 4.1, 2 
                  merites and power of Christs death, which being by faith applyed, is as a corasiue to abate, cō
                  sume, & weaken the power of all sinne.
               
                  Q. Howe is a man indued with inherent righteousnes?
               
                  A. Through the 
                     Rom. 6.5, 6 phillip. 3.10. vertue of Christs resurrection, which being applied by fayth, is as a restoratiue to reuiue a man that is dead in sin to newnes of life.
               
                  
                  Q. In what part of man is sanctfication wrought?
               
                  A. In 1. Thess. 5.23 euery part of body & soule▪
               
               
                  Q. In what time is it wrought?
               
                  A. It is 
                     Rom. 8.23. 2. cor. 5.2, 2. begun in this life, in which the faythfull receiue onely the first fruits of the spirit, and it is not finished before the end of this life.
               
                  Q. What graces of the spirit do vsually shewe themselues in the heart of a man sanctified?
               
                  A. The hatred
                  
                     Psa. 119.113 & 40.9 &. 101 3. rom 7.22. of sinne, and the loue of righteousnes.
               
                  Q. What proceedes of them?
               
                  A. Repentance, which is 
                     Psal 119 57.112 a settled purpose in the heart, with a careful indeuour to leaue all his sinnes, and to liue a Christian life.
               
                  Q. What goeth with repentance?
               
                  A. A continual fighting and strugling against the assaults of a mans owne flesh, against the motions of the Diuell, and the enticements of the world,
               
                  Q. What followeth after a man hath gotten the victory in any temptation or affliction?
               
                  A. 
                  
                     Rom 5.3. 2. cor. 1.5. Experience of Gods loue in

                  Q. What signe is there of this sorowe?
               
                  A. The true signe 1 Pet. 2.19.of it is this, when a man can be grieued for the very disobedience to God in his euill worde or deede, though hee should neuer bee punished, and though there were neither heauen nor hell.
               
                  Q. What followes after this sorowe?
               
                  A. Repentance 2. Cor. 7.11. 
                  renewed a fresh.

                  A. The preaching 
                  
                     Prou. 28.19. rom. 10.14. mat. 28.19, 20. of Gods word
                     •
                   and the administration of the Sacraments, and prayer.
               
                  Q. Where is the word of God to be found?
               
                  A. The whole word of God needefull to saluation is set down in the holy Scriptures.2. Tim. 3.16.
               
               
                  Q. How know you that the Scriptures are the word of GOD and no
                     •
                   mens pollicies?
               
                  A. I am assured of it. First, 
                     Ephes. 1.13. because the holy Ghost perswadeth my conscience that it is so. Secondly, I see it by experience: for the preaching of the 
                     Heb. 4.12. 1. cor. 14.25. Scriptures haue the power of GOD in them to humble a man
                  
when they are preached, and to cast him downe to hell: and afterward to restore and raise him vp againe.
               
                  Q. What is the vse of the word of God preached?
               
                  A. First it 
                     Rom. 1.17. 2 cor. 2.16 hebr. 4.2.
                  breedeth and then it increaseth faith in them which are chosē to saluatiō: but vnto them that perish it is by reason of their corruption an occasion of their further damnation.
               
                  Q. How must we heare Gods word, yt it may be effecuall to our saluation?
               
                  A. Wee 
                     Iam. 1.19 act. 16.14. hebr. 4.2 esay. 66.2 luke 2.51. psal 119 11. must come vnto it with hunger-bitten hearts, hauing an appetite to the worde; we must mark it with attention, receiue it by faith, submit our selues vnto it with feare and trembling, euen then when our faults are reproued: lastly, wee must hide it in the corners of our hearts, that wee may frame our liues and conuersations by it.
               
                  Q. What is a Sacrament?
               
                  A. A 
                     Rom. 4.11 gen. 17.12 gal. 3.1 
                  signe to represent, a seale to confirme, an instrument to conuey Christ and all his benefites to them that doo beleeue in him.
               
                  Q. Why must a Sacramēt represent

the mercies of God before our eyes?
               
                  A. Because we are dull to conceiue and to remember them.
               
                  Q. Why doth the Sacrament seale vnto vs the mercies of God?
               
                  A. Because we are full of vnbeleefe and doubting of them.
               
                  Q. Why is the Sacrament the instument of the spirite to conuey the mercies of God into our hearts?
               
                  A. Because we are like Thomas, we will not beleeue till wee feele them in some measure in our hearts.
               
                  Q. How many Sacramēts are there?
               
                  A. Two 1. Cor. 10.1, 2.3. and no more. Baptisme, by which wee haue our admission into the true Church of God: and the Lords supper, by which wee are nourished and preserued in the Church after our admission.
               
                  Q. What is done in Baptisme?
               
                  A. 
                  
                     Act. 2.38 tit. 3 5. act. 22.16. matth. 28.19 Solemnly in the assembly of the church a couenant is made betweene the Lord and the party baptized.
               
                  Q. In ye making of this couenāt what doth God promise to ye party baptized?
               
                  A. 
                  
                     Gal. 3.27. 1. pet. 3.21.Christ with all blessings that come by him.
               
                  
                  Q. To what condition is the party baptized, bound?
               
                  A. To 
                     Mark. 16.16. receiue Christ, and to repent of his sinne.
               
                  Q. What meaneth the sprinkling or dipping in water.
               
                  A. The couenant being solemnly made, is therby sealed and confirmed.
               
                  Q. How commeth it to passe that many after their baptisme for a long time feele not the effect and fruit of it, and some neuer?
               
                  A. The fault is not in GOD, who keepes his couenants; but the fault is in themselues, in that they doo not keepe the condition of the couenant to receiue Christ by faith, and to repent of all their sinnes.
               
                  Q. When shall a man then see the effect of his Baptisme?
               
                  A. At what 
                     Hebr. 10.20. 1. pet. 3.21. time soeuer he doth receiue Christ by faith, though it bee an hundred yeares after, hee shall then feele the power of GOD to regenerate him, & to work al things in him, which he offered in Baptisme.
               
                  Q. Howe if a man neuer keepe the condition, to which he bound himselfe

in Baptisme?
               
                  A. His damnation 
                     Deut. 23.21, 22. eccl. 3.4.shal be the greater, because hee breaketh his vowe made to God.
               
                  Q. What is done in the L. supper?
               
                  A. The former couenant made in Baptisme, is renued in 
                     
                        •
                     . Cor. 11.23, 24, 25, and 12, 13 the Lords supper, betweene the Lord himselfe & the receiuer.
               
                  Q. What is the receiuer?
               
                  A. Euery one 1. Cor. 11.28.31. matth. 5.22, 23. esay 66.2, 3. that hath been baptized, and after his baptisme hath truly beleeued in Christ: and repented of his sinne from his heart.
               
                  Q. What meaneth the bread & wine, the eating of the bread, & drinking of the wine?
               
                  A. These outward actions 1. Cor. 10.16 17. are a second seale, set by the Lordes owne hand vnto his couenant. And they doo giue euery receiuer to vnderstād, that as God doth blesse the bread & wine, to preserue & strengthen the bodie of the receiuer: so christ receiued by faith, shall nourish him, and preserue both bodie and soule vnto eternall life.
               
                  Q. What shall a true receiuer feele in himselfe after the receiuing of the
