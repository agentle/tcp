            A Religious discourse, moouing
euery Christian man to enter into

and manner of disposing himselfe
to God, before, and at the time of
his departure.
            In the whole, somewhat happily
may be obserued, necessary to
be thought vpon, while we are aliue,
and when we are dying,
to aduise our selues
and others.

shalt not liue, but die.

vertuous his very good
Lady, the Lady Elizabeth Southwell,

honourable priuy
Chamber.
            
               LAtely entring
(Right vertuous
Lady)
into some
more then ordinary
consideration of the
gracelesse attempts, and
desperate enterprises,
which many in these
dayes (& the more the
more pittie) by a cowardly
yeelding to euill
motions, commit euen

against their owne selues,
yea their owne safetie;
I thought to discharge
my duetie vnto
Almightie God, and
plaine meaning to men,
by setting downe onely
some shorte aduertisement,
for discontented
and distressed mindes.
But after, waying with
my selfe, how much it
concerneth euery man
to be careful of his end,
whereupon dependes
so great a charge, as
his eternall welfare is
worth; I then began to
draw that particular aduertisement
appertayning

vnto some, to a
more general discourse,
appliable vnto all, and
euerye one, in this
forme, DISCE MORI,
Learne to Die: For it
seemed to me a thinge
most necessarie, for euery
sober Christian to
be mooued to enter into
a serious remembraunce
of his ende, to
know the meane and
manner of disposinge
himselfe to GOD, before,
and at the time of
his departure: that so
by the assistance of
Gods good grace, hee
might liue and die the

life and death of the
righteous, and that it
may bee saide of him,
which S. Ambrose sometimes
spake of Abraham,
Mortuus est in bona
senectute, eo quód in bonitate
propositi permansit;
Abraham dyed in a
good old age, for why?
Abraham perseuered
in his good resolutions,
in his old age, yea euen
vnto the ende. Madam,
I beseech the God of
Abraham, to graunt
you Abrahams good
successiue course, both
in the way, and at the
ende of the way. Your

more then vsuall fauor,
and long continued acceptance,
hath bounde
me vnto you, whome
otherwise I truely reuerence,
for that I am fully
perswaded, you truely
reuerence God, and
serue him, whome to
serue, is blessed libertie,
yea, (as I shall in the discourse
following shew)
is the most honourable
estate of all. To make
issue of my duetifull
regard, this small occasion
is offered. Were I
a meere straunger, I
could not for protection
sake, seeke any

better patronesse of a
religious discourse, thē
from a religious disposition:
but your particular,
respect towardes
me many waies, is such,
as I shall liue and die
vngratefull. I could
haue wished to haue
made testimonie of my
willing intention by
some other meanes, thē
by publishinge vnder
your Ladyships name,
these small labours, to
the view of the world:
for I must needes confesse.
I w

               s very loath;
(respectinge my owne
weakenesse) to make

that knowne vnto others,
which is best
knowne vnto my selfe;
vntill at last, being ouer
entreated by some speciall
friendes, from the
vniuersitie of Oxford,
whose sober, iudicious,
& very learned aduise,
I knewe not howe to
gainesay: I was induced
to let this presente
tracte goe forwarde in
the name of GOD.
Wherein I seeke not
praise, where none is
deserued: but onely desire
the Christian Reader,
where ought is amisse)
to attribute that

vnto my selfe: and beseech
your Ladyship,
that if there bee any
thing obserued, which
may mooue so much as
a good thought, that it
woulde please you, to
giue the glory only vnto
God, to whose heauenly
protection commēding
you euer in my
prayers, I cease for this

            The Preface to
the godly Reader.
            
               THat Religion
is somewhat
out of ioynt,
when Christian
conuersation goes not euen,
as it ought with Christian
profession, it is so apparant
it cānot be denied,
such and so sensible a defect,
as that thereby the
whole bodie is not a little

blemished. Those whose
hearts desire is, that Israel
may be saued, and whose
true charity is woont to beseech
God, for the good of
all, haue not onely lifted vp
humble handes to heauen,
but also endeuoured by
painfull labors, to seeke (as
much as in them lieth, and
so farre-forth as the times
may permit and suffer) the
best redresse in this case
they could: some by substantiall
answering, and soberly
asswaging the turbulent
humors of those men,
whose priuate fancies haue
much hindred higher proceedings

in matters of
faith. Refuted they may be,
and are, quieted they will
not bee: others by deuout
and learned exhortations,
in seeking to make a stay
of those euils, which Atheisme
and want of the
fear of God, would in great
likehoode bring vpon this
declining world, both labouring
for their times to
keepe some remembraunce
of Iesus Christ in the
minds of men, before all be
too farre out of square, or
come to vnrecouerable ruine.
But here may wee not
demaunde of the diligent
obseruers of our imperfections

abroad, whose maner
is so much to strike vpon
this one string, and by this
defect take occasion to call
in question, nay, to bring in
open oblequie our Christian
cause, are none fallen at
home from the ancient sinceritie,
and harmlesse deuotion
of former and better
ages of the Church?
Some state medling actions,
these vncharitable
censures in cleane shutting
out from the housholde of
faith, and hope of life, those
who haue poore soules to
saue as well as others, and
beare as true a loue to
Christ crucified as themselues,

may put them in
minde, that wee may all
beare a part togither in
that song of mercy; Asper
gas nos Domine, Cleanse
vs O Lord. May we not all
b
                  •
                thinke our selues on both
sides, whether these bee not
the dayes whereof our Sauiour
Christ spake, Wherin
iniquitie shoulde abound?
Was euer that old
complaint of Hilary more
trulie verified?Hilarius ad Constantium 
               Dum in
verbis pugnaest, dum in
nouitatibus quaestio est,
dum in ambiguis occasio
est, dum in consensu
difficultas est, iam nemo
Christi est; While

there is strife in wordes,
while there is question in
innouations, while there is
occasion in doubts, while
there is a waywardnesse in
consent, none is of Christ.
This nipping and galling
one of, and at another; this
eger pursuit of the liuing,
and troubling the verie
ashes of the dead, (who can
not answer for themselues)
is farre from that charitie
that hopeth all thinges:
and the counsell of that
spirit that biddes vs pray
one for another. To see
what wit and learning is
wont to doe in tossing the
testimonies of auncient record

to and fro: nay, which
is more, in wresting the verie
text of holie writ vpon
th
                  •
                tenters of our owne dispositions,
would so amaze
him, that shall reade ouer
with aduisement, the controuersies
of these times, as
he shall think some of them
rather discourses to trie
masterie, then otherwise
sincere trauels imployed for
Gods glorie, and his Churches
good. Now God of his
mercy grant that once this
frowarde crossing worlde
may drawe to a Christian
harmonie, that wee may
haue lesse fighting and writing
for religion, and more

indeuouring on all partes
to become as we ought,
more religious; that so
this little Arke of Christes
Church may nowe in the
coole of the Euening, with
a so
                  •
               t gale drawe homewarde,
and with olde Simeon
embracing Christ,
make readie to depart in
peace. It is the Wisemans
aduise to euerie one, Remember
thy ende, and
let enmitie passe. And
thus much wee beseech at
their hands, in whose hardest
iudgement our cause is
so feeble, that setting aside
all priuate respects, they
would at last considerwhose

gratious protection hath
defended so long his, and
our cause, whose louing and
watchfull eye hath preserued
her, who is (and God
graunt long may bee)
the staffe of our peace, calling
to minde that of our
Sauiour, If you will not
beleeue me, yet beleeue
me for my workes sake.
For those busie spirits nearer
home, who would needs
gouerne before they haue
well learned to obey, and
that at their first bourding
must sit at the helme to
guide all, how raw, how vnskilfull
soeuer: but experience
hath long time since

taught the worlde, and the
ruine of the East Church,
howe daungerous it is to
saile in a ship, where the pilots
are of a disposition to
bee quarrelling within
themselues: these mens new
deuises in matters of meere
conceipt, haue long seemed
vnto themselues, better
then all the wisdome of the
world. But may we intreat
them at the last to recount
with themselues their own
follie, in making it as they
haue done, a perfection of
godlinesse, to call and reckon
others vngodly. And
this cursed scoffing at Noahs
nakednesse, a sport to

delight their sower austerities.
would to God these
strange minded men would
listen to the graue counsell
of Saint Chrysostome:

desire of iudging thou
wouldest needes be a Iudge,

I will shew thee (saith he)
the iudgement seat, which
shall be gainfull vnto thee,
and no way touch thy conscience,
let thy minde and
thought sit downe to giue
sentence, call forth all thy
offences, and begin to say
with thy selfe, why hast
thou done this or that?
This priuate examining
of themselues, would soone
make these publike controllers
of all others, by plausible
pretenses of reformation,
to looke nearer home,
and amend in themselues
where much is amisse.1. Tim. 13. S.

And Iudah spake humblie

               She is more righteous

for deuisers to reproue others,
then to amend them
selues. Those who haue
a blemish in their eye,
thinke the skie to be euer
cloudie. Nothing
more common with troublesome
dispositions, which
haue not knowne the way of
peace, then to bee contending,

what cause soeuer there be
otherwise, to be thankefull
vnto God. The Lord by the
Prophet Malachie saith,
I haue blessed you: the

vnthankful people replied,

vnto some mens conceipts,
all is amisse; no blessing

no thankfulnesse at all remembred.

this present discourse of
learning to die, shall first
lay before thee (good Christian
reader) how necessary
it is for euerie one to enter
into a serious remembrāce
of his ende. The manifolde
reasons that should mooue
him to this remembrance,
amongst these reasons, specially
the meditation of his
state, and manifold afflictions
incident vnto the life
present, should mooue him
herevnto. Correction causeth

               ous
in this learning: the
meanes that call vs away
from so good a labour are
mentioned, and the maner
how to auoid these meanes
is with all expressed. To
make an entrance into this
so solemne a subiect; I was
sometime since occasioned
by the treatable visitation
and most Christian ende of
that verie woorshipfull
knight sir Robert Southwell,
whose approued seruice
in this Commonwelth,
and good reputation in his
Countrie, is well knowne
vnto manie: but of whose
true heart to God-warde,

both in the time of his life,
& at the time of his death,
my selfe can truly relate before
others. If there be (as
without doubt there is) a
dutie which wee owe vnto
the faithfull departed, and
a good remembrance to bee
had of those happie soules;
then might I not omit a reuerende
mention of him,
whose portion I trust assuredly
is with God. Looke
what a mournefull minde
during the time of this his
so Christian visitation,
could at times consider of,
and obserue in priuate, I
haue beene since by speciall
motiues drawn on, to make

that poore labour publike,
as a discourse proper vnto
the time. For although a
consideration of our departure
from this world bee a
subiect not vnfitting all
ages, yet seeing we are fallen
into those dayes, wherein
manye liue as if they
should neuer die▪ and die, as
if with death al were done;
and when they come to depart
this world they are so
farre to seeke in a right
disposing themselues to
God, as if they seldome or
neuer entrod into any earnest
consideration of the
same. Necessarie are those
manie treatises which tend

to the amendment of life,
but because vpon our last
conflict dependeth our eternall
victorie, against the
professed enemie of our
soules, the well behauing
our selues in this combate,
must needes of all other be
most necessarie. To guide
the ship along the seas, it is
no doubt a good skill, but at
the verie entrance into the
hauen, then to auoide the
daungerous rockes, and to
cast anchor in a safe roade,
is the chiefest skil of all. To
run the race in good order
is the part of a stout champion;
but so to run towards
the end of his race that hee

may obtaine the crowne, is
the verie perfection of all
his paines. Then a good life
what more Christian like,
but after that passed to die
in the faith and feare of
God, what more diuine?
To order aright the vpshot
of our owne time, and farewell
from this world, what
more behouefull if we respect
our selues? but in
these occasions to bee also
helpfull vnto others, what
more charitable in respect
of the communion of
Saints, and that common
ioy we receyue in the good
of all? Wee are charged to
let men liue loselie, and

most vnchristianlie to depart
this worlde, to leade
their liues, and to goe out
of their liues without order:
what men doe, is one
thing, what wee wish were
done, is another. God
knowes, and many can witnesse
how often, howe earnestlie
wee call vpon this
carelesse world, to remember
that high and weighty
businesse of the soule men
haue in hande. Though

It is said of Aristides, who
perceiuing the open scandal
likelie to arise, by reason of
the contention sprung vp
betwixt him and Themistocles,
to haue besought
Themistocles
mildly after this manner:

no smal offence vnto many,
good Themistocles, let
vs be at one, and if we will
needes striue, let vs striue
who shall excell each other
in vertue and loue. The
Elements though in qualities
diuerse: yet doe they all
accord for the constitution
of the bodie naturall, what
should Christians but acaccord
for the conseruation
of the Church, that
they be not a shame to Israel
which Church is a bodie
mysticall: we are all sheepe
of that folde whereof Christ

is the sheepheard, we are all
stones of that building,
whereof he was the corner.
We are all braunches of
that Vine whereof hee was
the stocke. We haue but one
God for our father, that
created vs all, one Christ
Iesus to our Sauiour, that
redeemed vs all, one holie
Ghost to our sanctifier, that
doth adorne vs all. We are
but pilgrimes and straungers,
and wee shall one day
find, that a peaceable christian
life, with a good departure
from this worlde,
shal stand vs more in stead
then all the world besides,
when after bearing our

braines in matters of contradiction,
we shall perceiue
that this charitable Christian
life is worth all. And
therefore beseech we God,
the authour of all good
giftes, that Mercie and
truth may meete togither,
that righteousnesse
and peace may kisse
each other. And his glorie

Copie of a letter sent from
Oxford to the Authour of this
booke, and thought good in his
absence to be set down by those
to whome the publique allowance
heereof did
appertaine.
            
               
                  MAster Sutton,
I haue perused
your copie,
which
seemeth to mee in my
simple opinion, very
deuout, diuine & learned:
The subiect of
your booke, I greatly

approoue, for to teache
to die well, is the forciblest
perswasiue to liue
well, which alas are in
these wicked times,
both little thought on:
for in deede, men liue
as though they neuer
made accompt to die:
and they die as if they
neuer thought on another
life. Your seuerall
treatises are very Christian
& most necessary
in this dying age, to all
goodnesse: your phrase
and vaine of penninge
sweete and patheticall:
your allusions diuine &
comfortable. I say at

once, and I thinke, Omnia
in illo libro spiritum
dininum olent. Wherfore
my counsell vnto you
is, that you woulde
make this your booke
liue by printing, which
may make many liue
frō sinning. Gods good
spirite hath not moued
you to take this good
paines, now to bury the
fruite, so soone as it is
borne, and none profited,
but that it shoulde
be presented vnto the
worlde, to liue, when
you are dead: Foelix &
formosa proles est: be not
then so vnnatural now,

to stifle it in the cradle,
or cast it with Moyses to
drowning: it is worthy
the nurcing, and bringing
vp of a Princes
daughter, and your honourable
patronesse.
The Church looketh
to haue good seruice
of it: the Vniu
                  •
               rsitie,
your Colledge, your
mother, your frendes
expect credite & commendation
by it: your
selfe the father of it, will
no doubt haue great
ioy of it. Goe forwarde
then on Gods name,
and christen it to the
world. And so I leaue

with my hartiest commendations,
longing to
see that faire printed,
which is now so neere
written, I could s

               Wherein is shewed in the last

Learne to Die.
            
            
               The First Chapter.
               
                  An exhortation moouing euery
one to apply himselfe to this
lesson of learning to Die.
               
               
                  TRue it
is, that
our abode
heere in
this world
is an ordinaunce
established
of God, and may also be very
acceptable to man. To procure

the continuaunce of life, by
meanes ordained, is allowable.Eccles. 38. 3.
To auoide thinges hurtfull
to the preseruation thereof,
is behoouefull. Wilfully
to hinder our owne health, is
not onely against the cours
                     •
                   of
nature, but a way to tempt the
very God of nature. To wish
eyther to bee gonne sooner, or
to stay longer in this earthly
station, then it shal seeme good
vnto him, by whose appointment
wee all stand, is a part
(saith one) of great ingratitude.
The time therefore allot
                     •
                  ed
vs to walke in, we may
accept, vntill God cal vs away,
with thankefull hearts: vsing
that space to serue him,Luc. 2. 72 in holinesse
and righteousnesse. To
desire with the Prophete,Psal. 72. 15. that
God, who hath taught vs frō
our youth by, would not leaue
vs in age, when wee are grayheaded:
vntill wee haue shewed
his power vnto them who
are yet to come. With Ezechias
                  
to do God yet a little more
seruice in the world.Esa 38. 4 With S.
Paule to be content to stay our▪
dissolution,Phil. 1. 24 to be helpefull vnto
others. In which respectes,
we may accept of, and wish yet
some farther continuaunce of
our selues and others. The
true Israelites in desiring so
hartely the life and preseruation
of Dauid their king;2. Sam. 21 17. because
when he should be taken from
them, the light of Israel wold
bee quenched, and many a good
Israelite shoulde (as Iacob
saide) bring his gray heires
with sorrow,Gen. 42. 38. vnto the graue,
did herein she
                     •
                  , no lesse dutifull,
then godly affection. Notwithstanding,
seeing that man
hath here onely a course to finish,
which beeing finished,
he must away: seeing that life is

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , true as ye
saying hath, a debt to Death,
who hath absolute authority
ouer all, then as the Prophet
Daniell said, Heare acceptable

counsell: Nay heare
O mā,Dan. 4. 24. counsell by y• wisest amongst
men, from the God of
Heauen,Eccles 12. 1. 
                  Remember thy Creator
in the dayes of thy youth:
or at the least, before the dayes
come wherin thou shalt saye, I
haue no pleasure in them: That
is to wit, thy approaching end
It is sufficient,1. Pet. 4. 3. 
                  
                     •
                  aith S. Peter,
That wee haue seene the time
past after the lustes of the Gentiles.
As if he should haue said▪
for the time past that is gone,
and cannot be recalled. Now
for God his sake bee carefull
for the time to come. That we
are not borne Angelles wee
knowe, and experience dooth
shew we are all mortall▪ 
                  Liue
well and Die well: If wee take
heede in time, wee may, Liue,
and not to Die, wee cannot.
Neither are we to regard how
long wee liue, but how well
we liue. To take then a Religious
remembrance of our end,
as a potion next the heart in

this miserable world, that begins
apace to w

                  xe sickly in

                     rection,
and goes forward so coldly
in the exercises of Christian
pietie, will with God his help
be a warme, and speciall preseruatiue
to the soule, To
Learne to Die, is a lesson worthy
our best, and best disposed
attention, being a speciall preparatiue
vnto a happy ende,
wherein consisteth the welfare,
of all our beeing. Dauid
who was for his learning
a Prophet; for his acceptation
(saith the Scripture) A man
after Gods owne heart;
                  1. Sam. 13. 14. was
thē very studious in this learning,
who after watching, and
fasting hee besought God to be
instructed,Psal. 39. 5 cōcerning the nomber
of his dayes, and the time
hee had yet to liue: Like the
carefull scholler that breakes
his sleepe, forsakes his meate,
is often in meditation, when
he 
                     •
                  eates vpon some seriou
                     •
                  
                  
subiect. Now therefore this

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , of all lessons, or
learninges,Cor. 1. 20. this learning to
Die, what more waighty?
what more diuine? where is
the Scribe? where is the Disputer?
what is it to haue the
force of Demosthenes? the
pe
                     •
                  swasiue arte of Tully, so
great an Orator? What is it
by Arithmeticall accompte, to
deuide the least fractions, and
with the man of God, neuer to
think of nombring the time we
haue yet to liue? what is it by
Geometrie, to take the longitude
of the most spatious prospectes,
and not to measure
that, which the Prophete calleth,
onely a span long? what
is it to set the Triapason in a
musicall concent, and for want
of good gouernement, to lead
a life all out of tune? what
is it with the Astronomer, to
obserue the motion of the Heauens,
and to haue his harte
buried in the earth? With the

Naturalist, to search out the
cause of many effectes, and let
passe a consideration of his
owne 
                     •
                  railty? With the Historian
to knowe what others
haue doone, and to neglect the
true knowledge of himselfe?
With the Lawyer to prescribe
many lawes in particular, and
not to remem
                     •
                  er the common
Law of Nature, that all must
Die, which is a Law generall?
In a woord, what is it for the
deepest worldlings to be able
by reaching pollicy, to compasse
plots of high enterprise,
as Doctors in that faculty,
and die God knowes, like simple
men? Surely all is nothing
worth. If thou art wise,
bee wise then vnto thine owne
soule. As the rich man, saith
Fulgentius,
                  Fulgent. epist. ad 
                        •
                     al. spoken of in the sixteenth
of Luke, was poore in
all his pompe, mourning in all
his mirth: so are those who
Liue and neuer Learne to Die:
ignorant in all their knowledge.

For why? the greatest
Rabbines in these professions,
may come with Nicodemus to
be catechised in this learning▪
wherein either as babes they
haue not receiued the first rudiments,
or as very trewantes,
haue a little by roate, and so
soone forget all. Well, the perfection
of our knowledge is to
know God, and our selues:
our selues wee best knowe,
when wee acknowledge our
mortall being. As men we die
naturally, as Christians wee
die religiously. In the schoole
of Christ, first by mortifying
the old man, wee endeuour to
die to the world, and then by a
vertuous disposing of our
selues, for the day of our departure,
we learne to die in the
worlde. By our dying to the
world, Christ is saide to come
and Liue in vs, and by our dying
in the world, wee are saide
to goe to Liue with Christ.Gal▪ 2. 20.
Now therfore seeing to die, is
so necessary, and to Die wel is

so Christian-like,Phil. 1. 23. let euery one
apply himselfe sov
                     •
                  rly to this
learninge, as the greatest part
of true wisedome. How many
in the world beat their braines
about friuolous matters: some
beeing more busie to knowe
where Hellis, sayth S. Chrisostome,
                  Chrisost. in Homil. 31.
then how to auoid the
paines thereof: others pleasing
themselues, in pelting and
needelesse questions, to seeme
singular amongst men. When
they come to departe this
world, then they perceiue they
haue spunne a faire thred, and
wearied themselues in vaine;
then they consider howe they
shoulde rather haue applyed
themselues as they ought,
Wherefore to grow more and
more, out of loue and liking,
with these transitory delights:
to breake off by little and little,
from this wearysome world,
to his home-warde, disposing
himselfe for the day of his departure
is a course most beseeming
euery wise Christian. Let

the vaine glorious, who with
the Camelion, liue by the ayre,
and therefore is said to be euer
found gaping: who haue with
the Moone, but a borrowed
light in the world, not lighte in
themselues, & therefore are still
waxing and wayninge, follow
shewes, and shadows, all which
shal perish, in the twinckling of
an eye, but let the wise Christiā
man Learne to die the death of
the righteous,Psal. 116. 15. that so hee may
liue ioyfully heere & hereafter.
That which foolish menne are
willing to do in the end, wise
men do in the beginning. Wisedome
it is with Noah,
                  Gen. 6. 12 Gen. 41. 48. to build
an Arke while the season is
calme: with Ioseph to laye vp
store in the dayes of plenty:
while y• weather is faire to bethinke
our selues of a tempest:
in a word, whē oportunity doth
serue, to follow a thriuing husbandry,
sowing the seed of godly
actio
                     •
                  s, in the field of a repē
                  tāt
hart, that so at y• Antumne,
or end of our age, we may reap

the fruites of euerlasting comfort.
We are for the most part
euen out of the world, before
euer we consider out condition
in the same, and we then begin
to direct our course aright, whē
the time is come rather to make
an ende. Would to God we
would remember that worthy
sayinge of one, when hee was
now drawing towards the period
of his time,Sene. epist. 62. 
                  quando iuuenis
curaui bene viuere, quando senex
bene mori, Whē I was a yong
man, my care was how to liue
well, since age came on, my care

                  w to die wel. And
of an other, who brake out into
these words:August. de. mat. Luc. 10. 
                  Nihil suauius in
hac vita, quā vt quietus fiat exitus
ex 
                        •
                     adem, In this life now
nothing more sweete vnto me
then to prepare for a peaceable
passage from the same. With
Martha we are combred about
many things. Mary that sate
musing, chose the good parte.
Vnum est necessariū, One thing
is necessary: Learne, O learne to

Die. The enemy that is often loked
for, dooth least hurte, when
hee makes his assault. If this
Basiliske Death, first see vs, before
we it, there is some daunger:
but if wee first discrie the Basiliske,
then the Serpent dieth,
wee neede not feare. The tempest
before expected, dooth lesse
annoy, when the storme shall arise.
He that leaueth the worlde,
before the worlde leaues hym,
thinketh of the day of his dissolution:
as the Sicke man hearkeneth
to the clocke, shall giue
Death the hand: like a welcome
messenger,Luc. 2. 29 and with Simeon pray
to depart in peace. Yet the weather
is faire,Gen. 7▪ 5 wee may frame an
Arke to saue vs from the floud.
Yet Ionas calls in the streete ofIon. 3. 4
                  Niniuie. Yet Wisedome crieth to
all that passe by,Prou. 1. 2. 
                  vsque quo: O
how long will you loue vanitie?
Yet the Angels are at the gatesHos. 6. 4
of Sodome. Yet the Prophet
woos; O Iuda how shall I entreate
thee? Yet the Apostle beseecheth
for Christes sake,2. Cor. 5 20. that
we would bee reconciled vnto

God. To conclude, yet the
Bridegroome tarries and stayes
the virgins leysure,Matth. 25 7. to haue them
enter with him vnto the marriage
solemnitie. Lord that they
would make speede, and cast off
many meere vanities, seeing the
ioyes of heauen carry for them.
The pleasures of this worlde,
are pleasures in shew: but the
pleasures that Christ hath layd
vp for them, that are his, are
pleasures in deede. God almighty
increase in our hartes a desire
of this learning: that so wee may
liue in his feare, & die in his loue,
to liue for euer.

                  Wherein is shewed, the cause why
men so seldome enter into a serious
remembrance of their end
               
               
                  CAn wee sufficiently
woonder, that the
regenerate manne,
whome God hath
made by grace, 
                     •
                  
contemplatiue creature, and by

glory,Matt. 22. 30. equalled vnto the state of
Aungels, should bee so delighted
in the affaires of thys
vncomfortable worlde: so enchaunted
with the harlot-like allurements
of sinne: so carried away
from himself by the way of
sensuall securitie, as vtterly to
cast away all remēbrance of his
ende, and to become worse then
an Idoll of Canaan, which had
eyes, & saw not, that is, to haue
a Reasonable Soule, and vnderstand
not to induce the sonnes of
men lightly, and loosely to passe
ouer a religious remembrance of
this their ende? Is his sleight,
whose businesse was, and is, at,
and since the fall of Adam,
                  Gen. 3. 4. to slay
soules: Nequaquam moriemini,
Tush you shall not dye at all?
As if he would haue the remembrance
of death▪ but a melancholy
conceite: and least it should
make in mans hart too deepe an
Impression of the feare of God,
he will haue the Forbidden tree
to delght the eye: fayre woordes
to please the eare, and driue all
away. Eritis vt Dii: Why? you

shall be as Gods: when his drift
was to haue had them Diuels.
By this we see, whose practise it
is to make the worlde runne at
randome as it doth, and so many
graceles Libertines by a carelesse
course to passe ouer their dayes in
vanity, their yeares: in folly, so
long, vntill they be taken by the
euill day, when they thinke not
of it,Eccles. 9 12. 
                  as birdes in the snare, and fishes
in the nett, sayth the wise
man, and so become vtterly vndone
for euer. To muse of our
Ende, is none of our thoghts: to
heare S. Paule speake of iudgement
to come, is too chilling a
doctrine for our delightful dispositions,Act. 24, 26,
and makes vs cold at the
hart. We cannot abide to stay vppon
such austerities. with Felix
wee are not at leysure, for this

                     •
                  arring musicke▪ which soundes
not a right in the consort of our
worldly pleasures, and therefore
will heare it another tyme,
happely not at all. To thinke of
death it is Acheldoma, a fielde of
bloud: but to let the time slide
wastfully, and our sinnes increas
                     •

Mercyfull Lorde!Iere. 5. 31. what
will become of this at the last?
If nothing els, yet the dayly instances
of death before vs, doe euidently
shew, what shall in like
maner shortely betide our selues.
The enterlude is the same: we
                     •
                  
are but now Actors vppon the
stage of this world. They which
are gon, haue played their parts:
and wee which remayne, are yet
acting ours, onely our Epilogue
is for to ende. It is a maruaile
aboue maruailes, that in a battaile,
where so manye goe to
the grounde, our remisse hartes
can take no warning, to enter into
some remēbrance of our state.
The neighbours fire cannot but
giue warninge of approachinge

night, whether he would or no,
to make his ende. If nothinge

Good Lord, into what a daungerous
Lethargie of the soule are
wee fallen, when so many obiectes
before our eyes, which
are so often sounding in our
dullest eares, can nothing moue:
or at least so little, as sodeinely
all is gone. Our mouing is with
Agrippa, in modico tantum, but
onely somewhat, which by and
by is forgot againe. Our consultations
are, Volumus, & nolumus,
we will, and we will not:
and so with the sluggarde, nothinge
is done. What long discourse

haue we in our greatest
meetings, but dead men are partly,
if not chiefly, the subiect of the
same? How often heare wee the

it is so long before; the most glorious
amongest men, in the eye
of the world, will remember thē
                  selues
to be but men. First, he
                     •
                  
speaketh vnto all: Heare all yee
people. And least any shoulde
thinke themselues exempted, thē
vnto all, of all estates: High and
Low, Rich and Poore, one with
an other: and because he would
haue it knowne to be a matter of
importaunce in deede, hee sayth:
My mouth shall speake of wisedome,
my hart shall talke of vnderstanding:
vtter inge the selfesame
twise ouer, as if wee might
wonder, what the Prophet had
to say, which is indeede his own
wondering. Seeinge that wise
men die as well as fooles: that

death groweth vpon them: that
their beauty shall consume in the
Sepulchre: that they shall carry
nothing away with them: that
all their pompe shall leaue them,
when they go and follow the generation
of their Fathers: yet
for all this they thinke that they
shall continue for euer, and their
dwelling places endure from one
generation to another, callinge
their landes after their owne
names: this is their foolishnesse
saith he. And surely as in many
other thinges, the wisedome
of man is foolishnesse with God,
so is it in this,1. Cor. 1. 
                        •
                     . 5. 
                  Ioseph of Aramathea,
a rich mā (as we read in the
Gospel) had a Sepulcher in his
garden. Surely in places,Ioan. 19. 41. where
we take felicity, wee should not
but haue a mention by some good
thought at least. of our mortal
beeing. In all other affaires wee
are often vigilant: but in this so
remisse, as if all wer but a game.
Did we watch death, which in
times of our chiefest delighted
most watcheth vs, and often taketh
vs too; then would we not

liue as we liue, and sinne as we
sinne, but giue a thousande dalliances,
a bill of diuorce, as if for
their baggage dealing we would
haue no more to doe with them.
But so long as wee liue, wee
spend our dayes, as if we had an
estate of Feesimple, or Patent
at large to continue as we lift, to
commit sinne, as easily as beasts
drinke wat
                     •
                  r, without remorse,
without feare. One of the greatest
euils in the life of man, is a
carelesse neglecte of Gods woorship.
One of the greatest causes
of this neglect, is the forgetfullnesse
of his ende. Therfore (saith
Gregory) doe so many cast off
all care of Christian piecy, beecause
they neuer care at all.Greg. mor. to
minde their present condition of
humane frailty. When the Prophet
Ieremy woulde shewe the
state of Ierusalem to haue become
altogether irreligious: without
mentioning many causes, hee expresseth
the maine cause in briefe,
as thus: Non est recordata finis,
                  Lam. 1. 9
She remembred not her end. So
by this wee see, Sathan hath no

more daungerous deuise to draw
men from GOD, like Absolom,
who stole away the hartes of the
people, when they were goyng
downe to doe homage to Dauid
their king,1. Sam. 15. 6. then by stealing from
their hartes this remembrance of
their ende. The Panther, as is
written of him, knowinge howe
beastes flie from him by reason of
his oughly head, which frayes thē,
thrusts onely his head in some secrete
corner, whilest they gazing
on his goodly spotted hide, nothinge
suspectinge their approaching
ende, suddenly he breaketh
out, and prayeth vpon them. So
this foule headed Panther Sathan,
perceiuing well, how much
delight men take in worldly pleasures,
hideth his deformed head,
settinge out his fine coulored
skinne; that is, the glory and
vanitie of pleasaunt, but daungerous
delightes, whilest in the
meane time they neglecting their
enemy, their ende; hee suddenly
seeketh to entrappe and deuoure
them. Wherefore men had neede
be prepared and vigilant in thys

respect, that they may bee euer
prouided against his so subtle deceites,
and Remember their end,
before it end them; that is, beefore
it be said, as vnto Ahaziah,
                  2. ki

the bed, vnto the which thou art
gone vp. And that which is chiefest
of all, beefore the soule by a
consumption of sinne, pyne to
death. Blessed Lord! who? were
he not carelesse in the superlatiue
degree, would not sometimes retire
himselfe from this combersome
world, and remember that
which almost hee cannot forgett,
That he must one day die? Why
did God leaue, saith S. Austen,
                  Aug. Ep. ad Diase. our
last day of our life vnknowne to
vs; was it not because euery day
should be prepared of vs? which
preparing wee may not neglecte
vpon paine and perill of losse foreuer.
Wherefore let them take
heede in time,Exod. 5 2. who passe ouer their
dayes Pharao-like,Eccle. 5. 4. 
                  Atheist like,
sayinge, who is the Lorde? Wee
haue sinned, and what euill is
happened vnto vs? be they well
assured, that Death like a Sargeant

sent from aboue, vppon an
action of Debt, at the suite of
Nature her selfe, will sooner or later,
attache and arrest them all:
and make them aunsweare this
high contempt, where God himselfe
is a party, at the Courte of
Heauen. Let them know▪ that all
must yeelde, bee they as strong as
Sampson, as glorious as Herode,
as mighty as Alexander: this tyrant
Time will sweepe them all
away. Moyses vpon the mount

yeares.Gen. 5. 27 The holiest, the healthiest,
where, or when, we know
not: all must downe when death
commeth. Wee dayly see it, and
will not sticke sometymes our
selues to say as much, and yet remember
nothinge lesse, as if it
were onely some arbitrable matter,
and so wee bring our yeares
to an ende, as it were a tale that
is tolde. Of all other we cannot
sufficiently maruelle, that olde
men, when as now drooping nature
putteth them in minde, that
their continuance is not long,

when bended backe makes them
looke downe, whether they will
or no, and biddes them thinke of
their hearse or graue: to see these
either addicted to the insatiable
desire of gaine, or giuen vnto the
lightest behauiour of youth,
shewes them to be far from this
religious remembraunce of their
ende. Sophocles a heathen man
would blush for shame to see the
most vnseemely matches & marriages
of our time. wherein age
and youth are yoaked together;
a thing so contrary in nature, so
vnseemely in reason, as nothing
more: and the inexcusable folly of
age, to bee so farre from a consideration
of that which is seemely
both before God and man Tully
could say longe agoe, of ciuill
gouernemente amongest men,Cicero de Senect.
                  Aptissima arma senum exercitationes
virtutum: Olde mens weapons,
what shoulde they els bee,
but exercises of vertue? In Christianity,
more fitter wer it a great
deale for them, to be at their deuotions,
then to do often as they
doe. Isaack thoughte it tyme atGen. 27. 2
                  
these dayes, to commune of blessing,
and of his ende: My sonne
let me blesse thee, I am olde, and
know not the day of my departure.
               
               They doe as much labour in
effect and more, that sit at the
sterne, and gouern, as those that
toyle and tosse otherwise: but to
mooue age to this consideration,
the very beholding of others,2. Kin. 1. 13.
that goe before them, is in reason
sufficient. When the thirde gouernor
ouer Fifty, of whome
mention is made in the seconde
booke of Kings, saw but his two
fellow Captaines ouer Fifty
deuoured before him, it went so
nere his hart, that he came forth,
fell downe and besought the man
of God, that his life mighte bee
pretious in his sight. How many
Fifties in late yeares of mortalitie
and warre haue we seene,
or heard to haue beene deuoured
by death? How many of our fellow
Souldiers in this spirituall
conflict, in which wee all fight,
haue wee seene die in the fielde?
How many of our deerest frends

haue taken their leaue and gone
before, and yet for all this there
is no comming to make humble
supplication (I say) not to the
man of God, but to God himselfe,
that our liues and deathes
may be pretious in his sight As
is,Psal. 116. 15. saith Dauid, the death of hys
saintes. The Publicans but hearing

roote of the tree, and that euery
tree, which did not bringe foorth
fruit, should be hewen down, and
cast into the fire, it made them
come to Iohn the Baptist wyth
their Quid faciemus?

shall we doe to avoide these thinges!
The men of Niniueh hearing
but once of their imininent
ende, it wrought such, & so great
remorse in them, as they all out
of hand fasted, put on sackecloth,Ion. 3. 8.
and sorrowed for their sinnes
Often hath God knocked at the
doore of our hartes, to aduertise
vs of our mortalitie: For whe
is there that hath not sometime
experienced in himselfe by feeling
the infirmity of his declining nature?
by auoidinge the perils of

apparant daunger, beesides the
sondry warninges to this effecte,
whether we must? And here wee
may all wonder at the mercy and
patience of God, whō by these
motiues dooth admonish vs of
our approaching ende. But yet
for all this how little humblinge
of our selues is ther before him,
whose dominion reacheth vnto
the endes of the earth, whose power
is aboue all powers,

Saluation is a matter of great earnest.

and Watchfull seruauntes,
what els doth he teach his Disciples
& vs all,Luc. 12. 37. but in so weighty
a cause to be carefull in deede?
Wee haue as much neede as any
that euer liued vnder the cope of
heauen, considering these sinnefull
dayes. When God saide, the
wickednesse of men is great vppon
earth,Gen. 6. 5 it was time for Noah
to prepare for an Arke to saue
himselfe. When once the crye of
Sodome was ascended to Heauen,

it was time for Lot to thinke
of his departure,
                  Gen. 19. 14. vnto the Hill
countries. When this world now
after many strong fittes of great
contentions beginnes to trifle
idlely with euery fancy, we may
partlye gather by these sickly
signes, which may it is drawing
and say. God of Heauen helpe
this worlde, for it is a weake
worlde indeede. These bee no
dayes to liue securely in: but rather
time and high time is it for
euery one, to amend one, that
God may haue mercy vppon vs
all. Haue wee not example by
them that sleepe vntill the Bridegroomes
comminge,Mat. 25. 11. that euerye
knocke will not bee sufficiente
warrant to enter?Gen. 27. 38. By him, that
wepte for a blessinge, when it
was too late: that euery sigh will
not be a satisfaction for our sins.
Tis most sure, and we had neede
looke to it in time:Eccles. 11. 3. 
                  Where the
tree falleth, there it lyeth. And as
the last day (saith S. Austen) of
our life leaueth vs; so shall the
day of Doome finde vs. To let
all alone vntill it be too late, was

their folly, who long since were
drowned in the floud.Gen. 7. 21 To cast
onely for wealth and ease, was
his worldly wised
                     •
                  m, that made
a suddaine farewell from both:
when that night his soule was taken
from him,
                  Lu. 12. 20 and not yeelded of
him. To deferre all vnto the
last push, neuer entringe into a
Religious remembraunce of our
ende, is an effete of that ill spirit,
called sensuall security, which
kinde of Spirite is not cast out,
but by Fasting and Prayer.
               
            
            
               The Third Chapter.
               
                  How behoouefull it is for euery Christian
man, soberly to meditate of
his ende.
               
               
                  IN the whole Tenure
of a Christian
life, no parte more
heauenly, then that
wee spende in Religious
meditation, for this Religious
meditation, no subiect more
neerely concerneth the state of
man, then often to beate vpon a

                  Remembrance of his ende, wherin
consisteth the Center of al his
desire
                     •
                  , the haruest of all his labours,
his s
                     •
                  re and most happy
repose for euer. How behoouefull
then is it for euery one, to
sequester himselfe sometimes frō
incombrances of this worlde,
vacare Deo, to bee at leasure for
God, & to call his best thoughts
to counsel to this businesse of his
soule: the manyfold effectes of so
good and practise will easily shewe
and approoue as much. For who
is there that with Ezechias will
not fall to set his householde, his
life,Esa. 38. 1. his soule, and all in order,
when once that of the Prophet
mooues his very hart: Ezechias
moriere, Ezechias now God bee
mercifull vnto thee, thou art no
longer a man of this world, dispatche
to bee gone, thou must
shortly die? Who is there that
will not set downe, and cast ouer
his bils of account, before he run
too farre in Arrerages, that
thinkes throughly he shall (beefore
long bee) heare his masters
voice to warne him out of office:

                  Iam non poteris villicare,
Thou shalt bee no longer Steward.Luc. 16. 2.
In a generality, how this
or the like remembrance causeth
a carefull direction of all our life,
whē any temptation doth come,
that of the Wise mā doth briefly
expresse: My sonne remember thy
ende,
                  Eccles. 1. 40. 
                  in whatsoeuer thou shalt take
in hand, and thou shalt neuer doe
amisse. This remembrance, if it
did sincke into the hart, whereas
often like a peece of musicke it
soundeth in the eare, then would
it woorke better effectes in the
world, then commōly it is wont.
If coueteous menne, who seeme
possessed with a spirit of hauing,
who like Moales and Antes, are
alwayes turning in the earth. If
the proude, who like Gyants,
with contempte, disdayne the
meaner sorte of menne, who are
made of the same mould▪ as well
as they, did deepely consider that
one of these dayes, they shall become
a clod of earth: when like
a State-searcher. Death will see
they carry away nothinge wyth
them, when these loftye lookes

shall bee layde full lowe, and all
their glorye bee Eclipsed: some
good thoughte to this effecte,1. King. 5. 18.
would make them say with Naaman
the Sirian, God be mercifull
vnto vs, in this one thinge: that
wee thincke not oftener of our
ende. Would any Ammon committe
that freely in the sighte of
God,2. Sam. 13 19. which he shameth to cōmit
in the sighte of the meanest of all
Gods creatures 
                     •
                  . Would any
Ahab oppresse & wrōg poore Naboaths;
                  1. Kin. 13. 9.
& did himself remember
hee were but a Soiourner, as
wer his Forefathers; & that after
an euill course, he must shortly
goe to answeare for all, when
the hart shall feele, for wrong offered,
many a colde pull: and the
sinnes lye vpon the soule, as heauy
as lead. Our Sauiour Christ
saide, to fore-warne Reuolters:
Remember Lots wife.
                  Lu. 17. 32 So may
it bee sayd, to aduise all oppressors:
Remember poore Naboths
vineyard. To call to minde, that
this world, and the glory thereof,
so soone passeth away, that we
are heere to day, and gone tomorrow.

If nothinge els: yet
with men of reasonable capacitie,
this were inough, were it
considered, to contayne them
within the listes and limites of a
Christian & conscionable course.
But because this is not considered,
so many liue, as if they
had no soules to saue. Such is
the calamitie of our time: Non
sic erat a principio; but it was
not so from the beginning. The
godly Patriarkes, in purchasing
onely a place to bury in, what
doth it els, but manifestly shew
vnto succeeding posteritie, howe
mindefull they were of theyr
state mortal. That song of Moyses,
which the auncient Fathers
say, the people of God vsed, in
forme of a dayly prayer, to witt,Psal. 90. 12.
the 90. Psalme, wherein both
man
                     •
                   frailtie is acknowledged,
is also this petition pathetically
inserted: Lord teach vs to nomber
our dayes: doth it not shew vnto
vs, with what deuotion they

                     •
                  aily entred into a Remembrance
of their ende? Where is that
mindfullnesse of Abraham, so

great a Patriarke,Gen. 18. 27. who confessed
himselfe to bee but dust and
ashes? Of Iob, who dayly wayted
till his chaunginge shoulde
come?Iob. 14. 14 Of king Dauid, who made
no other reckoning of himselfe,Psal. 120. 3.
but to bee onelye a straunger amongst
men? Of the Apostle S.
Peter, who counted his contynuance
here,2. Pet. 1. 13. but an abode in a
Tabernacle, which hee shoulde
shortlye laye off. Tabernacles
were only for men in warrefare
& Pilgrimes, to shew, while we
are in these bodies, wee are no other,
but men ready to remooue.
How farre these were from setting
their repose heere in earth,
we may hence easily perceiue, Amongst
heathen men, the Emperours,
when they were crowned,
the Sepulchers of dead
men were shewed vnto them, and
they asked, what one should bee
made for them; thereby putting
them in remembrance, that they
must looke for no other, but
themselues shortly to haue the
like. For the old Saintes and
seruauntes of God, who liued in

a continuall farewell from the
world, like wise marchantes alwayes
thinking of their returne,
endeuoured to take vp treasures
by billes of receite, where they
should stay and make their abode
for euer. Iacob was carefull in
his iourney to Haram.
                  Gen. 28. 12. 
                  Iacob
slept, the same night God shewed
him a ladder, the top wherof
reached to Heauen. Iacob that
as the iourney thou and al Pilgrims
should be carefull of indeede.
The Philosophers who
saw no farther then the cloudes
of humane reason, perceyuinge
the declining course of humane
nature, could say, the life of wise
men, what should it els bee, but
a continuall meditation of death?
If any to exercise himselfe in this
speculatiue remembrance of hys
state, would keepe a Catalogue
to this ende, and often recite by
name? how many reuerend Prelates,
how many graue Counsellors,
how many worthy men of
Armes, & gallants of the world,
how many of his nerest familiars
he had knowne, within these few

yeares, to haue flourished wyth
their troupes and trames after
them▪ saying (Good Lord:) Are
t
                     •
                  ey not deade and rotten? are
they not all gone almost, as if
they neuer had bene? Why should
menne make so much accompt of
this world, that is so transitory?
Againe, what more effectuall
meane, to make vs shake off the
allurements of this life, as Paul
did the viper,Act. 28. 5 into the fire, then
this or the like religious Meditation
of our ende? Almighty God
would shew the Prophet Ieremy
in no other place, then a house of
clay,Ierem. 18. 2. 3. the state and condition of
the despisers of his word, to signify,
that wee are best lessoned,
where our fraile estate may bee
best considered. The Wise man
could not but woonder, Why any
shoulde bee puffed vpp with
pride,Eccles. 10 12. considering what he was▪
                  Quid 
                        •
                     uperbis terra; O earth saith
he, why art thou proud? As if
all our pompe, and our selues too,
were no better then the ground
we treade vpon. A strange case
to see the meanesse of our estate,

and yet to exalt our selues? to
consider vpon how weake a foundation
we stand, and to thinke
of nothing lesse? If we will needs
be high minded, would to God
we would set our mindes on heauenly
thinges,Coll
                        •
                     s. 3. 2 or things on high.
For consideration, necessary is
it, to thinke of that which must
necessarily beefall. Were it but
onely for that which stands lyke
the Law of the Medes and Persians:
Constitutum est omnibus
semel mori:
                  Heb. 9. 27 It is enacted that
all must die▪ this were inough
to cast a cloud ouer all mens fairest
delightes. But that same
post autem iudicium, ther is somewhat
more behinde, and that is
called the time of iudgemente.
This once possesing the harte▪
there neede not so manye penall
Lawes to deterre them and their
affections, which are often so far
out of square, from extreame impietie.
The Cocke (saith one)
fearing the Eagle and the Hauk,
hath one eye fixed on his meate▪
and the other often directed in the
ayre: So a prouident godly man

prouiding before-hand thinges
necessary, hath respect vnto the
Eagle, or Christes comming in
the ayre to iudgement, as also vnto
the Hauke, which is Death,
therefore called Rapax▪
                   because
it suddainely seizeth and prayeth
vpon all. A generall restrainte
from euill (saith Cassianus an
auncient writer) is a mindfullnesse
of Death,Gass. col. 18. which the Egiptians

Let vs meditate in this
life of nothing more, then of our
pilgrimage, that heere woe shall
not alwayes bee: preparing our
selues rather to that place, whēce
we shall neuer depart, but haue a
sure stay for euer. And S. Ierome,

                  Qui quotidie recordatur se esse
moriturum, contemnit praesentia,
& ad futura festinat: He that doth
remember, that die he must, little
regarding thinges present, euer
hasteth towards things to come:
which the olde enemy of man
perceiuing, seeketh nothing more

then to draw vs frō this frequēt
meditation of Death, chiefly by
the pleasurable allurementes of
intising vanities. The Hunter
when he seeketh to take the Tygers
young (which is onely one)
is said, to set vp looking glasses,
where the Tyger should passe a
longe, in seekinge this younge,
which shee doth sometimes by
straying abroad, loose; finding in
the glasse, a resemblance of herselfe,
leaues the pursuite, and
looseth her younge. This olde
hunter perceiuing mans industry,
in the conseruation of that
which is one, and onely one, his
deere Soule; would by many
goodly shewes, make vs neglect
this religious care, and stay our
selues, vppon euery triuolous
delighte, so longe, that wee

goe, and so hazarde that, which
the Prophet calleth, most precious,
euen the Redemption of
our Soules.
                  Psal. 49▪ 8. But the prouident
Christian man, knowing how
daungerous it must needes bee,
for the bird to take delight amidst

the ginnes, and snares, of the
Fouler, makes no stay vppon
these intising euils, soares aloft,
and taking the winges of contemplation,
thinkes of the ioyes
of Heauen, the paines of Hell,
his owne Death, and the Death
of the Sonne of God, for the
saluation of vs all: with Daniel,
strawes ashes or thoughtes of
his earthly beeing, to descry the
steps of Death, who stealeth along
and eateth to the continuance
of our dayes: or like a skillfull
Pilot, who often sits at the
Sterne, lookes vnto the Stars,
and Planets, beares off from the
shelues of many daungerous occasions,

so much admire amongst men, as
Christ said, of the buildinges of

                  qui
fuerunt ante vos, said our Sauior
to his disciples, the Prophets of
old dranke of the same cuppe, all
suffered. From this annoyance
we may come vnto the domesticall
or home troubles within our
selues,Gen. 16. 4 where olde Adam, or nature,
like Hagar the bond woman
is verie disdainfull towards her
mistresse Sarah: to witte, infused
grace, where the rebellious appetites
conspire against the regiment
of reason, where our will
like another Eue is stil prouoking
vs to reach after the forbidden
fruit,Rom. 6. 12 where sinne like Tarquinius
the proud, would tyrannise &
vsurpe a perpetual Dictatorship,
did not the regenerate like men
of courage and constancie cast
him out of his kingdome. And
thus labouring to bring all to
that seemely Monarchy of Gods
spirit, no small labor and trauell
is vndertaken. In pleasing men

wee often incurre a greater losse
by displeasing God: by pleasing
God (which is best of all) we often
times displease men. So
which way soeuer wee cast our
eies, wee see and find that of the
wise man verified:Ecclesiast. 4. 1. 2. 3 
                  Great trauell
is created for all men: and a heauie
yoake for the sonnes of Adam,
from the day that they come out
of their mothers wombe, to the
day that they returne to the earth
the mother of all thinges: from
him that sitteth in the glorious
throne, vnto him that is beneath
in earth and ashes. This being
the estate of all in general, sinners
corrected, sonnes chastened, nay
the euill themselues much tossed
and turmoiled, they that worship
the beast (saith S.
                  Apoc. 14▪ 11. 
                  Iohn) haue
no rest day nor night, as they
haue not who make an idoll of
sensual pleasure. Looke how many
vices, so many furies is wont
to haunt the licentious liuers.
But the good, who onely haue
their trials, and are proued with
Simon of Cyrene,
                  Math. 27. 32. euery one with
his crosse must bee content to accompany

Christ vnto his kingdome.
Manifolde troubles are
incident to all, but in more special
manner vnto those who are going
from the dirt and mire of Egypt,
to doe sacrifice to God,Exo. 8. 25 who
will bring them into a good land,
the remembrance whereof may
make them wish with Dauid, that
they had wings like a Doue, and
so flying they might come to rest.

of Babilon,

sing them a song. Alas,
what song could they sing, being
so sorrowfull captiues as they
were? Here we are flying before
many Iezabels. Heere wee sit in

subiect vnto moisture?Lu. 15. 14▪

farre country is full of penury
and sorrow, no plenty, no musicke,
vntill we returne vnto our
Fathers house. While we are on
this side Iordan, wee are amidst
many trials, and to say trueth,
we may looke for no other. Wee

finde that of S. Austen true, Quid

                  nisi diu torqueri?
What is it to liue long, but to be
long troubled? Wee reade that
Noahs Dooue, at her first flight
from the Arke, (well shee might
mount aloft) fetcht many retires,
but shee could haue no resting
place,Gen. 8. 9 vntill Noah opened the
window of the Arke, to receiue
her in againe: so the poore soule
may soare a time, by lifting vp
many a sigh▪ and supplication
vnto God, who at last doth open
the window of his heauenlye
Arke; and then, but not before,
shee hath sure footing, to rest for
euer. Those good men, saith the
Apostle S. Paul,
                  Heb. 11 38. in the eleuenth to
the Hebrewes, of whome sometimes
the bad worlde was vnworthy,
wandred vp and downe,
in sheepes skinnes, in deserts, as
men forelorne, shewing euidently,
that their glory was not of
this worlde, where they founde
so sorry acceptance, and therefore
had their hope ful of immortality,
hoping for a reward to
come. Now therefore, seeing in

this state of life,2. Cor. 11. 26. all is so troublesome;
enemies at home, enemies
abroade, perils on euery
side: a Christian Meditation of
our departure from this world,
may tell vs, All will one day be
better. That wee shoulde not
thinke of our continuance here,
we see this life to be onely a pilgrimage:
That we should not
take the way for our country, or
thinke of setting vp our rest.
where our state is so

where wee haue much
Wormewood, but little Hoonny:
more motiues to reade the Lamentations
of Ieremy, then wee
haue to sing the Songs of Salomon.
God would haue it so,
that we should looke for an other
home, and hope for a better rest.

quicken a little our weary spirites,
amidst many calamities,
the lifting vp of our hartes, by a
meditation of our deliueraunce

the prison of the soule, will tell
vs of a blessed state to come,

Philosophy,
that to see the Planets,
and those superior
lightes at

mid-day, men must go downe into
some wondrous deepe pit or
well, cleane from the light of the
Horizon, where they liue. To
behold with the eye of the soule,

from the loue, and delights
of this in

                  erior world. The
people neuer tasted Manna,
                  Exod. 16 15. vntill
they were come from the Leauen
of Egipt. Our auncesters when
they saw no other but straw cottages,
they neuer minded any
farther buildinges: but when
once they beheld more seemely
mansions, they began forthwith
to dislike that, which before was
very acceptable vnto them. Whilest
wee set our affections on
earthly thinges, wee seeke for no

                     •
                  ter, we looke no higher: but
once taking a taste of heauenly,
we beginne to dislike that, which
before was very acceptable vnto
vs, and grow out of liking with
the meanesse of our former des

And therefore as Zacheus,
so long as he abode in the presse,Luc. 19. 3
was vpon the low ground to see

                  Christ, vntill he gate him vp into
the figge tree: so while we are
in the route of too many worldly
affaires, wee are too low, and
therefore should get vp into the
sweete Figge-tree, or contemplation
of heauenly things: that
there and thence, we may see the
ioy of Israell, or excellency of the
life to come.Gen. 13 17. God saide vnto Abraham,
arise, and walke about
this lande, this is the country
that I will giue thee. God sayes
vnto Faith, arise, beholde thy
heauenly inheritance. that is the
city where thou shalt haue thy
blessed abode for euer. Seafaring
men, hauing bene long weatherbeaten
in the surging and daungerous
Seas, are wont to shout
for ioy, when they do discry their
hauen. Ioyfully may the Christian
behold a farre off, after the
manifold stormes of this world,
his heauenly & euerlastinge harborough,
the remembrance where
of may mooue vs, either to wish
with S. Paule,
                  Phil. 1. 23 to be dissolued, and

Saintes in the Apocalips vnto him

in teares, there is the place, wher
we shall reape in ioy. Here we
are members of the church militant,
where is nothing but combatting:
there shall wee be parts
of the Church triumphāt, where
is no other but reioycinge. The
state of the life present, and to
come, is figured by the Tabernacle,
and Temple of the old Testament:1. Sam. 6 3.
the Tabernacle, for that
it was mooueable, may resemble
the condition of the life present:1. King. 2. 3.
the Temple, for that it was fixt,
and immoueable, the fruition of
the life to come. To the framing
of the Tabernacle, came the Iewes
onely: but to the buildinge of the
Temple, with the inhabitants of
Iewry, the men of Tyre and Sydon,
to wit, both Iewes and Gentiles:
all concurre in this building,
wherein is neuer heard, the
noyse of a hammer.Psal. 84 4.

That which wee call life,
is a kinde of death, because it
makes vs to die: but that which

a very life: for that indeede it
makes vs to liue. There is a
death, which some call mortall
sinne, and this is the death of the
Soule, which death wee should
all feare. There is also a moderate
feare of the other death,

which is profitable to withdraw
vs from the allurements of euill.

Wherefore though Death doe

who vanquished the power of

aduantage, and a gentle guide,
that bringes them home to euerlasting

dying they are said since Christes
resurrection to fall asleepe. They
that sleepe in Iesus, saith the Apostle,
they lay them downe,1. Thess. 4. 13. and
take their rest, and God it is, that
makes them dwell in euerlasting
safety. We should not then feare
to fall a sleepe, for sleepe is a refreshinge
after wearysome labours.

we rest from all the trauels of
a toile some life. Againe, where
as death is a tribute, wee must
all pay homage.Chrisost. Homel. 10 in Math.

quod futurum est necessarium,
& offeramus Deo pro
munere, quod pro debito tenemur
reddere, Let vs make that

voluntary, which is necessary,
and yeeld it to God as a gifte,
which we stand bound to pay
as a due debt. Had we no farther
hope, then onely to attaine
a state temporall, wee might
feare indeede, because when we
die, all our happinesse shall deceiue
vs: but when God made
man of the dust of the ground.
God breathed into him,Gen. 2. 7 the
breath of life, and man was
made a liuing soule, therefore
not a dying soule. Cesar writeth,
that the bare opinion of
the Druides,
                  Cas. lib. de Bel. Gal. who taught that
the soules had a continuance
after their separation from
their bodies, it made many of
their followers hardy, in great
attemptes, and abated in most,
the feare of death. Cyrus himselfe
could say vnto his children,
when hee was ready to
die: Thinke not deere children,
that I shalbe no where or nothing.
If a baresupposall of a
future beeing, could so much

auaile against the feare of
death: what doth faith effect
that doth warrant vs by good
euidence, of the blessed assurance
of the resurrection? If Abraham
the faithfull Patriarke,Gen. 12. 4
left his owne country
and kindred at the commaundement
of almighty God, and
went into a strange land, how
willingly should wee leaue this
country, wherein we are only
strangers; and goe, where wee
haue our owne home, and abode
for euer? This was the
resolution of S. Ambrose: who
neither loathed life, nor feared
to die, because saith hee, wee
haue a good Lord. This was
the faith of Simeon,
                  L
                        ••
                      2. 29 who hauing
seene Christ, prayed to depart
in peace. This was S.
Paules gaine, when he said,Phi. 1. 21. 
                  To
die is to me aduantage: because
this passage was a dissolution,
and this dissolution was to bee
from the body, and this his being
from the body, was to bee

with Christ. Seeing therefore
that death it selfe, being duely
considered, should nothing at
all dismay vs, then much lesse
the meditation thereof. The
more we meditate of death, the
lesse wee feare it; the lesse wee
feare it, the more faith haue
wee. What shall seperate vs
from the loue of God,
                  Ro. 8. 35 
                  that is in
Christ? shall tribulation, or anguish?
shall life or death? Blessed
be God, saith S. Peter,

hath begotten vs to a liuely

                     SAlomon, whome
GOD for wisedome
chose as it
were to be a forman
of a great
Enquest, to make enquiry of
the state of the world, to come
foorth, to speake for all, and
his conscience of all, hauing
heard and seene the nature of
thinges vnder the Sunne;
yeeldes vp his verdite of all, as
thus,Eccl. 2. 11 
                  All is vanitie, and vexation
of minde. This is in briefe
the condition of all in generall.
The rich discontented in honors,
the poore languishing in
griefe, the learned full of restlesse

labours, all of what estate
soeuer, subiect vnto troubles
and vexation of mind. As if
Salomon should haue said, you
may looke for no other, all is
vexation. Small cause had
the Israelites, to care for their
continuance amongest the
Taske-masters of Egipt, and
as small cause, haue any to desire
to liue in this wildernesse,
amongst many wolues. Wee
know, Christ our Sauiour
hath told vs,Iohn. 15 19. that beeing in the
world, we are not of ye world:
here we may not looke for perfect
rest of body, or all contentment
of minde: and therefore
to meditate of deliuerance, may
bee some refreshing to the distressed
soule, who may powre
out her complaintes, saying,
Would to God that day might
once shine, when I shall see my
Redeemer. When I shall come
where is peace, within and
without, when I shall appeere
before the presence of God,

with ioy, and bee no more oppressed
with griefes, disturbed
with cares, molested with
thoughtes, but liue and rest for
euer. What comfort can a man
reape▪ or what quiet should hee
take, where want is miserable,
plenty full of peril? which way
soeuer wee cast our eyes, wee
finde cause of complainte, that
we may well count Laughter,
                  Eccles. 2. 2
                  error, and subscribe to that of
the Prophet, Lord,
                  Psal. 88. 125. 
                  thy terrors
haue I suffered from my youth
vpward, with a troubled minde.
Hauing then so little cause to
ioy in this life, where there is
so small a cause to make vs reioyce:
where the minde is so
inuested with cares, and molested
with griefes, wee may recount
with our selues, the happinesse
of them, who after the
stormes of this troublesome
sea, haue cast anker, in their safest
roade. Noah had much molestation
in the old world,Gen. 8. 4 hee
had the waters swelling vnder

him,Genes. 19 17. the heauens darke & gloomy
ouer him. At last the Arke
stayed vpon the mountaines of
Ar
                        ••
                     at. and then was Noah a
glad man. Lot was grieued
amongst the sinfull Sodomites,
at last God sent his Aungels
to take him cleane away. Elias
mourned for a time, sate vnder
the Iuniper tree, sent vp his
sighes to heauen,1. Kin. 19 at last came
the charriot, and then there
was no more Iesabell to persecute
him, no more false Prophets
to band themselues against
him.Apo. 6. 10 The Saintes vnder
the▪ Altar may for a time
cry, How long Lord Iesus: after
a little more sufferinge, their
disgrace shall be turned into
glory, their mournefull teares,
into gladsome triumph:Ps. 42. 11. 
                  Why
art thou so vexed O my soule,
and why art thou so disquieted
within me? O put thy trust in
God. In the multitude of my
sorrowes (saith the same Prophet,)
that were in my hart, thy

comforts (Lord) haue refreshed
my soule. Thereby shewing,Ps. 94. 29
that as the world had a multitude
of sorrowes to assault his
hart, so God had a multitude
of comfortes to refresh his
soule amongest them all. For as
our sufferinges in Christ doe abound,
so our consolations also
in Christ do abound t

                  th
S. Paule. Our Sauiour, knowing
that his Apostles should
haue many, and great discomfortes
in the world,Ioan. 1. 4 16. promiseth
to send them after his Ascention
vp into heauen, an other
comforter: for his presence
was their com
                     •
                  ort, and afterward
in their deepest prisons,
they should haue the holy
Ghost their fellow prisoner: &
howsoeuer the world did outwardly
annoy them, yet they
should inwardly haue a comforter
to make them reioyce in
their sufferinges, and after all
to reioyce for euer. Now therfore
though the burden be heauie,

yet a lightsomenesse it is,
to remember, the way is not
long. When the Apprentise
cals to minde that his yeares
of couenant will now shortly
expire, and that then hee shall
haue his freedome confirmed,
the remembrance hereof maketh
many laborsome workes
seeme more light, and lesse grieuous
vnto him. The poore
Traueller in thinking of his
Inne, goes on more cheerefully
in his painefull iourney.
The bondman in callinge to
minde the yeare of Iubilee,
is wont with more patience,
to goe through the yeares of
bondage. Now then amidst
the sondry afflictions that
grieue the minde, a Meditation
of our ende, may much
mittigate, if not altogether
take away the greatest sorrowes
of all;Ps. 32. 19 
                  Many are the
troubles of the righteous, but
the Lord deliuereth them out
of all: And taketh either sorrowes

from them, or them
from sorrowes. Great are
their trials, but saluation w
                     •

one day make amendes, when
they shall haue all teares wiped
from their eyes: and their
reward by so much the more
ioyous, by how much the more
the course of their life hath
beene grieuous vnto them.
Seeing therefore, that on euery
side, wee haue such vrgent
occasion, to passe the dayes of
this wearysome Pilgrimage in
trouble, and pensiuenesse of
minde, may wee not thinke
them thrise blessed, who are
now landed on the shoare of
perfect Securitie, and deliuered
from the burden of so toilesome
a labour? May wee not
bee refreshed, in calling to
minde, that this battaile will
one day beat an ende, and wee
freed from the thorowes of all
these bitter calainities? well
may we weepe and mourne, as
Iob and Ieremy, in consideration

of our entraunce into
this vale of teares, and often
may wee muse with gladnesse,
of the time of our departure.
After all sorrowes, and those
threatning voyces, A voyce wil
come from the throane,

                  when

God, to looke vpon the desolation
of his people, and to shew
mercy in ridding them from
all. When wee see and feele,
what is, and still will bee the
condition in this our Babilon:
                  
griefes of body, and afflictions
of minde. wee may in our
highest deuotion to God, call
to

                  ,
and our good deliuery
from all. Yea, we may consider,
that there will come a day,
when the

                  e crased bodies, subiect
to seuerall infirmities, as,
the Head to megrimmes; the
Lunges to suffocations; the
Iointes to gowtes; the stronger
partes themselues to convulsions:
when these bodies I
say, which haue holpen to beare
the burthen of the day, shall
with the happy soule liue together,
and reioyce together.
In the meane season, wee may
remember in all these infirmities,
that of the Prophet,Psal. 94. 14. 
                  The
Lord will not faile his people,
neither will he forsake his inheritance.
Dauid knew it was
Gods manner to trie his seruauntes,
&c. therefore in his
afflictions, made this protestation
of himselfe and them;

though all this come vpon vs,
yet will not wee forsake thee.
It is our Isaaks vse, first to
feele vs by tribulation,Psal. 44. 18. and
then to blesse vs: by these infirmities
of the body, wee may
consider Gods feeling. Now
after we haue suffered a little,
then Take a blessing my sonne.
                  Gen. 27 23.
Though the wind blow colde,
yet dooth it cleanse the good
graine: though the fire burne

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   so are they also

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   both sufferings and
instructions. For these afflictions
doe often cause an vtter
contempt of all worldly pleasure,
humblenesse of minde, penitency
and sorrow of hart, for
sinnes passed.Psal. 137 1. 2. In the hundreth
and seauen and thirtieth
Psalme, the peoples captiuity
is thus mentioned, Super flumina
Babilonis, by the waters
of Babilon, wee sate downe and
wept, in the verse following,

                  As for our Harpes, wee hanged
them vp vpon the trees that are
therenigh: We sate downe, a token
of their humility; and
wept, a signe of sorrow and
penitency: as for Harpes we
hanged them vp, which shewed
they were now very farre
from mirth and melody. All
the life of Salomon was full of
prosperity, and therefore wee
finde, that Salomon did much
forget God: but the whole life
of Dauid hath much aduersity,
and therefore we see by his penitentiall
Psalmes, and others,
that Dauid did much remember
God. These chasti

punished, which is the
body, that the better parte of

we neede no more, but lay open
our griefes, and let him alone
with the saluing, who knowes
better then our selues, how
best to ounce vs, though the
potion bee sharpe, yet it is his,
whose intent is, to do vs good,
whose loue in chasteninge wee
may not refuse. Chrisostome
could say, Magna tentatio non
tentari, A great temptation is
it, not to be tempted at all. Iob
was a righteous man, by the
testimony of him, whose testimony
was most true. What
saist thou to my seruant Iob, an
vpright man, and iust man, one
that feareth God? The next
newes wee heare of him,Iob. 1. 8. 
                  Iob
is afflicted in body, from the
crowne of the head, to the soule
of the foote. You haue heard

(saith S. Iames) of the patience
of Iob, and what end God made
with him.
                  Iam. 5. 11 The holy man was
tempted, that when wee are
tried, to teach vs what wee
should doe. S. Ierome, hauing
read the life and death of Hilarion,
who after hee had liued
religiously, died most Christianly,
said: Well, Hilarion shall
be the champion, whome I
will follow. If S. Ierome
could say, Hilarion should bee
the champion whom he would
follow: If chaste men may
say, Ioseph shall be the champion
whome we will follow:
Then may afflicted men say for
true patience, Iob shall be the
champion whome we will follow.
Toby after that deede of
mercy, in burying the deade,
was accepted of God, the next
tydinges we heare of Toby,
is,Tob. 2. 10. the holy man Toby is striken
blinde. To suffer some
chastisementes, wee may bee
contente: for respectinge our

sinnes, God by these afflictions
doth lay but a soft hand
vpon vs. It was an auncient

thereof is pleasant. When S.
Iohn asked the Aungell what
they were that appeared in
long white garmentes, with
Palmes in their handes: the
Aungell aunsweared,Apo. 7. 14 
                  These
are those that came out of many
tribulations in the world. To
shew after the stormes of a
troublesome life, they weare
Palmes & crownes, in token
of euerlasting triumph. There
is a threefolde consideration
that may mooue in vs matter
of meditation to this effecte:

The first, Quid fuimus, what
we once were: The seconde,
Quid 
                        •
                     umus, what we now are:
The third, Quid e
                        ••
                     mus, what
after a short space we shalbe.
What we once were, is shewed
by that of Esdras,
                  2. Esd. 7 
                  O Adam
(saith he) what hast thou done?
When Adam fell, wee all fell.
If the estate of man had beene
without sinne mans estate had
beene as the Aungels in heauen.
Salomon in his princely
seate, was clothed in greate
royalty, and yet Salomon, in
all his royalty, was not clothed
like the Lillies of the Fielde.
But neither Salomon in all
his royalty, nor the Lillies of
ye Field, was euer so clothed, as
was Adam beefore hee lost the
clothing of innocency. O happy
Adam, if Adam had well
considered so much. Wherefore
as the people, in the time of the
Prophet Aggee,
                  Agg. 3. 4 beholdinge
the forme of the Temple, how
farre inferior it was vnto the

former glory thereof, might in
effect sorrow, when they saw
the one, and remembred the other.
In like manner, when
wee call to minde the state of
innocency, wherein GOD
made all thinges for man, and
man for himselfe, (in that
wonderfull excellency) placed
him in Paradise, a Garden of
all delightes, subiect neither to
griefe of body, or vexation of
minde. Wee cannot but with
some sorrow for sinne, bethinke
our selues of that former felicity,
and in the first place, Quid

                        •
                     uimus, what wee once were.
For the second consideration,
Quid sumus, what wee now
are, euen soiourners in this
vale of teares, exiles from our
natiue home, where troubles
come like Iobs messengers, no
sooner one hath tolde his tale,
but another steps in, to say as
much: where men are beset
with crosses and calamities
round about, the feeling wherof

may mooue vs to breake
foorth into that desire of the
Apostle,Ro. 17. 
                        •
                     4 
                  Who shall deliuer vs
from these bodies of death?
Cato the wise, a Heathen man,
could tell his Schollers, that
were he offered to be young againe,
he would in no case accept
of such an offer, so wearysome
is the condition of our
estate present. For that future
state, Quid crimus, what we
shalbe, when these drossie bodies
shalbe chaunged, and made
like the glorious body of the
Sonne of God,Phil. 3. 21 to which bodies
God in mercy saith, as
sometimes vnto Abraham, For
Ismaell I will blesse him also:
so of these bodies in their resurrection,
though as Ismaell,
they are not so free borne, as
Isaacke the Soule, yet shall
they haue a blessing too. A
Christian remembrance hereof,
doth make vs desire wyth
longing,Prou. 13. 42. aperfection els where.
Hope (saith Salomō) that is deferred,

doth afflict the minde.
In the meane season, considering
that God is at the last the
rewarder of patience, and death
the finisher of paine, it may
make vs the more cheer
                     •
                  fully
to passe ouer the gretest griefes
of body, and afflictions of
minde whatsoeuer, which afflictions
in this life are testimonies
of Gods loue, but in
the life to come, signes of his
iustice. It is the wont of Fathers,
to holde in their owne
children, when they suffer the
children of bondmen, to goe
loosely as they list. God that
keepes an inheritance for his,
after his rod in correcting, hee
hath a staffe of stay and comfort.
Wherefore wee may reckon
these trials, as harbingers
to warne vs before hand
of deathes comming, as testimonies
of Gods care ouer vs,
as schoolemoisters towardes
our ende, to teach vs this lesson
of learning to Die. If God
                  
(saith S. Ierom) had promised vs
all peace and quiet both in this
world,
                  Ieron. de Consol. in aduers. 
                  & in the world to come,
then our troubles here might amaze
vs, and make vs doubt of
our future rest: but finding by
proofe, the manifolde tribulations
of the life present, we may
expect with comfort, the promise
of the time to come. If a
Heathen man could say, when
he saw a suddaine shipwrack of
all his worldly wealth, all lost
in a momēt: Wel Fortune I see
thy intent, thou wouldest haue
me bee a Philosopher: how
much more may the Christian
man say, after the many and
manifold afflictions in minde,
and body: well I see that God
would haue me euen to become
religious, and to enter into a
meditation of the life that is
freed of all.

dissolution.
               
               
                  SEing that our
good or bad estate
in the life
to come, depēds
much vpon the
qualitie or condition
of the life present. (for
where the tree falleth there it
lieth) and our passage in order
is from the life of grace,Eccl. 11. 3 vnto
the life of glory: they see
but little, that perceiue not
how greatly it concerneth euery
Christian, in time of best
health, while hee hath yet day
before him, to set forward in
a prouident course; that so in
the coole of the euening, he may

arriue at the porte of euerlasting
rest. The dayes of man
are but short, his time vncertaine,
that little moment, wee
haue, to prouide for a state of
all continuance, is runne ouer
before wee are aware: Gods
mercy in giuing vs time and
grace, passeth a long, as a
pleasaunt riuer if wee stoppe
the course thereof, by our continuance
in sinne, it will arise
high and turne into iustice, and
beare them downe by force, &
ouerthrow our securest repose
in this worlde. That which
once, and neuer but once, is
done, should bee aduisedly begun,
carefully prosecuted, and
most seriously laboured with
all industry vnto the end. It is
the counsell of the holy Ghost:Gal. 6. 10.
                  Do good while ye haue time.
The place of making attonement
with our aduersary,Mat. 5. 25 is
while wee are in the way. No
preparing oyle in our Lampes,Math. 25. 8.
no entringe with, the Bridegroome:

no running, no crowning.
For a sure rule is it with
God, Do well, and haue well.
Liue the life of the righteous,
and die the death of the righteous.
If any aske (saith) Lactantius)
whether death bee
good or euill, my aunsweare is,
Looke vnto the condition of
the life present, which if it be
passed ouer in vertue, O well is
thee, and happy shalt thou be:
if otherwise, the case is altered,
Mors peccatorum pessima,
                  Psal. 34 22. the
death of sinners is worst of all.
For why, they passe ouer their
dayes, saith Iob,
                  Iob. 21, 13 in great iollity,
and suddainely fall into a
sea of miseries. Because wee
know not the day, wee should
watch euery day: because wee
know not the hower, wee
should watch euery hower. We
see that in matters of waight,
foresight and deliberation is
wont to bring them better to
passe. The husbandman will
take his season, the Souldier

will watch his fittest time: euery
one will cast the best way
to compasse the businesse hee
hath in hande: and shall the
Christian man be altogether
carelesse and negligent, in preparing
himselfe for his departure?
God forbid. It is the
Wise mans wise counsell, Ante
languorem adhibe medicinam,
ante iudicium interroga teipsum,
Before thy languishing
griefe, consult of the medicine.
before iudgement, examine thy
selfe. The Prophet Dauid expressing
the prouident care, and
carefull prouidence of an holy
man, saith,Psal 33. 6 
                  Orabit ad te in
tempore oportuno, Hee shall
pray vnto thee in a time conuenient,
or remember thee O
Lorde, in a time when thou
maist bee found. The seruants
that saide in their hartes, the
master dooth deferre his comming,
the master of those seruantes
shall come in a time
they thincke not of, and giue

them their portion, where shalbe
weeping and gnashing of
teeth. But happy are those
seruantes, who attend his returne:
these are those, that
make all cleane and handsome
                     •
                  
these are those that sometimes
looke foorth, sit as Abraham, at
the entrance of the Tabernacle:
these are those, who haue
their loynes girt, their lampes
burning, their oyle ready, and
waite with the wise virgins,
for the Bridegromes coming:
these are those, whome their
Lord shall finde, sic facientes,
so dooing, and therefore make
them rulers ouer much, take
them by the handes, and bring
them to the participation of euerlasting
ioy. That menne
would well prepare themselues
in time, while they are
their owne men, they shall
one day finde the benefite of
this carefulnesse. To him
that passeth through darke
places▪ one light carried before

him, will doe him more good,
then many, that are brought
after. For him that vndertaketh
a long iourney, abuise beforehād
wil stand him in stead.
Of this spirituall voyage, the
vowe of the Prophet should be
the vow, and resolution of euery
particular man, by the
assistance of Gods grace,Psa. 39. 1 
                  Dixi
custodiam vias meas, I said, I
will take heede vnto my
wayes. I religious preparation
in time, woulde doe
men more good, then they are
aware. Christ wepte for the
men of Ierusalem, whiche
would not weepe for themselues,Lu. 29. 41
and all was because
they knew not the thinges
that did belonge vnto their
peace. Antiochus after his many
iniuries 
                     •
                  ffered vnto the
people of the Iewes,1. Mach. 6. 12. 13 and vnto
the temple of God it selfe,
taking sacriligiously frō thence
the ornamentes appointed for
Gods seruice, when the Lord

called him to aunsweare the
cause at his owne consistory, he
could then wish hee had neuer
medled with sacred goods onely
consecrated ad pios vsus. to
Church, to godly vses. When
Pharao saw the Sea ready to
swallow him, hee could then no
doubt be sorry, that euer hee
had wronged poore innocents,
and oppressed Gods owne portion.
When sleepe is gone from
their eyes, and rest from their
tossed beds, then many may
wish, that they had vsed lesse
oppression then they haue, that
they had fasted often with the
Apostle,2. Cor. 11. 27 prayed with Daniell,
                  Dan. 9. 21
wept with Mary Magdalen,
                  Luc. 7. 38
liued in meane estate, and so
haue feared God, rather then
to haue inioyed the pleasures
of sinne for a season, which
they find to be ful of bitternesse
at the last.Pro. 1. 28 
                  These thinges should
be considered in time, and here
is the time. They shall seeke
me, saith Wisedome, speaking

of negligent sinners, but they
shall not finde mee, and why?
because they seeke when it is
too late. The foolish virgins
may call,Mat. 25 11. 12. Lord, Lord: but when
the Bridegroome is past, and
that mild countenance of Christ
turnd away, the woefull plight
of these virgins shalbe such, as
it were inough to breake their
hearts with sorrow, and such
sorrow, which shall neuer cease
to wound their very distressed
soules. Had wee not need,
then in a case of such importance,
to stande euermore ready,
by a serious preparation
for our ende, to hold vs fast in
the feare of God, and to waxe
olde therein,Eccl. 2. 6. as Syrach counselleth
vs. Moreouer, our cō

Tabernacle? Doe not many

escaped, in the middest of hatefull
enemies, to yeeld by so
weake a meanes, whether they
would or no. Many good
friendes oftentimes in the

worlde, shake handes at partinge,
and wee see their nexte
meeting is at heauen. Wherefore
when wee keepe our solemne
assemblies, we had neede
keepe them religiously minded,
for we know not whether wee
shall euer keepe them any more.
When wee make our humble
repentance to God, wee had
neede doe it sincerely in deede:
Sathan hee is busie, because his
time is short, and therefore his
wrath is the fiercer. But wee
remembring the continuance
of time, should vse all diligence,
and therefore our care should
be the greater to preuent the
subtile Serpent. The Church
doth pray, and that in most
Christian manner too, that the
faithfull may be deliuered from
suddaine death. And surely
great cause hath the sober
Christians man to desire rather
leysurely to yeelde himselfe
to God, then to bee taken in a
moment from the society of

men. To haue a good departure
out of the worlde, may bee a
good mans prayer, and to close
vp the course of life, with a
treatable dissolution, is that
faire Christian ende wee may
all beg at the handes of God.

                  Bernard. de consid. ad Eug. lib. 3. 
                  sed qualis
fueris, consider not so much
what thou art, as what thou
shalt be: What is become of
all Adams posterity, for these
many hundred yeares passed?
excepting a remnant that must
shortly follow after, are they
not all gone? Moyses mentioning
the age of those who liued
before the floud (when as
yet the dayes of man were of
more continuance then they
are) saith:Gen. 5. 8. 20. 27. 
                  All the dayes of Seth
were nine hundreth and twelue
yeares, and hee died. All the
dayes of Iered were nine hundreth
sixty and two yeares, and
he died. All the dayes of Methushelah
were nine hundreth
sixty and nine yeares, and hee
died, that same, & mortuus est,
and he died, will yere long, bee
the clause appliable to vs all.
In the meane season we reade

deere friends; we see many, as
those on whom the Tower in
Siloa fell) gone in a moment,Luc. 23. 4
warninges sufficient, if warninges
will serue to make vs
liue prepared for our ende.
Carelesse men (saith one) are
not vnlike dissolute seruitors
in princes courts, who hauing
their allowance of lights, spend
them out in riot, and so at last
are faine to go to bed darkling:
prouident Christians haue a
foresight to thinke of the time
to come, consider this transitorie
estate will haue an end, and
therefore prepare for an other
world, where they may haue a
stay or perpetuity of rest. Now

charge may iustly moue vs all
to bee carefull indeed. Howe
much therfore it concerneth vs
in time of health to prouide for

another world, euery one doth
see we haue not two souls, that
wee may hazard one. God willed
his people vpon their passage
out of Egypt to haue their
loines girt,Exod. 12. 12. their staues in their
handes, their shooes on their
feete, that there might be no let
when the time of their deliuery
should come: wee know not
how soone God will sende vs
from this Egypt: Iesus Christ
graunt we may keepe our Pasouers
with soules prepared to
bee gone. Who so feareth the
Lord (saith the Wise man) it
shall go well with him at the last,
                  Eccles. 1. 13.
                  and hee shall find fauour in the
day of his death.
               
            
            
               
               The Tenth Chapter.
               
                  Wherein is shewed the maner of
preparing, or the state and condition
of life, wherein the christian
man should stand prepared
for death.
               
               
                  THe meane then to
die the death of y•
righteous, is firll
to liue the life of
the righteous.
The meane to sit with Abraham,
is here to walke with Abraham:
for God hath appointed
a vertuous life to go in order
before the great reward of
eternall life, not as the cause,
but as the consequent of our
blessed righteousnesse in Christ
our Sauiour: What remameth
but to frame the premises as
we would fine the conclusion.
To sow, as we would one day

reape, for those that will lie
soft, must make their bed thereafter,
and to liue the life wee
hope to liue, is in a generalitie
here to liue religiously. The old
Christians made the worlde to
reade in their liues, that they
did beleeue in their hearts, and
Heathen men to say this is a
good God,Iustin. Mart. whose seruants are
so good. Therefore, then this
godly and holy conuersation of
life, what better state for a
Christian man to stand in, euer
prepared sor his end? Was not
that a memorable protestation
of Samuel,
                  1. Sam. 12. 3. when before his
death, in the presence of all the
people, he declared as thus, his
integritie of life: Behold here I
am, beare recorde of me before
the Lord and his anointed. As
if he should haue said, giue me

I done wrong? The peoples replie
in effect was, now God be
with thee good Samuel, to whō
                  
thou art going, and so with
mournfull heartes they gaue
him this testimonie at parting.
That of Saint Paul when hee
tooke his farewell of the men
of Ephesus,
                  Act. 20. 26. 37. who wept abundantly
for the words he spake,
being chiefly sorie they should
see his face no more. I take you
to recorde this day, I am pure
from the blood of al men, I haue
couered no mans siluer or gold.
After so good a life, was not
this a good farewell? That of
Simeon a iust man,Luc. 2. 19 one that

                     •
                  eared God, and waited for the
consolation of Israel, who imbracing
Christ, prayed to depart
in peace. O good life (saieth
an ancient father) what a
ioy art thou in time of distres?
It made the some father neither
ashamed to liue any longer,Poss. de Amb.
because hee had liued honestly,
nor afraid to die, because
he had a good Lord. Plutarch
writeth of Pericles,
                  Plutar. in Gita Peric. that he neuer
caused man to weare sorrowfull

attire, he was so harmlesse.
And of Lysander, that hee
was more honoured after his
death then euer he had beene in
all his life,Plut. in vit. Lysand. hee was so vertuous.
But the Wise man speaking
of the seruants of God,
who passed through the darkenesse
of this world with lamps
in their liues, which did both
light themselues and others.
The righteous (saith he) are had
in a perpetuall remembrance,
                  Eccles. 44. 14.
                  their bodies are buried in peace,
but their name liueth for euermore.
For such is the power of
vertue, as it makes men, not
onely honoured when they are
aliue, but also when they are
dead, and it is wont to take
them out of their graues, and
cause them to liue in the mention
of long posteritie, hauing
their names registred and inrolled
with the Saints of heauen.
These stood euermore vpon
their departure, hauing that
heauenly treasure of a good

conscience, hauing peace and
tranquilitie of mind. When the
euill are tossed, saith the Prophet
Esai, as the raging waxes
of the sea, their name perisheth,
saith the Wise man as if
they neuer had beene. Thus the
innocent life like the watchfull
seruant openeth the doore gladly,
when his maister knocketh:
but the riotous seeketh corners,
being ashamed to be seene:
the one is quit by a ioyfull proclamation,
the other found guiltie
at the barre of his own conscience.
He that will say with
the Apostle,Phil. 1. 
                  Mors mihi lucrum,
Death is to mee aduauntage,
must liue with the Apostle,

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   
                  Omni
bona conscientia,
                  Act. 23. 1. 2. with all good
conscience. Thus much ingenerall
of preparing our selues for
the time of our dissolution, in
particular, to come nearer
home, the applying of himselfe
to Faith, Hope, and Charitie, is
that Christian estate wherein

the seruant of God once setled,
need not to feare,Ps. 128. 5 
                  To speak with
his enemies in the gate. Faith is
the staffe wherevpon we stay
both in life & eath: the which
faith telles vs, that God thorough
Christ is become our
welfare. By faith we are blessed,Gal. 3. 4.

Christ crucified put out. But
will the true Giliadites yeelde
to such a condition? No, not
for ten thousand worlds of riches.
Haue we any thing to do
at the throne of God in heauen,
there wee haue but two pleas,
the one of innocencie, the other
of mercie? Faith bids boldly
pleade the plea of mercy, and
tels vs the iudge is reconciled.
What shall sepearte vs once

loue of God in Christ Iesus?
Shall powers,

thinges present, or thinges to
come? no, neither life,Rom. 8. 8. nor
death. What manner of faith
Christ commendeth in the
Gospell, wee reade by that of
Mary Magdalene, who after
sorrowing and weeping f
                     •
                  r her
sines, Christ tels her: Thy
faith hath made thee whole:
                  Luc. 7. 50 as
if he shold haue said; Mary, this
weeping, this repenting faith
is faith indeed. When hee had
seene the religious duetie of the

                  Samaritan, that came backe to
giue God praise, and fel downe
at Christes feete, he faith vnto
him also;Lu. 17. 19 
                  Thy faith hath made
thee whole: as if this humble faith,
this religious faith is a
sauing faith: Go in peace. The
blind man that cried.Lu. 18. 42 
                  Sonne of
Dauid haue mercy vppon mee.
And being reproued would not
leaue Mercie, vntil he obtained
Mercie: Christ said to him as
to the former, thy faith hath
made thee whole, as if this
praying faith of thine is a good
faith: Receiue thy sight. What
made many old Saints to endure
bondes and imprisoment,
to bee stoned, to bee hewen a
sunder?Heb. 11. 37. it was faith (saith the
Apostle.) This was no pals
                     •
                  e
faith, but firme and constant
vnto the end, that comforts the
languishing mind, and sayes, if
we liue, we liue vnto the Lord;
it we die,Rom. 14. 8 we die vnto the Lord;
Whether we liue or die wee are
the Lords. To this faith is adioyned

                  Hope, which is called
by the holy Ghost, the Ancre of
the soule. The anker lyeth
deep, and is not seene, and yet
is the stay of all: So hope reacheth
farre,Heb. 6. 19 is of thinges vnseene,
and yet holds sure anuds
the surging waues of a boistrous
world. This hope maketh
not ashamed, abideth with
patience,Rom. 5. 5. reioyceth in afflictions,
is as S. Austen calleth it,
the very life of life. For why?
it biddes vs go comfortablie to
the throne of grace,Rom. 13. 25. and not to
refuse the chaunging of these
mortal badies, that we may receiue
them in a better resurrection.
In the third place Charitie1. The. 1. 6
the indiuisible companion
of faith may be considered.Heb. 4. 16 God
in the creation did seperate
light from darknesse; we may
not in the state of iustification
ioyne the workes of darknesse
as enuyinges; strife, and contentions,
with the light of
faith. In the second booke of

Kings, and the tenth Chapter,
When Iehonadab came to
wardes Iehu,
                  2. King. 10. 15. 
                  as if hee had some
earnest intent to be his follower,
Iehu saide, is thy hearte vpright
with mine? he aunswered, it is;
then quoth Iehu, giue mee thy
hand. Our noble Iehu, whom
God hath set vp to pull downe
the power of darknesse, sayes
to all that would professe his
name: Is your faith vpright
to me? then giue me the operations
of your hands. The children
of God, as they shal differ
from the children of this world
hereafter; so must they differ
from them here by good works,
which doe manifest themselues
by Christian charitie. Christ
sayes vnto his, as the Lord of
the vineyard said vnto them in
the market place, Quid statis oriosi,
why stand ye idle? Faith
like Rachel mourning for her
children,Mar. 2, 18. lamenteth the defecte
of good works; and saith as Sara,
giue me fruit or Idie. Our

Sauiour Christ saith to his
disciples, by this shall men
know you, whose you are,Ioan. 13. 35. 
                  In
that you loue one another.
                  Gen. 4. 5. 8. 
                  Caine
offered bad offerings, which
was a token that the loue of
God waxed colde in Caine, it
was not long after that he laid
violent hands on Abell, which
shewed that he lost withall the
loue of his neighbour.Ieron. de cons. in Aduers. 
                  But O
Caine (saith Saint Ierome) what
doest thou? what cause hast thou
of this cruel hatred and desire of
shedding innocent bloud? Quid
commeruit frater? quam vim
intulit? what hath thy brother
deserued? what violence hath he
offered? hath thy solitarie brother
displeased thee, because hee
pleased God? thou knowest not
what a losse thou shalt haue in
the misse of so good a companion.
But enuie puffes vp, blinds
the vnderstanding where it once
entreth. If you will heare how
Lamoch that was an euill man
speakes:Gen. 4. 25 
                  If 
                        •
                     aine were auenged

seuen folde, I will bee auenged
seuentie seuen fold: Here is nothing
but a mind set vpon reuenge.
But if you will heare
how Dauid the man of God
speaks,2. Sam. 9. 1. 
                  Is there any of the house
of Saul, that I may shew mercie
vnto them? He speakes of loue
and kindnes towards his verie
enemies. And so Ioseph when
hee forgaue his brethren,Gen. 50. 19. because
saith he, I my selfe am
vnder the hande of God. All
that we can, or do forgiue our
enemies, are 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , offences
or some final trespasses:Mar. 11. 25.
but that which God forgiues,
they are 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , debts of
great importance:Mat. 6. 12 we some few
pence,Luc. 18. 28. 30. he talents, and those ten
thousande too. Thrasibulus 
                  
                     •
                  
heathen man, to renew amitie
lost amongst men; made a law,

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   of forgetfulnesse of
all wronges and iniuries that
had beene offered: it is nor a
lawe of Th
                        •
                     asibulus; but of

Christ Iesus:Luc. 6. 37 
                  Forgiue and it
shall bee forgiuen you. What
hath heauen more glorious
then the vnion of the Trinitie?
What hath the earth more heauenly
then consent and vnitie?
When one riuer runneth towardes
the Ocean, it is a good
course, and goes as it should:
but when it meeteth with another
riuer, then they make a
current in deede. When the
loue of God doeth carrie vs along,
wee go well but when
this meeteth with the loue of
our neighbor, then wee set forward
with a main streame into
a sea of all blessednes. A special
meane to increase this double
loue in y• hearts of al beleeuers,
is a frequent participation of
the holy and blessed Eucharist,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
which is called of some 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
that is to say, a most necessarie
prouision for out spiritual
voyage: O blessed mysterie!
which amongst other high and
heauenly effectes, is a meane to

strengthen vs in this great
iourney, and comfort vs towardes
the ende of the way.
Thus setting our selues in order,
wee may accept of the
time whensoeuer it shall please
God, that broughts vs into the
worlde, to take vs from this
our continuance in the same.
The condition of life wherein
we may stand prepared, requires
our Christian practise:
the happinesse of this condition
wee shall finde when wee
come vnto the state of all happinesse.
            
            
               
               The eleuenth Chapter.
               
                  How the Christian man shoulde
demeane himselfe when sicknes
beginneth to grow vpon him.
               
               
                  THe first and principall
thing religiously
to bee remē
                  bred
in the beginning
of sicknes is,
that the soule do cal her selfe to
a serious account of sins passed,
of the euill committed and
the good omitted, remembring
that of the Prophet,Psal. 32. 6. 
                  Dixi quod
confitebor aduersum me iniustitiam
meam. I said I will
confesse against my selfe my
owne vnrighteousnes. Therefore,In decre. vinc.
by an auncient decree, the
sicke was enioyned before sending
for the Phisition, to
make first a contrite confession,
and humble acknowledgement

of his sinnes, as if our
sinnes were (as they often are)
the cause of our sicknesse: and
surely this decree was very respectiuely
had in vse. For God
doth oftentimes take away the
effect, when we take away the
cause or vse of sinning. Christ
hauing cured the man that lay
so many yeares by the poole
Bethesda,
                  Ioan. 5. 2. 3. and shewed no small
worke of mercie, for being
put backe at the mouing of
the water, of himselfe weake,
of friendes destitute, the right
course of this vnrighteous
worlde; if any go downe, this
man doeth. Well, Christ
cures him, and giues him
this caution as a Memorandum
for the time to come:
Beholde,
                  Ioan. 5. 14 
                  thou art made whole:
sinne no more, least a worle
thing come vnto thee: made
whole, therefore sometimes a
dieased creature: made whole,
therefore not of thy selfe
whole: made whole, therefore

now a sound man: Sinne
no more, least a worse thing
come vnto thee. Hee that afflicted
thee for a time, coulde
haue held thee longer: he that
touched thee in part, could haue
stricken thee whole: hee that
laide this vppon thy bodie,
hath power to lay a greater
rodde vppon both body and
soule; Sinne no more. So
that by this wee see, that sicknesse
of the bodie may moue
vs to crie out with the Prophete,
Peccata iuuentutis ne
memineris Domine, Lord remember
not the sinnes and offences
of our youth:Psa 25. 6. And ab
occultis munda nos, cleanse
thou vs from our secreate
faultes.
               When sicknesse beginneth
sharpely to touch vs,Psal. 19. 12. wee are
carefull in seeking and sending
to procure the health of the body;
as Asa sought to the Phisitions
to heale his disease,1. Chro. 16 12. when
he should haue rather sent to y•
                  
Prophet to haue giuen him
some spirituall receipt for his
sicke soule: when the phisition
hath done, then we can be content
the Diuine should begin:
as if some fewe wordes of
ghostly counsell were enough
when wee see there is but one
way with vs No, no, the first
and chiefest care in all extremities
should bee a penitent imploring
of the help of God, who
in this case doeth oftentimes
cure both bodie and soule, and
lengthen the daies of sorrowfull
suppliants, as hee did the
daies of Ezechias. The lumpe
of dried Figges, meanes ordained
by God, haue also their
conuenient vse. The phi
                     ••
                  eke
of the soule must haue the best
cordials for the penitent patient.
That of the people in the
booke of Nombers may bee remembred,
who being stung
with the serpentes in the wildernesse,
had no other meane of
succour then the looking vp to

the serpent, which Moyses (as
a meane ordained by God) set
vp for the procuring of their
health, we haue no other refuge
in time of need,Nom. 21. 8. then the lifting
vp of the eyes of our soules to
beholde Christ crucified. The
people cryed vnto Moyses and
Aaron, but there was no helpe
vntill God in mercie appointed
this miraculous meane. No
reliefe could bee founde in the
Law for the distressed soul, vntil
God in his wonderfull loue
raised vp a mighty saluation in
the state of grace. The serpent
was lifted vp on high, that all
might behold him, so was the
Sonne of God, that all beleeuers
might receiue sauing
health from and by him. In
the curing those who were
stung by the Serpent, it was,
Vide & viue,
                  Nom. 21 9. looke and liue: for
Christes curing, it is Crede &
viue,
                  Ioan 3. 14. beleeue and liue. This
blessed meane in times of greatest
extremitie doeth adde no

small comforte to the afflicted
man. And thus the principall

                     •
                  are, when sicknesse beginneth,
being an humble acknowledgement
of our sinnes, which may
moue vs to say, as Iosephs brethren,
Therefore is this trouble
come vpon vs;
                  Gen. 42. 21. a heartie confession
of them all; an humble
desire with bended hearted and
knees for the remission thereof;
a willing mind 
                     •
                  o bee deliuered
from the bandes of sinne, may
make vs crie with the prophet
Dauid, I am so fast in prison, that
I cannot get out: And last of
all, a ioyfull lifting vp of the
hart to the throne of grace, may
make vs willingly renounce
the world and resigne ouer our
selues vnto his diuine pleasure,
to whose appointment
we ought with patience meekely
to submit our selues. Wee
see wee are in his hande, who
alone hath power ouer al flesh:
when we are in want, we then
know the benefite of plenty:

when we are in bondage, wee
then best perceiue the good of
freedome: when we are in sicknesse,
wee must thankfully acknowledge
the blessing of
health, (if we haue any thank
fulnesse) and may easily gather
how God by lingring sicknesse
doth in mercy, stay till we make
vs rendie. If it shall please
him to adiourne the time of
this our pilgrimage, we ought
to offer a determina
                     •
                  e purpose,
as a sacrifice vpon the altar of
our hearte, to serue him truely
all the daies of our life. And
thus hauing our trust in
Christ crucified, we make this
resolution; If we liue, we shall
do well: if we die wee shall doe
better.
               
            
            
               
               The Twelfth Chapter.
               
                  How the sicke shoulde dispose of
worldly goods and possessions.
               
               
                  HIs sinnes by the
sicke partie confessed,
his soule
religiously commended
vnto
God, his desire
either to liue or die, giuen ouer
to the Divine prouidence, an
orderly disposing of those temporall
blessings, which GOD
hath heere lent vnto his seruants,
is verie conuenient for
euerie Christian in time of
health, and nothing ominous,
as some haue timirously doubted.
None ought to alienate ancient
inheritance,
                  Numb. 27 11. 
                  God would
that 
                        •
                     he 
                        •
                     ight heire should take
place, and succeed in order. Experience
doth shew, that after

wise men haue liued long, and
serued God many yeares in the
world, this disposing of blessings
temporal, maketh vs not
to die the more quickly, but the
more quietly. And therefore it
was put in practise of Abraham,
when he gaue the principall
part of his goods vnto Isaacke
his Sonne,Gen. 25. 5. 6. and vnto others.
Abraham gaue giftes or
legacies:1. King. 1. 25. this did Dauid, Toby,
and Ezechias,
                  Tob. 4. 20 Esa. 38. 1. for the quiet of
succeeding posteritie, dispose of
earthly possessions, going to
possesse heauenly. In this disposing,
to bee aduised by them,
whose learning and knowledge
is approued, doth much further
the well ordering of all. Wee
shewe our thankfulnesse vnto
God, and charitie to men,
when wee become beneficiall
vnto others, remēbring whose
saying it was:Act. 20. 
                  It is a blessed
thing to giue. In which giuing,
the maintenaunce of
Churches, Colledgs, Schools

Hospitals, and such like godly
vses, should▪ where abilitie
is answerable, be chiefly remē
                  bred:
for by these deeds of mercie
we doe not onely our selues
acknowledge Gods goodnesse,
but make many others, when
wee are long since dead and
rot
                     •
                  en, blesse him in the participation
of the same. Merciful
men (saith the Wiseman)
haue honoured God by this
meanes, and how;Eccles. 44 2. 15. 
                  The Lord
hath gotten great glorie by
them. To giue vnto the poore
in time of sicknes, 
                     ••
                  is good: but
more acceptable were it to do it
dayly, and in time of best
health. This giuing is the
ship that will neuer strike against
the rocke, but bring
our marchandise home in safetie.
This giuing is the most
gainefull interest, when the
mercifull shall receiue a thousand
for one. In keeping our
riches saith Gregorie, wee lose
them: but in dispearsing them

abroad, wee most surely keepe
them. To dispearse them when
wee can holde them no longer,
is not so much, though commendable
in this kind: but to
giue our bread vnto the hungrie,
nay to take from our
owne plentie, to giue vnto
Christes little ones, is commendable
indeede:Psal. 41. 1 
                  Blessed is
hee (saith Dauid) that considereth
the poore and needie. A
cuppe of colde water shall not
want one day a rewarde.
Where is the large liberalitie
wee should haue towardes the
poore members of Christ▪ The
excessiue pride of the worlde in
attire, the needlesse superfluitie
in diet hath eaten vp hospitalltie
and there
                     ••
                   towardes many
hungrie soules. But to the
disposition of these worldly
goods and possessions, wherein
naturall affection may not
bee extinguished, the next
                     •
                  
heyre or name disinherited,
the custome of the place

and auncientrie not violated:
restitution where wrong hath
beene offered, should be remembred:
debts truely discharged:
all which Christianlike disposition
is seemely both before
God and man. The forgiuing
our enemies when we can hurt
them no more, is not so much.
The perfect charity at al times,
but principally at this time,
that becommeth Christians,
may not be wanting. The example
of Steuen praying for his
persecutors, may shew vs a
mirror of charity towards all.
These speciall respectes obserued,
the sicke may in the name
of God dispose himself and his,
as thus.
               First with a free heart and
willing mind, to yeeld and render
his soule into the hands of
Almightie God his Creator,
who of his endlesse goodnesse
gaue him being; of his infinite
mercie vouchsafed to redeeme
him, by the death and passion

of his deare Son & our Sauiour
Christ Iesus, in whose
onely merites is his last repose
at parting: the commending his
body to Christian buriall, hee
may proceede as Gods grace
and wise aduertisement shall
direct, that so the sicke laying aside
all earthly respectes, hee
commend with penitencie and
contrition of hart, his soule into
the hands of almightie God,
humbly applying vnto his
faith, the innumerable benefits
of Christs passion, and of the
three things hee is then to dispose
of, His body, goods, and
soule: that principall care he had
of all other, in commending
this his soule with al deuotion
into y• hands of Iesus Christ.
            
            
               
               The Thirteenth Chapter.
               
                  How necessarie it is for the sicke,
leauing all worldly, thoughtes,
to apply his mind to praier and
some godly meditation.
               
               
                  THe disposition of
worldly goods being
well and wisely▪
ordered, the
mind is at more
quiet to consider of heauen and
heauenly thinges, more apt to
draw neerer vnto God by the
actions of Christian pietie: amongst
which actions we haue
no sweeter incense then our deuotion
offered vp by prayer:Psal. 141. 2.
The lifting vp of our handes
wee may make our euening or
latter sacrifice. Wee haue no
better Orators to pleade our
cause, no surer ambassadors to
conclude our peace, then our

humble supplications vnto
him, who sits euer in commission
to heare our suites, and
lookes that we should send vp
ou
                     •
                   prayers, that he may send
downe his mercie: by which
meanes we enter into a spirituall
traffique with God himselfe:
we giue a cuppe of colde
water,Ioh. 4. 14. and hee returnes vs a
fountaine of the water of life.
Wee giue him with the poore
widdow two mites, and hee
giues vs againe the whole
treasure of the Temple.Luc. 
                        •
                     1. 2. The
merey of God (saith one) is
like a vessell full to the verie
brimme. If once his faithfull
children by the hand of faithfull
prayer beginne to take of
it, it doeth ouerflowe vnto
them.
               Moreouer, it is not with
God as with man: those who
are petitioners are wont to bee
trouble some vnto thē; but with
God the more we offer vp our
praiers vnto him, the more we

are accepted of him. The Ediles
amongst the Romanes had
euer their doores standing open
for al that had occasion of complaint,
to haue free accesse vnto
them. With God the gates of
mercie are wide open to all
poore sinners, that will make
their prayers vnto him, Come
and wel
                        •
                     come. Now as wee
should at other times, and vpon
other occasions, with Abraham,
sometimes leaue our
terrene affaires,Gen. 22. 5. as hee left his
seruants beneath, when hee
went into the mount to sacrifice
to God: so principally in
sicknesse and griefe of bodie,
should we then ascend into the
contemplation of heauenlye
things, and haue recourse to
Gods mercie, as to a Cittie of
refuge: Call vpon me (saith the
Lord) in the time of trouble, &
I will heare thee, and thou shalt
praise me.
                  Psal. 50. 15. In the t'me of trouble,
there is a refuge for extremitie;
and I will heare thee,

theres the rewarde of mercie:
and thou shalt praise me, there
is the reflex of thankfull dutie.
Christ wils all that are wearie
and heaui
                        •
                      laden to come vnto
him,
                  Math. 11. 28. 
                  and they shall not loose
their labour, hee will refreshe
them. In time of need no surer
centerie, then by humble prayer
to repaire to God. Demus operam

I lifted mine eyes vnto the hils,

this or the like penitent complaint,
that ioyfull reply is not
farre off;Psal. 91. 14. 15.

will deliuer him. I will set
him vp, because he hath known
my name: Cum ipso sum in

                   I am with him
in his tribulation. The select
prayers to bee vsed in the

visitation of the sicke, should
bee obserued with many of
the Psalmes of Dauid, which,
when the afflicted reade them,
instruct the conscience, and in
times of sicknesse are wont
more then ordinarie to moue
the minde. For these diuine
hymnes saith Saint Basill,

are a parte of holy Scripture,
High in misterie, profounde in
sence, comfortable in doctrine,
and haue in times of affliction a
special and peculiar grace to instruct
the soule. Amongst these
the thirtie eight Psalm. Domine
ne arguas me▪
                   Put me not
to rebuke O Lord. The fiftie
one, Miserere mei Deus, Haue
mercie vpon me O Lord. The
seuentie Psalme, Deus in adiutorium,
Haste thee to deliuer
me O God. The seuentie
one, In te Domine sp

                     raui. In
thee O Lord haue I trusted.
The seuentie seuen; Voce mea
ad Dominum, I will crie vnto
the Lord with my voice. The

hundred and thirtie Psalme:
De profundis clamaui ad te domine,
Domine exaudi vocem
meam, Out of the deepes haue
I called vnto thee O Lord,
Lord heare my voice, with many
other like Psalmes, proper
and peculiar for the sicke. Herevnto
may bee added, a silent
meditation, wherein the soule
doth enter a solitarie talke
with God, which is verie conuenient
in this ease. When the
ioyes of heauen haue leasure to
present themselues to our religious
thoughts, the pleasures
of our sinfull life, and this
worldes vanities, are then
seene to be of small valew, (as
they are indeede) then may we

his resurrection the third day,
his ascention, and glorious sitting
at the right hand of God,

imploy our thoughts, then in
calling to mind how God hath
kept vs from our youth vp;
from how many daungers we
haue beene deliuered,Psal. 22. 9 into
which we haue seene not a few
fall before our eyes,Psal. 27. 21. and our

selues by his onely mercie vnto
this day freed from the same.
Can we but with all thankfulnesse
call to minde the goodnesse
of God towards vs, for
the time past, and put our
whole trust and confidence in
him euen in these greatest extremities,
yea both in life and
death, for the time to come, seeing

that Christ himselfe went not
vp to glorie, but first hee suffered
paine. When Vriah was
willed by Dauid himselfe to
take his peace at home: Shall I
see (quoth hee) my Lord Ioab,
                  2. Sam. 11 11.

of GOD himselfe all in gore
bloud, suffering for the sinnes
of the whole world, and shall
we refuse all suffering, taking
our case in Sion, and our rest
vppon the mountaines of Samaria,
as loath to endure any
crosse or calamitie at all? Is
that Souldiour worthie to triumph
with his Captaine, that
woulde neuer strike stroke to
fight the battaile? Againe,

suffered more for vs. But that
which principally is to bee remembred,
this our striuing is
not beating the ayre: for after
wee haue fought a good fight

there is laid vp for vs a crown
of glorie.2. Tim. 4. 8. God is (saith Tertullian)
Agonothetes,

purposeth the prize, and rewardeth
the champion. Consider
the olde generations of
men, and marke them well:Eccle. 2. 11 12. 13.
                  Was there euer any confounded
that put his trust in the Lord
who hath continued in his feare
and was forsaken? Or whome
did hee euer despise that called
vpon him? Wherefore let the
languishing person take vnto
him comfort in Gods mercie;
Was euer the righteous forsaken?
God told Iosias,
                  2 King. 22. 20. that hee
should bee gathered vnto his
Fathers in peace, and yet Iosias
died in warre.2. King. 23. 29. God gaue

I will giue thee a crowne of

liuelie faith, the sicke may make
a heartie confession of his christian
beliefe, saying, O holie
Trinitie, I commend my selfe
vnto thee, the father, the sonne,
and the holie ghost, which in vnitie
of nature art one, and the

vnto thee. O omnipotent father,
which hast created me, yea
heauen & earth, with all things
visible and inuisible. I commend
me vnto thee, O Lorde
Iesus Christ, who for mee, and
the saluation of mankind, wert
sent into the world, conceiued
by the power of the holy Ghost,
borne man of the blessed virgin
Marie, didst suffer, wast dead,
vnried, discendedst into hell, the
third day didst rise againe from
the dead, ascendedst into heauē,
where thou sittest at the right
hand of the father, from whence

thou shalt come at the day of
iudgement, to iudge all flesh. I
commend me vnto thee, O holie
Spirit, which proccedest from

togither I adore and glorifie,
which doest quicken one Catholike
and Apostolike church,
to which thou hast in mercie
graunted remission of sinnes,
the resurrection of these mortall
bodies, and euerlasting life after
death. The same confession
may be made of the sicke in maner
of oblation: As I offer my

the father, the sonne, and the holy
ghost, &c. Also in maner of an

In which christian confession
Gods seruants may stand constant
vnto the end, against all
temptations. Not vnlike y• people
of Ciniensis, who when the
ambassadors of Brutus would

and freedome into his handes,

                  xt to the
Ephesians,
                  Ephes. 6. 14. 15. sheweth what these
weapons are; as the brest plate
of righteousnesse, the shield of
faith, the Helmet of saluation,
the sword of the spirit, their feet
shod with the preparation of
the Gospell, where is spirituall
furniture for all parts, only the
back or hinder part excepted, to
signifie that the Christian souldier
should not turne his backe
before his enemies. The Eagle
to trie her young, is said to carrie
them vp against the piercing
beames of the Sunne,
which seeing them to endure,
she acknowledgeth them as her
owne Christ knowes vs to be
his, by our constant suffering,
and therefore somtimes brings
vs vnto the conflict. Wee reade

in the 2. Sam. 20. That Seba a
rebellious Iew,
                  2. Sam. 20 1. 
                  blew a trumpet,
and many of the people followed
after him, but the men of Iuda,
who were of the bloud royal,
they as good Isralites would liue
and die with Dauid their king.
The olde Seba, blowes many
an entising blast to carrie vs away
from our true allegiaunce
of Christ Iesus our king, All
that are borne of water and the
holy Ghost, will liue and die in
his faith. Howsoeuer the world
for a time frowne vpon them,
yet they are not as the Reede
without pith or substance, and
so wauing with euerie winde,
but firme & constant, like Iohn
Baptist, that will holde his profession,
though he loose his head
for it. Wherefore considering
that there is no crowne without
a conquest, and no conquest
without courage and perseuerance,
the faithful like Iob say,Iob. 13. 15
                  Though the Lord kill vs, yet wil
we put our trust in him.

(saieth the Apostle)
we haue hope
in Christ,
                  1. Cor. 15 17. then are
we of al men most
miserable: to shew in effect, that
we haue not in this life the occomplishment
of our hope. Not
here therefore we should expect
it else where: this is not our
Paradise, but a barren desert:
we may not looke for our heauen
here, our citie is aboue,
which wee all must inhabite,
to drawe backe when we are to
goe most comfortablie to take
possession of the same, and the
hope so long hoped for, should
most strengthen vs in the way,

is far from that Christian beliefe
whereof wee make dayly
profession. Oftē haue we praied
Thy kingdome come.

but now hauing this stay,
why should we wauer? Oftentimes
haue we wished, that we
were once freed from this
worlds captiuitie: now God is
going about to free vs indeede
our desire is to continue our
captiuitie still, not vnlike
children, who crie out of pain
                     •
                  
and griefe, and when th
                     •
                  
Chirurgion comes that should
ease them of all, they chuse

rather to remaine as they are.
There is no Marriner but after
many sharpe stormes desireth
the hauen: and shal not we
after so many tempests of this
troublesome world, accept of
our deliuerance, when the time
is come? We are giuen to loue
the world too much, and a great
deale more then we should, being
onely straungers in the
same. Had we no farther expectation,
but onely to enioy a
state temporall, where wee
might set vp our rest, as hauing
here attained our chiefest
good, then might our departure
from this world bee very grieuous
in deede, because our being
and happinesse should ende
together. But looking as we
doe for a further condition, so
perinanent, so blessed, and
death being the passage or
entrie thereunto, there is no
cause why man, if hee bethinke
himselfe, should vnwillingly
set forwarde, when his

time of departure is at hande.
First remembring it is the ordinance
of God, the course of
all flesh, and, as Iosuah calleth
it,Ios. 23. 14 the way of all the worlde.
What man is he (saith the prophet)Psa. 89. 47.
that liueth and shall not
see death? It is not proper to
any one, which is commō to all:
kings, princes, strong, valiant,
take parte with them in this
lot. There is no reason that any
should looke to bee priuiledged
in that wherin all without
exception must, will they,
nill they, sub
                     ••
                  t themselues.
Secondarily, that it is a meane
to bring vs from a prison with
out ease; from a pilgrimage
without rest, wee all see euidently:
and this made the Wise
man praise the dead aboue themE
                        •
                     cl. 4. 2.
which are yet aliue, and prefer
the day of death before the day
of birth, surely for no other rea
                     •
                  son,
then for that in the one
we come into a vale of misery,
in the other we depart from it,

departing in the farth of him,
by whom we looke for a better
state to come. Thirdly, this
being the way for the obtaining
so high a reward, we may
steppe forth with confidence in
his mercy, who now calleth vs
by death to the participation
of y• same. Why on Gods blessing
should any bee loath that
the soule should returne to him
that gaue it? When the louing
mother sendeth forth her childe
to nurse, and the nurse hath
kept it long enough▪ if the mother
take her owne child home
againe, hath this nurse anie
cause to grudge or complaine?
How much lesse cause haue wee
to shew any part of vnwillingnesse,
that God shoulde take
home this departing soule, the
worke of his owne hands, the
plant of his owne grafting,
who first gaue it, and will before
all others most louingly
keepe and tender it. There is
none knowes the loue of a mother,

but a mother. There is
none knowes the loue of God,
but God, who is loue. Wherefore
wee are verie vnnaturall
to our selues, if we should giue
testimonie of discontentment,
when our soules should be deliuered
into his handes, who
is the best preseruer of all.
Where is our desire with S.
Paule?
                  Phil. 1. 23 
                  To bee dissolued and
to bee with Christ. Where is
our complayning with the
Prophete Dauid?
                  Psa. 42. 2 
                  That we are
not yet come to appeare in the
presence of God. Where is
the longing of Saint Austen?
                  August. Medit. 2.
to see that head which was
crowned, those handes which
were pearsed for our sins. Had
wee the loue and faith which
these good men had, we should
rather wi
                     •
                  h for the houre of
our rest, then shewe any
vnwillingnesse to departe
when God is about to call
vs hence. Shall naturall
inclination ouer-rule the

force of Christian hope. Can
wee forget the prayer of Christ
in the garden?Luc. 22. 42. 
                  Father not my
will but thine be fulfilled. The
starres by their proper motion
are carried from the West to
the East, and yet by the motion
of obedience to the first
Mouer, they passe along from
the east vnto the west. The waters
by their naturall course
follow the center of the earth,
yet yeelding vnto the higher
body, which is the Moone, are
subiect to her motions. The
motion of obedience to the will
of God, who is the first mouer,
the higher bodie should drawe
vs and al our desires, how contrary
soeuer in nature: for hereunto
all should yeelde themselues,
and obediently follow.
Those who by Alchemie will
turne worser mettall into a
more pure, must first dissolue the
worse: so if we will change
our wils into the will of God,
wee must cleane dissolue them,

that his will onely may take
place. When Christ in the Apocalips
saith,Apoc. 22. 20. 
                  I come quickly:
the Saints replie; Euen so Amen,
come Lord Iesus. To
shew whatsoeuer doeth please
Christ, coulde not displease
them, much lesse his comming,
which is most ioyful to all that
feare and loue his name. And
here we may consider by this
meanes of yeelding our selues
meekely vnto God, wee haue
occasion offered to shewe our
subiection to his diuine pleasure:Gen. 22. 4
as Abraham had, when
God commanded him to offer
vp Isaack his sonne, nay Isaack
his only son, and Isaack whom
he loued, and Isaack in whome
rested all the hope of his blessed
posteritie. Here was a conflict,
wherein God would see which
was strongest in Abraham, eyther
faith or fatherly affection
But Abraham, who is called
the father of the faithfull▪ and
so one that leaues his children

an example for the tune to
come, in this straight resigned
his will to the wil of God, stood
not weighing so high a precept
in the light scales or ballance of
humane reason: but with hope
contrarie vnto hope, proceeded
to the accomplishment thereof.
The Apostles of our Sauior
Christ being willed to launch
forth▪ and to passe vnto the other
side of the lake, stoode not
casting timerous doubtes; as
thus,Mar. 4. 35. this Genazereth is a dan
                     •
                  gerous
passage; y• euening draweth
on; we our selues plaine
fishermen, none of the skilfullest
Pilots: but when Christ
cōmanded them, without more
ado away they go. Now Christ
bids vs to put off frō the shore
of our earthly estate; what
should wee but obediently set

                     •
                  orward? at the other side is
heauen, the hauen of our hope.
Againe, seeing we must needes
away, Si aliquando cur nō nunc,
If wee must away, why not
now? if not now, when? There

is a time to bee borne (saith the
Wiseman, & there is a time to
die: we came into this world,
vpon condition to leaue it: yeeld
vp our liues we must wt 
                  Codrus
that valiant Athenian, and
that before the field be wonne.
With the Thebane Captaine,
let vs not care to change life wt 
death, so the victorie may bee
ours, & to say the verie truth,
we haue no great cause to couet
long life in this stony hearted
world: we see some miseries, &
wise men foresee more, the righteous
is taken away,2 Kin. 22. 20.

euill to come: as God took Iosias,
because he shold not see the
calamitie of the sinfull people.
For our own estate in particular,
when de
                     •
                  repite age cōmeth
which we so much wish for before,
and those fourscore years
which is y• furthest hope of our
strength, are wee not thē combersome
to others, & irksome to
our selues? In the meane time,
so many snares and engins are
laid by the professed enemie of

man to entrap mens soules, as
wee may with reuerence and
loue wonder at the mercy of
God in our deliuerie for the
time past, and peaceablie accept
our passage into a place of true
securitie, now consequently to
ensue. Last of all, a remembrance
of the place whither we
are going should take vs away,
as the Angels tooke Lot from
Sodome. It is vnto a cittie of
all continuance,Heb. 13. 4 
                  Euen that citie
where our soules shall liue. Let
vs send our faith in beleeuing,
our hope in expecting, (as losua
sent messengers before) to
view that countrie which God
will g
                     •
                  ue vs. These messengers
will bring vs word, that eye
hath not seene, nor eare heard,
nor the hart of man conceiued,
the high excellencie thereof,
which (me thinks) shold moue
men to giue this world a willing
farewell. To conclude
with S. Cyprian, let Pagans
and infidels feare death▪ who

neuer feared God in their life.
But let Christians go as trauellers
vnto their nature home,
as children vnto their louing
father, willingly, ioyfully.Psa. 27. 4 
                  One
thing (saith the Prophet) haue
I desired of the Lord, that I may
dwel in the house of my God all
the daies of my life.
               
            
            
               The sixteenth Chapter.
               
                  How they may bee induced to depart
meekely, that seeme loath
to leaue worldly goodes, wife,
children, friends, or such like.
               
               
                  WHile wee set our
affections vpon
earthly thinges
onely, we much
affect them, and
are loath to depart
from them: but once taking
a taste of heauenly, we begin
to grow out of liking with

the basenesse of our former desires,
and bend all our affections
to an earnest expectation of
farre better. If wee do respect
riches, Christ hath greater
riches in another worlde,
then all the empire of Alexander
can yeelde, If honour,
he hath greater honor then all
the thrones of earthly Potentates
can afforde. (For one
day in his house is better then
a thousand.) If friends, heauen
hath the glorious companie
of Saintes and Angels,
who reioyce at our entrance
into their common ioy: what
more 
                     •
                  cceptable then good company,
& together, ioyful company?
The company is good where
the righteous liue for euer, ioyfull,
where is nothing but a
cheerefull singing of Allelu
                        •
                     ah.
                  Apoc. 19. 3.
For worldly possessions here
we found them, & here we leaue
them. The time of our enioying
of thē is vncertaine, because we
see them ebbing & flowing like

the sea, and we do not possesse
them as we ought, vnlesse wee
are readie at times best beseeming
vnto God to leaue them.
But the losse of friends cannot
be but grieuous vnto flesh and
bloud; to leaue wife and children
cannot but go neere the
heart, where affection hath been
rooled. Yea, but if we open the
other eye, and see whether wee
are going to Christ that redeemed
vs, and is neerer then all,
we leaue pleasant delights, but
receiue more pleasant by infinit
degrees: wherefore to vnburden
our selues of all earthly
cares, wee may obserue this
course, which is, to commend
wife, children, friends, & such
like in our humble praiers, vnto
his protection, who can better
prouide for them then our
selues, who is a father of the
fatherlesse, and taketh into his
owne hand the cause of y• widdow
& orphanes,Psal 88. 5 which y• ancient
patriarks well knowing at
their departures frō the world

for the blessing of God to come
vpon their posterities, and so
left them. Knowing that they
were but sent before them, who
should also follow after. Did
we rightly consider the manifold
grieuances, which euen our
chiefest delightes, which wee
are so loath to leaue, haue often
brought vs, we should soone see
our departure from them to be
a departure from many cares.
The Sun though it be cheerefull
and warme, yet is it sometimes
lesse pleasing, by reason
of scorching heate: the aire
though it be lightsome, yet is it
sometimes glomie and ouercast.
Our worldly delightes,
and whatsoeuer is here pleasing
vnto vs, haue had oftentimes
much sower sawce. Why
then (saith Fulgentius
                  Fulg. ad Theod.) do wee
not forsake this want to attain
a future plenty? Of all other
wee neede not so much respect
the forgoing of worldly
possessions, which are (sayeth

one: For these causes, rather
to be dispised of vs, then to bee
left with discōtentment. First,
for that they are vanities: Secondarily,
for that they are not
onely vanities, but also deceits:
Thirdly, because they are spinae,
pricking thornes: Fourthly,
for that they are aerumnae, euen
griefes themselues. Be it
we vse them aright, we are but
only stewards: when the owner
himselfe will haue it so. What
should we els but with all contentment
of mind forsake and
leaue them? We came all of vs
with Iob 
                  
                     ••
                  ked into the world;
and with Iob, naked shall wee
returne againe: onely our good
deeds and our bad (as they say)
beare vs company; bona sequū
                     tur,
mala presequuntur. A great
conqueror of the world would
haue his ensigne-bearer carrie
forth Linteam vestem, a sorie
cloth or shrowding sheete, saying:
here is all, of all his conquests
a worthy captaine doth

carie with him. Hither we come
as Iacob came to Laban;
                  Gen. 32. 10. onely
by Gods prouidence wee are
that we are. These heards and
droues about vs, they are from
the mercy of God. Not plants
growing in our owne soile, not
vapors that did arise of vs, but
of the nature of influences that
from heauen are come vppon
vs: euery one sueth to God in
forma pauperis, for things necessary.
Wherfore the Prophet
Dauid saith;Psa. 148. 
                  Te dante, nos colligimus,
Lord, thou giuing, we
gather: and therefore called
goods, because they are Gods,
his, and not our owne: whereby
we learne with contentinent
to leaue them, when the giuer
thereof shall of his bountie call
vs away to receiue better. But
is it possible wee should forget
whither we are going? where
should the members bee, but
where the head raigneth? where
should the heart be,Mat. 6. 21 but where
our heauenly treasure is?

Christ who is our treasure, is
in heauen, whither first our affections
ascend, and then wee
follow after. All these riches
remaine not, nor helpe in time
of need: they take them wings
often and flie from vs, and are
but straw and stubble,Prou. 27. 24. whereupon
wee may build no sure
foundation: And therefore we
neede not so much care to forsake
them. On the other side, we
leaue the society of men, and go
to that celestiall societie aboue
in heauen, where a multitude
of our good friends expect vs.
Our seperation each from other
here, is only for a time, our
continuance together in the life
to come shall be for euer.

call his children to any crosse or
calamitie, then begins the battell:
then their blessed patience

Phisition can be more carefull
for the health of the bodie, then
God is wont to bee for the
health of the soule: how bitter
soeuer the potion seeme, yet receiuing

it frō him who meanes
vs so well, we should not but
receiue with patient suffering
whatsoeuer his mercifull hand
shall reach vnto vs.Eccles. 2. 1. 2. 3. 
                  My sonne
(saith the Wiseman) when thou
commest vnto the seruice of
God, prepare thy soule vnto
temptation, and shrinke not away
when thou art tried, for
whom the Lord loueth, him hee
chastiseth. Gold and siluer are

If God will haue Moses to beExod. 2. 3

thought God had little respected
their sincere worship and
reuerence of his name. Flesh

their state most distressed: but
if wee stay a little and obserue
their patience, we shall see their
deliuerance not farre behind▪
Should wee not departe the
worlde with a willing minde?
the faith wee haue or ought to
haue of our chaunging can tell

                  Nisi granum frumenti cadat
in terram, & mortuum fuerit,
that same fructum adferet

of corne must bee cast into the
earth, before wee can haue increase
of fruit. Although our
dissolution bee vnto nature a
painefull trauell; and therefore
it is,Gen. 35. 18. as Rachel said, Benoni an
effect of sorrowe, yet is the
same to Grace an ofspring of
strength, and so counted Pilius

dexterae, the sonne of her
power, to endure and suffer
somewhat, seeing the reward
of suffering is great, shoulde

not suffer his to bee tempted

                  nt not vppe to glorie, but
first hee suffered paine. Crux
pendentis, Cathedra docentis;
Christ vppon the Crosse as
a Doctor in his chayre, read
to vs all a Lecture of patience.
Whatsoeuer wee suffer,

he patiently suffered more
for vs,1. Pet. 5. 10. and hath called vs
to his eternall glorie, that after
suffering a little, hee will
make vs perfecte, confirme,
strengthen, and stablish vs,
which will bee a happie refreshing
after all. That I may
(sayeth Saint Austen) after
this languishing life,August. manu. see Christ
in glorie, and be partaker of so
great a good, what though
sicknes weaken, labours oppresse,
watchinges consume,
colde benumme, heate enflame

                  nay
though my whole life bee
spent in sighes, and sorrowes,
what is all to the rest that
shall ensue in the life to come?
The Apostle Saint Paule
                  Rom. 8. 18
counted these momentarie afflictions
not worthy of the glorie
that shalbe shewed vnto vs:
wherefore seeing that after all
these sorrowes, we are going to
so quiet a hauen, we may with
patience endure a time some
fatherly correction. Shall we

looke for a garland and neuer
set foot to runne the race? shall
we with Iobs wife be content
onely to receiue good at the
handes of God, and no touch
of trouble?2. Sam. 10. 4. 
                  Dauid tooke it not
wel whē the Ammonites ill entreated
his ambassadors▪ these
afflictions are Gods ambassadors:
to repine or grudge against
them, is to intreate them

all thankfully, and in peaceable
manner depar
                     •
                  e this
world. It is said of Plato, a
heathen man, who at the point
of death amidst all his paines
was saide to giue the Gods
thankes that hee was borne a
man, and not a beast; a Greeke,
and not a Barbarian, and so
quietly left the worlde. How
much more should the Christian
man with all gratefull remembrance
of Gods goodnesse
towardes him, of blessings receiued,
of daungers preuented,
now patiently bequeath his departing

soule into the handes
of God, quietly enduring his
transitorie triall. Sorrow may
endure for a night, but ioy cō
                  meth
in the morning. Be patient
saith S. Iames:
                  Iam. 5. 7. 
                  Behold the
husbandman waiteth for the
precious fruites of the earth, vntill
he receiue the former & the
latter raine: settle your harts, for
the comming of the Lord draweth
nigh. Take the Prophets
for an example, if wee will reioyce
as they now reioyce, wee
must liue as they sometimes liued,
and suffer as they suffered.
If we look into the proceedings
of God with all his seruantes,
wee shall see him chastening
them for a time, and leauing
theim a little in the trial of their
faith. The louing mother doth
sometimes leaue the child, goes
aside, and seeing the infantes
moaning after her, then shee
runneth and is wont to make
the more of it. When God seemeth
to withdraw a little his

help from vs, it is onely to see
whether wee will moane after
him; which when he perce
                     •
                  ueth

the waters of the floude came

but as the waters rose, so the
Arke rose still higher & higher
In like sort when the waters
of afflictions arise, down goes
the pride of life, the lust of the
eyes: in a word, all the vanities
of the world. But this Arke of
the soule riseth as these waters
rise; and how too? euen
naerer and neerer towards heauen.

sinnes, and feare of iudgement

out to the prophet saying, alas

of iudgemente, the malice
of the olde Serpent, nowe
all laying siege and

                  atterie

vnto his departing soule, the
worlde forsaking him, his
friendes departing from him,
or at least sometimes weeping
by him, cannot but with complaint
say, What shall I doe,
which waye shall I turne? Let
vs sprinckle our heartes with
the blood of the Lambe, and
the destroyer shall not enter, nor
haue power to hurt. Let vs call
to minde the loue of God, in not
sparing his owne Sonne,
                  Ro. 8. 32. 
                  which
the Apostle tooke as an argument
of good consequence: if
he gaue vs his owne Sonne, how
much, will hee not giue vs all
thinges, and therefore mercie in
time of need. What heart is able
to conceiue the diuine prouidence
from the beginning had
ouer man? One bringeth in
the three persons in Trinitie, after
this manner, consulting
of his good. God the Father,
saith let vs create man, but being
created will hee not fall away?
God the Sonne aunswereth

though he fall away, I will
redeeme him: but being redeemed
will hee walke worthie of
his calling; God the holie
Ghost replieth, I will conserue
him, I will sanctifie him. The
Prophet prayes that the eyes
of his seruant might be opened,
which petition graunted, then
hee sees that they were more,
who stood for them, then all the
multitude which compassed the
citie. Now may the sicke with
Apostles pray, Lord increase
my faith. By which faith hee
shall see that Christ with all, is
merits is for him, which is
more, and of more efficacy, then
the whole power of darknesse,
that can oppose it selfe agaynst
him. This blessed obiect of
Christs merits, is alone able to
reuiue the fainting sinner, and
make him argue his right against
Satan, as thus▪ Where
in thy force thou roring Lion,
hath not Christ weakened it?
Wilt thou know my strength or
might wherin I ouercome? It

is the bloud of the lamb. Thus
when like Dauid, wee come to
fight with Goliah, wee cast away
Sauls armor, and al trust
and confidence in our selues, &
onely set forward in the name of
the God of Israel.Gal. 3. 13. Doth the
law indite vs of transgression?
wee haue a supersedeas to stay
that course, & our cōmission is
vnder seale, to appeale vnto the
throne of Grace.Col. 3. 14. Doth it bring
forth our debts bil, our answer
is the obligatiō is cancelled, the
booke is crossed, and the whole
debt fully discharged. Doe the
sins and offences of our youth
now dismay vs? If we acknowledge
our sinnes,
                  1. Ioh. 1. 
                        •
                     
                   saith S, Iohn,
God is faithfull, and iust to forgiue
vs our sinnes, and to clense
vs from all vnrighteousnesse. I
but doe a multitude of sinnes
inuiron vs? & we see our selues
great sinners? why Christ appeared
first after his resurrection
to Marie Magdalene to
shewe that he brought comfort
to the greatest sinners of all.

This is a true saying, saith the
Apostle,1. Tim. 1. 15. 
                  That Christ came into
the world to saue sinners, whereof
I am the chiefe: as if S. Paul
put himselfe in the number, as
euerie one shoulde, and say,
wherof I am one, nay the chiefe.
And here we may call to minde
that bottomles depth of Gods
mercie, who will bee called rather
by the name of a father to
intimate vnto vs his loue, and
to enconrage vs to call vpon
him in time of neede, whose
goodnes is diffusiue, and communicable
vnto others, whose
bountie is delighted in nothing
more then in doing good. And
is woont rather to giue great
then small things. God is not
such a one as Adam tooke him
to be, from whom when he had
sinned hee shoulde flie, or hide
him selfe for feare: but God is
such a one, to whom Adam, and
all that haue sinned, may haue
accesse with hope, and loue. The
seruants of Benadab, in the first

of Kinges, and the twentieth,
when they saw and considered
wel their distressed case,
began to aduise their maister
Benadab after this maner:1. Kin. 20 31. 
                  We
heare that the Kings of Israel are
mercifull, wherefore let vs cloath
our selues in sackecloath, that so
we may goe and find fauour in
their sight. If this mercifulnes
were a thing proper vnto the
Kings of Israel, what may
wee looke for at the handes of
him, who is the God of Israel,
before whom they that humble
themselues, shall questionlesse
find grace and mercie. My sin
is greater: no Cain, thou errest,
God his mercie is far greater,
couldest thou aske mercie. Men
cannot bee more sinnefull then
God is mercifull, if with penitent
heartes they will but call
vpon him. But come we vnto
Christ, the fountaine of al mercie,
there shall we find God in
his mediation onlie, great without
quantitie, and good without

qualitie (as Saint Austen
speaketh.)Matt. 11. 19. Christ in the Gospel
was called of the Pharisies, by
way of reproach, a friend of
Publicans and sinners, and so
was hee in truth and verit

                  ome that might amaze this

wandering sonne: though wee
sometimes lose the nature of
children, yet God doth neuer
lose the name and nature of a
father, a name of priuiledge to
his children,Gal. 4. 6. we crie Abba father,
a name of care and prouidence,Mat. 6. 32
your heauenly father
eareth for you,Luc. 11. 13. a name of loue,
If you giue your Children
good things, how much more
shall your father in heauen giue
you, if you aske them of him.
And not onely a father, but our
father, which should wounde
our harts, and kindle our affections
in al distresses with comfort
to 
                     •
                  al vpon him. It may be
said also in this case as before
it was saide of the affection of
a mother. There is none
knowes the loue of a father,
but a father, nor any the loue of
God, but God himselfe, who is
loue. That thou mightest bee
blessed O man: first hee created
the
                     •
                  : that thou mightest bee
recouered when thou wert

lost, then hee redeemed thee,
which redeeming sheweth a
price paied for thy raunsome,
which price was his dearest
bloud. When Christ wept and
shed some fewe teares for Lazarus,
                  Ioa. 11. 36
the Iewes reasoned and
said, see how he loued him: but
when Christ shedde his owne
bloud for vs, and that in great
aboundance, Osee how he loued
vs. If hee bought vs with so
deare a price, will he refuse his
owne peniworth? If he sought
vs flying from him, shal be not
much more receiue vs when
we come vnto him? Can a mother,Esa. 59. 4
saith the Prophet Esay,
forget the childe of her wombe,
yea tho
                     •
                  gh she do: yet will not
God forget his people.Psal. 27, 12. 
                  When
my father and mother forsooke
me (saith Dauid) the Lord tooke
me vp.
                  Luc. 10. 34. We haue a good Samaritan,
that when the Priest, and
the Leuite left vs wounded, to
wit, the Law and figures thereof
passed by vs, hee bound vp

our wounds, and paid for our
curing, that we might be recouered
vnto euerlasting health.
Our Ioseph is gone before to
prouide for his brethren,Gen. 45, 5 was
there euer such loue? Looke
how wide the East is from the
West▪ so farre hath hee sette
our sinnes from vs. Nay like
as the pillar of clouds was set
betweene the host of their enemies,Exod. 14. 20.
and the tents of the people
of Israel, that no harme
might befall them: so hath hee
set his prouidence betweene vs
and all casualties, that no hurt
should oppresse vs Wee should
be sutors vnto Christ, and least
our manifolde sinnes shoulde
make vs bashfull, he calleth vs
vnto him, saying:Matt. 11. 28. 
                  Venite omnes
qui laboratis & onorati estis,
& ego reficiam vos, Come
vnto me al that are wearie, and

                     ••
                  e loden, and I will refresh
you. Did al the poore creatures
come vnto the Arke to saue
themselues? Did the Angels

carrie Lot out of Sodome? and
shall not wee come vnto him,
who calles vs so louingly,
and meanes no other but to
bring vs vnto his euerlasting
kingdome? Wherefore let neither
the multitude of our sins,
the terror of the lawe, nor the
feare of Gods iustice, discourage
vs in time of distresse,
Christ hath put thē al to flight;
as Dauid did the Philistines,
                  2. Cor. 3. 6
by killing the killing letter of
the lawe; who would not cast
his burthen vpon him that
doth desire to giue vs ease? As
I liue,
                  Ezec. 33. 11. 
                  saith the Lord, I woulde
not the death of a sinner. God
woulde haue the sinnes to die,
but the sinner to liue, whose
creatures haue nourished vs;
whose-prouidence hath preserued
vs; whose mercies hath
carried vs all along from, our
verie cradles vntill this d

whose watchfull eye hath deliuered
vs from so manie daungers,
both of bodie and soule:

haue we had such and so many
experiments of his loue, and
should we now doubt thereof?
Is the Iudge become our aduocate
and shall we feare to go
forwards towards the throne
of grace? The Spirite and the
Bride say, come,
                  Apo

of God maketh request for vs.

                  Howe the sicke in the agonie of
death, may bee prepared towards
his ende.
               
               
                  AL our life long
haue we liued
in a departure
& farewell frō
the worlde;
since our very
first entrance, wee were euer
drawing towardes our ende;
our pilgrimage is almost ouer.
When we approach towardes
the period of our course, what
else remaineth but a heartie
commending our soules to
God, and a comfortable expectation
of a better life to come,
when weaknes of humane nature
doth not affoord habilitie
to manifest our soules affections,
God shall accept at our

handes the sending vp of our

                     •
                  ghes and desires to heauen,Exod. 14. 15.
who saide vnto Moses, why
hast thou cried vnto me for this
people, & yet we find that Moses
spake neuer a worde: to shew
that hee heard the secret supplication
of Moses heart. Ionas
praied in the belly of the whale,Ionas. 2. 1. 2.
when hee thought vpon God.
Susanna in her distresse,Susan. 35. when
she lifted vp her eyes to heauen.
Haue I not remembred thee,
saith Dauid, vpon my bed, and
thought vpon thee when I
was waking?Psa. 63. 7 And in anotherPsal. 108. 1.
place, O Lord my heart is ready,
my hart is ready, As if his trust
was, that God would accept the
readinesse of his heart: wherefore
the minde beating vpon
a remembraunce of Christes
passion, shall mittigate in part
the bodies paynes. Nowe is
the time that Timothie,
                  2. Tim. 4. a good
Soldiour, shoulde fight, by
Saint Paules example, a good
fight, Keepe the faith, and so

finish his course, for after all
there is a Crowne of glorie
reserued for Gods children:
This is the last Secane of all
the Comedie. When a little
brunt is ouerpast, troubles
cease, but ioyes neuer ceasse.
And therefore a good remembraunce,
that wee are going
from the darkenesse of this
worlde, to the lande of the
liuing, Where is no night, no
neede of the Candle, nor light
of the Sunne: for God giueth
them light, and they shal reigne
for euermore. Hold thy peace
Babylon (sayeth Epiphanius)
and bee mute,
                  Epiph. 
                  O Sodome,
                  Epist. 323 
                  because
(that article) I beleeue life
euerlasting is cleere, and consequentlie,
bringeth comforte
to Gods departing Children.
But let vs hearken to Christ
himselfe, I am the Resurrection,
                  Ioan. 11. 25.
                  and the life, (sayeth
the Lorde) whosoeuer beleeueth
in mee, yea though hee
were dead, yet shall hee liue,

and whosoeuer liueth, and beleeueth
in me, shall not die
for euer. O ioy of ioyes, wee
lay vs downe to sleepe, and
take our rest, to dwell in safetie.
And here wee may not
omitte to call to minde, the
manner howe Gods seruants
of olde haue shut vp the day
of their mortalitie. As first
that of Moyses,
                  Deu. 33. 1 who after beholding
the lande of promise,Deu. 34. 5
blessed God for all his benefites,
blesseth the people, and
so dyeth. That of Iosuah,
                  Iosu. 23. 11.
who exhorteth Israel to feare
God, to stande stedfastlie in
all his ordinaunces,Iosu, 24. 29. and so
mildly goeth the way of all the
worlde. That of Dauid,
                  1 Kin. 2. 2 who
enioyneth Salomon his sonne
to walke in the waies of God,
that so hee might prosper in
whatsoeuer he tooke in hand.
That of Tobie,
                  Tob. 13. 8 who called his
sonne, and his sonnes sonnes,
exhorting them to bee mercifull,
and iust, that it might

goe well with them. That of
Saint Steuen,
                  Act. 7. 60 who praying
for his persecuters, and calling
vpon the name of Iesus, fell a
sleepe. And after this manner
haue the godlie taught vs to
depart this worlde. That of
Serapion,
                  Euseb. Hist. li. 5. cap. 45. 
                  a good and faithfull
olde man (sayeth Eusebius) who
after receyuing the holie Eucharist,
moste meekelie departed
the worlde, Now for things
transitorie, they leaue vs, and
we them, the soule onely remaineth
to bee commended vnto
God. If when thou art
going a iourney, thou wouldest
be glad to commit thy remporall
goodes to such a friend,
by whome thou mayest be sure
they shall bee well and safelie
kept, how much more may the
Christian man comfort himselfe
in committing his soule to
the custodie of Iesus Christ
his Sauiour, who will keepe
it sure and safe for euer? Reuben
saide of Beniamin, when

                  Iacob was loath to let him go:
Deliuer him vnto me,
                  Gen. 42. 37. 
                  and I will
bring him safelie home. So of
Christ it may be more rightlie
said: Commend thy departing
soule vnto him, and hee will
bring it vnto her long and blessed
home.
            
            
               The Twentieth Chapter.
               
                  In what maner the sicke should be
directed by those to whom this
weightie businesse doth speciallie
appertaine.
               
               
                  AMongest men,
those whom GodNum. 6. 23.
hath set apart to
helpe distressed
consciences, to
loose or pronounce remission in
his mercy, to blesse in his name,
to teach his people, and to doe
thē good in times of need, partly
by matter of exhortation,

and partly also by offering vp
in their behalfe deuout praiers
towards the throne of Grace,
In the vi
                     •
                  tation of the sicke, so
high a worke of mercie, they
are occasioned, if euer, to enter
most seriouslie into the exercise
of both. That care may
bee thought to bee of greatest
importaunce, which is imployed
in helping them, who
be now least able to helpe them
selues, and had neuer more
neede (God knowes) of ghostly
direction. There is nothing
which the sicke in these extremities
doe more desire agaynst
the naturall terrours of death,
and many troubles of conscience
which at this time are
woont to assault them. It is
greatly to be wished, that like
as the serpent, that olde enemie
of mankinde, who the shorter
the time is, the 
                     ••
                  ercer his
wrath is, and chiefly entendeth
ruine vnto the heele.Apoc. 1
                        •
                      12. As the
last part of mans life is at this

time busie: so those who in louing
feede, and in feeding▪ loue
Christ his lambes, should now
bee most carefull to keepeIoh. 21. 15
them from this deuouring Lion,1. Pet. 2. 25.
and endeuoure to present
them sounde in faith,1. Pet. 5. 8 hope,
and charitie, vnto the great
Bishop and Sheepheard of
their soules. Notwithstanding
that the good grace of
that spirite, which directeth
our highest proceedings, can
better direct a discreet and sober
Agent in this case, then all
forms of direction whatsoeuer:
yet as in other duties, so in this
some aduertisements may bee
obserued by those, who are content
also to heare the aduise of
others. First therfore, death being
that which all men suffer,
but not all after one sort, care
ought to be had answerable vnto
the disposition of the dying.
Tediousnesse of discourse may
soone weary the weake partie.
Few words, & those sometimes

in priuate well ordered, are
woont for the most part to auaile
most. Impertinent speeches
verie vnfit, the presence
oftentimes of those, who haue
beene associate in follie, yea
sometimes the presence of those
who are nearest in alliance remooued,
is thought by graue
indgement to bee the fittest oportunitie
for the giuing of
soule counsell, bearing a simple
and honest intent to doe good.
A premeditated exhortatiō, after
information taken of the
disposition of the sicke, is verie
behoouefull, this loose and
sleight hudling vp of diuine
matters, and sometimes of
Gods mysteries themselues,
doth often bring in contempt
the high wisedome of holie
Scripture, which but with all
reuerence, watchfulnesse, and
prayer, none should presume to
search, and open. This disposing
then of the sicke vnto a
Christian ende, being a worke

of such moment; they may proceede,
to whom this shall appertaine
in this or the like
manner.
               
                  And first:
Care is taken that the sicke
                  1 Now make a most sincere
and humble confession
of all his sinnes.
                  2 That he be content with
all his heart to liue, or
die, as it shall seeme
go
                        •
                     d to God his diuine
pleasure.
                  3 That hee bee resolued to
make a heartie reconciliation
with the worlde,
desiring forgiuenesse, and
forgiuing all offences
whatsoeuer amongest
men.
                  4 That hee take in good
part this visitation sent
vnto him, to prepare
him to die leysurablie
Gods seruant.
                  5 That hee wholie commend

him to God his
mercie, in the onely mediation
of Christ Iesus
his sauiour.
               
               
                  Secondarily.
Let care bee had that the sicke may be moued to call to minde
                  1 That all of what state or
condition soeuer must
depart this transitorie
worlde.
                  2 That Gods children thoroughout
the volume of
holy scripture and examples
of auncient writers
haue willingly yeelded
themselues at the time of
their visitation.
                  3 That Christ himself went
not vp into glorie, but
first hee passed through
death.
                  4 That the death of the seruaunts
of God is pretious
in his sight, and
that they rest from their
labours.
               
               
                  
                  These demaundes may bee proposed to the sicke.
                  1 Whether he acknowledge
the faith of the holie
Trinitie, with the articles
of the Creede, and
in this faith be resolued
to liue and die,
                  2 Whether he be sorie for his
sinnes, and aske God
forgiuenes, with a penitent
heart in the merits
of Christ Iesus.
                  To which confession, of
faith God sendeth him
this message, go in peace
               
               
                  The sicke should be willed seriously to consider,
                  1 That Christ came not to
call the righteous, but
sinners to repētance, he is
a sinner therfore for him.
                  2 That hee was the verie
lambe of God that came
to take away the offences
of the world.
                  3 That he is a refuge for all
them that be wearie, and
heauie loden.
                  4 That he is our righteousnesse,
                  
                     
5 That if he liue, he liueth
vnto the Lord, and it hee
die, hee dieth vnto the
Lord: whether he liue or
die, he is the Lords.
               
               
                  He may be requested to say with
                  1 The Prophet Dauid,
Lord remember thy seruant
in al his troubles.
                  
                  2 The Publican, God bee
mercifull to me a sinner.
                  
                  3 The woman of Canaan;
Iesus thou sonne of Dauid,
haue pitie on me.
                  
                  4 Iob, I know that my redeemer
liueth, and that
I shall rise againe, and see
God, not with other, but
with the selfe same eies.
                  5 Saint Steuen: Lorde Iesus
receiue my spirite, &

to say: I am that wounded
man, blessed Samaritan,
heale me: I
                        •
                     am that
wandering child, that is
not worthie to be called
thy son, father, make me
thy meanest seruant: I am

the lost sheep, O seeke &
saue me; bring me home
Lord vnto thy heauenly
fold.
                  6 To mention the words of
Christ vpon the crosse:
Lord into thy handes I
commend my spirit.
                  
               
               
                  Let him also say, Iesus giue me
                  1 Patience in my trouble.
                  2 Comfort in my afflictions
                  3 Strength in thy mercies.
                  4 Deliuerance at thy pleasure.
               
               
                  If the sick bee
                  1 Not able to pronounce
them himselfe, let the articles
of the Creed be recited
in his presence by
some other: I belieue in
God, &c.
                  
                  2 Distempered, as the best
may be, in burning feauers,
and otherwise,
choller shooting vp into
the braine, and the malignant
humour meeting
with the vitall powers,

which may cause rauing;
let him in fewe wordes
bee moued to remember
God, and the assemblie
may softly pray by him.
                  3 Troubled with strange
visions, as good men
haue beene, beseech him
in the name of God, to
call to mind the aboundant
loue of Iesus
Christ crucified.
                  4. Pensiue and sorrowfull,
mention the ioyes of
heauen, whither he shall
go by Gods grace,If the sick be and
the troubles of this sinfull
world, which hee
hath often felt, and may
nowe very thankfully
leaue.

The sicke may sometimes be
left to silent meditation, and

                     MOst merciful Lord
wee are at this
present constrayned
to praye for
other, who are not
worthy to pray for our selues,
beseeching thee in the multitude
of thy mercies, to looke downe
from heauen, and behold thy
seruant here visited with sicknesse;
enlighten his mind; preserue
his sence; continue thy
grace; asswage his paine; and if
it be thy good pleasure, prolong

his daies as thou diddest the
daies of Ezechias: if otherwise,
receiue him vnto thy Arke of
mercie. In the meane while,
giue him patience in trouble,
comfort in affliction, constancie
in temptations, and victorie
against his ghostly enemies.
Let the blood of thy deare sonne
wash and cleanse all the spots
and foulnesse of his sinnes. Let
thy righteousnes hide and couer
his vnrighteousnes. Let
that ioyfull voice bee heard of
him: Thou shalt be with mee in
Paradise. Grant this O Lord
for the honor and glorie of thy
holy name, through the same
Iesus Christ our only sauior
and redeemer, Amen.
                  
               
               
                  
                  A Prayer to be vsed by the

                     O Lord Iesus, who
art the resurrection
and the life,
in whom whosoeuer
beleaueth
shal liue though
he die. I neither desire the continuance
of this mortalitie, or a
more speedie deliuerance, but
onely commend my selfe wholly
to thy will. Doe with mee
most mercifull Sauior, accor
                        •
                     ding
to the riches of thy goodnes:
through thee haue I beene
holpen euer since I was borne;
it grieueth mee that I haue so
often offended thy goodnes, and
I am grieued that I grieue
no more. Lord as an humble
suitor I appeale vnto the
throne of mercie, and there
begge▪ at thy handes remission
of all my sinnes in the
merites of thy bitter passion.

I offer vnto thee a penitent
heart for the time past, and promise
amendment, if it shall
please thy diuine wisedome to
continue on this my pilgrimage
for the time to come,
wherein I refer my selfe wholly
to thy heauenly will, in hope
of a better resurrection vnto euerlasting
life through Iesus
Christ our Lord, Amen.

whom thou dost
loue, and chastenest euerie
one whome thou receyuest;
receiue O Lorde wee beseech
thee thy seruant here visited
with sicknesse, distrusting
in his owne merites, and trusting
in thy mercies. Looke vpon
him O Lorde, as thou didst

vpon Ezechias; restore vnto
him his former health, if it bee
thy will, or otherwise giue
him grace to take this sicknes
patiently, that after this life
ended in thy faith and loue, hee
may dwell with thee in life euerlasting;
vnto which life
vouchsafe to bring him and vs
all thy hamble seruants, for
thy infinit mercies sake, Amen.

mans departure.
                  Let vs pray.
                  
                     O Almightie and euerlasting
God,
seeing it hath
pleased thee to
take this thy
seruant out of
the miseries of a sinfull world,
vnto thy heauenly kingdome;
for which (Lord) thy name bee
blessed: make vs we beseech
thee, that yet remaine, mindful
of our mortalitie, that we may
walke before thee in righteousnesse

and holinesse all the daies
of our life: and when the time
of our departure shall come, we
may rest in thee, as our hope is,
this thy seruant doth▪ that we
with him and all other departed
in the faith of thy holy
name, may reiorce together in
thy eternall and euerlasting
glorie, through Iesus Christ
our Lord, Amen.
                  
               
            
            
               The two and twentieth
Chapter.
               
                  An exhortation is comfort those
who lament & mourne for the
departure of others.
               
               
                  TO vse mourning
for the dead, decencie
amongst
men, and Christianitie
doth allow
it; examples
of holy scriptures doe approue,

as much. What more seemely
then the performance of the dutie,
whereby we giue testimonie
of naturall affection, in
this solemne departure each
from other. God hath neither
made vs stockes nor stones,
nor giuen vs heartes which
should haue no seeling when
occasions offered, or times beseeming,
require sorrowfull affections.
In the contrarie,
what more vncomely, then to
vse nurth in the house of mourning.
A very Heathenish mannerConcil. Arela. 3. sub Leo. 1.
was it thought to bee, by
the decree of an ancient council.
to sport at these motiues to
mourning. For examples in
holy scripture, we find that Abraham
mourned for Sarah:
                  Gen. 23. 2 all
Israel for Samuel:
                  Sam. 25. 1 the people
in the wildernesse for Aaron
                  Nomb. 20 29.
their high priest: the inhabitantes
of Bethulia for Iudeth,
                  Iud. 16. 24.
that honorable widdow:
the Machabies for their nobleMac. 9. 20. 21.
Captaine: Martha and Mar
                        ••
                     
                  
                  
for Lazarus their brother:Ioan. 11. 31. the
women of Iewrie for their
tender children,Mat. 2. 18. those young
infants: the twelue Putriarks
for Iacob their aged father:Gen. 50. 14.
                  Dauid for Ionathan his trustie
and faithfull friende.2. Sam. 1. 17. Nay
Christ himselfe saith Saint I
                        •
                     
                     rome
went not to his sepulcher
without weeping eyed:
Neither hath this mourning
beene a light passion onely.
               Great was the lamentation
that Iacob made at the
supposed death of his sonne
Ioseph, when hee said;Gen. 50. 14. I will
goe vnto the graue to my
sonne sorrowing. Great was
the lamentation that Dauid
made, when newes was
brought him of Absalon his2. Sam. 1. 17.
eude: O Absalon, Absalon,
my sonne Absalon, I woulde
to God I had dyed for
thee.
               Great was the lamentation
which the widdowes
made for Dorcas, so good a woman

full of good workes and
almes,Act. 9. 39 when they considered
her bountie towardes them.
And thus wee see the laudable
custome and practise in mourning
for the dead. When the
Apostle forbad the Thessalomans1. Thes. 4. 13.
to sorrow, he did not absolutely
forbid all sorrowing,
but onely after the manner of
the Gentiles;Bern. in Cant. serm. 26. 
                  Noa culpamus
affectum, saith S. Barnard, sed
excessum, We blame not the affection
it selfe, but the excesse or
want of moderation. We may
not onely vse moderate sorrow
in the departure of others, but
euen in the departure of the
godly and well disposed themselues:
for as good men often
are, and, in regarde of their
great misse in the world, where
they had beene many waies
helpfull vnto others, may be
mourned for of many; which
is a testimonie of their neede,
who haue left but fewe such
behinde: So is it a signe of

some ill dealing amongst men,
when the poore and distressed
let them go away without any
lamentation at all. It was
saide by the Prophet Ieremie,
                  Ierem, 22. 15.
to Iehoiakin; So long as thy
father did helpe the oppressed,
did hee not prosper? And after
hee addeth this, as a great
punishment to bee laid vpon
him, well thou shalt die in
griefe of mind, and there shall
bee none to make lamentation
for thee.
               The Apostle confesseth in
plaine wordes, that God had
mercie on him in sparing Epaphroditus,
                  Phil, 2. 27.
lest hee should haue
had sorrow vpon sorrow: to
shew that hee was not so vnnaturall,
but himself
                     •
                   should
haue had feeling in such a case.
My sonne saith the wiseman,Eccles. 38. 16.
powre forth thy teares ouer
the deade, and neglect not his
buriall: whence mee may
gather, that funerall rytes,
decent interring, exequies,

and seemely mourning, is not
vnsitting the practise of those,
amongst whome all thinges
should bee done in order.
               The Israelites in burying
so honourablie their Fathers1. Cor. 14.
and Gouernours, did shewe
themselues a people of good
and orderly disposition. My
sonne (saith Tobie) when ITobie. 14. 10.
am dead bury me honestly. The
new sepulcher, the cleane linnen
cloathes, the sweete ointmentes,
the assemblie of men
of reputation, shewed how
our Sauiour was respectiuely
regarded and entombed
with some solemnitie: and
sure these bodies, which haue
beene the temples of the holy
Ghost, and shall bee chaunged
at the day of doome into a
condition of glorie, should haue
that decencie performed as to
agreeable both to practise, and
conneniencie. Wherefore not
to yeeld the dead after a Cynick
manner, comely burials, or

Christian mourning with moderation,
is most inhumane, is
a concept to say truth, very
barbarous. Notwithstanding
this Christian sorrow, yet to
sorrow as men without hope,
is farre distant from the rule
of faith; which tels vs, that
the death of the Saintes isPsal. 116. 13.
precious in Gods sight. They
are at peace, and that their hope
is full of immortalitic. He that
said my sonne,Eccles. 38 17. 
                  Powre forth thy
teares ouer the dead, said also
comfort thy self. And surely for
Christians of all others, who
beleeue the resurrection vnto a
better life, shold raise vp themselues
by faith, frō too too deleful
passions For as in all other
things, so in this a moderation
should be had. Haue we lost a
good father, friend, husband,
wife or children, we may say wt 
                  Iob. Dominus dedit,
                  Iob. 1. 21. 
                  Dominus
abstulit, The Lord hath giuē, &
y• Lord hath takē away, neither
are they yet clean taken frō vs;

but gone a little before the
way, wherein wee must all
follow. Wee shall one daye
meete againe, at which meeting
(sayeth Cyprian) there
will bee no meane ioy,Cypr. de mort. 1. when
friendes come to reioyce together.Aug. Cir.
Our knowledge is now
but in parte, then shall wee
knowe as wee are knowne;
where Peter shall bee Peter,
and Paule shall bee Paule; and
many long since departed shall
(as some of the auncient Fathers
say) bee knowne of vs,
that haue liued long after. But
of all other meanes of comfort,
that happie hope of the
resurrection should raise vs vp
from ouer pensiue thoughts.
Christ our Sauiour before
his passion, when hee saw the
disciples sorrowfull for his departure,
which was so shortly
to ensue,Ioan. 14. 28. saith vnto them; Let
not your hearts bee troubled, I
go vnto the father. So it may
bee said to those that mourne

for the misse of others, let not
your minds be too much plunged
in sorrow: those for whom
you thus lament, are gone vnto
their mercifull redeemer. It
is saide of Enoch, because his
soule pleased God,Ecclus. 4. 10. God tooke
him away. It was spoken as
a blessing to Iosias,
                  2 King. that hee
should bee gathered vnto his
fathers before the captiuitie of
the people came Saint Ierome
of sinful times saith,Hiero. ad Helio. 
                  Foelix Nepotianus,
qui haec non videt, Nepotian

liues, not to see this wicked
world. When God ships his
Noahs,
                  Gen. 7. 1 it is signe there is a
floud not farre behind. When
God sends Angels to fetch his
Lots out of Sodome,

there is a punishmēt for the sinfull
Cities shortly to ensue.

no more penurie to endure.
Wherefore seeing we are all to

who can tell whether God will
haue mercie on mee, that the
childe may liue: but being dead,
wherefore should I now fast, can
I bring him againe any more?
I shall go vnto him, but hee shall
not returne vnto me. In the like
case Saint Barnard being not a
little mooued for the death of
one: I turned mee (saith hee) to

considered that God had done
what seemed best in his diuine
prouidence, what should more

And so the good father resolued

Heathen men coulde tell Ionas

superiour power.Exod. 8. 8 
                  Pharaoh himselfe
coulde intreate Moyses to

worshipped God with all deuotion,
and their went forth for
y• deliuerāce of Bethulia. Faith
and trust in God doeth not
make men towards, but rather
addeth spirite and comfort in
greatest assaults of enemies.
By faith (saieth the Apostle)Heb. 11. 32, 34.

and also Dauid, of weake were
made strong, waxed valiant in
battell, turned to slight the armies
of aliants, who came against
Gods people, with great
force and multitudes. While

they were arming themselues
with sword and shield, the maner
of God his people was to
arme them with deuotion, and
a religious commending themselues
either in life or death to
Gods protection.Num. 22. 5. When Balaac
saw the people of Israel to prosper,
more by their praying, thē
he could by his strogest forces,
he would needs haue Balaam to
curse them. Moses (saith S. Ierome)
fought as well as Iosua
against Amelech:
                  Iero. ad Heliod. for while
Moses held vp his handes,Exod, 17. 11. Israel
preuailed. Rufinus, and Socrates
write, that Theodosius
the Christian Emperour,Rufi. Soc. Eccle. hist. in a
great battell agaynst Eugenius,
when hee sawe the huge multitude
that was comming agaynst
him, (and so in the
sight of man there was apparant
ouerthrow at hand, he gets
him vp into a place eminent
or in the sight of all the armie,
falles downe prostrate
vpon the earth, beseecheth

God, if euer hee would looke
vpon a sinfull creature, to helpe
him at this time of greatest
neede: suddenly there rose a
mightie winde, which blew the
darts of the enemies backe vpon
themselues, in such wonderfull
maner, as Eugenius with
all his host was cleane discomfited,
who saw that the power
of Christ fought for his people,Exod. 14. 25.
and therefore cried in▪ effect
as the Egyptians did, O, God is
in the cloude: or God fighteth
for them. Thus with faith and
constancie haue the seruants of
God gone foorth against their
enemies with all deuotion, and
a through preparing of themselues
either for life or death, as
it should best stande with the
good pleasure of God. For
those therefore that vndertake
any attempt, either by sea or
land, wherein life more then
ordinarie is endaungered, let
them in the name of God, goe
forth with soules prepared: for

in so doing, they remember
themselues to haue a further
expectation, then either the gaining,
or loosing of a life temporal.

themselues before anie

Maister. When a good remembraunce

not returne voyd: Abraham had

and yet the Apostle to the Hebrues
saith,Heb. 11. 17. 
                  By faith Abraham of
fred vp Isaac: as if y• deed had bin
done, when his intention was
good to doe it, Whereby we see

that God doth accept a good
meaning heart, which is all we
can offer at these times. The
mercie of man extends it selfe
vnto his neighbour, saith the
Wise man, but the mercie of
God reacheth to all flesh; and
both can, and will, saue in a
moment: wherefore this suddennesse,
may not either giue
occasion to others to iudge vncharitably,
or vnto the patients
thēselues, to bee discōforted for
want of time. Non nocet bonis,
saith one,Ansel. 
                  si subito moriantur,
It dooth not hurt good men,
how suddenly soeuer they are
called away: so they depart
when God calleth them; which
time all must tarrie. For as the
pleasures of this world, should
not cause vs to bee altogither
addicted to the same: so also the
miseries of life, shoulde not
cause any, how deepely distressed
soeuer, distrustfully to flie
away; or desperately with Saul,
to iucurre his owne daunger:

which foule attemptes nature
herself doth abhorre: but christianitie
vtterly condemne. To
be any way accessarie vnto our
owne decay, or much lesse principall,
O God forbid. Fie vpon
that discontent, or faithlesse cowardlinesse,
to run away, or to
flie, where no feare is: God is a
sure refuge, and wil neuer fail:
God is a present helpe in trouble.
He that brought vs into
the worlde, should haue the calling
vs from the worlde. At
whose calling, we may meekelie
depart, as becommeth vs:
Abridge the time we may not,
we ought not, for all the afflictions
that may betide the
sonnes of men. The lawes of
nations haue forbid in this
case the benefite of decent buriall,
to terrifie men from this
shamefull fact of casting away
themselues desperatelie.
At the verie motions wherof,
the true Christian is woont

the tempter in the wildernesse:
Vade Satana, auoyde Sathan.
Thus therfore an humble submitting
our selues to Gods
pleasure, and also a faithfull
commending our soules into
his hands, how soone soeuer we
are called to depart, is that direction,
which we should put in
practise by the assisting help of
Gods blessed grace.

sonne, Filius hic mortuus erat,
                  Luc. 15. 31.
This my sonne was dead Sin
is a drowsie or heauie sleepe:
considering the season,Rom. 13. 11. saith
the Apostle, it is now time to
arise from sleepe. Newnesse of
conuersation is a resurrection;
and blessed are those that haue
part in this resurrection. Christ
when he rose,Ioan. 11. 39. he rose carely. Lazarus
that lay foure daies, began
to sauour. If we lie long
in our sinnes, we shal ware vnsauorie
too. But with the women
that came betimes with
sweete odors vnto the sepulcher;
we should bring our praiers
and supplications, which
are acceptable to the most highest.
Though wee doe not yet

Let vs not offer the first

of sinne, and serue God with
the lees and dregges of our age.
Let vs not yeeld the flower of
our life vnto the fowle affections
of sinfull nature, and reserue
for God the very refuse
of our time. It is no conquest
to ouercome a weake and feeble
enemie, to resist the pleasures of
the flesh, when nature it selfe is
decayed. Wee should consider
that our care is not so much

day we may wish we had done.
Wherfore let men

dutie after free iustification in
mercie, which only he expecteth
at our hands. Folly therefore
is it to flatter our selues in a
fruitlesse course of life, and to
deferre time vntil it be too late:
If God offer grace to day saith
S. Austen,
                  Tract 33. in Ioan. thou knowest not
whether he will offer the same
to morrow, & therfore now vse
it, if thou wilt vse it at all. The
light will shine when we shall
not see the closing in of that

day, the euening will come,
when we shall not see the breaking
forth of the morrowe
light. Lazarus after his want,
Diues for all his wealth, sicut
homines moriemini,

children of the most highest,
saith the Prophet, ye shall die
like men. Neither is that all,
but as Saint Peter saith,1. Pet. 4. 5 
                  Tanquam
rationem reddituri, which
shall giue accompt vnto him
which is readie to iudge both
quicke and dead, when the secrets
of all harts shall be disclosed,
when the foolish virgins
shall crie Lord, Lord, open
vnto vs: but it shall bee
answered, and said vnto them,Mat. 25. 12.
I know you not. But as for
the wise virgins, which haue
prouided oyle in their lampes,
they shall lift vp their heades
and passe vnto that ioyfull mariage
of the lambe. Now therefore

such thinges▪

But it is Durus sermo, a hard
saying, Discite, learne you: but
it will one day be a harder, if
men take not heede in time:
Discedite, get ye hence, depart
you. Dispatch therefore about
this businesse of learning to die,
the tide tarrieth no man: our
going to such and such a Citie
is vpon condition, Si, if God
will, if we liue, to set forward
in time is best: these after wits
are not so good.

reforme the same. A vaine

himselfe with hope of continuance.

expoundeth, saying: That the inuisible

God, as in deede they doe by
their wonderfull order and decencie
of motion. If all creatures
serue God, then much
more should man, for whome
they were all created, and hee
only for the honourable seruice
of God. Come we vnto man
his new birth, there he taketh
his couenant peny, to serue his
redeemer in holinesse and righteousnesse
all the daies of his
life. Consider we his iustification
and sanctification: there
wee finde him drawen by the
cordes of loue▪ vnto this sweet
yoake of Christ. It is a Maxime
in Morall Philosophie,

                  omne beneficium exigit officium,
euerie benefit doth require
a dutie. In nature where the
Sun doth extend the beames
of light, there the solide bodie
hath a reflexe of heate. But
that which doth often moue

should neuer forget) the author
of our health; our wealth, our
peace, our prosperitie and all,
if these moue not, we are inferior
vnto the insensible creatures,
if we should haue no reflexe
of dutie.
               Auncient histories make
mention how much religious
and de
                     •
                  out minded men haue
desired to passe ouer their daies
in this world in some priuate
and peaceable course of life.
It is said of Paphnutius, y• hee
betooke him wholy by this desire
to the seruice of God. Iohn
an Egiptian, of whom Saint
Ierome speaking, wee haue
seene: this Iohn (saieth hee)

so calme and angelicall kinde
of life, as is wonderfull,
wholly addicting himselfe to
liue and die in the seruice of
God.
               Now therefore if the promises
of grace and mercie in
Christ Iesus, if the greatnesse
of the rewarde layde
vppe for them that walke in
the way of Gods commandementes,
and keepe them
with their whole heartes,
(for is there not a rewarde
for the righteous? then might
they well say with the Prophete;Psal. 73 12.
                  Sine causa lauimus manus
inter innocentes, In vaine
haue wee washed our handes
amongst the innocente. If
promises I say, and those in
mercie cannot winne vs to
a iust remembrance of our estate
to come; yet at least to
bethinke our selues of this
reckoning day at hand should
somewhat moue vs in this case.

The rich man in his scalding
torments hath a Discite ex me,

O learne of me to take heede in

worldly pleasures, in sensuall
delights, the conclusion whereof
is sorrow and paine, when
they shal say, would to God we
had neuer offended so gracious

wee had neuer neglected so fauourable
a time of grace: Wold
to God we had neuer followed
the follies of a sinfull life: the

                     •
                  nket is pleasant, but the shot
will proue deep and chargeable
after an euill course: and therefore
if there be any consolation
in Christ Iesus, any comfort
of loue, any hope of mercy: if
there bee any feare or dread of
iudgement to come: consider
we of a future condition: prepare
wee our selues for a life
permanent; for an estate of all
continuance; and God of his
infinit mercy grant all grace so
to do. A speciall meane with

Gods good assistance to obtain
this calme & peaceable course of
life is to withdraw our selues
from the inordinate and excessiue
cares of this world; from
the too too much delight in these
earthly affaires, which is called
by diuines,

mentioning the sudden destruction
of those which murmured
against God in the wildernes,Psal. 78. 30.

                  While the meate was yet
                  in their mouthes, the wrath of
God came vpō them. Of which
very instance the Apostle saith,
These things came vpon them
for our example, and are written

to admonish vs vpon whom
the ends of the world are come.
If all this be not sufficient, yet
a consideration of Christ his
second comming to iudgement,
should at last moue euerie man
vnto a moste serious remembrance
of the time to come.
That which the holy Ghost
doth set downe so often, and is
in scripture forceablie expressed,
and that in too many places so
euidently laide before vs,
the holy Ghost doth thereby
shew, how diligently the same
subiect should bee considered of

himselfe sheweth in the Parable,
where the kingdome of
heauen is likened vnto a certaine
king,Mat. 18. 23. that will take account
of his seruants. God

other great differences
whereby Gods children are

discerned from the children of

that they are the children of
peace. Saul that had an euill
spirit, had an vnquiet and troublesome
spirit, but Dauid that
had a good spirit, had a spirite
of peace. Amongst the punishmentes
of Egypt, that of the
flies was not the least, which
would not suffer the Egiptians
to rest. In like manner amidst
this worlds felicity these
combersome thoughtes are
wont much to molest y• worlds
followers. The graces y• flow

often vnto riuers and pleasant
waters. These riuers abide
not on the higher mountaines,

in the Israelites, to desire rather

praier is with the Prophete:
One thing haue we desired of y•

is wont to afforde the

good? The bird, who
for necessity is faine sometimes
to staire vpon the earth, is notwithstanding
for the most part
soaring in the aire, where she
tunes many a quiet and pleasant
dittie. In like manner for
necessities sake onely, our cogitations
are sometimes on
thinges here beneath: but our
chiefe delight should be higher,

conscience; where no distracting
thoughts, which are wont to
disturbe the louers of this

they are risen with Christ, and
therefore seeke the things that

blindnesse in this: when men
might bee more at peace, they
neuer leaue climing vntill they
take a fall, they looke vnto pleasures

as they are comming to
them, not as they are going
from them, when they are
woont to leaue trouble behind.
It were to be wished, that men
would once withdrawe themselues
from vnnecessary cares &
desires, in seeking too vehementlie
the vaine riches and
pleasures of this worlde, which
are so much in request as they
are. In so doing might they not
passe ouer the dayes of their
pilgrimage more peaceablie,
more religiouslie? They might,

now departing the worlde by
giuing good examples vnto others,
all considering the state
and condition of life it selfe,
which is but as a flower. First
it buddeth, then comes the blooming
and flowrishing, a little
after it withereth, and is gone.
Wherefore man (saith one) may
bee well greeted with a threefolde
salutation. From childehoode

to thirtie, the greeting
is, you are welcome. From
thirtie to fiftie, the greeting is,
you are in a good day. From
that time afterwarde, Then
God giue you a good departure.
Nowe therefore gentlie to accomplish
this iourney, to passe
from childehoode to youth,
from youth to strength, from
strength to olde age, from
olde age to death: as certaine

soft course to runne through a
