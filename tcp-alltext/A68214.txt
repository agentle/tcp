            ¶To the mooste puisaunt
Prince, and our most redoubted
Soueraign Lord, Edward
the syxt, by y• grace of God, Kyng of
England, Fraunce, and Ireland, defender
of the fayth, & in earth next,
and immediately vnder God, of the
Churches of England, and Ireland
the supreme head. And also vnto the
moste wyse, godly, and most honorable
Lordes of his highnes priuie coū
               cel,
his most humble, louing, and obedient
subiecte Ihon Hoper, electe
and sworne Byshoppe of Glocester,
wysheth al grace and peace from
God, wyth long, and the same
most godlye & prosperous
raigne ouer vs, in all
honoure, healthe,
and perpetual
felicitie.
            
               AMong al other
moste noble and famous
dedes of kinges,
and Princes,
none is more godlye,
commendable,
nor profytable to

the cōmon wealth, then to promote,
and set forthe vnto their subiectes
the pure, and sincere religion of the
eternal God, kyng of al kynges, and
Lord of al Lordes. Then shal iustice,
peace, and concord raygne, the doore
of Idololatrie be shut vp, vi the whyche
hath entred all euyl, and kynges
and kyngdomes fallen into ieopardye,
as the writinges of y• Prophets
do testifie. But the more thys noble
fact is glorious, godly, and princely,
the more difficile & hard it is. For the
enemy of God & of al mankynd, the
Deuyll, customablye is wont to deceiue
the princes of ye world, so that
eyther they vtterly neglect the religion
of the true God as a thynge folyshe,
and of no estimacion, eyther
prouoke thē cruelly to persecute it.
If he cā bryng neither ye one, neither
the other of these to pas: he wyll do
the beste de can to preserue a myxte,
and myngled religion, that shall nether
playnly be agaynst, nor wholye
wyth hym: And so vse the matter,
that partly goddes truth shall take
place, partly the supersticious inuē
               cion
of man. The whych myngled

and myxed religion is so muche the
more daungerous, as it is accompted
for pure and good. Therfore it is
earnestlye forbidden by God, as the
examples of the scripture declareth.
Iehu the kynge of the Israelites
when he had remoued all grosse and
sensible Idololatrye: and with the
swerde had taken away all the Idololatricall
priestes. iii. Reg. x, is reproued
of God, neuertheles because
he walked not in the lawe of God
wyth all his herte, and lefte not the
wayes of Ieroboam. And againste
these minglers and patchers of Religion
speaketh Elias the Prophet,
iii. Reg. xviii. Howe longe sayth he
wyl ye halt on both sides. If y• Lord
be God, folow hym, if Baal, go ye after
hym. Euen so we may iustly say:
If y• priesthod & ministery of Christe
with his notes and markes be true,
holy, & absolutely perfect, receiue it:
in case it be not, folow y• pope. Christ
can not abide to haue the leuē of the
pharises myngled wyth hys swete
flowre. He wold haue vs ether hote,
or cold, the luke warme he vometeth
vp: and not wythout a cause.
            
               
For he accuseth God of ignorancie
and folishenes, that entendeth to adorne
and beutifye his doctrine and
decrees with humaine cogitacions.
What kynge or prince of the world
wold suffer hys statutes, lawes, and
testament to be cut of, and set on at
euery mans libertie and pleasure?
Shulde not the same glory, maiesty,
and honour be geuē vnto the lawes
and testament of Christ, that is sealed
wyth hys precious bloude? The
worde of God wherwyth he gouerneth
and ruleth his church, is a septer
of yron. Psal. ii. and not a rod of
wylowe to be bowed wyth euerye
mans finger, either a rede to be broken
at mans wyll: no, neither a pece
of lether to be stretched and reached
out wyth any mans teth.
            These thynges be spoken of me
most gracious and vertuous kyng,
to commende youre maiestyes and
your moste honorable councels doinges
that seke the glorye of God
and the restituciō of hys holye and
Apostolycall churche. The whyche
thing, as your highnes & your most
honourable and wyse councel, haue

gracyouslye be gon: goddes mercye
in the bowels of Chryst Iesu graūt
you moost gratiously to perfourme.
The people of Englande were oppressed
wyth the vyolente and cruel
tyrannye of Antychryste: darckenes
and ignorauncie occupied y• mindes
all moost of all menne, so that fewe
knew the true way to eternal saluatyon.
And yet manye Prynces and
wysemen delyte and tarye in thys
darckenesse, and can not or wyll not
bare nor suffer the radiant and shynynge
beames of the Gospell, more
then the night crow can the beames
of the sonne: but the merciful father
of heauen shall better their syghte
when hys good and mercyfull pleasure
is. But the Lorde be praysed
your magestye: youre moste honourable
and wyse counsel, haue not cared
what y• greatest parte, but what
the better dothe, that the lawe of
the hyghe and myghtye God, maye
be knowne to your hyghnes people,
as did Dauid, Iosaphat, Ezechias
and Iosyas. And in your maiesties
so doing, ye bynde not only the true
and lyuynge members of Chryste to

geue God thanckes in thys behalfe
but also declare your selfe to be the
verye fauroure, nource, and helper
of the word of God according to the
sayinge of Esaye .xlix. Perseuer gracyous
kynge in thys quarel & daungerous
enterpryce. Youre hyghnes
shall not neade to feare eyther the
strength or cautelles of your ennemyes
for there is no witte, wsdome,
nor coūcel against ye Lord as Salomō
saith pro. xxi. No although they
had syluer as the grauell of the sea,
and golde as commune as the claye
of the stretes. zach. ix. for albeit the
horse is prepared for the day of battell,
yet the vyctorye commeth from
the Lorde Prouerb .xxi. I am he
sayth the Lord that do comfort you,
what art thou that fearest mortall
manne, eyther the sonne of manne,
that shalbe made as haye, canst thou
for got the Lorde thy maker, yt streachith
forthe the heauens, and laieth
the foundacion of the earthe? Esa.
li. Let these diabolycall soundes, &
speakynges of euel menne, nothyng
trouble your highnes, nor your wise

and godly councellour
                  •
               . As long as
the kynge is in hys tender age hys
councell shulde do nothinge in matters
of religyon. For those mens folishenes
(rather I shuld sai malice)
is condemned by the worde of God
that teacheth howe a kynge in hys
younge age wyth hys wyse and
godlye counsell shoulde abolyshe Idolatrye,
and sette forthe the true,
& godly religyon of the liuing God.
Thus declareth the notable & godlie
facte of Iosias that folowed the
relygyon of hys father not Ammon
the Idolater, but of Dauid, nor declynynge
to the rightt hande, neyther
to the left hand. And destroyed
not onlie the Images of his father,
but also of Ieroboā, & of Solomon.
iiii. Reg. xxii .xxiii. This scuit of Iosias
holp his godly coūcellers, & vertuous
priestes. Euē so Ioas beynge
but a child was holp by his coūcellers
in the lyke procedinges & reformaciō
of religion. In case yt princes,
Bishops, & priests had not knowen
it to be the cōmaundemēt of God to
haue obeyed these .ii. yonge & godlye
kynges, they wold not haue consented
vnto his procedinges.
            
               
But we see howe gladde they were
to do it. The Princes and councellours
moued no sedicion, the Bishop
and the priestes soughte not for the
defence of their proper doctrine, eyther
to myngle theirs with goddes,
but were content wyth the sole and
onely lawe of God. Ye noble Princes
and councellours, praise be vnto
the liuinge God for your great wisdome,
and godlye assistaunce in this
behalfe. And the Lorde be magnifyed
in all the godlye and learned Bishoppes,
and others of this Realme
that haue, and do put to their helpes
and studies to brynge the churche of
Chryste to her olde, and reuerende
perfeccion agayn. And al other that
hynder your maiesties godlye purpose,
openly, or secretelye, God wyll
douteles reuenge at length.
            The godly and vertuouse begynnynges,
moste noble Prince, of your
father the kynges maiestie, Henry
the eyght of a blessed memorie, shall
by your hyghnes godlye be ended,
in hym that can and wyl do al thinges
for Christ his deare sōnes sake.
And a thousande tymes the rather

shal your maiestie restore agayn the
true ministerie of ye church, incase ye
remoue & take away all y• monumē
               tes,
tokens, & leauinges of papistry.
For as longe as anye of them remayne,
there remayneth also occasion
of relapse vnto the abolyshed
supersticion of Antichriste. Seynge
I see in the writynges of the Prophets,
God to require the obseruacion
of his lawe onely, concerninge
religion: and threatneth all Prynces,
priestes, and prophets wt his displeasure
that neglecte or contaminate
it with their own cogitacions:
I can do no lesse, howe soeuer the
worlde shall take my doynges: but
exhorte and pray the magistrates to
brynge the churche to her fyrst perfeccion.
For if I shulde studye to
please man herein, I were not the
seruaunt of God. And I am afrayd
leste the dissease that infected the
Pharises, infecteth also many now
a dayes, that minister in the church,
vnto whom Chryst spake. Ihon .v.
Howe can ye beleue, that seeke glorye
one of other, and the glory of
God ye contemne. God geue grace

I maye not saye. Hinc ille lacrime.
            Helpe ye therefore O ye Byshoppes
and pryestes, the kynges maiestyes
and hys noble couurelles procedinges,
that all thynges maye be
broughte to a perfecte and Apostolicall
reformacion, it is not inoughe
to laye the foundacion of the temple,
but there muste bee buylded vpon
it golde, syluer, and precyous
stone. But in anye case wee muste
take heede we laye no strawe, nor
stubble upon the foundacion, if we
do, it wyll be burned. i. Corrinth. iii.
If wee do not buylde vp vpon the
foundacion, then shal we be shente
as the Israelites were. Agge .i.
Lette no manue excuse hym selfe vpon
the kynges maiesties age, for the
age canne not excuse the kynges maiestie
it selfe, If hys relygyon in
hys youthe be accordynge to goddes
woorde, he hathe the fauoure
and promyses of God to blesse, preserue
and keepe hys maiestye, and
hys Realme, thoughe the Deuyll,
and hys members wolde saye nay.
If in youthe hys maiestye take a

wronge relygyon, he shall bee assisted
of goddes displeasure, as it is
to be seene .iiii. Regum. xxi.
            Manasses beynge of twelue yeres
olde was crouned kynge, and in his
youth reuoked the Idololatry that
his father Ezechias had abolished,
and in hys so doing displeased haynously
y• maiestie of God, & at lēgth
was sore afflicted, and punyshed for
his so doyng. Behold y• displeasure of
God in a yonge kynge for a false religion.
Ieoachim crouned the eyght
yere of hys age, for the euyll he dyd
in the syghte of the Lorde, he was
taken prisoner by the kynge of Babilon
.ii. Paral. xxxvi, wyth all the
goodly vessels of the Lorde
            Thys kinge raygned but thre monethes
& ten dayes before the Lorde
reuenged the false doctrine he mainteined.
These examples I dout not,
moste godlye kynge, and vertuouse
councellers, moneth you to be carefull
of the true religion. The Lorde
hathe strengthe and power inough,
seeke ye hym, and geue no place to
the infirme perswasions of the flesh,
for the Lorde shall be wyth you.
            
               
Souche as thynke peace and quyetnes,
shal come to the realme a better
waye, then to haue the true relygyon
of God restored, they shal knowe
the contrarye in the Prophete. Ie.
Chapter .vi. the whyche Chapter if
the kynges maiestye bare in mynde
and folowe it is wourthe a kynges
reuenue: If a Lord, the value of hys
lande: if the Byshoppe, the estimacion
of hys Byshopprycke: if the marchaunte
the gaynes of hys laboure:
if the husbande hys Oxen & plough.
And the same commaunded God, Leuit
.xxv. Obserue my statutes, and
my iudgementes then shal ye dwell
safelye in the earth: and the earthe
shal brynge forthe her frute, ye shall
eate and be satyfied, and dwel in the
earthe wyth out feare. It is a fonde
opynyon most gracyous kynge, and
vnmete for a chrystyan man to bare
the Magystrates of God in hande
that incase the doctryne of Chryste,
and hys holy sacramentes shuld not
be decked and set forthe wyth these
plausible, and well lykynge ceremonyes
(that is to speake playnelye wt 
papysticall superstisticion) it were

to be feared of sediciō and tumults.
Doutelesse if the Popes members
woulde not deceyue the people, but
teach thē gods word, y• people wold
sone see the truthe, and willingelye
leaue asmuch as God and their king
shulde commaunde them, as y• gests
and factes of Iosyas, and Ioas declareth.
Moste gracyous kynge and
noble councellers as ye haue taken
away the Masse from the people, so
take from them her fethers also: the
aulter, vestmentes, and suche like as
apparelled her. And lette the holye
communion be decked wyth the holye
ceremonyes that the hyghe and
wyse preyste Chryste deckyed and
apparelled her fyrste of all. And frō
whence (myghtye Prynce and soueraygne
Lord) spryngeth warre, and
sedicion? Come they not frome the
onlye God beynge angrye, for the
neclectynge of hys lawe: so we be
taughte by Esa. l. And Ieremye .ix.
sayeth, who is wise & vnderstandeth
thys, and he vnto whom the mouth
of the Lord hath spoken & declareth
wherefore the earth perisheth, and is
like vnto the burned wildernes yt no

man maye passe by it. And the Lord
sayed, because they haue forsakē my
lawe, whyche I put vnto them, and
hearde not my wayes, and walketh
not therein, but folowed the desyre
of theyr owne hertes, and after Baalimas
they were taughte by there
fathers: And because wee myngle
mennes inuencyons wyth his lawe.
For he sayeth menne worshyp hym
in vayne wyth the preceptes of men
Math. xv. And in the .ix. of Ieremy
the Lord declareth other manner of
causes of warre and sedicion. The
forsakynge of hys lawe, not to harken
vnto his voyce, nor to walke in
hys wayes, to go after the prauitye
and euylnes of euer owne hartes.
The viciatynge and iuste vse of the
Lordes supper. i. Cor. xi. Also y• neglecrynge
of wydowes and orphalynges
causes, not to iudge ryghte
iudgemente to the power Ierem. v.
These causes muste be auoyded or
else truelye thy sayinge of Ieremye
wyll take place. Chap. vii. You trust
in youre selfes and in lyes that nothynge
profytteth. The nexte waye
to returne the hande of gods angre,

& great displeasure against vs is to
folowe Iosophat the kinge, that appoynted
good iudges and godlye
pryestes in euerye cyty. The iudges
to iudge after the true lawes of the
realme, and the preystes to do all
thynges in the churche accordynge
to the worde of God which teacheth
suche knowledge and feare of God
and of the magystrates, that all the
wysedome, lawes, and bokes that
euer were made be but counterfeete
and folyshe in respecte of it. Nor euer
had God in heauen, or kynge vpon
the earthe suche a frende as is
the holy Bible. For it reacheth y• people
and subiectes of the realme, the
feare of God, obedyence to the kynges
maiestye and hys Magestrates
and all mutuall and fraternal loue.
Thys example and counsel of Iosaphat
if it beneglected ther cā no godlynes
be amonge the people as the
texte sayeth when Prophecye wanteth,
the people shall be dysipated &
scattered abrode Prouerves. xxix.
To the doinges of these godlye offyces
shoulde all menne be exhorted specyallye
suche as bare the name of

Bishoppes and preistes. If they will
not be desyrous and glad to haue, &
helpe the mynistery of the church to
the primatyue and perfecte estate agayne,
the Lorde dothe crye vengeaunce
towardes them, and wyl not
onlye requyre the lose of them selfes
but also of all the people at theire
handes Ezech. iii. xxxiii. Let them
remember the complaynte of God
hym selfe Ierem. i. My people hath
haue a loste flocke, my shepperdes
haue deceiued them, and haue made
them go astraye vpon the hylles. If
these threatnynges wyll not amend
theym Gracyous Kynge, and you
my honourable Lordes of his highe
counsel, muste do wyth them as the
mariners did with Ionas. What y•
is, seing it pleased the kinges maiestie
and you my Lordes of his moste
honourable councell in the lente to
heare by me, I haue nowe at the request
of manye godlye persons caused
it to come abrode, and dedicated
the same to youre Pryncelye maiestye,
and mooste prudente Counsell
that youre hyghenes maye be bothe
iudge and recorde of my doctrine vnto

youre Maiestyes true and louing
subiectes. The whyche doctryne is
Catholyke, and godly in al thynges
nothynge dyssentinge, but agreable
wyth the Prophetes and the Aposteles,
as I am, (accordynge to my
bonnden dutye) redye at all tymes
to make answere, if anye thyng shal
be attempted to the contrarye. Incase
ther be now & thē added a word
more or lesse, or peraduenture some
sentence, yet I know well ye matter
is not chaunged nor aultered other
wyse then I spake it before youre
maiestye, for I haue memoryaies,
wherin I wrot before y• inuenciō, order,
& disposition of al the matters
I wolde entreate vpon: As I vse, &
euer wyl doo of all thinges I speake
in goddes behalfe to the people, wryt
my selfe, or cause an other to wryte,
the pethe, and disposycion of al thinges
I speake vpon, that I maye
as well learne a farther knoweledge
my selfe thereby, as make answere
to myne enemyes, if any shuld
accuse me of false doctryne. The
God of all strengthe and consolation
gouerne poure maiestye an youre

            ¶The fyrste Sermon
made the .xix. day of March, in
the yere of our lord a. M.CCCCC.L.
before the kinges maiestie & his most
honourable Counsel, by Ihon
Hoper Preacher, vpon
the holy Prophet
Ionas.
            
               ¶Preface vnto the
Prophet.
               
                  IT is the offyce
and dewty
of euerye good
chyld, that studiousli
laboreth
to obey and folow hys fathers
commaundemente, before all
thynges, to know perfectly the
nature and condiciō of hys fathers
wyl. Wherof if he be ignoraunte:
manye tymes in the
same thynges he iudgeth best
of, he moste offendeth, and the

thynges moste pleasaunte and
acceptable, as thynges moste
dyspleasaūt and vnacceptable
vnto hys father: he flyeth, and
refuseth. Euen so wee that be
subiectes and the chyldren of
God the father almyghty, can
do nothyng gratefully and acceptable
vnto his Maiesty, excepte
we first knowe hys good
wyl and pleasure towards vs:
or else we shal ther most offēde
hym, wher as we mynde moste
to please him. And agayn happyly
to improue as pernicious
and heretycal, that his wisdom
approueth to be most Godlye
and profytable. Wherefore as
the fyrste poynte of a louynge
Childe, is to know, what pleasyth,
and what dyspleasyth,
what contentyth and what discontentyth

hys father, least he
should by ignoraūce displease,
where as hys sonnelyke affeccion
by naturall zeale woulde
please: so is it the second poynt
of a good Chylde (hys fathers
wyll once trulye knowen) dyligently
to obserue and kepe the
same, least he should by neglygence
or contempt be seene wilfullye
to contemne the thynge
he hathe wyth dylygence and
studye obedyentlye submyttyd
hym selfe vnto. And incase (as
suche cases be moste common
and daylye) that infyrmities or
other occasyon ledde the sonne
from the obedyence of hys father:
The thyrde poynte of hys
dewtie is, speedely to acknowledge
his offēce, and desyre pardon
& merci for his trāsgressiō,

As the prodigal and disobedient
sonne dyd. Luke. xv. And
Dauid. ii. Samuel. and so after
the remyssyon and pardon
obtayned, to be more circumspect
and wyse how he fall and
transgresse agayne. Psal. li.
               These proposicions and sentences
be so true, that no resonable
man doubteth of them.
But as the deuyll hath lefte in
the world no truth nor veritie,
whych by argument and question
he hathe not called into
dout: so trobleth he in this case
the myndes of men wyth twoo
questiōs. The first is how and
from whence the wyll of God
maye be knowen. The seconde
what ye wil of god is: So hath
he preuayled amonge men for
synne, that the truthe of these

questions is vnknowen to the
greatest part of the world, as it
was in Moses tyme, Christes
tyme, & now in oure tyme more
ignoraunte and far from God,
thē thei. He perswaded in those
daies that the wil of God was
knowen, not from heauen nor
out of the scripture Canonical,
as the Patriarches, Prophets
and the Apostles tawghte, but
that it was knowē by the writings,
decrees, and statutes of
mē that were in the earth, and
that the wyl of God was to do
that man commaunded, and
not that God commaunded.
               But as almighty God left not
hys Church thē, wythout some
that shoulde kepe the truthe of
bothe these questions amonge
the people, to preserue thē from

the daunger that muste needes
folowe, where as truthe is not
knowē. So hath he done now
at thys presente tyme. And by
the same authoritie (as the deuyll
authore and father of all
questions and lyes) was confounded
thē, so is he now. Moses
instructynge the people in
the truith of the fyrst questyon
whence the wyl of God should
be knowē, commaundeth them
neither to loke it in Aegipt nor
else where, but in the worde of
God. Deut. xxx. and Sayncte
Paule doth the same. Roma. x.
and S. Ihon .i. sayth: Noman
hath sene the father, but ye sōne,
and he vnto whome the sonne
hathe openyd the father vnto.
God therefore and hys blessed
wyll is knowen vnto vs, because

he hathe spoken vnto vs
by hys deare beloued sonne.
               Heb. i. As he spake before time
vnto ye world by his prophets.
From Christ therfore and hys
worde, commeth the knowlege
of Gods wil, for the father bid
vs hire him. Mat .iii.vii. Io. x.
Nowe what hys wil is, ye truth
also appereth out of the booke
of God and oute of none other
mans writinges. Mark. i. hys
wyll to the worlde is thys: Do
penaunce, and beleue the Gospel.
That is to saye: let euerye
man bewayle, and repēt him of
hys synnes, and desyre the remyssyon
and pardon thereof
for Christes sake. For whom,
the Gospel sheweth, our sinnes
shalbe forgeuē. Ihon. i.iii.iiii.
v. vi. Math. xi. Rom. v. Eph. i.

Thys doctrine from the fal of
mā hath bene alwayes taught
in the Catholicke Churche of
Christ vnto al nacions, as the
wrytynges of the Prophetes,
and Apostles dothe testifye: in
whom is fully, and aboūdaūtly
conteined al truth, and veritie,
and lefte here for oure doctrine
and consolaciō. Rom. xv.
Among the whych is also conteyned
as a most faythful wytnesse
of all truthe, and verytie,
thys holye Prophet Ionas,
who was sende by God to the
Citie of Niniue, to preach vnto
them Gods pleasure, and amendemēt
of lyfe, or else wythin
fourtye daies, both they and
the Citie, shoulde be destroied.
               Thys Prophet haue I takē
to interpretate for two causes.

The one, to declare vnto ye
kynges maiestye and his most
honorable coūsel, that the doctryne
we preach vnto hys maiesties
subiectes, is one and the
same, with the Prophetes, and
Apostles. And as olde as the
doctrine of them both, and not
as new as these Papystes, and
new learned men of Papystry,
wold beare the people in hand.
The secōde cause is: to declare
whych way the synfull worlde
may be reconcyled vnto God.
And for the better vnderstandynge
of the Prophet, I wyll
deuide him into fowre partes.
The fyrst cōteineth, into what
daunger Ionas fel by dysobeing
of Gods commaundemēt.
The seconde parte conteyneth,
howe Ionas vsed hym selfe in

the fyshes bellye. The thyrde
part conteineth the amēdemēt,
and cōuersyon of the Niniuites
at ye preachyng of Ionas.
The fourth part cōteyneth an
obiurgacion, & rebuke of god,
because Ionas lamented the
saluacion of ye people and citie.
            
            
               The fyrst Parte.
               The first part is deuided in
to thre members. The one conteineth
the Embassage, and legacye
of Ionas vnto Niniue.
The other conteyneth Ionas
dysobedience. The thyrde conteyneth
the payne and punishment
of Ionas disobedience.
               ¶The Embassage is described
wyth these wordes.
               
                  THe worde of the
Lorde came vnto
Ionas ye sōne

of Amithai, saying: Arise,
and get the to Niniue
that great Citie, &
crye out againste it, for
theyr wyckednesse is
come vp before me.
               It is not ye lest help that the
reder or teacher of ani prophet
or other part of ye scriptur shal
haue, to knowe of what place,
vnder what king, in what state
of cōmon wealth, ye prophet liued,
yt he purposith to interpretate:
al these things as touchīg
our Ionas, is declared in the
iiii. booke of ye kings, the. xiiii.
cap. He liued in Samaria vnder
an Idololatrical king Ieroboam,
ye sonne of Ioas, a detestable
Idololater: & in Iuda
at yt time reigned kīg Amasias
               
                  
And thys Ionas labored in
the ministery of Gods word at
one tyme, wyth Amos, Oseas,
and Ioell the true Prophetes
of God. The state and condicion
of the commone wealthe,
was troublous and verye vnquiet,
forbecause ye Israelits bi
their Idololatri in folowing yt
learning inuented by man, and
leuing ye word of god, God punyshed
them wt many greate &
cruel warres, Yet after hys accustomed
pytye and compassiō
vpon those that he punysheth,
to remoue ye occasion that worketh
gods yre and displeasure,
he sent them dyuers tymes his
holy Prophetes, that shoulde
cal thē from theyr Idololatry
and corrupt lyuyng as Elias,
Elizeus, and this our Prophet

Ionas, but all in vayne: they
wold be noughty Idololatres
and vicious lyuers continually,
mawgree gods heade, and
would (as we now adayes, for
the most parte do) rather geue
faythe vnto the Prophetes of
men, and lyars, then vnto the
Prophetes of god, that be true
men: But ther reward was (as
ours shalbe, except we amende)
vtter destrucciō, and losse both
of them selues, and theyr commune
wealthe. The commone
wealth and state of Israel and
Iuda, thus troublouslye being
afflicted, the commaundement
of god came vnto thys oure
Ionas, that he sholde go to the
great Citie of Niniue, as the
text saith. In the which words
note fyrste that no man can, or

may teach truly ye word of god,
but he be called ordynarylye,
or extraordinarily. Ordinarily
wher as is no corruptiō of the
ministery in the church, neither
in doctrine, neither in the right
ministracion of the sacramēts,
whyche be as seales and conclusions
of Gods holy worde.
Wher as this integritie I say
remayneth in the Churche, noman
ought wtout the appointment
of the hygher powers to
intrude or appoynt hym self to
preache, or minister, as it was
in Moses tyme and the Apostelles.
               Extraordinaryly is, when
immediatelye any mā is called
by God, wher as the ministery
of the church is corrupted, as it
was in the tyme of yt prophets

and of Christ, that called to minister
such as the common face
and greatest multitude of the
worlde, woulde not admitte, no
not the hygh byshop, and those
that then were called the holye
churche, as is to be seene by Amos,
Ionas, Hieremie, Moses
and Paule, wyth other. They
are to be rebuked therfore that
intrudeth and put them selues
wythout lawful callynge into
ye ministerye of ye Church, other
wyth money, or praier, and bye
them selues into the Churche,
which thing through al papistry
is acōmon practyse & dayly
vsed thinge. For in case they
sought not of their bishopprik
more ryches and honoure, then
the necessari trauels & labours
that be annexed vnto the vocacacion,

they woulde not stryue
so sore who might lepe vp first
to the bishoppes and persones
vocacion. Ther woulde not so
many princes contend, and labour,
for the seate of Rome, the
nest of abhominacion. If ther
were not in it rather the patrimonye
of Iudas and Simon
Magus, then the laboure of
Christ & Peter, more ease then
payne, more ryches then bourden.
The Text saith: that thys
prophet beyng called by God,
was sente to Niniue. Of thys
cityes originall, reade the .x. of
of Gen. It was the chiefe citie
of the Assiriās, vnto the whych
Ionas was sent and the consideracion
therof, that in case the
heade Citye be well instructed
of a realme, there is the better

hope of all the reast. Therfore
god hath vsed from the beginnynge
of common wealthes to
be mercyfull vnto the greatest
cities therof, and hath sent the
most preachers of y• truithe, as
it is to be seene in these dayes,
what God hathe shewed vpon
London. And as he offereth
them fyrste the tokens of hys
merci, so first he reuēgeth their
vnkyndnes wyth hys punishment
(if they neglect and contemne
the grace offered.) It is
to be noted that thys Cytye of
Niniue was Idololatrycall,
and Gentelyshe, neuer vnder
the dysciplyne and doctryne of
Moses.
               Yet vnto it sendeth the lord
his Prophet to declare vnto ye
                  
Iewes that the Ceremonies &
workes of the law, wherof they
most gloried and extolled them
selues, were not necessari to saluacion,
but geuen for a time to
excercise theyr obedience in the
commaundement of God. And
to trust in Christe of whō their
rites & sacrifices were fygures
and shadowes of: further the
Lorde declareth by thys embassage
vnto Niniue, that the
ignoraunte and supersticious
Gētils be more redy to receaue
the lyuing worde of God, then
the harde harted Iewes: As it
is to be sene at thys presēt day.
More easie it is to conuert vnto
God ten symple and ignoraunt
soules, thē one that hath
bene broughte vp, & is wedded
to the vngodlye doctryne and

tradycions of men. Moreouer
the Lord in sekyng the wealth
of these Assitiās, declareth that
he is not onelye the God of the
Iewes, but also of the Gētils.
Rom. iii. Act. x. The text declareth
to what ende Ionas was
sent to the Citye. What to doto
bryng in the Ceremonyes of
of Moses law? Nay, but to cry
out agaynst it. That is to say,
playnlye and openlye to shewe
Gods pleasure vnto them: and
not agaynst one or twoo of the
citie, but generally against the
whole Citie, without respect of
persons: Against the kyng, the
Prynces, the lawers, the Priestes,
and the common people.
And thys was the dewtye and
offyce of all the Prophetes.
               Esay. lviii. Crye out and ceasse

not. Also Hier. ii.vii. The same
commaundemente was geuen
to all the Apostles, Mark. xvi.
Math. xxviii. The same commaundeth
S. Paule. ii. Tim.
iiii. preache in tyme and out of
tyme. Th
                     •
                  s is the note and
marke to know the byshoppes
and ministers of god, from the
mynisters of the deuyll: by the
preachyng tounge of the Gospel,
and not by shauyng, clyppyng,
vestyments and vtward
apparel. The text maketh answer
to an obiecciō that myght
be demaunded wherefore God
woulde sende Ionas, a man of
base sorte, to rebuke so greate
a kyng wyth hys councell and
common wealth.
               Because theyr syns

are come vp before the
face of the Lord.
               Of thys aunswer we learn
three thynges. The fyrste that
the Lorde seyth, marketh, and
is displeased wyth our sinnes,
althoughe we lyue in al securitie
and careles, as though oure
synnes offended God nothyng
at all. The seconde, as manye
tymes as God sendeth suche
Preachers, as wythoute feare
sheweth vnto the world Gods
woorde, and punyshmente for
synne, that theyr synne is full
rype, and that they must either
amende at the preachynge, or
vtterlye to peryshe vnder the
plage, and scourge of God.
               Thus Noah was preacher
before the flood, Ionas before

the destrucciō of Niniue, Loth
of Sodome, Christ and his Apostles
of Hierusalem. Seyng
nowe that God hathe sent hys
worde, hys king, his magistrates,
and hys Preachers into
England, it is (take hede of it)
a very token, that the sinnes of
Englande is ascended vp into
hys sight, and that out of hand
we amend, or sodenlye to looke
for the most seuere & cruel punyshment
of God. Al men confesse,
that synne neuer so aboū
                  ded,
but none of vs say it is I
that prouoke the Ire of God.
and I wil amēd. The nobilitie
putteth al the fault in the people,
the people in the nobilitye,
in the Bishops, marchauntes,
priestes, and other. But wil ye
he iudged, at one worde by the

testimony of a noble wise man.
Noble Esay the prophet saith:
The Oxe knoweth hys Lord,
and y• Asse hys owners stable,
wo is me, ye sinful people, people
laden with iniquitie, a sede
malicious, lost childrē: ye haue
forsaken the Lord, and the holy
one of Israel ye haue prouoked,
as Esay. i. Let euery man
looke vpon hym selfe, knowledge
hys synne, and studye to
amend it from the hyghest to
the lowest, for the Lord is redy
to smyte.
               The thyrd doctryne oute of
thys place is a descripcion of
Gods nature, and longe sufferaunce
towards kyngdomes,
realmes, publicke and priuate
persons, for wher as he myght
most iustlye punyshe and take

vengeaunce vpō vs for synne,
he is yet so mercyfull that he
premonysheth, & forewarneth
of hys scourge to come, by hys
prophets, Apostles, and preachers,
and wylleth the worlde
to amende: in case they so do, he
wyl turne hys Ire from them,
if they wyl not, no remedye but
vtter destruccion, as ye maye
read. Gene. vii. of the flud. Ge.
xix. of Sodomme. Exo. xiiii. of
Pharo. But let vs rather folow
the exāple of the Niniuits
and amende, then the example
of the Aegiptians, and perish.
Thus much is to be takē hede
of, in the legacye of Ionas in
the fyrste parte of the chapter.
               Now foloweth the seconde
part conteyning Ionas dysobediēce
after this sort in ye text.
               
                  
Wher vpon Ionas
rose to fly from the face
of the lord into Tharsis,
& came to Iapho,
& founde a shyp pressed
towards Tharsis, paiing
his passage, he wēt
into her, to come wyth
them vnto Tharsis.
               Ionas was cōmaūded to cry
& preach against ye Niniuites,
but being afeard, & suspecting
yt difficulty of yt vocaciō, flyith
an other way. Here first ar two
things to be noted: whether he
flyeth, & frō whēce he flieth, the
text saith he fledde to Tharsis,
which some mē thīk is yt sea called
Mare mediterraneū, but y• more
true opiniō is, yt Tharsis is the
citi caled Tunes, or Carthage.

Iapho is the citie called Ioppe,
a hauē towne in Palestina.
He flieth from the face of God,
that is to wyte from the beneuolente
and mercyful god that
appoynted hym to the vocacion
of preachyng. Of thys text
we learne manye Godlye doctrines.
First, how hard & difficult
a vocaciō it is, to be a preacher,
that incase he be not wyth
a synguler mercy of God comforted
and strengthned, he can
not, nor is it possyble he shuld
preach truly Gods word, as it
is to be sene by Moses. Ex. v.
vi. Esay. vi. Hier. i.ii. Math. x.
and in thys ye may see the dyuersitie
betwene the ministerye
of God, & of y• deuil, of Christ,
and of Antechrist. Christs mynistery
is ful of labors, paines

sclounders, and calamytyes.
Antichrist is ful of care, pleasures,
cōmodities, & honoures:
as ye maye see through all the
kingdom of the Pope, for ther
is not a byshoppricke nor benefice
cā fal, but ten ar reddy to
take it or it come to the groūd.
Yea, and healpe awaye the incumbēt
wyth an Italion figge
before tyme, as ye may rede of
Uictor the thyrd. The seconde
doctryne is, that who so euer
leaueth vndone the office commaunded
vnto him by god, flieth
from the fauour and good
wyl of God, as it is to be sene.
i. Regu. xv. Here be al bishops
and priestes admonished to beware
how they leaue their deuties
and cures. They flie from
y• face of god as many as beare

that name and preache not the
word of God, and instruct not
the people after the mouthe of
god. Myserable and cursed is
our tyme of gods owne mouth
that ther be such dom bishops,
vnpreaching prelats, and such
asseheadded Mynysters in the
church of God. Christ institutid
nether singers, nor massers,
but preachers, and testimonies
of his true doctrine. Mar. xvi.
Mat. xxviii. Luk. xxiiii. Act. i.
He that leaueth thys doctryne
vntaught in the church, or teacheth
a contrary doctrin flieth
from the face of god, and do incurre
the daunger and dampnacion
that is wrytten. Ezechi.
xxxiii. iii.
               I wyll requyre theyr losse
(sayeth God to the preacher) at

thy hand. Let nomā therfore be
offended if the cryer speake agaynst
the faultes of al degres
wythout excepcion: seing he is
commaunded so to do vpō the
paine eternal of his soule, and
Paule sayth: wo be vnto me, if
I preache not. i. Cor. ix. Let all
men take heede to do the thing
that apparteyneth to theyr offyce,
least they depart from the
face of the Lord, as kyngs do,
if they make any laws contrary
to the lawe of God and the
lawe of nature, or suffer theyr
subiectes to be tawght in anye
doctryne for the saluacion of
theyr soules, beside and contrary
to the expresse word of god.
               The iustyce departeth from
the face of God, when yt he for
fauor, preposterous peti, or for

bribes iudgeth not iustly. The
gentle men when bysyde charity
seke themselues wyth the
hurt of their neighbours. The
commons of euery realme departeth
frō the fauour of god
when sediciously, & inobedientlye
they make tumults, and sedicion,
lyftynge vp weapon agaynst
theyr kyng and rulers,
whych leadeth to eternal dāpnacion.
Rom. xiii. Num. xvi.
               But a man might say: toush,
it is not so great a matter, if a
man walke not in hys vocacion,
neyther yet is god so much
offended with dysobediēce, but
thys fleshly and peruerse opinion,
may soone be corrected, if
mē wold cōsider the daungers
that thys poore man Ionas
fell into, for hys dysobedyence.

They be in number syxe. The
fyrste is the perylous wyndes
that troubleth the shippe. The
seconde, hys synne and dysobedience
is detected and made open
by lottes. The thyrd, he is
examyned what he is. The
fourthe, he is constrayned to
geue sentence of death agaynst
hym selfe. The fyfth, the shipmen
cannot saue him. The sixt,
he is cast into the sea.
               The fyrst daunger hath two
partes: The one sheweth the
daunger of the shyppe. The other
shewith how the mariners
behaueth thē selues in the time
of theyr daunger. Of the fyrst,
thus sayth the Prophet.
               The Lorde hurled a
greate wynde into the

sea, and there arose a
myghtie tempest in the
sea, so that the shyppe
was in Ieoperdie of goynge
in pieces.
               Well we maye thyncke to
escape the daunger of GOD
though we neglect oure dewty
and vocacion, but truely it can
not be so. Whither sayeth Dauyd
shoulde I go from thy spirite,
and whither shoulde I fle
frō thy face? Psal. cxxxix. Ther
is no corner of the world wher
in man maye hyde hym selfe
from the knowlege and punishment
of God, if we neglect the
worckes of oure vocacion. He
hath all thynges in hys hand,
heauen, earth, the wyndes, and
the waters, with the whiche he

vseth to punyshe the wyckednes
of transgressours wythall
at his pleasure, when he wil, as
it is to be seen. Samu. i.
               Of thys place of the text, we
learne that whosoeuer contrarye
to Goddes commaundemente,
studieth to auoyde one
yuell, falleth into manye. The
byshop or the preacher that for
the loue or feare of the world
letteth to speke the trueth, falleth
into the burnyng and damnacion
of hys owne conscience.
The people that agaynst goddes
lawe woulde defende the
pouertye of theyr bodies, loste
body, soule, wyfe, chyldren and
all together. The corrupte
Iudge in serchynge to serue
hyz owne tourne or hys frenfrends

in corrupting of iustice,
bryngeth bothe hym selfe and
hys frende into the daunger of
eternal dampnacion. The text
procedeth yt sheweth howe the
mariners behaued them selues
in this daūger, yt whych thyng
is dylygently to be noted. For
in them is expressed averi liuelye
ymage of all men that lackyth
fayth, howe they feare aboue
measure in the tyme of
trouble. Theyr doinges is expressed
foure waies: First their
fayth. Second, eche of thē calleth
vpō his own god. Third,
thei exonerate the ship. Fourth
they wake Ionas oute of hys
sleepe.
               The fear, declareth ye greatnes
of the daunger they were
in, & theyr ignoraunce of God,

who onelye comforteth in the
dayes and houre of trouble.
               That euery man calleth vpon
his own god, it appeareth ther
were people of sondry and dyuers
nacions, and also what is
common to all men vnder the
sunne that haue not lost the vse
of reason when we be left destitute
of humane healpe, we call
vpon god, not for loue, but for
feare, as it is sayd: metus primus
in orbe Deos fecit. That is to say:
feare was the fyrste that made
Gods in the world. These mariners
are of some part to be folowed,
of some part not, that in
the daye of trouble they praye,
we ought to folowe them: that
they praye not to the one and
sole God, but euerye man to a
sondrye God, they maye not be

folowed. For there is but one
patron and helper for all men,
and he is neuer nor no where
knowen but by his word. Mā
                  nes
reason knoweth ryght wel
in the tyme of trouble that ther
is a god, but who he is reason
cannot tell. Therefore worshippeth
reasō an idole of hys own
heade, vnder the name of God,
and then foloweth man, eyther
hys owne opinion, eyther the
tradicion of hys elders. And
thys is the fountayne of Idolatrye,
when that euery manne
thyncketh hym to be hys God,
that he hym selfe, hys elders, or
custome hath taken to be god.
From hence came suche diuersitye
of gods among the Gētiles,
& so many patrons among
ye supersticious sort of Christians.
These goddes all together

be forbyd. Exodi. xx. Deutrono.
vi.
               They lyghten the shyp when
they felt that prayers auayled
nothynge, they tourne to laboure
whyche also eased them
nothynge. Whereby we learne
that al gods and goddesses be
but vanitye, sauynge oure god
the father of Iesus Christe.
               And no laboure nor trauayl avayleth
wyth out the fauoure
of God. Luke. ix. The woman
had spente all she had on Physicions,
yet nothyng the better:
so doeth the Papistes in Masses
and yet theyr conscience nothynge
more deliuered from
synne, and those that praye to
Saynctes attayneth nothyng.
If theyr requeste be sometyme
graunted theym, it is none

other then a punishmēt of their
Idololatry .ii. Thessa. ii. The
fourth thing thei do, they wake
Ionas.
               But Ionas gate him
vnder y• hatches wher
he laied him down and
slombred.
               The text noteth two things:
one that Ionas slept: the other
how the mariners awoke hym
to call vpon hys God. Ionas
slepe sygnifyeth two thynges.
Fyrst, that when we thynk our
selues most at reast: then be we
moste in daunger, as it is to be
sene by Baltheser in y• prophet
Daniell, and Math. xxiiii.ii.
Thess. ii. Luke. xii. The second
is, to declare the nature of syn,
whyles it is a committyng the

prycke and daunger thereof is
not felte, but it delyteth rather
man: So without feare, eat Adam
and Eue the apple, Peter
denyed Christe. And because
God, out of hande punyshethe
not out synne, the deuyl bewitcheth
our myndes, and wyttes,
and beareth vs in hande, that
he wyl neuer punysh, and that
God seythe not oure synne, nor
is not so greuouselye offended
wt oure sinnes. So yet slepeth
the synne at thys daye of them
that persecute God and his holy
word. The synnes of false or
negligent Byshops and priestes,
the synne of the corrupte
iudges, and sedycious people:
but it wyll awake one daye as
ye may read Gen. iiii. and here
by our Ionas. At the houre of

oure death synne wyll awake,
and wyth oure owne synne the
deuyl wyl kyl vs eternally excepte
we awake betime. That
they desier Ionas to praye vnto
hys God, it declareth that al
Idololatrye and supersticious
persons thyncke one god to be
stronger then the other. As it
is to be seen in papistrie at this
presente day, where as it is disputed
which ladye is best, oure
Ladye of Bullayne, or our Ladye
of Rome. Sayncte Iames
in Italye, or Sayent Iames
at Compostella? Father
this text declareth that Idololaters
alwayes seeke newe goddes
where as theyr olde god dedeiueth
theym, so is it amonge
Christians when the matter is
playne desperat, they lot y• matter,

betwene three, or foure Idololatrycal
Pilgrimages which
one of them shalbe the Patron
of his health. Wher as ye word
of God is knowen, there is no
sute but vnto one god by ye mediacion
of Christe: Beside whō
there is no health. Thys God
I cōmend vnto you: vnto thys
god make youre prayers, for
sake that heretical doctrin that
deuideth your hartes in prayer
part to god, and part to saynts
departed. For god is sufficient
to helpe and wyl healpe alone.
Esa. lxiii. to hym be all honour

            ¶The second Sermō
vpon Ionas, made by
Ihon Hoper .xxvi. of Februarye.
            ¶The Preface.
            
               VNto euerye
man is apoynted
hys vocatiō:
to one this, to an
other that: One
to a priuate, an other to a publyke
vocacion, and eche of thē,
eyther is lawful, or vnlawfull.
That is vnlawfull that fyghteth
and repugneth wyth the
word of God, as the vocacion
of baudes, Idololatres, masse
mongers, common receauers,
and mainteiners of disers, and
dysse houses wyth suche lyke.
In these, or any lyke, who soeuer
continually styll wythoute

repentaunce is subiect to eternal
dampnaciō. The other vocacion
is lawfull, and standeth
wyth the word of God. Of the
whiche S. Paule speaketh.
In what vocacion any man is
called, in the same let hym abyde.
But thys lawfull vocacion
we transgresse, two maner
of wayes. Ether when we bear
the title or name of the vocacion,
and do nothyng appertayning
thereunto (whyche is condempned
by God in that he
commaunded in Adam al men
to auoyde ydlenes. Gene. iii. in
the sweate of thy browes thou
shalt eat thy bread: and Paule
i. Thess. ii. Thess.) Either whē
we do, in the vocacion that we
should not do. As for example
a bishop to teach false doctrine

for a true. A iudge that should
iudge truely corrupteth iudgemente
for fauoure or monye.
A Merchaunte to waxe richer
by false contractes, or corrupte
wares. Into what daunger ech
manne falleth that anye waye
transgresseth hys vocacion, it
is to be sene by thys oure Ionas,
who in voidyng of one dā
               ger
falleth into sixe, as ye haue
hearde before: of the whych six,
we haue spokē but of one. And
in the one noted manye, & profitable
doctrines, as well declaringe
mannes infirmitie, that
cannot healpe it selfe, not from
the daungers of the body as of
the power and good wil of god
that can & wil saue, boeth from
the daungers of bodye & soule.

Al mē confesse hym to be ye true
God, that can and wil helpe al
dyseases, the Iewes, the Turkes,
the Gentiles, the good, the
bad. But therein standeth the
daunger, lest for the true God
we cal and inuocat a false god:
and vnder the name of god we
honoure, and worshyp the dyuel,
as these mariners dyd, whē
eche of them called to a sondry
god. And as the Gentiles doth
that Dauid speketh of. Psal.
cvi. that they sacrificed their
children to the deuyl, and not
to God. Dauyd sayeth they offered
to the deuyll that they
thoughte was offered to God.
And Paule. i. Corinthians. x.
calleth the religion of the heathen
the table of the deuyll:
            
               
So dyd the Iewes before
vs, & so do they in these dayes
now, that for eueri disease, they
haue a sōdry god and patrone.
For the pestilence S, Roch, for
the war S. Barbara, In thys
daunger of Idololatrye be all
they that call vpon God, and
pray vnto hym otherwyse then
he hath appointid by his word
And here we be admonished of
two things. The fyrst, that we
offer none other obsequie and
relygion vnto god, thē he hymselfe
by hys word requireth. If
we do, we offer an ydol of oure
own heade, and honore the dyuel,
vnder the parsō, and name
of god. As those doth that erect
and buylde vp Images, and
aulters to saye masse vpon, in
the honor of god, whyche God

neuer commaunded. Exod. xxii
Deutrono. v. The nexte we be
here admonished of, is that we
call vpon God onelye in the
name of Christe, for he is the
dore, the waye, and the trueth.
Iohn. x. And he alone sheweth
vs the father. Iohn .i.vi.
Heare be condemned not
onely the Iewes and Gentiles
but also as manye as woulde
knowe, and come to the father
by inuocacion of the saynctes
departed, by Bulles, Pardons
Peregrinacions, Masse and other.
Let thys erroure, be corrected,
And let vs leue calling
euerye man to hys owne God,
and call onely vpon the onelye
God that can and wil in Christ
heare vs, as he hearde the Patriarches,
Prophetes, and the

Apostles. And y• thys be doone
it is the office of the kyngs magestye,
hys councell, and al his
Magistrates to se ye true boke
of God the holye Byble to be
tawghte and receyued of hys
magesties subiects, after the example
of Moses, Iosua, Dauid,
Iosaphat, Ezechias, and
Iosias, the Noble Princes of
goddes people. Ther was, and
is one doctryne more, in that y•
Mariners dyd not onely praye
but also lightened the shyppe.
That thei praied and were not
heard, ye learne what a vanitie
it is, to praye after the opinion
of man. Nothynge at all it auayleth.
It neuer commeth before
God, nor caseth the conscience
of hym that prayeth. Further,
y• they do not onelye praye

but also laboure: we se our duetye,
that as GOD freelye geueth
healpe, so we muste trayuell,
and do the beste we canne
wyth prayer, not onelye to receyue,
and obtayne the free
helpe of God, but also to kepe
it. Thus I thought it good, to
speke before the seconde daunger
which is thys. Ionas synne
is detected by lotts, so sayth the
texte.
            They sayde one to
the other: come let vs
caste lottes, that we
maye knowe, for whose
cause we are thus troubled,
and so thei cast lottes,
and the lot fell vppon
Ionas.
            
               
When they perceiued the
tempest ceassed not with prayer
and deuocion euerye manne
vnto hys God, they vnderstod
that suche desperate daunger
could not come, but onely from
the Ire and displeasure of god
for some notable and wonderfull
cryme. And the more was
the feare because the crime was
not knowen, nor no mā woulde
be seene coulpable of it. They
thoughte it good therefore, to
serche the gyltye and offender
by lottes. And missed not of
theyr purpose adele, but found
Ionas the rebellion of God to
be the occacion of theyr troble.
            Of thys text we be learned
that the cause of all trouble in
publick and priuate persones
is syn, as we rede Deu. xxviii.

Leuiti. xxvi. That vnderstode
the Marinars. And in case we
be wyse, we wyll vnderstande
the same, and amend it, and not
to attribute our aduersities to
sunne, or mone, sterre, or planet
as fooles do.
            Of thys texte we learne agayne
howe so euer synne be
hyd for the tyme, yet at lengthe
it wyll be knowen, some by one
meanes, some by the other. By
lotts as our Ionas, and Ahab
Iudicum. i. Samuell .xiiii. by
theyr owne confession, as Dauyd
.ii. Samuell. Let no man
therefore thyncke to kepe alwayes
his synne hyd.
            Farther here we learne how
euerye kyngedome and commune
wealthe maye be apesed,
when it is troubled. If ye chiefe

captaynes and principall occasions
of the trouble be knowen
and remoued, then shall peace,
ioye, and quietnes folow in the
commune wealth else neuer, excepte
the Scripture of God be
false. Men of the best iudgemente
in Ciuile matters many
tymes vnder the name and similitude
of a shyppe, vnderstande
the commune wealth, in
case the shyppe whyche is the
commune wealthe be troubled,
the mayster of the shyppe
that is the Kynge wt his counsell
inquire deligentelye of the
authours of the trouble, or else
the tempeste of trouble shal neuer
cease. At thys daye gracious
Kynge, the shyppe of the

commune wealthe is sore moued
wythe wyndes and tempestes.
Here youre Magestye
and youre mooste honourable
Counsell maye not ceasse if ye
woulde the shyppe to come to
rest, but take the payne to fynd
out the authours of these troubles.
            In case ye wyll, (as in dede
ye muste) by some meanes fynd
out the occasions of these troubles
and vnquyetnes wythin
youre Magisties Realme: ye
shall not fynde (as manye reporte)
the Gospell to be the
cause therof. For it is the word
of peace, and the Dysciples
thereof be assured of all grace
and goddes fauoure. Deutronomye
the eyght and tewentye

and Christe apesed wyth hys
presence the troublous waues
of the sea. Iohn. vi. Upon whō
then wyll the lot of vnquietnes
and trouble fal? Upon Ionas,
that is to saye vpon euery
man that neglecteth his vocacion,
and doeth not as he is
byd, as when he that shoulde
stirre the rother in a shyp, leaueth
her to waues, he yt shoulde
stricke the sayles, stretcheth thē
to more wynde, and so to conclude
none taketh hede of that
he should. My gracious Lord
and Kynge, and ye my Lordes
of hys moost honorable councel,
how many Ionasses shuld
there be founde in Englande?
doubtles to many in euery condicion
and sorte of people with
in thys realme amonge the nobles,

lawers, Byshoppes, priestes,
and the commune people.
Examyne al a part and proue:
the nobilitye make vnprofitable
expenses, more then theyr
habilitye can or is able to sustayne.
They fede a sorte of Idle,
and neuer cōmended sort of
people, neither by gods lawes
neither by mannes lawes: they
them selues lyue Idle, and wyl
not laboure neyther with hand
neyther wyth wyt. What must
folowe but trouble of the ship,
that is to say oppression of the
pore. Esai. v.
            The lawers in al causes hath
more respecte to luere and vantage
then to iustice, in somuche
they reioyce, and of other foles
be reioysed at when they can ouercome
in a false cause, and so

there theuerye catcheth vp the
labours and swet of the poore.
            The Byshoppes and priestes
vnquyet the shippe of this
realme two maner wayes. One
by the neglecting of theyr true
dewtye, the other by a defence
of a false and damnable supersticion.
In the primatiue and
Apostolicall churche the offyce
of a Byshoppe and priest was
to teache in the congregacion
of the faythfulles the doctrine
of the Prophetes and Apostles
accordynge to the commaundemente
of Christe Mathewe
.xxviii. Marke .xvi. Ephesians
.ii. Now is this integritye
turned into false Idololatrye,
and deuyllyshe supersticion, to
synge, and saye Masse in the
congregacion of God. Thus

lyke theues & murderers they
do the abominacion commaundid
by man with massyng, coniurynge
the holy water, bucket
and suche lyke, and leaue the
preachynge of goddes worde
as God comaundeth, and as
the Prophetes and Apostelles
hath left vs example. And saye
when godly kynges and magistrats
requyre and commaund
a refourmacion of their iuells,
the ministery of the churche is
contemned wt such false sclaunders
as the Ignoraunt people
wyll do more for the Byshoppes
and priestes of Ball, then
for God, goddes worde, or hys
anoynted magistrate as it appered
this last somer.
            The people and commonnaltye
of thys realme trouble

the shyp of this cōmune welth.
For do the Kynge and Magistrate
what he can, the people
wyll neuer be content. Manye
of theym lyue in yldenes, and
wyl not labour: and in case thei
cannot haue that they woulde
they conuert them selues to sedicion
and treson, and care nomore
to kyll and oppresse theyr
lawefull kynge and magistrates,
then the deuyll cared to kyl
Adam in Paradise. Gene. iii.
They should cal vnto the lord
for redresse of theyr thynges, &
not to redresse it them selues.
            Psal. l. How is it possible wher
euery sort offendeth in the commune
wealth, but that the Ire
and vengaunce of God should
sende vnto our ship wyndes of
aduersitye. I knowe that Ionas

was neuer better knowen
to be the occasion of thys tempeste
in the sea, then I knowe
these foure sortes of people to
be the trouble, and wyll be the
dystruccion of thys commune
wealth if they be not found out
by lotte and wysdome be tyme.
But a man myghte aske what
should the kynges magestie do
in suche a case wyth all these
foure sortes of Ionasses? Let
hys maiestie learne of these mariners,
then shall he do wel: and
as they dyd with Ionas, so the
kynges magestie must do with
these four sorts of people. What
they dyd, the Prophet shall tell
hys owne tale, and declare the
third daunger he fell into whiche
is the examinaciō of Ionas
in thys forme.
            
               
Thei said vnto him:
shewe vs I praye the,
how thys trouble happeneth
vnto vs? What
is thyne occupacion?
whence commest thou?
what countrie man art
thou? Of what nacion
art thou?
            In these Ethnicall Mariners
we se a singuler discrecion
wit, & humanitie. What if our
Mariners Christiās had suffered
the lyke daunger and detriment
for any mānes sake with
in their shyppe, Doubtles they
would haue sworne, and out of
hande wythoute examinacion
haue cast him into the sea. But
these men be wyse that they do

not onelye serch to knowe his
faulte by lottes, but diligently
seketh to knowe all the circumstances
howe he fell into thys
daunger, lest Ionas should accompt
him selfe vniustlye condemned.
Ot thys doyng of the
Mariners we learne two thinges,
one humanitie towardes
the aflicted persons. The other
that all kynges and magistrates
oughte to condemne thys
lawe as a thynge pestiferous
and damned by gods lawes, to
execute sentence agaynste anye
man before his cause and matter
be heard, for it is contrarye
to the lawe of god, the lawe of
nature, and the law of mā. Yea
God commaundeth that nomā
shoulde be condemned with the
testimony of one mā. deu. xvii.
            
               
Here is for the kynges magestye
and hys coūsel one more
doctrine to be learned of these
Mariners. I sayde that foure
sortes of people were the occasion
of the trouble of hys Magisties
shyppe thys Realme of
Englande, but I sayd not that
euerye man of these foure sorts
was giltye of the tempest, therfore
there muste be lottes, and
examinacion of euerye deorce
and of eche person in hys degree
that the innocente be not
punyshed, neither the transgressoure
fauored. And these muste
be examined by the mayster &
hys shyppemen: that is, to oure
purpose, of the Kynges magestye
and hys Counsel. So that
in case the godlye wythout respect
of persons, seeke to know

and vpon truthe, and knoweledge,
punyshe as they knowe,
the shyppe of thys commune
wealthe shall rest in peace
and quyetnes: if it be not
serched for, and amended,
the shyppe of
the commune
wealthe
shall
at laste be burste in pieces,
whyche the
Lorde defend.
Amen.
         
         
            
            ¶The thyrd Sermon
vpon Ionas, made by
Iohn Hoper the .v. of
Marche.
            
               ☞The Preface.
               
                  WE neuer rede in
anye wryters
whether they be
holy or prophāe
of anye kyngedome
or comune
wealth that continually endured
without tumultes, sedicion
or warre, eyther by foreyn and
outwarde enemies, eyther amonge
it selfe by conspiracye,
treason, & disobedience of subiectes
of the same realme, and
the same euyll not beynge in
tyme taken hede of, and redressed,
brought alwayes the kingdom
or commune wealth from
trouble and sedicion vnto vtter

ruyne, and confusion. We
wyll omitte and passe ouer to
speake of the kyngdome of the
Assirians, the Persians, Grekes,
& Romaynes (althoughe
of theyr originall, continuaūce
and distruccion, the holye Byble
maketh in Daniell the prophet,
and other places of the
Scripture, muche mencion of)
we wil speake but of two kingdomes,
of Iuda, and Israell.
What troublers, contencion,
warres, sedicion, and rebellion
they suffred, and at laste came
cleane to noughte, the bookes
of the Kyngs, and Chronicles
doth recorde, and the Prophet
Ieremye. What the causes of
these troubles and dystruccion
were, the godlye readers of the
scriptures he not ignoraunte:

But the men of that tyme, the
Princes, the kynges, neyther
the priestes would vnderstād,
but assigned false causes, the
preachynge of goddes worde
.iii. Regum. xviii. For thus sayeth
Ahab vnto Elias the prophet:
arte not thou he that trobleth
Israel? and so sayeth the
people. Hiere. xiiii. The worde
of god yt thou hast spoken vnto
vs in the name of the lorde,
we wyll not receyue it, but we
will do whatsoeuer seme vnto
vs good, yt we may do sacrifice
vnto the Quene of heauē, and
offer oure offerynges vnto
her, as we haue done and oure
fathers, our kinges, & our princes,
in the cities of Iuda, and
in the stretes of Ierusalē. Thē
had we aboūdaunce of al thinges,

and wel was it wyth vs, &
we felte no yuell. Assone as we
lefte offerynge to the Quene
of heauen, and sacrificed no
more sacrifyce vnto her, we
lacked al thynges, and be consumed
wyth warre, and hungre.
But the true Prophetes
of GOD shewed the true causes
of these euils, to be the contempt
of goddes word, as Elias
saide vnto Ahab: I trouble
not Israell, but thou and thy
fathers house, troubleth it. For
ye haue forsaken the commaū
                  demente
of the Lorde, and
thou goest after Baalim. But
the princes and the people cō
                  tinually
defēded ye falle causes
& accōpted ye prophetes of god
yt wold haue corrected theyr error,
to be sedicious, & trayterus

persons, and euen so persecuted
and kylled them for there
true preachynge: Till at the
last they perished and theyr realme
wyth theym, as ye maye
rede .iiii. Regu. xvii. and in the
last booke of the Cronicles in
the last Chapiter. Unto the lessō
of those two Chapters I exhorte
the wyse, and godly hearer.
For ye shal gather of those
places that the contempte of
goddes worde was the occasion
of the losse of these realmes.
               The same euyll vexeth vs
at thys presente daye. The
ship of thys commune wealthe
of Englande is tossed vpsyde
downe, and the occacion thereof
is imputed and layed vnto
Christe and hys holye worde,
though falsly, for Christes nature

is to apeace and quiet all
troubles and tempestes wyth
hys presence. Iohn .vi. Therefore
thys false and preposterous
cause of trouble muste be
taken hede of, if we wyshe the
shyp of this kyngdom to come
to rest. We shal neuer bryng it
to passe vntyll suche tyme as
we agree and confesse that Ionas
is the occasion whye the
realme is thus vnquieted, that
is to saye, as manye as be in
this realme, that neglect, or peruerte
theyr appoynted vocacyon.
               I sayde O Kynge that Ionas
myght be founde amonge
foure sortes of people wyth in
youre maiestyes Realme, amonge
the priestes, noble men,
lawers, and the commune people.

But lest anye man shulde
thynke I condempned euerye
man within the shippe of your
commune wealthe, we wyll folowe
the wisdome and comendable
doinges of these shippemen
which were not only content
to haue found out Ionas
(the cause of theyr trouble) by
Lottes, but also diligētly they
examin him. So ye same thing
most gracious kyng we muste
do. But before we take vpon
vs theyr examination, we wyll
praye vnto almightye god for
his holye spirite of wysdome,
lest in this necessarye and profitable
examination we erre
and be deceiued. And also that
they vpon whome the Lottes
do fall, and can not iustelye excuse
theyr faultes, maye learne

to amende theym, and tourne
vnto the Lorde, and from
hensforth maye lyue
in puritie and in
nocencye of
trueth
and vertue all the
dayes of theyr
lyues.
So be it.
               ☞The ende of the Preface.
            
            
               
                  YE haue hearde
howe Ionas for
the contempte
and disobeyinge
of hys vocacyon,
to haue fallen
into syxe greate dawngers.
Of two we haue spoken,

& nowe we be come to the
thirde, where as he and his factes
be deligentlye examined,
whyche doutles was agreate
crosse and trouble vnto hym.
For there is nothyng that dyspleaseth
man more thē to haue
his faults hiddē, to be brought
vnto lyghte and knowledge.
God notwythstandynge suffereth
that manye tymes for
oure good, and profit, that we
beyng brought vnto acknowledge
of oure synnes, myghte
hate the same and praie for the
remission thereof, and so is it
better (howe so euer the blynde
fleshe iudgeth) to haue oure
synnes (if God wyl) opened for
oure saluacion, then hyd to our
losse and damnacion. In thys
examinacion we se not only the

daūger of Ionas, but also the
office of euery good maiestrate
that meaneth to quiet and rest
hys commune wealth, beynge
in trouble.
               Those shoulde be examined,
that by any signe, or probable
suspicion seme to be the authors
of tumultes. And thys
vsynge moderacion in examininge
the innocente and good,
shalbe fre from payne, and punyshmente:
and the Culpable
and gyltye, founde worthye of
correcciō. First therfore let vs
examyne the Byshoppes and
priestes, whether those yt know
the wyll of God by hys holye
worde, diligentlye teache and
preache the same vnto other.
Then whether any mā of that
vocacion, teache false doctryne

in the churche of Christ. If the
one do to litle in the fyrste, and
the other to much in the secōd,
or the one neglect the fyrst, and
the other to diligente in the second,
both these be Ionas, and
occasion ye the shyp is moued.
Agaynste the negligente sorte
speaketh Ezechiell .iii.xxxiii. &
Agge. i. with vehemēt wordes.
and threteneth eternall dampnacion
to suche as preacheth
not, nor buildeth vp the temple
of goddes congregacion:
lykewyse Saynt Paul .i. Cor.
ix. Agaynste those that teache
false doctrine speketh Christe
Io. x. and Paull .i. Timo. iiii.
Hier. xiiii. Amonge the noble
men, Ionas that troubleth the
commune wealth may be foūd
amōg two sortes of them. The

one of them hathe inoughe gyuen
him from God, yet is not
content there withal, but for auarice,
and loue of him self and
his insaciable couetousnes scrapethe,
and gathereth to gether
whither with ye law, or against
the lawe it maketh no forse
so he haue it. So this Ionas
and trobler of the ship with all
iniuries and wronges, rather
woulde ad somewhat where in
deade is to much, thē to depart
a litle where as is nothynge at
al. And in vaine glorye & pride
of the manmon of ye world, they
wyll condemne and disdayne ye
verye Image of God in the
poore, agaynste whome speaketh
Salomon. Prouerv. xiiii.
he yt calumniateth the pore, abraydeth
hys creatoure. Take

exāple hereof. Out of the. ix. of
Iohn howe the general coūcel
of the Phariseis layde to the
pore blynde man his blindnes.
Theyr reproch of gods worke
was reprehended: and the insaciable
and couetous hartes of
theym be condemned by Esaye
the Prophet: Chapter .v. cursed
be ye that Ioyne house to
house, and feld to feld. The experyence
of thys curse had Ahab,
that vngodlye toke from
Naboth his vineyard. If these
men that hath Inoughe wyll
not moue the shyppe of youre
highnes commune wealth, let
theym leaue their rauenynge,
and giue god thankes for that
they haue, and to theyr abilitye
healpe, & not rob the pore.
The other sort of noble or gentlemen

that make more expēce
then their reuenues and condicion
is able to beare and liueth
by dysse, Cardes, whordome,
fraude, gile, deceite, thefte and
suche like: Indifferent examinaciō
not only by gods lawes,
but also by mānes lawes wyll
proue thē not only to be disobedient
Ionas, but also starke
theues. The lawiers if they be
examined diligently, there wil
be so many found amonge thē
to vnquiet the shyppe of thys
commune wealthe, that few or
none wilbe found clere. And among
the lawyers I put Iudges,
and Iustices the one for
gaine, careth not to defend the
faulsest cause and most vniust
matter yt can be brought vnto
him, & promiseth (like a theyfe)

ye cause to be good, till he haue
emptied hys poore Clientes
pourse. Then washeth he hys
hādes, with as much foule honestie,
as he can, and referreth
the doutfull cause aboue his
lerning, to the ignoraunt men
of yt shire, to be iudged at home
lyke a fole, wher as his pourse
can no lenger cause his pratler
and ignoraunt lawer to kepe
his cause aloofe and out of the
shire. And in dede suche a subiecte
as can not fynde in his
herte after gods lawes to ende
his contencion without stryfe
by the arbitremēt of those that
be his neighboures, is worthy
to fynde such a Ionas as wyll
neuer leaue blowinge at hys
pourse, till he haue vnladed it
euen to the bottome, and haue

caused him to spend asmuch in
recouerye of twētie shillinges
by lease, as he might haue purchased
twenty shilinges in fele
simple. I dāpne not the lawe yt
is good, but these theues yt abuse
ye law: for their doinges is
nothyng but gile & deceate, & a
noble kynd of theuery. Against
ye which speketh zachari in his
v. Chapi. And God. Exod. xx.
Deut. v. Thou shalt commit
no thefte. Thou shall geue no
false testimonye agaynste thy
neyghboure. These Ionasses
dothe not only geue false testimony,
but also for lutre defendeth
y• same. And not for a day
but for a yere, and yeres. The
more shame it is to be suffred.
The iustices be also Ionas, for
they receiue rewardes and Bribes,

whiche blindeth the eyes,
De. xvi. & maketh them to corrupte
iustice to theyr eternall
damnacion if they amend not.
Agaynste whom speaketh Salomon,
Prouerbes .vii. He that
quiteth the euyll doer, and cō
                  demneth
the innocent, be bothe
execreable and damned before
God.
               Among the cōmune people ye
shal also find many Ionasses,
but yt we maye the better espye
thē out, we wyl deuide them into
the rustikes or people of the
contrye: & into the Citizens. Al
& euery contry or housbād mā
that liueth not of his laboure,
and geueth hym selfe to Idlenes,
and so moueth seditiō and
treason agaynste theyr lawfull
kyng and Magestrate, or priuely

in theyr conuenticles, and
assemblyes speke euell, cursse,
or prouoke any thing agaiust
their magestrates, thei can nor
wyll learne, nether to knowe
god, nether to obey ther prince:
these be those among this sort
of people ye be Ionasses, & trobleth
the state of this realme.
Amonge the Citizens be a
great number that trouble the
shippe also, as adulterous vnpunished,
the fraude and gyle
of the marchaundise, ydlenes
the Mother of all myscheyfe,
thefte, murder, blasphemous
othes, conspiracye and treason
with open slaūder and rebuke
of goddes moste holye worde.
These thynges and suche lyke
tosseth the poore shyp ye hardly
she cā saile aboue the water.

And so dyspleaseth the Maiestye
of God, that he wyll neuer
ceasse from sending of tempestes,
tyll those Ionasses be
amended, or caste into the sea.
               But before I come to Ionas
aunswere vpon hys examinacion,
because I knowe
thys sayinge to be trewe: obsequium
amicos, veritas odium parit.
That is, flatterye obtayneth
frēdship & the truth displesure,
lest any mā shuld for my truth
and liberty be offēded, I wyll
briefly purge my self. Doutles
it were pleasure to me to speke
nothynge at al, in case the necessitie
of my vocatiō, the daunger
of these Ionasses, and the
saluacion of this ship of oure
commune wealthe forced me
not therunto. As touching myself

I am called vnto this place
to cry, in case I do not I know
all the bloud of these Ionasses
shalbe required at my hande:
which god forbyd. It were better
I shuld cal so hard as heauen
and earthe might sounde
agayne of my voyce.
               The saluacion of these wicked
Ionasses moueth also to
speke in this matter & with the
trompe of gods word to wake
thē out of their slepe, leste they
slūber & rest so lōg in theyr wickednes,
yt they go slepyng to eternal
dānaciō. These therfore
I call vpon for the amendemente
of theyr knowledge and
liefe.
               Farther the loue I beare vnto
the Kynges Maiestye and
to this comune wealth of England

compelleth me to speake,
seynge I se the angry hand of
God all redye streached forthe
to punysh vs, if we awake not
oute of synne. Laste of all be it
knowen to all menne that I
speake in the condemnacion of
the euyll, and commendacion
of the good. And that all men
may easlye find out and know
amonge these foure sortes of
people, the Ionasses, and troublers
of thys shyppe and commune
wealth of Englande, I
gyue you one mooste true and
generall rule, whyche is thys.
Whoso euer, or of what so euer
degre he be, that is or sheweth
hym selfe to be offended
wyth thys my free and indifferente
speakynge of Goddes
worde, he or they be they what

they be maye, arre the verye
Ionasses and troublers of
thys commune wealthe. And
these menne loue more darckenes
thē lyght, moreto trouble
the shippe then to rest her. But
nowe to the texte wherein is cō
                  tayned
Aonas aunswere vpon
hys examinacion.
               He aunswered them:
I am an Ebrew,
and feare the lord
God of heauen,
that made the sea
and the drie land.
               When as Ionas perseaued
he coulde no longer clooke

and hyde hys offence, he dothe
not onelye confesse hys faulte,
but also maketh them priuye,
and vttereth hys fayeth and
religiō he hath in GOD, vnto
theym. In that he confesseth
hys faulte, we learne that
the fyrste gree and procedynge
to mercye and remyssion, is the
knowledge of the synne, whyche
is a thynge moste difficile
and harde to the fleshe to saye:
I haue offended the Lord, and
wil amend. For either we denie
oure syn with Cain, or extenuate
and excuse it wyth Saule.
Would to God our Ionasses
would acknowledge theyr faures,
& not excuse it nor extenuate
it. It is but a mockeri once
in a yere to acknowledge, and
murmoure oure faultes in the

priestes eare. But we shoulde
from the harte repent the neglectyng
of our bounden duties,
and vnfaynedlye amende it,
whyche is not onely paynefull
to the fleshe, but also gratefull
vnto God. I exhorte all men
therefore that knoweth theym
selues gyltye, as in deade
there is none of vs of all partes
innocente, we saye wythe
Dauyd: we haue offended the
Lorde.
               Yet is not thys inoughe to
confesse our faultes, but therewythall
we muste make a confession
of oure fayeth, but not
suche a confession as mooste
menne vse, but suche as maye
most be lyke vnto Ionasses.
And let theym imbrace onelye
Christe and hys doctrine, and

worship god in sprite & veritye
as his word teacheth. This I
meane, let the preistes teache accordinge
to the worde of God,
the noble mē gouerne and rule
thereby, the lawers conforme
theyr lawe to gods law, & suche
lawes as be contrarie to gods
lawes abrogate and abolishe.
The people shoulde heare the
word of God, geue faithe vnto
it, and folow it. And so saye euery
man of vs with Ionas, I
am an Ebrew, that is to say, I
am a christian man, and wyll
frome henceforthe forsake my
synne, that disquieteth not only
myne owne conscience, but also
the hole cōmune wealth. It foloweth
how the mariners toke
Ionas answere.
               Then were the mē
                  
exceadyngelye afrayde,
and sayed
vnto hym. Why
dydest thou so (for
thei knew that he
was fled from the
presēce of the lord
because he hadde
tolde them) & said
more ouer vnto
him: what shal we
do vnto the, y• the
sea may ceasse frō
trobling of vs: for
the sea wrought &
was troblous.
               In these mariners we see
three thinges: feare, rebuke of

disobedience, and takynge of
councell howe to saue the ship.
This feare it is mooste like
sprange of this that the mariners
had hearde Ionas saye
howe he was commaunded by
God to preache vnto the Niniuites
theyr destruction, and
the cities also for theyr synne.
The mariners knowing them
selfes giltye of the same, them
selfes being both Idolaters, infidels,
and of corrupt conditiō
and lyuyng, fered the lyke punishment.
Who is it that will
not tremble at the angrie countenaunce
of gods dyspleasure?
But nowe a dayes oure stonye
and indurate hartes be paste
al feare, and turneth the threatenings
of God to a laughter,
sayinge in theyr hartes: ther is
no God.
               
                  
That these gentilyshe Mariners
rebuke Ionas of dysobedience,
it declareth the faute
to be so greate when anye man
leueth his vocacion and specially
the vocacion of preching,
that it meriteth and is worthy
to be rebuked of all men. But
suche is nowe the proude mindes
of Byshops and pastours
that it wyl suffer no rebuke, or
Christian admonicion, but wil
be lauded and praised yea in euel
doyng and omissiō of their
vocacion, as it is to be seene in
that horrible and wycked decre:
Si papa. And not onelye,
the Pope but also euerye man
that slepeth, and delitethin his
sinne, refuseth all maner of admonicions.
If Ionas toke wel
at worthe the reprehension of

the heathen, it is more then ashame
one Christian to forsake
the admonicion of an other.
               In that they aske counsell
of Ionas, howe to saue the
shyppe, they declare a syngulare
humanitye towardes a
straunger: that althoughe by
the meanes of hym they stode
in daunger bothe of lyfe and
goodes, yet woulde they leaue
no meanes they coulde, to saue
hym, thoughe it were wythe
theyr greate losse, and daunger.
               Thus we be bounde to do
as occacion shal serue: not cruelly
wythout discression to reuēge,
but cheritabli with pacience
to beare with the weke, vntyll
suche tyme as the lawe requyreth
execucion of the euyll.

Nowe foloweth the aunswere
of Ionas, wherwyth al he condēneth
him selfe as it is plaine
in the texte, and is the fourth
daunger he fel into.
               Take me and cast
me into the sea, so
shal it let you be in
rest, for I wote it
is for my sake that
this great tempest
is come vpon you.
               In thys answere we learne
and knowe what is the nature
and condicyon of euerye penitente
manne, to Iudge hym
selfe worthy payne and punyshemente.
And that is so
trewe in case wee Iudge not
so of oure selues (and saye:

heretofore I was accompted
and toke my selfe for a christian
man, but in deade I was
the contrarye, wherefore I am
worthy of punyshmente) we be
but Hipocrites and desēblers.
Thus shoulde the Nobleman
saye, the Lawer, the priest, and
the commune sorte of men as
Dauid techeth .ii. Sam. xxiiii.
When he sawe the commune
wealth punyshed and in daunger
of dystruccion for his offence,
he sayde vnto the Lorde
as Ionas dyd.
               I haue synned, I haue done
yuel, what hath these shepe offended?
let thyne ire & dyspleasure
be agaynste me and my
fathers house.
               But O my gracious Lorde
and Kynge, suche penitent and

sorowful Ionasses be farre out
of youre realme, for none wyll
confesse theyr faultes. They
wyl rather saye: let the Bible in
Englishe, and the preacher of
gods word be cast into the sea,
and so shall folowe quietnes,
for it was neuer wel sithe preaching
begā. But these be, most
gracious kyng and honorable
coūselloures, Caiphas felowes
that sayde: ye vnderstande not
Io. xiii. Chap. But what folowed?
It happened vnto the
wicked as he feared. They lost
theyr communewealth as their
fathers did before, and came in
to bondage bothe of body and
soule.
               Now foloweth the fift daūger
that Ionas fel into. The mariners
can not saue hym, as the

texte sayeth.
               Neuerthelesse, the mē
assaide with rowing
to bringe the ship to
lād: but it wolde not
be, because the sea
wrought so & was so
troblus against thē.
               In these Mariners y• holye
gost teacheth vs two thynges,
the one howe they would haue
saued the troubler of the shyp,
the other that they coulde not
saue him. In the first is noted
the nature & condicion of euery
godly Magistrate yt would
if god wold & the lawe, al men
to be saued: as Moses did prai
for the people yt rebelled, for Aron
& Marye, hys brother & sister.
Iosua called disobediente

Ahab sonne. Here is the percial
and corrupte iudgement of
Kynges, Magistrates, iudges
and such as beare offyce in the
commune wealth horriblie cō
                  demned:
that serue not the law
but mayster the lawe, and for
lucre or affecciō damneth hym
the lawe quytteth, and saueth
him the lawe condemneth, contrary
to the doctrine of Salomon.
Prouerb .xvii. Deut. xix.
Luke. xxii. Rom. xiii. Iac. iiii.
That they could not saue Ionas,
we learne that no cōmune
wealth cā be quieted except the
trāsgressors be punished. Ios.
vii. God giueth no victory to y•
children of Israel till Ahab be
punished. The plage cessed not
frō y• Israelits, til Phinees had
slaine the adulterous, Nu. xxv

And the Lord sayth in Ezechiell.
xxxiii: ye lifte vp youre eyes
to your Idoles, & shede bloud:
and thyncke ye, ye shall posses
thys land? Ye pollute eche anothers
wyfe, and should ye inhabit
thys lande? Nether vnto
alludeth sayncte Paule. Ephesians.
v. Let no mā seduce you
wyth prophane woordes, for
these thyngs cōmeth the yre of
God vpon the chyldren of distruste.
               Generallye we learne that
there is no more pestiferous
hurt cā come vnto a commune
wealth, then ouer muche lenity
and preposterous petye to suffer
the lawes of a realme to be
broken and neglected, wythout
punyshement of the transgressoure:
as it shall be more

declared here after. Nowe to
the text, whyche containeth the
prayer of the shypmen in thys
wyse.
               Wherfore thei cried
vnto the lord and sayd
O Lorde let vs not perishe
for thys mannes
death, neither lay thou
innocent bloud to our
charge: for thou oh lord
hast done, euen as thy
pleasure was.
               Of thys oracion fyrste wee
learne that the Mariners were
conuerted vnto God by y• preachynge
of one Ionas. Before
eche man called vpon a sūdrye
god, now al cal vp on one god.
They excuse not theyr olde Idololatrie

for their olde customes
sake, nor yet for the aucthoritie
of their forefathers,
but symplie they imbrace the
trueth. The same shoulde we
followe, and for oure doctryne
it is written, as sayth Saynte
Paule in the fyftenth chapter
of hys Epystle to the Romay.
Whatsoeuer thyngs are wrytten,
are wrytten for oure learnyng:
that we through paciēce
and comforte of the scriptures
shoulde haue hope. Casting away
al Idololatrye & false honorynges
of God, we shoulde
in Chryst imbrase and receyue
the euerlastynge God and hys
infalliable worde, seynge wee
be not moued there vnto by
one Ionas but by manye: by
Kynge, by counsell, and manye

other menne of God.
               The seconde thynge we
learne oute of thys prayer is
howe they desyre GOD, not
to Impute vnto theym the
deathe of, Ionas whyche had
not hurte theym but hymselfe,
in dysobeyinge the Lordes
commaundemente: wherein
we maye see howe the Gentiles
and Ethnyckes abhorred
murder, land Manslaughter,
and accompted it horrible and
a thynge damned by the lawe
of nature▪
               
               They were in the sea, and
no manne coulde haue accused
them of murther, yet perceyued
they well that the eyes of God
coulde marcke theym where
so euer they were, and woulde
punyshe the facte. And wisely

they iudged: for so teacheth vs
all the Scripture of God as it
shall nowe apere: for I wyll
somewhat touch thys horrible
crime of murder more at large.
Murder is cōmitte two maner
of wayes, by chaunce and ignorauntelye,
or of malice and
wetingelye. Ignoraunt when
agaynste hys wyll doynge
and meanynge nothynge lesse
then murder, agaynst hys wyll
killeth. Suche a murderer by
the lawe shuld not die, for God
absolueth and quitteth hym,
and prepared in the commune
wealthe of the Israelites, sanctuaries,
and refuges for them,
whyther as they might flee for
their sauegarde. Exod. xxi. Nu.
xxxv. Ios. xx. lest theyr bloude
shulde be shed againe.
               
                  
He that of malice, and willingly
killeth a mā shuld no waies
be saued, for vnto such the lord
commaundeth deathe agayne.
Exo. xxi. Leui. xxiiii. And also
in the tyme of the lawe of nature
this was the commaundement
of God for murder. Gen.
ix. he that sheddeth a mannes
bloude, shall haue his bloude
shed againe: and so saith Christ
Math. xxvi. he that striketh wt
the swearde, shall peryshe with
the sweard. This sin is so horrible,
that no indulgēce or pardō
shulde pitie the offence, nor pardon
the fault: but the murderer
incase he fled to the highe aulter,
he shoulde be fet fourthe:
as ye maye see the experyence
in Ioab at the cōmaundement
of Salomon. iii. Regum. ii.

and reade. Nume. xxxv. If the
gistrate dyspense either for fere
of hym that shoulde suffer exequution,
or for anye profit or
gayne, and punysh it not, what
both he other thē prouoke theire
of God agaynst hym selfe &
the hole realme? For the Lorde
sayeth, he wyl not dwell in the
earth tyll it be pourged wyth
the bloude of hym that shed
the bloud. Nume. xxxv. Let all
men therefore in the commune
wealthe knowe and feare thys
doctrine of Paul. Ro. xiii. The
magistrat beareth not a sweed
in vayne. Let the Maiestrate
take hede of two things: first yt
vnder the pretexte and cloke of
the lawe to serue hys affeccion
or gayne, he punyshe not y•
innocent. In thys offended the
kyngs and magistrates of the

Israelites that for the maintenaunce
of theyr supersticion,
false religion and corrupt maners,
kylled and put to deathe
the Prophetes, and the Apostles.
So Iesabell caused Naboth
to be slayne. iii. Reg. xxi.
               The second let ye magestrate
take heade he absolue not him
that God condemneth, and cō
                  maundeth
to be punyshed, for
gayne, affection, good intencior
els for any folyshe & preposterus
pety: for so doing Saul
loste his kyngdome .i. Samu.
xv. reade the place. And Ahab
the kynge of Israel for dimissyng
of Bennaud as god said:
they soule shalbe for his soule
.iii. Regum. fourtene. Euen as
here is occacion to admonishe
of iustice towardes euil doers,

so is it to speake of warre, and
how it may be vsed lawfulli by
magestrates. The magestrate
offendeth when he beginneth
or continueth any iniuste battel,
or of affeccion punisheth any
innocent person: So Iosyas
offended althoughe he was
a good man in makinge warre
with the Egypcians, where as
honest conditions of peace
was offred, and was slayne for
his laboure. The magestrate
of the other part maye offende
if he in case he see his subiectes
oppressed and wyll not defend
thē as Abraham did his neuie
Loth and other. Agayne, thys
battell he is daylye bounde vnto,
to warre agaynste vice and
to punyshe, synne and incase he
see anye rebellion to resiste the

iust execusion of iustice, not to
feare: for God wyll helpe his
procedinges. Deut. xiii. And it
maye be seen that God wyl fauoure
the magestrate that fighteth
against his owne brother,
if it be to amende vyce and to
kyll synne. For in manner the
hole tribe of Beniamin was destroyed
for the defence of adulterie.
Farther a maiestrate fighteth
iustly, when he resisteth vniust
forse, whether it be of foren
ennemyes, or of his owne rebellious
subiectes. Of such lawes
as shulde be kepte in the tyme
of warre it is written Deut. xx.
xxiii. Luke. iii. Oure warryers
haue made of war a menes and
waye to all robberye and spoil.
The captayne by hys fayth is
bound to haue as many as his

allowaūce chargeth him with
all, but lyke a thiefe he deceyueth
the Kynge bothe of hys
noumber of menne, and robbeth
hym of hys goodes: and
for lacke of true paymente to
the halfe number that he is appoyneted
vnto, he weryeth the
good wyll of the poore Souldiours,
that extreme pouertye
wyth syckenes for lacke of paymente
of theyr wages, causeth
theym to passe neyther of the
Kyng, neyther of the commune
wealth.
               And as these vniuste and alreadye
dampned Capytaynes
(excepte they repente) wyth receyuers,
paye Masters, vitaylers,
and other, destroye not
onelye the lawe and Magesty
of Armes, but also deceiue

the Kynge by pyllyng and pollynge
the poore & needye souldyours:
so decaye & vndo they
the hole commune weale. For
they come to serue the cōmune
wealth of lytle or no valewe at
all: in seruyng of the commune
wealthe they enryche them selues
vniustly to the vtter impouerysshynge,
and beggerynge
both of the cōmune wealth and
the heades thereof.
               And well both Magistrate
and Souldiour meriteth the
same. For the one trusteth he
knoweth not whom, other then
vpon reporte: the other prepareth
hym selfe to the warre
for defence of his contrey, with
horedome, thefte, and all abhominacyon.
               
                  
And by false & theuish meanes
bryngeth more to the war then
is hys owne: no maruell then
though God set such a thiefe ouer
hym as wyl geue hym lesse
thē is his dew. True men were
wount to go to batel, and such
as prepared theim selues with
the feare of god to liue and die
for theyr Magistrate and coū
                  try:
nowe the veryer thiefe, and
blasphemoure of the God of
batel, the better soldiour. Wel
God maye gyue the vyctorye
to suche blasphemours for a
tyme, but doutles it wyll not
nor cannot continue. Loke vpon
all the warres that Moses
wrytteth of in hys fyue bokes,
and then shall ye knowe the
same. Wherefore I humbly requyre
all Magistrates bothe

in peace and warre to punyshe
chiefely these two vices adulterye
& blasphemye, incase they
would haue either vyctorie in
war, or quietnes in peace.
               As touchyng swearyng and
blasphemye, it is knowen vnto
al men of God, how the law
condemneth it in the fyrste table.
Exodi. xx. Deutronomi. v.
Thou shalt not take the name
of the Lord in vayne: for God
wyll not leaue vnpunyshed,
suche as abuse hys name. Of
an othe I thyncke it therefore
conueniēt to speake sumwhat.
There is two maner of othes,
the one of custome or of sport,
the other serious and graue, requyred
and taken before the
Maiestrate or Iudge. The
Fyrst is deuyllyshe, damnable

and nought of euery part, and
forbidden by god to all christian
mē. The other that is taken
for the glorye of God, the
defence of the trueth, or helpe
of a mans neyghboure, as necessitye
shal require is laweful
and godly. But in this lawful
oth a man may offend two maner
of wayes. Fyrst if hys hert
and mynde be not accordynge
to hys woordes, but that hys
mouth speaketh one thing and
the herte thyncketh an other
thynge: the seconde if he that
sweareth, sweare by anye creatures.
Both these be blasphemous
before God.
               And in case it be damnable
in a noughty matter to sweare
by creatures, is it not the same
trow ye, daylye and folyshly of

custome to sweare by a mans
hande, hys heade, by the masse,
and suche lyke? The more vile
the thynge is we sweare by, the
more is the othe detestable before
God. Wherefore in thinges
not necessarye, and requyred
lawfully, to sweare by anye
thyng, is synne. In wayghtye
matters to sweare by ani thing
except by god, is no lesse offēce.
That may we see .iiii. maner of
wayes. By reason, y• holy scripture,
exāples, & the Canon law.
By reasō thus: to sweare is to
protest & promise the thing we
sweare to be true before hym y•
knoweth the thoughtes and
cogitacions of the harte, that
knoweth onlye and solye God:
therefore is it blasphemye to
sweare or attribute ye same to a

creature as they do that sweareth
by creatures.
               Agayne euery oth hath annexed
wyth it, an inuocacion,
and execracion. An execracion,
that he by whom we sweare
maye punyshe and curse vs
if we swere false. An inuocacion,
that he by whom we swere,
woulde helpe vs if we sweare
true. But onely God can saue
and lose, reason woulde then
hym onely to be sworn by.
               The authoritye of the scripture.
Thys also is double: the
one techeth by whom we shuld
swere, the other by whome wee
shoulde not sweare: that is by
God, & by no creatures. Deut.
vi. x. Thou shalt feare the lord
thy God, and worshyp hym,
and also sweare by hys name.

Esai. xlv. vnto me shall euerie
kne bowe, and euery toung
sweare. In the .lxv. speakynge
of the callynge of the Gentiles
he sayeth: He that wyll sweare
shall sweare by the true God.
And Iere. xii. they shal sweare
the Lorde liueth.
               That no man should sweare
by creatures, ye haue. Exodi.
xxiii. Ye shall not thyncke vpon
the name of straunge goddes:
neyther shall it be hearde
out of youre mouthes. Iosue.
xxiii. The people be admonished
not to sweare by the names
of the goddes that the people
vsed, whither thei were going.
Hierem. v. It is sayde that the
people offended because they
sweared by the gods that were
not God. And ye people thynke

it is no synne to annex a creature
with god, heare what Sophonie
the prophet saith. Cap.
i. I wyll sayeth the Lorde, destroye
them that worshyp and
sweare by Malchon, that is to
saye by there patron. Where
as the Prophet meaneth, they
that sware by god & creatures,
matcheth & setteth God and the
deuyl in one chayre, & sete. Exā
                  ples
out of ye scriptures: Abraham
sware by the moste highe
god. God swereth by hym self.
               Policarpus woulde rather
suffer the flames of fyer, then
to sweare by Ceasars fortune.
Euseb, libro .iiii. Chap. xv.
               The Canon lawe Causa
.xxii. Q. i. clericum per creaturas. &
Et si quis per creaturas, and si aliqua
causa, also Mouet te iterum.
               
                  
Thus the lawes begynne, and
the glosse vpon the same places
requyreth vs to sweare
onelye by god. I haue taried
the longer in thys matter, because
I happened to se of late
a certaine boke for the making
of Deacons, priestes, and Byshoppes,
wherein is requyred
an othe by Sainctes: where at
I did not a litle wonder. And
howe it is suffered, or who is
the authoure of that booke, I
well knowe not. I am led to
thynke it to be the faute of the
correctoure in the printynge,
for two causes. One is because
in the othe for the Byshoppe
is no mencion made of
anye sainctes.
               The other cause is, that in y•
same boke the minister muste

confesse at the receiuyng of his
vocacion, yt the boke of God, ye
holy scriptur to be perfet, & sufficiente
for the saluaciō of mā.
               Yet do I muche meruayle
that in the same booke it is apointed
that he yt wyl be admitted
to the ministery of goddes
word or hys sacramentes must
come in white vestimētes, whiche
semeth to repugne playnelye
wyth the former doctryne
that cōsessed the onely word of
God to be sufficiēt. And sure I
am they haue not in ye word of
god, yt thus a minister should
be apperelled, nor yet in the
primatiue and best church.
               It is rather the habit and
vesture of Aton and the gentiles,
then of the ministers of
Christe. Farther where and of

whome, and when haue they
learned, that he that is called
to the ministery of gods word,
shoulde houlde the bread and
chalice in one hande, and the
boke in the other hande? Why
do they not as well gyue hym
in hys hande the founte and
the water? For the one is a sacramente
as well as the other.
If the founte be to great, take
hym a basynne wyth water or
such lyke vessell. But in thys
mater and in other, as tollerable
thynges be to be borne wt
for the weakes sake awhyle, so
I thyncke it not mete before
the Kynges Maiestye and his
mooste honorable Councell to
halte in anye parte, but to saye
the truth: that they knowing ye
same, may redresse it assone as

maye be, as my parte is & al other
priuate persons to praye
thē to do the same, & besech god
to restore vs to the primatiue
church, which neuer yet had nor
shal haue ani match or like. Before
all thynges beware of an
oth by any creatures, except ye
will be glad to haue gods displeasure,
Now foloweth ye sixt
daūger of Ionas, howe he is
caste into the sea.
               So they toke Ionas & cast
him into the sea, & y• sea left raging.
And ye mē fered ye lord exceadinglye,
doinge sacrifices, &
making vowes vnto the lord.
               Here se we two thynges: Ionas
cast into the sea, and howe
the sea left there vpon hys ragynge.
Out of the fyrste learneth
euery Magistrate & king

their office to caste out of theyr
cōmune wealth, as manye Ionasses
as they fynde stoborne,
& wyl not amende theyr lyues.
If Ionas in the sea could not
be saued, that offended but in
neglectyng of hys dewtie, and
yet confessed his faute, & conuerted
ye mariners, what maye
wee thyncke: is it possible to
sayle or lyue quyetlye wyth so
mani obstinate Ionasses: Nay
doutles: what remedy thē? Let
thē be cast all into the sea. But
lest mē shuld be to much offēdid
wt this seuere punyshment as
though I wold al to be cast in
to ye sea, I wil bring ye examinaciō
of ye mater to the .iiii. sorts
of people yt I spake of before,
and so appoint of euery sorte
whō the kinges magestie must

cast into the sea, or sende to the
Gallies.
               Fyrste Let vs speake of the
Byshops and priestes. Theyr
offyce was in the primatiue &
fyrste churche, to be preachers
of goddes worde, and ministers
of Christes Sacramentes.
Not to sacrifyce for ded
nor lyue, not to synge, or masse
or anye souche lyke. Unto the
fyrst original must al these mē
as they be called, of the holye
churche, be called: els by they
no shepherdes, but rauenynge
woulfes, to deuoure the shepe
of God. And that thys maye
the better be done youre maiestie
muste begyn wyth youre
Chapell and Chapellanes:
make theym to serue the same
soules that laboreth for theyr

liuynges. If your Grace do it
not, ye shal put your own selfe
in daunger of God. And from
henceforth make your Chapel
laynes men of the churche, and
let the Chapell go. And when
your magesty hath done thys,
your selfe cause all noble men
of your realme to do the same.
Thē reforme your Coleges in
the Uniuersities, and se honest
men to haue the leadynge and
ouersyghte of the youth: suche
as wyll amende, let them tarye
styll in theyr offyces, suche as
wyl no
                     •
                   your magestie must remoue,
if euer ye bryng the ship
to quyetnes. Unto the clarcke
from henceforth as ye wil aūswere
vnto it, gyue no benifice,
or spirituall promocions to
none, but to suche a one as can

& wyll preach true doctryne, or
els teache vnto the youth the
Cathechisme, and healpe the
people wyth some good councell,
Or else cast thē all into the
seaithat is, put thē out of theyr
offyce, and put better in theyr
places. And beware of this vn
godly pitye wherewith al men
for the most part be veri much
nowe adayes combred wythal,
which wyll for pitye rather let
a fole or an euyl man to enioye
hys benefice, then a thousande
soules to be broughte to know
ledge? thys in no pitye but rather
a crueltye and kylling of
the soule. Therfore if it should
please the Magistrates to
make a law that no man shuld
haue Byshoprycke, benefyce,
prebend, or other ecclesiastical

vocacion lenger then he vsed
hym selfe accordyng to his vocacion,
it were wonderful well
               The noble men that byeth
theyr offyces, and selleth agayne
the iustice and the lawe,
yt is a pointed to the office, must
be admonyshed: in case they
wyl not amende, into the sea wt
theym. Put theym out of their
offyces and putte better in.
These Gentlemen that lyueth
vpon dycynge, cardynge, ydlenes,
or with other mēnes gooddes
muste be also admonyshed:
yf they wyll not repente, altogether
caste them in to the
sea. Folysh and preposterous
pitye hath brought both king
and the Lawes not onelye of
thys realme, but also of God

into contempte, and dayly wyl
more and more if it be not fore
seen. Nowe ye lawes that iustly
shoulde be executed vpon theues,
and murderers, is of folyshe
pitye dyspensed wyth al,
and manye iudge it were better
to saue after hys opinion,
then to damne after the commaundement
of God. For thei
saye: O he is a tall felowe, and
can do the kynge good seruice,
it were pitye he should be hanged.
But in case they knewe or
goddes lawes or mannes lawes,
and knewe what maintaineth
best a commune wealthe
they would saye: suche a thiefe
or murderer can neuer do the
Kynges Magestye better seruyce
then when he is hanged
for hys faute, that other men

may feare to offende the lawe,
by hys example. Marke wher
vnto thys preposterous and
sinistre pitie hath brought the
realme, to be pestered wt more
theues then halfe Europe beside.
In so much that a manne
can not trauell suerlye by the
way with twentye pounde in
hys pourse, thoughe twentye
men be together in a companie:
as it was sene by experiēce
of late dayes to y• great shame
of al the iustices of the coūtry
and to the slaunder of the hole
lawe and the realme.
               The fraude, gyle, and Couetousnes
of the lawers must either
be amended, other thei thē
                  selues
to be cast into the sea: For
vnto thys hathe theyr crafte
and filthy lucre broughte the

enter your graces Court, may
se ye magestye of a godly house
and perceiue by the order of y•
familye that God dwelleth in
the courte and realme. But
(the more to be pitied) it is so
nowe that who so euer enter &
marcke the condicions of manye
men in the courte, he shall
fynde in the moste parte of the
house hangyngs of gods woū
                  des,
hys fleshe and his bloud,
wt such blasphemous othes as
the deuyll hym selfe if he were
incarnate woulde tremble to
speake. And greate wounder
it is there falleth not fyre frō
heauen to burne them and the
house they tarye in. Like wyse
where as goddes lawes forbyddeth
dise, and Cardes, and
also the commune statutes of

thys realme (the more shame
it is) it is vsed daily and hourly
in the Kynges Magestyes
house, where as onelye the
magestye of GOD is offended
but many an honest man
vndone in the yere. That dise
house must be cast into the sea
if it be not, God wyll caste the
maynteyners thereof at length
into hell. What and if all men
folowe thys godlye counsel of
Ionas what wyll folow? this
that is in the texte.
               The sea shal leue his
ragynge.
               As longe as Ionas was in
the shyp there was no quyetnes:
nowe beinge in the sea all
is at peace: so shall it be wyth
vs if we amend and cease from

euyll doynges, as it is writen.
Hieremy .ii.vi.vii. And thys

brynge hys commune wealth
to anye good poynte, restored
good iudges to ye ciuile state

same maye we see in Dauyd

So dyd Artaxerses that

               The same order toke Cambises
Cyrus sonne, though he
was and idell manne, he caused
the skynne of a corrupte

Iudge to be pulled ouer hys
heade, and to be nayled in the
place of Iudgement, to putte
other menne in feare how they
corrupted iustyce. For the
kepynge of all men in an order
it were well if men woulde
thyncke vpon the lawe of the
Corinthes: whyche men maye
reade in the Adagyes of Erasmus.
The Adage is: Proteruiam
fecit.
               
               Where as euerye manne
was bounde to gyue accompt
howe he lyued, and maynetayned
hym self. And the same
lawe had Solon at Athenes.
               When the Magystrate by
neglygence or Proposterous
pytye, wyll not punyshe for
syn, then God strikethe, as ye
may se by the vniuersal flowd,

by the fyre in Sodome, and
Gomor. Gyue hede therefore
most gracious Lordes, to punyshe
these Ionasses, and to
put better into theyr place, or
els God wyll punysh either wt
an euil beast, either with swerd
either wyth famyne, either
with pestilēce, as it is writen
Ezechiell .xiiii. But
in case ye wyl do it the
sea wyll cease. As
I praye God it
maye.
Amen.
            
         
         
            
            The fourth Sermon
vpon Ionas, made by
Iohn Hoper the .v. of
Marche.
            
               ☞The Preface.
               
                  SAinte Paul sayeth:
it is a moost
true saying, and
worthy to be receyued
of euerye
parte, that Christ Iesus came
into thys worlde to saue synners
.i. Timo. i. Unto the whiche
sayinge agreeth the wordes
of oure Sauioure Christ.
Luke .xix. The sonne of man
came to seke, and saue that whiche
was lost, Who is it amōg
vs all that woulde not ioyfully
at the hearyng of so amiable
& swete a saying, reioyce? seyng

we be all miserable and cursed
synners by nature, and yet
woulde (as full of miserye and
blyndenes as we be) be saued,
wyshe euer to be out of payne.
But in thys is all the hede to
be taken, leste we sinisterlye
vnderstande these confortable
promises, which the deuil auē
                  turth
to swad vs vnto. Wher
as he cā not al together beriue
and rob vs of the promises he
wolde vs to construe & vnderstand
the promises amis. And
where as these promises apertayneth
to none but unto repē
                  taunte
synners, he dazeth, and
deceyueth oure affeccion and
loue we beare to oure selues,
that he wyl beare vs in hande
Gods promyse appertayneth
as well to the impenitent and

neuer myndynge synner to amende,
as vnto the sorowfull
afflycted beleuyng sinner, and
he that wyl study the amendemēt
of lyfe. Against the which
illusion and craft of the deuil,
Christ speaketh. Mat. ix. Luc.
v. I came not to call the iuste,
but sinners to repentaūce. Of
the whyche repentaunce if we
be destitute, nothyng auaileth
vs the promises of God. Luc.
xiii. Excepte ye repente, all
shall peryshe. And the former
promyses were not so sweete,
but these threatnynges be as
bytter: Not vnto all men, but
vnto suche as be obstynatelye
yuel or desperat. Against whō
cryeth Ihon Baptyste: Euen
nowe is the axe putte vnto
the roote of the tree:
               
                  
Euery tre that bryngeth furth
no good fruite, is cut downe &
put into the fyre. Luke .iii.
               But a mā myght aske to what
purpose thys thyng is spoken
of by me? doutles to thys end
to prosequute and folowe my
matter begon. I sayd that the
authours of thys vnquietnes
in the realme in the churche, &
in euerye housholde, were verye
Ionasses, and those that
troubled the shyppe: whyche
oughte eyther to be amended
or remoued out of their office,
or els the shyppe maye neuer
come to rest. But because these
that be cast into the sea should
not dispaire, ther must be some
remedye founde to solace and
conforte suche as be fallen into
daunger of drownyng.
               
                  
Thys is the way: if they take
the admonicions and the admonitours
gētly and raile not
agaynste them, neither wynke
at their own faultes: but with
a true repentaunce of the hart
folowe thys our Prophet Ionas,
who confessed hys faulte,
and humblye asked remyssion
& pardō for the same. So shal
euery sīner be saued as he was
accordinge to the othe of God
Eze. xviii. As truly as I lyue
sayth the Lord, I wyl not the
deathe of a synner, but that he
be conuerted and lyue. Thys
counsell of the Lorde excepte
our troblous Ionasses folow
thei shalbe drowned in the water
of eternal damnacion, with
Pharao. But as heretofore
ye haue hearde howe Ionas

for hys disobedience was punyshed:
so now out of the texte
ye shal hear how he repenting
hys mysbehauiour and offences,
is preserued in hys daungers:
howe he prayeth, and at
last how he is delyuered. And
that I maye the better & more
playnely teache and open the
same, I wyll deuyde the texte
that foloweth into foure partes.
The fyrst part conteineth
the behauiour and doyngs of
the shyppemen, after they had
caste Ionas into the sea. The
second part conteyneth howe
Ionas beyng cast into the sea
was receaued into the bely of
the whale. The thyrde conteyneth
the behauioure and doynges
of Ionas in the whales
bely.
               
                  
The fourth conteyneth the
deliueraunce, and castynge
out of Ionas from the bellye
of the whale. The fyrste. The
texte sayeth those men feared
wounderfullye the Lorde, and
sacrificed vnto hym and made
theyr vowes.
               The shyppe men dyd these
thre thynges: they fered, they
sacrificed, and vowed.
               After they perceyued vpon
the execucion of Ionas the sea
to leaue hys trouble, they neglected
not the true religiō whiche
they learned in theyr trouble,
but are better and more
strengthened in the same, for
they feared the Lord, and hohoured
hym onelye. Of these
shyppe men let vs learne constancye,
and perseueraunce

in the true knowledge of god:
and when we be deliuered out
of daunger, lette vs 
                     〈◊〉
                   geue
oure selues to 
                     〈◊〉
                   and folye
of lyfe, as naturally we be
inclined and propen
                     ••
                   to do.
               Thus admonyshed Moses diligently
the children. Deutro.
vi. & .viii. yt whē they had receiued
the aboundante benefites
of the Lorde, they shoulde not
in theire saturitie and aboundaunce
be vnmindfull of the
Lorde that brought them out
of the land of Egypt, and the
penurie and scarcitie of the deserte.
               The thankefulnes of these
Mariners shalbe laied agaīst
vs at the daye of oure examinacion
for oure vnthankefulnes:
for God hathe not onelye

quyeted the sea for vs but also
aboundantlye geuen vs the
vse and commoditye booeth
of sea and lande: and not onelye
that for the rest and quyetnes
of the bodye, but also he
hath apeaced the sea of greate
displeasure and damnacion eternall
by castynge of hys onely
beloued sonne Christe Iesus
vpō the crosse, to cesse and
apeace theire and displeasure
betwene vs and hym: & yet we
neyther fere nor loue him, but
with continuall hatred, & despyte,
contemne both him, & his
holy word.
            
            
               ¶They do sacrifice.
               
                  THey thoughte it not
inoughe inwardlye to
honoure the Lord, but
dyd outwarde sacrifice, to proprotest

and declare vnto the
worlde the good iudgement,
fayeth, & knowledge they had
in the Lord. So shuld we do:
not only knowe god and feare
hym inwardly, but also outewardly,
with praier thākes geuyng
and other good workes
cōmaunded by God to declare
the same, as they dyd by their
sacrifices before y• cūminge of
Christe into oure fleshe. The
whyche were tipes, and significacions
of Christe to come,
that coulde not take awaye
the synne of the worlde as
Saynte Paule sayeth: Hebru
.x. It is impossible that
the bloude of Calues shoulde
take awaye synne. Christes
sacrifice once offered for all,
by that once satisfied for al sinnes.
Hebrues .ix. And where

as is remission of synne, there
nedeth no more sacrifice. It is
therefore an vngodly doctrine
that in thys tyme of the newe
Testamente, teachethe anye
other sacrifyce for synne, then
the onelye death of Chryste.
               If question nowe be asked, is
there then no Sacrifices now
lefte to be done of Christian
people? Yes truely, but none
other then suche as oughte to
be donne wythoute aulters.
And they be of three sortes.
The fyrste is the Sacrifyces
of thanckes gyuynge. Psalme
.li. Amos the fourth, and
fifte. Hebrues the thirtene. Oseas
.xiiii. The second is beneuolence,
and liberalitye to the
pore. Mich. vi.i. Corin. xvi.li.
Corinthia. viii. and ix.
               
                  
The thyrde kynde of sacrifice
is the mortifiyng of our owne
bodyes, and to dye from sinne
Rome. xii. Mat. xi. Luke. xiiii.
If we studye not daylye to offer
these sacrifices to God, we
be no christian men.
               Seyng Christian men haue
none other sacrifices thē these
whych maye and oughte to be
done wythoute Aulters, there
shoulde among Christians be
no Aulters. And therefore it
was not wythoute the greate
wysedome and knowledge of
God, that Christe, hys Apostels,
& the primatyue church,
lacked Aulters: for they knew
that the vse of aulters was taken
awaye. It were well then
that it myght please the magistrates
to tourne the aulters

into tables, accordynge to the
fyrste instituciō of Christe, to
take awaye the false perswasion
of the people they haue of
sacrifices to be done vpon the
aulters. For as longe as the
aulters remayne boeth the ignoraunte
people, and the ignoraunte,
and euyll perswaded
priest, wyl dreame alwayes of
sacrifice. Therfore were it best
that the Magistrates remoued
al the monumētes and tokens
of Idololatrye and supersticion.
Then shoulde the
true relegion of god the soner
take place.
            
            
               ¶They Uowe.
               
                  TOst lyke they vowed
to goo to Hierusalem,
there to manifeste the
myghtye power of God to the

people, and to giue thākes vnto
the Lorde accordinge to the
lawe and maner of Moses decrees.
Lest we shuld erre in the
nature & condition of a vowe,
there be thre thynges to be noted.
To whome the vowe is
made, what is vowed, and who
it is that maketh the vowe.
               The vowe shuld be made vnto
the Lorde, as Esaye the Prophete
sayth, Chapter .xix. they
shall make their vowes to the
Lord. The thynge vowed may
not be contrarye to anye of the
two tables wythin. Exod. xx.
Deut. v. He that voweth must
be suche a one as is able to pay
and satysfye hys vowe. So
Saint Paule aduised the yonger
wydowes to marye, perceiuing
how vntuly and vehemēt

the passions of yong age was,
that they were not apt to lyue
sole, nor to keepe their vowe, if
they shulde vowe so to do.
               Now foloweth the second mē
                  bre
of the oracion, how Ionas
beynge caste into the sea, was
receiued of the whale: and it be
ginneth the seconde chapter of
the Prophet in thys wyse.
               But the Lorde prepared
a greate fyshe that
shulde deueur Ionas.
And Ionas was in the
fyshes bealy thre dayes,
and thre nyghtes.
               The texte conteyneth two
thynges. Fyrste that the fyshe
prepared by the Lorde, swalowed
vp Ionas.
               
                  
The seconde, how long time
Ionas was in the fyshes belye.
The thynges to be noted
in the fyrste mēbre, be also two
in numbre. Fyrste is declared
the wonderful pitye, and mercye
of God, that can and wyll
healpe the afflicte in the dayes
of theyr affliccions. Ionas
thought none other but to dy,
and so dyd the Mariners: for
they besought God not to requyre
the innocentes bloud at
theyr handes. But the Lorde
that is redye to helpe as many
as cal vpon hym. Psalm. viii.
and .ix. lefte not hys penitente
and afflicted seruaunt Ionas
but preserued hys lyfe though
it were wyth trouble. Thus
wyll he do wyth all those that
be the Ionasses of thys realm

in case thei repent, though thei
shoulde be cast from al the honoure,
and offyces they haue:
better it were to lose them with
the fauoure of GOD, then to
kepe theym wyth goddes dyspleasure,
as zacheus dyd. Lu.
ix. Iacob. Gen. xxviii.
               The meanes howe God saueth
the afflicted be vnknowē
vnto man, and manne shoulde
not be curiouse to searche to
muche for the knoweledge of
theym, but commende theym
to God. For manye tymes
God vseth those for lyfe, that
mā iudgeth shulde leade vnto
death. So was Ionas saued
by the deuoutynge mouthe of
the whale, whyche semed vnto
Ionas reason rather a present
meanes vnto death. So vsed

he the cribbe of Moyses, And
the wounderfull passage of
the children of Israel through
the reade sea. If we pourge
and clense oure knoweledge,
religion, and maners, the lord
wyll fynde meanes sufficyente
to saue vs: whyche we maye
not appoynte to oure selues
but commende them to the prouydence
of God. For by the
same wayes yt we seake manye
tymes the fauoure of God,
and oure commoditye, we find
hys dyspleasure, and our own
dystruccion. As Saule dyd
.i. Regum .xv. that sacriificed
wythoute the commaundemente
of God, purchased the
seuere, and iuste ire of God.
The Israelites that of good
meanynge and intencion fasted,

zacha .vii. and sought by
that meanes gods good wyll,
they founde hys dyspleasure.
Cayp has soughte by councell
Iho. xi. to haue oppressed the
procedinges of Christ, and oppressed
hym selfe, & the whole
state of the common wealth also.
C
                     •
                  cero Rome, Demostenes
Athens, eche put their cōmune
wealthe in daunger, by theyr
beste aduised counsell, for the
preseruacion thereof. And so
shall all the Ionasses, extorcioners,
oppressours, deceiuers,
flatterers, and other of thys
Realme, come into extreme pouertie
by the same meanes thei
seeke ryches: for the curse of
God can not suffer euyll gotten
goodes, & possessions long
to prosper.
               
                  
Nowe Ionas sayeth that
he was in the belye of y• whale
thre dayes and three nyghtes.
Of thys we learne that God
healpeth not by and by the afflicted
but exerciseth theym in
theyr troubles. Fyrste because
he maye the better humble thē
and bryng thē to a true knowledge
of theyr faultes, whose
greatnes is so bygge that it cā
                  not
be perceyued where as the
payne for it is easy and lyght.
But the Lorde woulde vs the
better to iudge of the fault by
the greatnes of the payne, and
therefore the Lord is sayed to
explorate and trye hys in affliccion
as the golde is tryed
by the fyer. Farther his mightye
power is the better declared,
where as he helpeth suche

as be playne desperate of al other
remedies and helpes.
               Laste of all thys tyme of Ionas
beynge in the whales bodye,
was a type and fygute of
Christes beynge in the hearte
of the earth thre dayes & three
mightes. Mat. xxii.
               Nowe foloweth it how thys
man behaued hym selfe in the
tyme of hys trouble. When he
perceyued in the fyshes belye
some hope and sparcle of lyfe,
he fell vnto prayer. But because
prayer conteyneth in it
selfe two thynges, the knoweledge
of the fault, and hope of
forgyuenes, I admonyshe all
the Ionasses of thys realme
that they acknowledge and
leaue of from their faults, and
beg pardone for them, excepte

they wyll dye eternallye. The
Byshoppes and the priestes
that hath either wyth false doctryne
destroyed the churche, either
by negligence not builded
it wyth the true worde of God,
lette them acknoweledge their
faultes, amende it, and aske remission
betyme if they wil not
dye in their synne. The noble
men and the Lawers that are
secretelye touched wyth the
worde of God, and their conscience
condempneth them of
wronges, fraudes, Iniuries,
and deceites lette them not indurate
and hardē their hartes,
but praye to the Lorde to take
from them pryde, arrogancye
blindnesse, and couetousenesse,
lest they dye in theire synne, as
Saul did. The people let them

pray vnto God for knowledge
and patience, that they maye
knowe and suffer all thynges
as true subiectes ought to do.
And that from hense forth they
hate discorde, dissencion, treason,
conspiracie, whoredom, adultery,
idlenes, hatred, enuye,
disdaine, and suche like as prouoketh
goddes Ite, and leadeth
to the destruccion of a cō
                  mune
wealthe. But thys prayer
of Ionas is so acceptable,
it myghte be thoughte of some
menne, that the place where
Ionas prayed in should haue
bettered it, as the folyshe opinion
of the worlde is at thys
tyme: that iudgeth the prayer
sayed at the hyghe aulter to
be better then that whyche is
sayed in the Quier, that in the

quere better then it that is saied
in the bodye of the churche:
that in the body of the churche
better then the prayer sayd in
the fyelde, or in a mans chamber.
But oure Prophet sayth:
the lord hath no respect to the
place, but vnto ye heart & faith
of hym that prayeth: and that
apereth: for penitente Ionas
praieth out of the whales velly,
and miserable Iob vpon y•
doung heape, Daniell in the
Caue of the Lions, Hieremye
in the clay pyt, the thiefe
vpon the crosse, Saynte Stephin
vnder the stones. Wherfore
the grace of God is to be
prayed for in euery place and
euery where as oure necessitye
shall haue neede and wanteth
solace. Althoughe I commend

the prayer made to God in the
name of Chryste, to be lyke in euerye
place, because that oure
necessitie requyreth helpe in euerye
place: yet I do not condempne
the publike place of
prayer where as goddes word
is preached, hys holye sacramentes
vsed, and commune
prayer made vnto God, but alowe
the same, and sorye, it is
no more frequented and haunted:
but thys I woulde wyshe
that the magistrates shoulde
put bothe the preacher, minister,
& the people in one place
and shut vp the particion called
the chauncell, that separateth
the congregatiō of Christ
one from the other, as thoughe
the vele and particion of the tē
                  ple
in the olde lawe, yet shulde

remayne in the churche: where
in deade al fygures, and tipes,
ended in Chryste. And incase
thys were done, it shoulde not
onlye expresse the dignitie and
grace of the newe testamente,
but also cause y• people the better
to vnderstande the thinges
red there by the mynyster, and
also prouoke the minyster to a
more study of the thinges that
he readeth, leste he shoulde be
found bi the iudgemēt of the cō
                  gregatiō
not worthye neyther
to reade, nor to minister in the
churche: farther that suche as
wold receiue the holie cōmuniō
of the precious body & bloud of
Christ, myght bothe heare and
se playnely what is done, as it
was vsed in the prymatyue
churche, when as the abhomynation

done vpō aulters was
not knowen, nor y• sacryfyce of
Christes precious bloud so cō
                  culcated
and trodē vnder fote.
               The thyrde thynge in thys
praier is to be noted (lest in the
porte it selfe we make shyppewracke,
& offende God in praying)
to whome we pray. Unto
hym that onlye seeth the cogitacions
of out herte, and can
and wyl do al thynges for vs
accordyngly, helpe at neede, &
punish in due seasō, which onli
god cā do: & vnto him shuld we
direct, and make our praier, after
the examples of the Patryarckes,
Prophetes, & the Apostels,
who called alwaies vpon
their God: for such as direct otherwise
theyr praiers, thei fail
and erre al the heauens wyde.

Agaynste whome speaketh Esay.
lxiii. Iere. ii.xv. Eche. xiiii.
And the Lorde is angry wyth
hys people as Esaye sayeth,
Chap. ix. because they turned
not vnto hym that strake thē,
nor vnto the God of armoure.
And in the Prophet Ose. Chap
vii. They called not to me (sayeth
the Lorde) in theire hartes.
And in the same place a litle after
sayeth the Prophet: they be
retourned, but not vnto ye highest.
So lykewyse are they no
lesse to be blamed that deuyde
their hartes parte vnto God,
and parte vnto creatures: of
whome speaketh Osee, in the
x. Chapter. If these thre thynges
yt Ionas vsed in ye whales
bellye, were vsed of the people
that professe Chrystes name in

oure temples, blessed were we.
But it is al to the contrary: we
knowe not what prayer is, nor
yet wyl take the paynes to lern
it, The more is the petye, and
the more is God stirred to vengeaunce
and punishement, and
the more cruell shal the payne
be when it is executed by God.
As we knowe by the texte, he
prayed, so may we know by the
same how he prayed, and what
was the forme and manner of
hys prayer. That is verye requisite
to be knowen, marked
and borne awaye. The effecte
and sūme thereof consysteth in
thre poyntes. In two of y• first
verses he putteth forthe bryefly
the abridgement & Epitome
of hys prayer. Then declareth
he the greatenes of his daūger

and ieopardy. Thyrdly he setteth
forthe the pitye, and mercie
of God. The firste parte.
               From my troubles I
haue called vpon the
Lord, and he herd me:
from the depnes of the
depest I cryed, & thou
herdest my voyce.
               ☞Out of thys fyrst parte we
learne two doctrines: the one
that we shuld not dispaire, nor
cleane caste of God in aduersitie.
The other, that in aduersitie
we shulde not flye, nor seeke
any forbydden, or vnlawefull
meanes of help. And these two
thynges obserued Ionas in
this his trouble: and we shuld
do the same, accordynge to the
commaundemente of God.
               
                  
Psalme. rcix. Call vpon me
in the day of thy troubles, and
I shall heare the, as he dyd at
all tymes. Psal. xcix. And thys
cry of Ionas to the Lord was
rather the crye of hys herte,
then the noyse or sounde of his
mouth, as Moses was. Exod.
xiiii. and the good womans.
i. Samuel. i.
               The circumstances of true
prayer obserued, the Lord heareth
thys faythfull prayer accordynge
to hys promises.
Whereof all Idololatricall
Byshoppes and priestes may
learne, if they wil forsake their
Idololatrye, and call vnto the
Lord, mercy is ready for them.
And if the lasciuious, auaricious,
or couetouse gentleman,
or lawyer wyll acknowledge

hys faulte, and aske remission
for it, it wyll be forgeuen him.
And so shall it be to the commen
sorte of people if they acknowledge
their disobedience,
rebelliō, treasō, pride, contēpte
of the superiour powers, and
aske mercy for it.
               The second part of his prayer
conteyneth a descripcion of
his daungers that he was in,
after thys sorte.
               Thou hast caste me
downe depe in the middest
of the sea, and the
fludde compassed me about:
yea al the waues
& rolles of water went
ouer me, I thought I
had ben cast away out

of thi sight: but I wyll
yet again loke toward
thi holy tēple. The waters
cōpassed me euen
to my verye lyfe: the
depe lay about me, and
the wedes wer wrapt
about my head. I wēt
doune to the botom of
the hils, & was barred
in wyth earth for euer.
               It is the cōmen sort of al holy
men, for the moste parte in
the holy scripture, to make mē
                  cion
in their prayers of theyr
daūgers, & to amplify thē, that
their greatnes may be the vetter
marked & knowē: and thys
is done for thre causes.
               
                  
The one, because wyth the
numbrynge, and rehearsall of
their great daūgers, they may
the more inflame them selues
to ardente and earnest prayer.
For the more a man feleth hys
owne griefe, the more diligente
he wyll be to seeke a remedye.
The other is to brynge a man
the more to a contempte & hatred
of him selfe: for the greatnes
of the payne, declareth the
enormitie, and filthines of the
transgression, and synne.
               The thyrde is to sette forth
the power and good wyll of
God, that can, and wyll helpe
in extreme and desperate euylles,
and saue wyth sup
                     •
                  rabundaunt
mercye where as he findeth
iniquitye and synne to abounde.
Romaines .v. and so

manye tymes the slauery, and
miserable state of the afflicted,
setteth forthe the maiestie and
rychenesse of Goddes mercye.
Math. viii.ix. Ihon. iiii.ix.
               Thys manne of God noted
and knewe the dyspleasure of
God agaynste synne: but oure
Ionasses slepe quietly in both
eares, and feleth not the paine
of synne. And thys securitie &
insensiblenes vnder the wrath
of God, commeth by the ignorauncie
that the whole worlde
is lapte in almooste, as touchynge
the daunger of their
vocations.
               If the cleargye, the Byshoppes
and pryestes, woulde
thynke vpon thys payne annexed
vnto theire vocacyon,

if they do it not truelye, faythfully,
and as they be commaū
                  ded
of God: Sanguinem illorum de
manu tua requirā. That is to say:
I wyll requiere their bloud at
thy hande. Ezechiel. iii.xxxiii,
they wolde serue the Lorde,
and vse more diligence in their
vocatyon then they do. If the
Noble men wolde thynke vpon
thys texte: the Lorde resysteth
the proude, and thys texte
Esay. v: woo be vnto you that
ioine house to house, and felde
to feld. &c. and the lawers and
iudges that is wrytten Prouerb.
xvii. and Math. xxiii,
they wolde not slepe in greate
rest, nor vse the place they be in
with such parcialitie and false
head as they do: incase the commune
people wold thynke vpon

the .iii. of Gene. where as laboure
is commaunded, and also
.i. Thess. iiii.ii. Tess. iii. they
wolde not forsake laboure, and
seke weapon and strengthe to
tourne and aulter the state and
ordre that God hathe appointed
vpon the earthe. But thys
I saye to euerye man of eache
of those degrees mencionated
of, the lesse they fele the daūger
of eternall damnatiō, the nerer
they be vnto eternal pain, and
haue alreadye one fote in hell,
whych shal neuer come agayn,
but the hole bodi and soul shal
folowe excepte they repente:
for no man is farther from heauen,
then he that feareth not
hell: Nor no man farther from
grace, thē he that feleth not ye
daunger of synne, as wee se no

man in more daungerous disease,
then he that knoweth not
hym selfe to be lycke, as those
men be that are fallen into frē
                  sie,
and madnes. Let vs lerne
with Ionas to knowe in what
daunger we be.
               Yet is there an other thyng
to be noted in Ionas wordes,
where as he sayeth: thou haste
caste me downe. Of these wordes
shulde those that be damned
by the Magistrates, acknoweledge
that it is not the
Magistrat that putteth them
to execucion, but God whose
ministers they be, and ought to
saue suche as goddes worde saueth,
and dampne those that
gods wordes dampneth. It is
God that sendeth to hell, that
hangeth for transgressyon vpon

the Gallowes. As Ionas
knewe in thys hys prayer. He
accused not the mariners that
caste hym into the sea, but confessed
the execution of the euell
to be from God.
               Let therefore from henceforth
the Bishop and person that is
depryued of theire vocatyons
for theyr misbehaueour, & false
or neglygente preachynge in
them, saye: the Lord hath cast
me doune. So lette the Noble
menne and the lawers say whēn
theire Rauyne, couetuousnes,
fraude and deceyte cryeth vengeaunce
before God tyll they
be dysplaced: the Lorde hath
caste me downe. And the same
lette the trayterousse subiecte,
the thyeffe, the murderer, and

idle mā say: the Lord brought
me to the galowes: The Lord
wolde I shulde trouble the cō
                  mon
wealth no longer.
               And I do here appele & burden
euery subiectes conscience
of thys realme of Englande.
Firste those that haue the doynges,
receiuinges, occupyinges,
and custody, ouersyght,
rule, and offyce of the kynges
maiesties goods or lādes. Thē
their conscience to whome the
kynge and hys counsell hathe
commended the teaching and
instructiō of hys people in the
knowledge and feare bothe of
God and man: fynally I apele
all the conscyences of the subiectes
of this realme whiche me
riteth some for deceite, falshed,
and deceyuynge of the kynge,

losse both of body and goodes
some for preaching erronious,
seditious, and false doctrine, or
for neclectinge the preachyng
of the true doctryne, deserue
most cruel punishmēt. Some
for false iudgemente merite
the losse of theyr lyues. The
rest for rebellion, sedicion, and
treason, deserue the swerde and
the galowes, whether in sufferynge
the payne appoynted
for suche transgression they cā
from their hartes say: thys suffer
I worthely, & wyll the vengeaūce
of God, because I haue
synned agaynst hym, & the law
of my cōmunwealth. No no y•
Lorde knoweth: euery man extenuateth,
yea excuseth al thinges
donne agaynst God & hys
order. But I wyll sayne the (y•
                  
thiefe and robber of the kynge
and of the commune wealthe)
to be kynge, and the kynge thy
offycer & receiuer: woldest thou
thy offycer shulde deceiue the?
Or yu traiterous & false subiect
if thou were kynge & the king
thy subiect, woldest yu be cōtented
that thy subiecte shoulde
conspyre and imagine howe to
plucke the out of thy realme?
What if mi Lord Bishop and
master persone were kynges,
trowye their Maiesties wold
be contented that theire Byshoppes
and priestes shoulde
whyster a tale of treason and
sedycyon in aurycul
                     •
                  r confession
or other pryueye conuentycles
to theire subiectes?
               Speake all ye that be fayned
kynges, and speake of youre

conscyences, I dare saye ye
wold not be thus hādled. Wht
then do ye handell an other so
                     •
                  
remember ye not in thys lawe
of nature. Quod tibi non vis fieri alieni
ne facias. That is to saye: do
not to an other, that thou woldest
not an other shulde do vnto
the. Amende therfore euerye
man, and be true and faythful
vnto the realm, to the king
and lawes of him & his realm.
And for ye loue of God ye noble
men, Gentelmen, iustices, and
lawers, the holsome lawes of
the realme, that statut
                     •
                  s, and cō
                  missiōs
that hath bene made
by the king and the counsel for
the preseruacion of the commune
wealth, and the helpe of
the poore, whyche be boothe
afflicted wyth your insaciable

and neuer contented couetousnes.
Let them be faythfully executed,
and vpryghtly interpretated,
according to y• minde
and meanynge of those that
made them. For the euyll construing,
and sinister takynge
of good lawes, and godly, meanynge
of godlye maiestrates,
doth not only afflicte the pore
of this realme, but wyl sure at
length caste the whole realme
vnder the water. It commeth
nowe into my mynd a practise
of euyl takyng the gouerners
worde & cōmaundement, how
perilous, & daungerous thing
it is. I was once in the rase of
Britaine wyth a fore wynde,
and contrarye fludde, the seas
in that place goynge both holowe,
and that by reason of a

multitude of Rockes in the
same place. The master of the
shyppe to conduite her the better,
sate vpon the mayne yerde
to see the seas aforehande, and
cryed to hym that styrred the
sterne alwayes, vpon whyche
syde he shuld styrre the shippe,
to breake best the daunger of
the sea. The wynde blowynge
hygh, where as the master cryed
a larde borde, he that styrred
mystoke it, and styrred a
stare borde, and the once mistakyng
of the masters lawe, had
almoste cast vs vnder the water.
Then thought I, it is not
wythoute cause that wysemen
compare a common wealthe to
a shyppe, for one thynge loseth
and saueth them bothe.
               For incase the masters officer

in the shyp obey not hys lawe,
the shyp wyll of force drowne.
So shal thys cōmen wealth, &
euery other that whē the kyng
and hys councell shall make
lawes to help, & saue the pore,
such as styrre the hynder part
of the shyp behind the kynges
backe, folow not that he is bid
to do, but that, that he lysteth
himselfe, and his owne priuat
cōmoditie to do, And thus putteth
both the shyp, the master,
and all the mariners in daunger
of drowning. Amend therfore
euery man betyme: If ye
do not, the Lorde at lengthe
wyll caste ye oure from all ye
haue, to the destruccion of you
and youres.
               But of one thynge I praye
you all that be true, and faythfull

subiectes and friendes vnto
the kyngdome, and the kynges
maiestye, that ye wyll not
im
                     •
                  pute, nor burden the kynges
maiestye, nor hys councell
wyth the oppression, extorcion,
thefte, iniuryes, deceites, falseheades,
defraudes, cautelles,
violences, and other wronges
that those thieues and destroiers
vse towardes you and the
commen wealth: if their vsyng
myghte come to their knoweledge,
I doubte not but that
your wronges shuld be redressed
by thē. And this I knowe
my selfe vi experience in weighty
matters, the kynges maiestyes
councell hathe not onlye
hearde, but geuen accordynglye
sentence wyth the trueth,

and vsed me rather lyke fathers,
then lyke iudges in such
matters: if they hadde taken
thynges spoken by me honestlye,
euyll construed by myne
accusers, there coulde haue folowed
no lesse then my greate
vndoynge, and hynderaunce
to all my labours and paines
in the vineyarde of the Lorde.
Therefore praye to hym that
all good lawes maye be iustly
executed, and all other amended,
whych God graunte.
               There is one worde more in
the texte whyche muste not be
neglected, where Ionas sayeth
he shall se againe the holy
temple of the Lorde. In the
whiche wordes, note two thinges.
The one, howe that in
the mooste obscure and darke

troubles of aduersity, God
suffereth some sparke of consolacion
to shyne.
               The other, to what ende a
manne beyng in trouble, shuld
desyre to bee deliuered: to extolle,
and prayse for euer the
name of the Lorde, Esay thirtye
and eyght. But how thys
ende of deliueraunce is practised
in oure dayes, the Lorde
knoweth. We vse not to desire
the Lord to be deliuered to
gloryfye and laude his holye
name as thys Ionas dyd, and
Dauyd Psal. fyftye and one,
an hundred & .xviii. But from
sickenesse and aduersytye we
tourne oure selfe to al vngodlynes,
and lyberty of lyfe. And
wher we wer euel before trouble
and sicknes, we be worse after.

Therfore when God hath
wasted one rod vpon vs in punyshemente,
he begynneth to
make another more sharper
then the fyrste. And euen as
the fall agayne into a disease,
before the fyrste be quite paste
and ouercome, bryngeth the
more daunger vnto the paciente:
euen so the relapse, and
fall agayne into the displeasure
and iudgemente of God,
not onlye doubleth the griefe
and payne of the punishment,
but also endaungereth the afflicted
person wyth the horror
and damnacion of hel fyre: for
euerye relapse agrauateth the
paine for sin. After this foloweth
the thyrde parte of Ionas
praier, in the which is cōteined
a cōmendaciō of gods mercy.
               
                  
But thou, O Lord my
God, hast brought my
lyfe agayne out or corrupcion.
when my soul
faynted wythin me, I
thought vpō the Lord
& mi praier came in vnto
the, euen into thy holye
temple.
               In these verses is declared
bothe the power of God, and
the truthe of God. Hys power
that saued hys lyfe, where was
no likelihode but of death, yea
death it self. For he it is alone
that bringeth to hell, & saueth
frō thēce. i. Sam. i. His trueth
is declared yt wher as he saith:
call vpon me in the dayes of
thy trouble, and I wyll heare
the. Psalme nienty and nyne.

here he performeth it in this afflycted
Ionas: of whome we
shoulde learne bothe to feare
hys threatnynge iustice, and to
truste vnto hys promysed mercye,
for he can do boothe. Punyshe
the euell that wyl not repente:
and saue the afflycted
that fleeth vnto hys mercye.
               They that hold of vain
vanities, wyll forsake
hys mercye.
               The people of God haue a
custome in theire prayers, as
they beholde the true and sauinge
healthe of the lyuynge
God, so of the contrarye parte
to consyder the false and deceit
full helpe of the false gods, as
Dauid dothe many times, and
here also our Ionas. So doe
the true Christiās at this day

in beholdynge the mercye of
God in Christ: thei behold and
wounder at the fond and false
hope, helpe, and truste that mē
put in vanitie, erroure, and for
bodden helpe of the Masse, water,
breade, salte, bowe, candell,
pardones and suche lyke. And
thys note chrystian Reader,
that the Prophete calleth false
and vayne relygyon, vanitie:
so iudge thou of euery relygyon
that is not conteyned within
the worde of God, to be nothynge
else then vanitie, from
whēce soeuer it cōmeth: though
the world wold bear the in hād
it were as true as the Gospell.
But aske y• true iudge ye word
of God, and it wyl shewethe it
is supersticion, beggerye, and
treacherie vnto the soule. And

those do lose y• beneuolēce and
mercye that God hath promised
in Chryste to as manye as
seke him in truthe, and in veritie.
Oute of thys text ye se the
doctrine of Chryste true, that
is written Mat. vi. no man cā
                  seru
                     •
                  
two masters, the true relygion
of God, & the supersticion
of mā. Nor he cā be saued
that trusteth in Chryste hanged
vpō the Crosse and Christ
offered in the Masse: for the
one is contrarye playne vnto
the other. Therfore Ionas confesseth
what he wyl do: folowe
the one & forsake the other, as
the text of hys oration sayeth.
But I wil do the sacrifice
with the voyce of
thankes geuing, & wyll

pai that I haue voued.
               Here Ionas ef
                     ••
                  ones telleth
what he wyl do beinge delyuered
frome hys trouble. He
wyl extolle, magnifie, and sette
forthe the goodnes of God.
               Then he wyll performe hys
vowe made, that is to saie: liue
obedyentlye vnto the commaū
                  dement
of god. The same must
we do, and not vse healthe and
quyetnes as an occasyon to
syn, libertie, & filthines of lyfe.
Ionas also amendeth the folish
opinion of the Iewes that
trusted to haue obtayned remissiō
of their sīnes by the offring
vp of the calues & other brute
beastes. But Ionas declareth
that ye Lord deliteth in no
sacrifice y• man cā do, fauinge
in ye sacrifice of thākesgeuing.

For onlye Chryste is the sacrifyce
propycyatorye, and he
that alone meriteth before god
the remission of synne. If then
in the tyme of the shadowe, Ionas
knewe the Lord to accept
the sacrifyce of the harte and
mouth, that was indewed with
faythe, aboue the sacryfyce of
the blouddy calues, how much
more nowe of vs wyll he doo
the same aboue the Idololatricall
sacrifice of the Masse? Ionas
well trustynge of goddes
mercye and promyses, sheweth
a reason wherefore he wyl laud
and prayse the Lorde when he
commeth oute of trouble: and
sayeth.
               For saluacyon commeth
of the Lord.
               As thoughe he hadde sayd:

man can geue health of bodye
or soule except God, as Dauid
sayth almost in euery Psalme,
& Esa. xliii.xliiii. If thys doctrine
wer wel prynted into our
heades, we woulde not god astraye
to euerye straunge God
and supersticion of man, as the
world doth nowe adayes more
like Heathens, then Christiās.
Farther, we woulde the better
sustayne and endure aduersitie
seynge it canne neyther gode
nor come, wythoute the prouision
of God. Gracious kynge
and my lordes of the councell,
remember this doctrine of Ionas,
and thē ye nede not to fear
to refourme thys Churche of
Englande vnto the primatiue
state, and apostolical doctrine.
Let the deuyl wyth al hys ministers

do what they wil: yf the
iudges remēbred this doctrin,
they would not feare to punish
euyl doers. If ye people knewe
thys doctryne, they would not
take Armoure and weapon agaynste
the Magistrates, but
seke helpe frō God. Before all
men, let the preacher comforte
himselfe with this word, for he
is in daunger of most displeasure,
if he preach not truly. Also
let ye persecutours of Gods
worde, take heede of this doctryne:
for in the Lorde shalbe
their health, let them persecute
what & how they wyl: thoughe
they burne, ye Lord wil quēch:
If they kil, the lord wyl make
aliue: if they curse, the Lorde
wil blesse: if they damne to hel,
the Lorde wyl saue in heauen.

Blessed is thē the man yt trusteth
in ye Lord. Now foloweth
the conclusyon of the chapter.
And ye lord spake vnto
the fish, & it cast out Ionas
againe vpō the dry
lande.
               Here ye may se the effect of
a godly & ernest prayer, that it
obtayneth deliueraunce from
the daunger.
               Of thys in the hole wee learne
that ther is none so great
daunger, but that we may escape,
if wt penytēce we returne
vnto the Lorde, and aske hym
mercy. As mani Ionasses therfore
as be in thys realme, that
hath, & doth, or falsli vse, or negligētly
contēne theyr vocaciō,
let thē acknowlege their offēce

and beg pardon, or els doutles
where penitēt Ionas was cast
a drye land, they shal remayne
for euer in the paines of hel, as
Saule doth. Let them se therfore
that be bishops and priestes,
in what daunger they be
that neglect or abuse their vocation:
if they amende, healthe
commeth, as vnto this miserable
and penitent man. This I
speake to the noble mē and to
the lawers, & also to the cōmen
people: I pray God al Ionasses
of this realme, thus repēt.
Incase al do not, yet yt some folow
thys godly man, that
they may be saued
as he is.
So be it.
            
         
         
            
            ¶The fifte Sermon
vpon Ionas, made by
Iohn Hoper.
            
               ¶The Preface.
               
                  THere is no man
that hath anye
respecte or care
at al of his heal
the, that would
not gladly hys faythe, knowledge,
and faults should be aproued
and wel taken of God.
For he knoweth all labours &
paines to be in vaine, and lost,
that are not cōmēded by hym.
Yet in thys behalf mē greuosly
offende and goo oute of the
way, when the thyng that god
most estemeth, is of our parts
most neglected, and the thyng

that god hateth and is displeased
wythal, we most diligently
do and exercise oure selues in.
Men be broughte to thys ignorauncie
and contēpt of god,
and hys word, that they iudge
euery thing done of a good in
tenciō, and wel meaning, shuld
please the Lord. From whence
spronge this infinite, daungerous,
and supersticious nombre
of sacrifices, and other seruings
of god. But what thing
after the tyght iudgemente of
the scripture chieflye pleaseth
God? Obediēce: that is to say,
when euerye man in hys state
& hys vocacion doth the thing
he is cōmaūded to do. As it is
writtē .i. Sa. xiii. I desire obediēce
& not sacrifice. Let nomā
therfore thynke he can do anye

thing acceptable vnto the lord
if he neglect the workes necessary
appoynted vnto hys vocacion.
Here may prynces take
hede they go not aboute wyth
liberalitie to make other men
good for them, learned for thē,
vertuous for thē, wyse for thē,
and they them selues neglecte
study, praier, paines, & labour,
but to know and do al things
thē selues that is requyred to
a princely office, by the expres
word of God. Study, wysedō,
knowledge, and exercise is requyred
in the prince hym selfe.
Let the bishoppes and prestes
beware they goo not about to
please God wyth Masse, Dirige,
Pardons, Rytes, and ceremonyes
inuented by men.

But let them do the workes of
their vocacion, grauely study,
dilygently and trulye preache
the worde of God, Christianely
minister the sacramentes, &
seuerely vse discipline and correccion
of indurate mens fautes.
So let the counceloure see
what equitie byndeth hym to
do, the honour of god, the obedyence
vnto hys prynce, and
the loue of hys country, and so
iudge and councel for the glorye
of God, and wealth of the
realme, and not for hys owne
affeccion or profit: and thynke
that the persō, byshop or priest
is able to sing or sai the remission
or pardon for the neglectyng
of his duety, but he must
do the works therof him selfe.
The common sorte of people,

let them learne to know and obey
both god and mā, and not
trust to the pardon and remission
of theyr ignorauncie and
disobedient treason and sedicion,
at the Persons or Uycars
hand, but thei must know and
feare both God and gods magistrat
them selues.
               How feyre and relygyous,
good, and Godlye, so euer the
good intencion of mā appeare
and shewe it selfe to men, it is
playne iniquitie before God,
as ye maye see by Saule: that
though God would be pleased
wyth the wel ment fat sacrifice
of kynge Agag. i. Samu. xiii.
And also that he fought wyth
the heathen before Samuels
commyng .i. Sam. xv. he was
not onely rebuked greuouslye

for his fault, but disherited also
of hys kyngdom for euer. I
dare pronounce yt al these mischeues
& troubles that happē
in thys shyp & cōmon wealthe
of Englande, sprynge oute of
thys fountayne.
               No man laboureth to do
the workes that God hathe
apointed to his vocaciō. And
an exāple hereof we haue sene
in Ionas, whose disobedience
and want of doyng hys vocacion,
moued the wyndes in the
ayre, the waters of the sea, so
that it had lyke to haue drowned
hym selfe, the shyppe, and
as many as were within bord.
And seynge there is none of
vs but is culpable from the
hyghest to the lowest in neglecting
the workes of out vocacion,

and therby inobedyent
to the good wyl and commaū
                  dement
of God, let vs repent,
and returne to a better mynde.
He that erreth shal not perish,
if being admonished he return
home agayn. Eze. xviii. Mat.
xi. Io. x. Let thys glas & myrroure
of Ionas suffyce vs to
behold an other mans yuel in,
before we fele the lyke our selues:
we haue sene the disobedience
of Ionas, and the payne
therof, we haue sene his amendement
and pensyuenes, & the
frute therof, hys delyueraunce
and saluacion.
               Let vs also nowe see howe
much he hath profited, & learned
in Gods schole vnder the
rodde of aduersitye, and lette
vs learne to dooe the same.

But before we come to the obedyence
that thys man learned
in aduersytie, we wyl pray vnto
God.
               
                  WE be come so far, as ye
text hath made menciō
of ye restitucion of Ionas
in lyfe vpō the dry groūd.
And now foloweth his second
legacion & embassage to Niniue.
But for the better vnderstandyng
of al things that folow,
I wil deuyde the chapter
into hys partes, which ar. iiii.
               The firste conteyneth the
cōmaundement of god to Ionas.
The second, Ionas obedience.
The third, the repentaūce
of the Niniuites. The fourth,
the mercye and compassyon of
God towardes the penitent &
sorowfull Niniuites.
            
            
               
               The fyrst parte.
               The worde of God
came the seconde tyme
to Ionas after thys
sorte: Ryse, go to Niniue
that great citye and
preache in it the preaching
that I haue spoken
vnto the of.
               That Ionas goeth not to
the citie to preache of his own
heade, but tarieth to be called
vnto it by God, we learne no
man shuld wysh, or desyre for
any office or vocacion to a priuate
commoditie, and his own
lucre, but to tarye tyl God cal
hym to it, chiefely the offyce of
a byshop or preacher.
               For that office hath so many

difficulties, labours, & daū
                  gers,
that incase the man that
is in it, be not wel perswaded ye
he cam to it by ye calling of god,
he shal neuer be able to endure
the troubles anexed to the vocaciō:
as the perfit mans tidyousnes
and werines therin declareth.
Iere. xx. who decreed
 wt hym selfe to haue preached
no more, because of the malice
of the people, and for the contempt
that folowed him in doyng
of hys vocacion. Euen so
is the office of a good counceler
& good magistrate that incase
he loke not to come to hys
dignitie and honour for ambicion,
pride, and priuate lucre,
but commeth whē he is called
of God, he shal fynd so manye
labours & vnquietnes in hys
vocacion, that doubtles wer it

not for God, he could be glad
to leaue it to an other mā. For
incase the magistrate doo any
thyng cōtrary vnto God, doutles
he shal fal into two yuels,
fyrst into Gods displeasure, &
then the thing he doth shal neuer
prosper, as it is to be scene
by the Israelites that warred
before they were commaūded
by God. Num. xiiii. Let nomā
therfore run into an offyce before
the tyme god cal him, neither
bye hym selfe into y• office
as is now adaies cōmonly vsed:
for I know surelye he that
byeth wil sel, & neuer do God,
the king, neither the subiectes
good seruice, but dyshonoure
the first, and rob the other.
               That Ionas is byd to rise
and go to Niniue, in that is declared,

that of al thinges in euery
vocacion, idlenes & sloth
must be chieflye auoyded, and
labours exercysed: the whyche
if we leaue vndone (being workes
annexed wyth our vocacion)
we declare oure selues vnmete
for the roume and vocaciō
we be appointed vnto. Incase
any man had a seruaunte
apoynted to dreasse his meate
in the kytchen, or to kepe hys
horse in the stable, & yet wold
neglect the labours & paynes
that the offices ordinarily and
of deuty requyred, who gladly
would be contented wyth such
a seruaunt, or desyre he shulde
be preferred to anye offyce in
his house? Therfore commaū
                  deth
S. Paul yt he yt wyl not
labour, shuld not eat. i. tes. iiii.
               
                  
The thyrd doctryne of this
fyrst part declared for asmuche
as it behoueth euery man, to auoyde
idlenes in his vocation,
It myght be demaunded what
shuld a man do to satysfye hys
vocation. It is tolde Ionas
in thys place. Preache sayeth
the text. He saieth not: take ye regimente
and gouernaunce of
the cōmune wealth, but preach.
Of these wordes we learn that
euerye man is bounde to do the
workes of the vocation he beareth
the name of: and not to medle
with other mens laboures.
It is not the offyce of the Byshoppe
to playe the kinge and
Lorde, nor the kinges parte to
playe the Byshoppe. For the
kynges offyce is inoughe for a
kynge, and the Bishoppes office

inoughe for a Byshop, let
them do the best they can, and
studye eche of them in their office.
But let the kynge take
hede he be able to iudge whether
the Byshop do true seruice
to God in his vocacion bi
the worde of God, and let the
Byshop do the same, take hede
whether the kynge or councell
wolde commaunde hym to do
anye thynge contrarye to the
workes of his vocacion, which
is to preache gods worde: incase
he do, wyth knowledge
and sobernes to admonyshe
hym, and to brynge hym to a
better mynde. If yu be a iudge,
remember thi name, and do the
workes of ryght iudgemente.
If a iustice, do accordinge to
thy name: if a marchaunt, bye

and sell truelye: if anye other
subiecte, doo accordinge to
the name thou bearest, as oure
subiectes of Englande of late
dyd neuer awhyt. For master
person, & an olde wyfe taughte
them to forget the dueties of
true and godly subiectes, and
wolde haue made them all kinges,
but the Lorde cast them in
to the sea. Thys duety of eche
man is handsomly set forth by
terteyne pictures in the towne
house at Basyll in thys verse.
In supplex ora, tu regna, tuque labora
There be thre images, the one
of the Pope, the other of the
Emperoure, the thyrde of a
plough manne, and the verse
teacheth all thre their dueties.

He biddeth the Pope pray, the
Emperoure to raygne, and the
plougheman to laboure. Let
therfore al Byshops & priestes
knowe their office is to preach
& pray. This I saye, God to recorde,
of no hatred but of loue,
for I am afraied of gods threteninges
& vēgeaunce toward
them, if they amende not. For
God sayeth he wyl requyre the
bloude of the people at the Byshoppes
hande. Eze. iii.xxxiii.
And Paule sayeth: wo be vnto
me if I preach not .i. Cor. ix.
               Here myghte the Bishoppe
or the person paraduenture
partlye excuse them selfes and
saye: I knowe my faulte, and
wolde gladlye amende it if I
coulde, but I am so olde I can
not preache, nor neuer vsed miselfe

there vnto. I wold aduise
hym then to folow the doinges
of Ualerius the Byshoppe of
Hipponensis, that in hys olde
and latter dayes perceiuinge
hys age coulde not satysfye
the laboures dewe vnto hys
vocation, associated to hymself
a coumpanion and coadiutor
Saint Augustine, as he testifieth
Epist. cxlviii. In the begynninge
of that Epistle thus
he wryteth. Before al thynges
I wold your godlye prudence
shulde thinke in this our tyme
nothing to be more acceptable,
facile, or more desired of mē thē
the office of a Bishop, priest, or
decō, if their office be slightly &
slēderly vsed, but with God no
thynge is more dampnable, miserable,
or sorowful. The same

knewe Samuel: for in his age
he instituted his sōnes to help
and ease the intollerancye and
importaunce of hys offyce
                     •
                   so
I woulde euerye Byshop and
personne that for age or lacke
of learnyng cannot do hys offyce,
should institute and take
vnto hym some wyse and learned
preacher to helpe him, and
not a synger as nowe is vsed.
If this counsel and doinges
of the godlye men rehersed before
lyke thē not, let thē deuise
some other lyke, and all is one
to me, so they exchue the Ire
of God. For doutles it is horrible
to fall in this parte, into
the handes of God. For what
shal it auayle them to wynne
al the world, and lose their own
soules? I wold lykewyse praye

& admonysh the Magistrates
to se the scholes better maintayned:
for the lacke of them shall
bring blindnes into this church
of Englande againe. And such
as be the patrōes and geuers
of benefyces, lette them take
hede they gyue and bestowe
them vpon worthie menne, and
sel them not to Asses and blind
blocke headed felowes: For if
they bestowe theire benefices
for lucre or affeccyon, to suche
as can not or wil not fede with
the worde of God, the people
of hys cure, the patrone shall
dye eternallye for it as well
as hys blynde and naughtye
curate, person, or vicar. The
forth doctrine of this first part
is very necessary: for when the

Bishoppes and priestes heare
theyr offyce is to preache, then
thinke thei: but what we prech
it is no matter: it lyeth in oure
arbitrement & pleasure. Naye
sayeth the texte. Preache that
I byd the: and so sayth Saint
Peter .i Pet. iiii. Math. xxviii.
               In thys vocation of preachynge,
the preacher should so
vse hym selfe as he myght saye
all wayes: my doctrine is not
my doctryne, but hys that
hathe sende me. For it is
goddes woorde and his lawe
that turneth the hartes of people
to repentaunce. Psal. xix.
cxix. For the word of God written
is as perfect as God hym
selfe: and is in deade hable to
make a man perfecte in al thinges
.ii. Timo. iii. Wherefore it

needeth not that blasphemous
and stinkinge helpe of the Bishoppe
of Rome, that durst say
the law of God is not of it self,
but by his interpretacion, holsome
and sufficiēt. But by this
meanes he gote authoritie ouer
the scripture to bury it, and
to stablyshe what he woulde
were it neuer so deuilishe, and
heretical. Therfore let suche
as be of God do as they haue
in commission from hym, and
not as they please them selfes:
for if they do, they be of the deuell
and not of Chryste.
            
            
               The obedience of Ionas.
               Then Ionas arose
and wente to Niniue
at the commaundemēt
of the Lorde.
               
                  
Ionas now being an obediente
seruaunt, loketh no more
for a shyppe to flie, but goeth
the nexte waye whether he is
commaunded, though the iournye
was paynefull and daungerous
to the fleshe. But the
Crosse of trouble is not vnprofitable
to the Chrystyans, it
mortyfyeth the fleshe, so that in
the afflicted dwelleth the spirit
of God, it excersiseth the faythe
and proueth obedience. As Dauid
saith: wel it is with me that
thou haste chastened me Lord,
that I maye learne thy commaūdemēts.
Both good & bad
are afflicted in this world: but
y• good therby is amended, and
the euel is appeyred, & so they
peryshe in theire trouble. Dauid
was amended herewith.

ii. Regum. xii. xxiiii. So was
Ezechias, esa. xxxviii. So was
Daniel. Dani. ix. These & like
vnto them be chastened in the
world, because they shulde not
be dampned wyth the worlde.
The euyll wyth affliction be
not amended, but indurated &
hardened throughe their owne
malyce & obstynacie as Saul.
and Pharao. And the paines &
tormēts here, be the beginning
of the paines eternal. This diuersitie
and contrarye effect of
persecution godly, setteth forth
the holy prophet Dauid, Psa.
lxxv. wonderful godlye. The
whiche Psalme I woulde all
Byshopppes shuld reade, that
knoweth the truthe, & yet wyl
take no paynes to set it forthe,
but liue idle: & such as haue no

liuyng to set it forth, or of malice
whister, and secretlye hyndreth
the settynge forthe of it,
for doutles at length, they shal
not only drinke of the wyne of
aduersitie, but be compelled to
drinke dragges and all. So
shal al these rauenyng, and couetouse
noble men that wyth
iniuries and wronges now afflicte
the poore, at length they
shalbe most afflicted them selues:
so shall the auaricyous
iudge, the Couetous marchāt,
and the traiterous and sedicious
subiect. But I red you be
wyse in time, and as ye haue folowed
this rebell Ionas in euyll,
so folow hym in the good
and amende: if not, the kinges
maiestie muste caste you in to
the sea.
               
                  
The obedience of Ionas
is set forth and cōmended with
manye circumstaunces, and
shulde therefore the better be
noted. Fyrste, because he went
the next waye to Niniue, and
hyred none other, nor substituted
hys suffragane, nor wente
not into Samaria to aske coū
                  cell
at hys fryndes what was
beste to do, but went streighte
way hym selfe. The second circūstance
is worthy annotaciō,
that he dyd all thynges as the
Lorde bad hym. Wherein we
are taughte to be diligente, we
see all our doinges, actes, and
obedience to be according, and
as the worde of God biddeth.
There is putte in, as thoughe
it were by a parentesis, the descripcion
of Niniue.
               
                  
And Niniue was a
great citie to the Lord
of three dayes iourney.
               Thys dyscryption settethe
forth the obedyence of Ionas,
that diligentelye preached the
roughe the hole cytye the pleasure
of God, that it shoulde be
destroyed wythin .xl. dayes.
               The cytye is called greate vnto
God, that is to saye euerye
greate cytye, as the Cedre of
God, the mounte of God. &c.
Or else it is called the cytye of
God, for the wonderfull respecte
and pitye that the Lorde
had in the sauinge of it. Whether
the cytye were thre dayes
Iournye aboute, or else thre
dayes space to vysytte all the

streates thereof, it is not agreed
yet vpon amōg al wryters:
but this we knowe it was a notable
cytye, and amonge al cytyes
in the Easte of mooste famous
reporte.
               Nowe it foloweth what Ionas
dyd after he entrede into
the cytie.
               When Ionas hadde
entred the cytye one
dayes iournye, he cried
and saued: within this
xl. dayes Niniue shall
be destroyed.
               Of this text we learne that
Ionas lyued not idle after he
came to the place whether he
was sente by God, but that he
walked abrode and cryed.
               
                  
So shulde euerye man that is
called to the office of a Bishop
or pastor: it is not inoughe he
go to his dioces or personage,
but that he must walke abrode
there and crye oute the comaū
                  demente
of the Lorde. Or else
they be wyth al theire titel, glorye,
pompe and name, dome
dogges, subiect vnto the vengeaūce
and plage of God. And
this is the marke thoushuldest
knowe a Byshoppe, and priest
by: by hys tounge that soundeth
the worde of the Lorde,
and not by hys cap or vtward
vesture. So shulde the iudge
go abrode in his countrey, and
speake and declare euery wher
iustice. So shuld the prouost,
heades of Colledges, masters
of scholes, go and teache the

thynge apertayneth to theyr
place and vocacion.
               The texte maketh mencion
of the summe and pryncypall
state of hys sermō, that is, that
the citie shuld be destroied wt
                  in
.xl. daies, and yt spake he simple
and playnely wythout cō
                  dicion
or glose. Yet maye wee
easily gather of y• long time of
x
                     •
                  . dayes, that was geuen vnto
it, that it was reuersed vnto
penance and amendemente of
lyfe. And god would rather at
thys tyme fraye them to make
them amende, then to punyshe
them, and lose thē for euer: and
wold perce thus theyr mindes
and brynge them to a knowledge
of theyr synnes. And as
subuercion & destruccion was
threatned vnto thys Niniue,

so is it to thys hole realme: for
ther is among vs as greate,
and as manye syns (God geue
grace there be no greater, nor
nomore) as wer among them.
We muste then amende or els
we shall peryshe euerychone.
Luke .xiii. but what tyme the
Lord knoweth, & not I. Now
it foloweth how the preaching
of Ionas was accepted.
               And the people of
Niniue beleued God, &
preclaymed fastynge,
and arayed them selues
in sacke clothe, as
well the greate as the
small of them.
               Out of this text is fyrst to
be noted how that ye Niniuits

resisted not the preachynge of
Ionas, when they had yet yf
they would haue excused their
euil, mani refuges & pretexts.
Ther obedience to the word of
god cōdēneth both the Iewes
& vs of obstynacie, & malyce.
i. They might haue pretended
thys Ionas is but one man,
therfore not to be credited.
ii. He is a stranger & speketh it
of hatred vnto vs, & of affecciō
towardes hys owne countrye
.iii. He is of a cōtrary relygion
to ours, & wuld deceaue as frō
our fathers faith. iiii. He is no
king but a man that semeth to
haue lytle wir and lesse experience.
v. He is one cōtemned of
hys owne countrye men and
can not be hearde of them, and
shuld we credit hys woordes?

vi. He is a noughty lyuer an
                     •
                  
one that God hateth and hath
punyshed, and shuld we passe
of hys sayinges? But they remembred
theyr own faults, at
the preachyng of one day they
amended, they neuer loked for
myracle: They pretended not
the antiquitie and aunciētnes
of theyr citie, that had stode almost
from the tyme of the flud
Gen. x. They that heard hym,
neuer desyred theyr amendement,
vntyl suche tyme as the
kyng, the preists and the other
elders of the Citie, had agreed
whether Ionas doctrine were
true or not. Of thys facilitie &
quycknes of belyfe in the Niniuites,
we maye se yt soner beleueth
the verye infydels the
word of god, then such as beareth

the name of God, and be
broughte vp in supersticion.
And that I thynke were easye
to be sene, yf experiēce shuld be
taken to preach at Babilon or
Constantinople, he should rather
conuert those cities, then
Rome. Farther theyr promptnes
cōdemneth our obstinacie
and hardnes of harte, that daily
heare the word of god preached,
and yet nothyng the better,
nor nerer to saluacion. It
foloweth what the Niniuites
do when they be conuerted.
               Fyrst they beleue in the Lord,
second they fast. A man ignoraunt
of God, offendeth twoo
maner of waies, in bodi and in
soule, and both these offences
must be amended, if we wyl be
reconciled vnto god. By fayth

the mynde is reconcyled vnto
god, and by abstinēce the body
is kepte in subieccion, and the
wantones of cōcupiscence kept
in obedience. But in thys our
myserable and cursed tyme of
God (for synne) is great question,
and controuersy moued,
not onely cōcerning fayth, but
also fasting: of which two thinges
I iudge it mete somwhat
to be spoken of. As touchynge
fayth it is not an opinion and
knowledge onlye, but a vehement,
ernest, and certayne persuasion
of Gods promises in
Christ: and out of thys faythe
spryngeth all Godlynes and
vertuous woorkes: and what
soeuer spryngeth not hereof,
is synne.
               And thys faythe the almighty

god confirmeth in his
true and vertuous people two
maner of wayes: Inwardly &
outwardly. Inwardlye by the
holy gost, who testifieth by his
spirite with our spirit, that we
be the chyldren of God. Outwardly
by preaching of gods
word, and ministracion of the
sacramentes. The preachynge
conteyne the innumerable benefites
and promyses of God
made in the new testamēt and
ye old, vnto vs in Christe, who
is ye seede that shuld and doth
treade and breake the heade of
the serpent. Gene. iii. Io. iii.
               The Sacramentes be as
visyble woordes, offered vnto
the Eyes and other Senses,
as the sweete sounde of the

word to the eare, and the holye
gost to the hart. The numbre
of these sacramentes in y• publycke
ministerie of the church,
be twoo. One of baptisme and
the other of the lords supper,
and both these teach and confyrme
none other thynge then
that the mercye of God saueth
the faithfull and beleuers.
               Therfore is the bread in ye holy
supper called the bodye of
Christ, and the wyne the blud
of Christ, because thei be sacraments
and seales of gods promises
in Christ. This plaine &
symple doctryne of the sacramentes
were sufficiēt, if fraud,
gile, treason, heresie, supersticion,
papistrie, ignorancie, arrogancie,
miserie, and the malyce
of men woulde suffer it. But

these iuels afore rehersed, haue
called into question and controuersie,
whether carnally, corporally,
and reallye, the precious
body of Christ be present,
and how the communion and
sacrament of hys body shulde
be ministred and vsed. For the
resolucion, & answerynge vnto
the whyche questions, I wyll
sincerlye and playnelye shewe
my mynde, accordynge to the
worde of God.
            
            
               ¶Of the presence of Christes body
in the sacrament.
               
                  I Wyl not in this question
saye asmuche as
I would or could, because
of late dayes in thys
place it was godlye and learnedly
touched. But yet somewhat

                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
muste I saye because the
ignoraunce of it, bringeth idololatrye:
Idololatry bryngeth
eternal damnaciō, eternall dā
                  nacion
commeth not onlye to
the ygnoraunte, but also vnto
hym that shuld in hys vocacion,
remoue (or do his good wil
to remoue) the ygnorauncie. I
am appoynted to remoue ygnorauncye:
thus therefore I
pray you hear how ye may remoue
it. I wil kepe this order.
Fyrst I wil shew by many argumēts
that ther is no corporal
presēce of Christs body in
the sacramēt. Thē wyll I answer
to the argumēts of y• aduersaryes
yt wold haue it here.
               
                  
                     The fyrst argument.
                     
                        THis I take of ye name
of christs body, which
is lyke vnto ours in

al thynges except syn. Heb. ii.
Esa. liii. And incase it wer not
in al thynges like vnto oures
(excepte synne, and immortalitie)
Sayncte Paules Argument
would proue nothynge.
i. Cor. xv. But our bodyes be
one to each one, measured certaynelye
wyth quantitie and
qualitie, and occupye at one
tyme, one place: therfore so doeth,
and euer hath done Christes
bodye. And thus woulde
Paule proue our resurreccion
because our bodies be as Christes
is yt is rysen, excepte synne
and immortalitie. After that
thei sat Christ hath now a glorified
body, & so we haue not, it
maketh nothing for their purpose:
for whē Christ made hys
supper, & instituted ye sacramēt

of hys death, he was a mortal
and passible man, subiect vnto
the tyrany and violence of his
aduersaries. Yea after his immortalitie,
he shewed manifest
tokens and arguments of his
pure, true and sensible humanitie.
Io. xxi. i. Io. i. For y• apostles
fyngers touched hym.
Farther saynt Paule sayth, he
shal. Phil. iii. that Christ shall
make oure bodyes lyke vnto
hys glorious body. Therfore
they do destroy ye true and very
humanitie of Christs body,
that say hys body is in manye
places at one time, which robbeth
hys body of al the qualyties,
quātities, and properties
of a true body. For y• scripture
of god confesseth that Christs
body is but in one place. And

many of the Popes Canones
confyrme the same. Thus it is
written.
                     De cōsecrat. Distinct .ij. prima quidem.
Donec seculum finiatur, sursum
dominus est: Sed tame hic nobiscum
est viritas domini. Corpus enim in
quo resurrexit in vno loco esse oportet,
veritas autē eius vbique diffusa est.
                     That is to say: Tyl y• world
be ended, the lord is aboue: but
notwythstandynge hys truth
is here wyth vs. The body, in
whych he rysse, muste be in one
place, & hys veritie is dyspersed
euery where.
                  
                  
                     The second reason.
                     
                        THis is taken out of ye
nature & condicion of
a sacrament, whyche
is thys, that the thyng that is
remembred by the sacramente
be it selfe absent, and yet the

signes or sacramētes take the
name & nominacion of y• thing
represented & signifyed by the
sygnes, for a declaraciō of the
thynge that is done wyth the
sygnes.
                     So is it in al the sacraments
of the old testament & the new:
therfore also in this sacramēt.
The thyng it selfe in thys sacramēt,
y• is to wyt, ye precious
body of Christe broken, & hys
innocent bloud shedde, be absēt:
yet be the bread & the wine
called the body brokē, and the
blud shedding, according to y•
nature of a sacramente, to setforth
the better the thing done
and signified by the sacramēt.
Ther is done in the sacrament
the memorie and remēbraunce
of Christes death, whych was

done on the Crosse, when hys
precious body and bloud was
rēt and torne, shed and poured
out for our synnes.
                     Wyth this agreeth y• minde
of S. Augustine. Ad Bonifacium.
Epist. xxiii. Sienum sacramenta
quandam similitudinem earum
rerum quarum sacramenta sunt, non
haberent, ommno sacramenta nō essēt▪
That is to say: if Sacramentes
had not some proporcion
and lykenes of the thynges
whereof they be sacramentes,
they were no sacramentes at
al. And thus rather of the symilitude
and sygnification of
the thyng they represent & signifye,
they take the name, and
not that in deede they be as
they be named.
                     So after thys maner is the sacrament
of Christes body called

Christes bodye: and the sacramentes
of Christes bloud,
called Christes bloud: and the
sacramente of fayeth is called
fayeth. As Saynt Augustine
learnedly, and godly sayeth in
the same argumente. Accedat verbum
ad elementum, vt fit sacramentū,
non ait tollat elementum, vt fit sacramentum.
That is to saye: let the
worde come vnto the Element
and then is made the Sacramente.
He sayeth not lette the
word channge, or transubstanciate
the Elemente (that is
to say the substaunce and matter
of the sacramente) and then
is made the sacrament.
                  
                  
                     The thyrde reason.
                     
                        IF he were here in ye sacramente
bodelye, and
corporally he shoulde

euery day suffer and shed hys
precious bloud. For the scripture
sayth: thys is my bodye y•
is brokē for you, and my blud
that is shedde for you. Luke.
xxii. i. Cor. xi. but thys is not
true, that he daylye suffreth
payne and passiō. Rom. vi. no
more is it true that he is in the
sacrament bodelye: for heauen
kepeth hym tyll the laste daye.
Act. iii. Neither yet is ye bread
after consecration hys verye
bodye, i. Cor. xi. nor the wyne
his blud. Math. xxvi. But the
bread remayneth styl breade, &
the wyne styll wyne after the
word spoken, as they were before
cōcerning their substaūce,
but the vse of thē be chaūged.
                  
                  
                     The fourth reason.
                     
                        
                        THe scripture maketh
no mēcion but of one
ascension, and of two
commynges, one paste, and
the other we looke for in the
ende of the world at the latter
iudgemente.
                     Yf theyr doctrine were true,
ther shuld be infinite ascēsiōs
and infinite descencions. Farther
they cannot tel thē selues
what is become of the bodye
thei faine to haue in the sacrament,
when the accidentes and
qualities corrupt and be consumed.
                     Theyr glose vpon the Canone.
Tribus gradibus, ait auolare
in Celum. that is to say: it flyeth
into heauen, but we saye he
was there before. They darre

not say it corrupteth, nor yt it is
turned into the substaunce of
our bodyes and sowles: what
is there then become of thys
bodie?
                  
                  
                     The fyfth reason.
                     
                        GOd hadde made by
this mean his churche
in daunger and
subiecte vnto Idololatrie.
For there be manye
chaunces and cases happen
that maye let the Prieste to
consecrate, and then shoulde
the people worshyppe an Idole
for lacke of the presence
of Christes bodye.
                     These daungers maye
chaunce three maner of waies:
in the prieste, in the woordes,
and in the matter.
                     
                        
The priest if he be not lawfully
consecrated, if he be an herityke,
one excommunicated, or
a simoniache, he consecrateth
not. Magister sententiarum.
Lib. iiii. dist. xiii. Se the glose
De consecra. dist. ii. cap. Quid
sit sanguis. In the woordes of
consecracion, there is no lesse
daunger and dout. Fyrst many
of theyr writers be ignoraunte
wyth what wordes Christ cō
                        secrated.

the Master of the sentence

would God send an angell frō

But how so euer they agre

How shoulde thys be knowen

Wel, graunt they would

                     THus they saye now: yf
this opiniō be neither
of the Apostles, neyther
frō the aunciēt doctours,
how chaunceth it to be so vniuersally
takē, and for so infallyble
and indoubted truth, yea
such a truth as incase men forsake
al truth, and yet not contrary
thys truth, is accompted
a man moste christiane & true?
               
               
                  Answer.
                  
                     NOthing is more expedient
to answer directlye
vnto the question,
then to cōsyder the time of our
fathers. They thought it best
to name the sacramentes by y•
name of the thyng was represented
by the sacramentes. Yet
in manye places of theyr wryryngs,
they so interpretate thē
                     
selues, that no man excepte he
wyl be wylfully blynd, can say
but they vnderstode the sacrament
to sygnifie, and not to be
the thing signified: to cōfirme,
& not to exhibit grace, to helpe,
and not to giue faythe: to seale,
and not to wynne the promyse
of God. Ro. iiii: to shewe what
we be before the vse of thē, and
not to make vs the thynge we
declare to be after thē: to shew
we are Christes, to shew we be
in grace, and not by thē to be
receaued into grace: to shewe
we be saued, and not yet to be
saued by them: to shewe we be
regenerated, and not to be regenerated
by them, thus the
old doctours ment.
                  But when all good learninge,
and the lesson of the holye

scripture were drowned by
the Gotthes, and Uandales,
in Europe, Asia, and Affrica,
and yet somewhat rescued and
caughte agayne by Charles
the greate. Anno. viii C. men
not acquaynted wyth the frases
and veine of the scripture,
accustomed them selues to the
readyng of doctours, and leaft
the woord of God.
                  Wherof folowed amonge
other euyls, that in Fraunce
by certayne Italiōs this question
to be very much and manye
tymes reasoned vpon, as
touchyng the corporal presēce
of Christes body in the sacrament.
Agaynst the whyche ertour
one Ihon Scot and one
Bertram wrote a boke of the
sam mater to Charles y• great

But the monkes and the priestes
declyned most vnto ye opinion
of the carnall & corporall
presence: wher vpon in y• tyme
of Leo the nynth, a byshoppe
of Rome. Anno. M.L. beynge
a monke, called a councell named
Uercellence: y• whych tuled
as chiefe president & great
master, one Lācfranck a monk
& afterwarde bishop of Cant.
He damned Berengarius: but
after that the same Berengatius
had recāted, one Nicolaus
Pope, assembled a councell
of the monkes of Italie, and
priestes, and so compelled Berengarius
to a recantacion,
whych ye may reade. De consecrat.
dist. ii. Ego Berengarius.
                  But here we wyll pause and
deliberat a while vpon this recātacion,

and scanne it a lytle.
In this recātacion (marke it)
is no mencion made of trāsubstanciacion,
but the bread and
the wyne are called the bodye
and blud of Christe, and that
the same are touched wyth the
handes of the prieste, broken, &
torne with ye teth of ye faithful.
This sentence is not admitted
now a dayes among our scholastical
diuines. Yea the glose
vpon the same Canone, sayth:
(read the place) Ther is more
daūger of heresy in Berengatius
words, thē was in Berengarius
hym selfe.
                  That recantacion of Berengarius
sent the Pope into all
the cities of Italy, Germanie,
& Fraunce. But thys relygyon
could not be wel accepted,

nor iudged to be good of al m

though Hildebrand the mōke

Anno. m.lxxix. Wherfore they
excogitated, & dremed out trāssubstāciaciō,
the which opiniō
holpe forth the monks of Benedictes
order, in theyr Sermons.
And because thys newe
and wycked doctryne of transubstanciaciō
could not be receaued
and admitted of al mē,
After two hundred yeares almost,
Innocentius the thyrde
confyrmed it in the councell of

Parise. And that thys wycked
doctryne myght take the soner

Immediately afterwarde
began the beggyng friers the

and mete pe
                        •
                     sonnes to setforth
such abhominacion. At the begynnynge
of these monsters,
Honorius .iii. bishop of Rome,
commaunded thys newe bready
god to be honoured. Anno.
M.CC.xxvi. libr. ii. Decretal.
Tit. de celebra. Missarū. And
then beganne the pyndfooles
and cloisters to be made in the
churches to reserue their newe
god in. And when the monkes
had farther entred into the cō
                     sciences
of the people, and whē
thei had more inculcated & betē
to mens heads more this new
article of fayth, for transubstanciacion,
then all the other
of oure belyfe in Christe,
                  
                     
The Pope began to excogitate
more yet for the honour of
thys new god. For when they
had brought Christ from heauen
to earth agayne, & so concluded
he shuld be honored in
the sacramente, he thoughte it
iniurie to let hym be wythout
some solemne fest & dai, wherin
people myght honour hym according
to their decrees: whervpon
Urbanus the .iiii. instituted
the feaste that is called
Corpus Christi. M.CC.lxii.
Then increased the rable and
Idololatrical nombre of pryuate
Masses: and ye honoryng
of thys bread then was defended
wyth swerd and fyre.
                  In the meane tyme manye
godly men were sore afflycted
in theyr conscience, yet durste

not declare their griefe, partly
for feare, partli because that
sophistrie had blynded part of
theyr iudgementes. At length

that resisted thys new heretical
doctryne. M.CCC.lx.viii.
And now ye Lord be praised,
chyldren know the vngodlynes
therof, & may se it plainly
to be naught, if they wil not
be wylfully blynde. How childyshly
they bragge of the doctours,
now ye may see. And euen
the same do they wyth the

absence of christes

Thys is my bodye. Unto the
whyche we aunswere briefely.
The wordes should be vnderstanded
accordyng to the matter
& purpose they be spoken
for: But euery man knoweth, ye
matter and purpose yt Christ
entreateth of, is to make, and
institute a sacrament: therfore
ought euery word to be taken
sacramentallye: which is to attribute
vnto the sacramente, ye
name of ye thing signified & represented

by the sacramente.
            Therfore thei should not force
nor cōstraine y• soūd of the wordes
vsed in the sacramente to
make of y• sacrament on ydole
by false interpretaciō, wher as
the true sēce of ye word maketh
but a necessary ceremonie, and
helpe to our infirme faith. In
the Canon lawe, Decretalib

amittitur, yt is to saie: when
the nature of y• word is forced,
the meanīg of ye veritie is lost.
Farther what shuld moue thē
to deny vs one trope in these

wordes, when they them selues
vse a greate many of tropes &
fygures: where as we vse but
one, and the same one to be in
the open word of God: and all
theyrs to be without, and contrary
to y• word of God. Note
the wordes of Christ, Hoc est corpus
meum. That is to say: This

in the sacramēt. If a man
shuld thē aske: what fayth and

opiniō shuld y• christiane haue
cōcernyng ye presence or abs
                  •
               ce
of Christs bodi in y• sacramēt
                  •
               
            
            
               Answer.
               The body of Christ shulde
be cōsidred .ii. maner of waies,
fyrst as it was borne of yt blessed
virgin, beyng in dede oure
very natural brother: Th
                     •
                   as
it was offered vpon the crosse
for the redēpcion of the world.
And thus offered & put to hys
passiō vpō y• crosse, we cōsyder
hym in the sacrament: for the
bread there vsed is called the
body of Christ brokē: & y• wine
the bloud sheding. But the presence
of christes natural body,
or y• opiniō of his presēce, they
so litle profit, yt in very dede it
doeth rather hurt, and harme,
as Christ sayed.
               
                  
The flesh profiteth nothynge.
Io. vi. and agayne: it is expediēt
that I go awai. We must
therfore lyfte vp oure myndes
into heauen when we fele oure
selues oppressed with the burden
of sinne, and ther by fayth
apprehend and receaue the bodye
of Christe slayne and kylled,
& hys precious blud shed
for our offēces: and so by faith
apply the vertue, efficacie, and
strēgth of ye merites of Christ
to our soules, and by that meanes
quit oure selues from the
daunger, damnaciō, and curse
of God. And thus to be partaker
of the worthynes and deseruyngs
of Christes passion,
is to eate the body & to drynke
ye blud. Therfore doth Christ
in the .v. of Iohn, take eat, for

beleue, & beleue for eate, so many
tymes. And S. Augustine
sayth, vt quid paras dētem et ventrē,
crede et manducasti, why preparest
thou the teeth and bely, beleue
and thou hast eatē. And whoso
euer eateth after thys sorte
the body of Christ, and drynke
his blud, hath euerlasting life.
Then obiecte they: if we maye
thus eat the body and blud of
Christ without the sacramēt,
what auayleth it to haue anye
Sacrament?
            
            
               Answer.
               
                  AGaynst these temptacions
of the deuil
the vse of the sacramentes
were instituted
in the churche.
               The fyrst temptacion of
the deuil is, he would bear the

Christian in hand the promises
of Gods mercy to be false:
Therfore doth God confyrme
thē vnto vs by his sacramēts.
               The second tēptacion when
ye deuil perceaueth we belyue
the promises 
                     •
                  f god to be true
vniuersally, yet wold he make
vs doubt of them perticularli,
as thoughe they appertayned
not vnto the priuate or singuler
conscience afflycted. That
dout wold God remoue in vs
by hys sacramentes, and saith,
they appertaine to the priuate
and perticuler conscience afflycted,
euen as euerye priuate
man receaueth the sacraments
of the promyses.
               The thyrde temptacion.
The deuyl laboureth to take
from vs the knowledge of the

meanes of oure saluacion, and
howe the promyses of God be
made oures, by ye free grace of
God or by our merytes.
               The Sacramentes therfore
whyche beholde and represent
onely Christe, do teach
vs that the meanes of our saluacion,
is only in Christ. And
to put vs out of doubt wherewythall
Christe hath meryted
for vs the promyses of God,
and thys grace of our saluacion,
the sacramente sheweth vs
it was wyth and by his death
and blud sheddyng: and therfore
hath he geuen the name of
hys bodye and bloude to the
sygnes and elementes of the
sacramente. So the breade is
called the bodye broken, and
the wyne the bloude shedden:

Admonyshyng the that in the
receauing of ye sacramēt, thou
shuldest not tarye▪ nor occupye
thy meditacions and contemplacions
in the bread & wyne,
but in the merits of the bodye
broken, and the blud shedde.
Who so euer marke and vnderstand
these thynges, eateth
Christ: if he be ignoraunt here
of he is in daunger of eternall
damnacion.
            
            
               An other obiection.
               
                  THey saye: God can do
all thynges, therefore
it is not impossyble
for hym to make his body present
in the Sacrament.
               We be not so addicte and
geuen vnto humane ration,
that we wyll beleue nothinge
more then reason is able to accompte

and geue answer for.
But we beleue many thynges
that directly reason saythe we
shuld not beliue: As the incarnacion
of Christ, our resurreccion,
the making of the world,
thre persons in one godheade
and one essence: and these thinges
we belyue because the expresse
word of God commaū
                  deth
to beleue it. But the trāselementacion
and alteraciō of
the breade, no place of y• scripture
commaundeth vs to beleue,
but many places forbyd
we shuld beleue it. Nether doo
the Papists agree among thē
selues what shuld be the wordes
of consecracion: and yf we
had but that auantage of thē
only, it were inough to declare
theyr transubstanciacion to be

no parte of Gods worde.
               It is a folye to obiecte the
omnipotencye of God wythout
Gods woorde. God nor
doeth, nor can not do more thē
he wyl do: and as foolyshly do
they, makynge mencion of a
miraculous presence of Christes
body, and do declare them
selues to be of Antichriste by
the same meanes. For he shall
deceaue the worlde (ye the verye
electes, if it were possyble)
wyth newe myracles. Math.
xxii. i. ii. thes. ii. The myracle of
Christes visible ascencion and
other expressed in the scryptures
of God, are sufficient for
the Catholycke churche. And
the myracle of ye inuisyble and
miraculous presence, we leaue
to them that be deceaued wyth

the spirite of erroure. For they
woulde haue now Christe presente,
but in anye case dumme
and wythout speche: & whyles
he lyued and could speake, the
members of the deuil hanged
hym vpon the crosse.
               Thus was the malyce of
the deuyll alwayes greate agaynst
oure Sauiour. Before
he came into the flesh, he 
                     •
                  ave
manye beleue he was come, before
the time appointed by the
Prophetes was exspired: whē
he was come in deede, then
wente he aboute to perswade
he was n
                     •
                  t come, nor was not
the Sauioure of the worlde,
and neuer left tyl he had kylled
hym, because he would not
denye but that the verye true
sauioure of the worlde was

come. And nowe that in deade
he is ascended and departed
from vs accordynge to the
scriptures, he goeth about all
he can to proue hym nowe to
be here: so that neyther before
hys cummyng into the world,
nor at hys beynge corporally
in the worlde, nor yet beynge
out of the world, he can not be
in peace, sure, and safe from
the assaultes and temptacions
of hys and oure mortall ennemye
Satan. But I knowe
howe the aduersaryes of the
truth, perswade the people maliouslye
to gyue no credite to
such as preach, and teache the
truth. They saye we condemne
the holy sacramente, and make
it of no estimacion. But beliue
not their slaunders and lyes,

but heare or read our opinion,
knowledge, and godly estimacion
we haue of the sacramēt,
and then Iudge, and gyue sentence
afterwarde. And here receyue
myne opinion as touchynge
the forme and maner to
celebrate and vse the Sacramentes.
            
            
               ¶The fourme and maner howe to
celebrate the sacramentes.
               
                  IT were expediente to
intreate this mater at
length yf tyme would
serue. But yet in fewe wordes
I wyl say somwhat of the sacramente
of the Lordes Supper
and also of Baptisme.
               Baptisme consisteth in two
partes. In the worde and the
elemente. The worde is the
preaching of the good & mercifull

promyses of Gods goodnes,
acceptyng vs into his fauour
and grace for the merits
of Christ.
               The whyche promyses be
brefely comprehended in these
wordes. Math. xxviii. I baptyse
the in the name of the father,
and of the sonne, and of
the holy gost. These woordes
sheweth ye forme of Baptisme,
and also that only men, reasonable
creatures, shuld be baptised.
Mat. xvi. So is condē
                  ned
the gentilitie, and supersticion
that hath bene vsed in
the Christenyng of bels. The
matter and Elemente of thys
sacrament, is pure water: what
so euer is added, Oyle, salte,
Crosse, lyghtes, and suche other
be the inuencions of men,

and better it were they were aboly
                     •••
                  ed,
then kepte in the
Churche. For they obscure
the simplicitie, and perfectnes
of Christ our sauioures institucion.
I pray the kyngs maiestie
and hys most honorable
counsell to prepare a shyp as
sone as maye be, to sende them
home agayne to theyr mother
church, the bosome, and breast
of man.
            
            
               ¶The form how to celebrate
the Lordes supper.
               
                  HEre must be marked
two persons: ye minister,
and he that communicateth
with the minister.
These muste come and assemble
together as saynte Paule
sayth .i. Corin. xi.
            
            
               
               The dutye, and offyce of the
minister.
               
                  HE doeth best hys offyce,
and is best instructed
to minister y•
sacramente, if he in the ministracion
thereof go as nere as
is possible to the fyrste institucion
of Christe, and the Apostles.
For Christ was and is
the wysdome of the father, and
the Apostles had receiued the
holy gost that broughte them
into all truth: therefore it must
nedes folowe, their doyngs, &
ministracion to be moste perfit,
holy, and religious.
            
            
               ¶Howe the minister shoulde
prepare hym selfe.
               
                  INwardly & outwardly.
The inward preparacion
is if his minde

and soule be instructed & furnished
wyth godlye doctryne,
and a feruent spirit and zeale
to teach hys audience, to stablysh
them in the truth, and to
exhorte them to perpende and
marke wel the merites and deseruynges
of Christ.
               The outward preparacion,
the more simple it is the better
it is, and the nerer vnto the institucion
of Christ and his Apostles.
If he haue bred, wine,
a table, and a fayre table cloth,
let hym not be solicitous nor
careful for the rest, seyng they
be no thynges broughte in by
Christe, but by Popes: vnto
whom if the kynges maiestye
and hys honourable Counsaile
(haue good cōscience) thei
muste be restored agayne: and

greate shame it is for a noble
kynge, Emperour or Magistrate,
contrarye vnto Goddes
word, to detayne and kepe frō
the deuyl or hys minister, anye
of theyr goodes or treasure,
As the Candels, Uestiments,

                     〈…〉
                  : for if they be
kept in the church as thynges
indifferēt, at lēgth they wyl be
mayntayned as thynges necessary.
When the minister is

For the breaking of the bread

hath a great misterie in it of y•
passion of Christ, in the whych
hys bodye was broken for vs,
and that is sygnyfyed in the
breakyng of y• breade, which in
no case shuld be admitted: therfore
let the minister breake the
round bread, for broken it serueth
as a sacramente and not
hole. Christ did breake

saynt Paule

Cor. x. Thus shuld the perfecciō
of Christes institucion be
had in honour, and the memorie
of the dead left out, and nothing
done in this sacramēt, y•
had not gods word to bear it.
But alas God is accompted a
foole, for men can vse the sacrament
more religiously, deuoutly,

godly, and christianly,
then Christ Gods sonne, as it
appeareth: for his fourme and
maner is put oute, and mans
deuyse, and wysdome is accepted
for it.
            
            
               The dewty and office of
the people.
               
                  THe dewti of the receauer
resteth in thre partes.
To saye: what he
shuld do before the receauyng
of the Sacramente, what he
shuld do in y• receauing of it, &
what after the receauyng of it.
Before the receauing he shuld
prepare and make ready hys
mynde, as the commaundemēt
of S. Paul is, i. Cor. xi. let the
man proue and searche hymselfe,
and so forthe. And thys
maye be doone twoo maner of

wayes. Fyrst towardes God,
then towardes man.
               Towardes God he shulde
from the botome of hys heart,
confesse his faults and sinnes,
and acknowledge hys iust cō
                  demnacion:
then shuld he perswade
him selfe by true and liuely
fayth, that God would be
mercyful vnto him for y• death
of hys dere beloued sōn Iesus
Christ, done in his body torne,
and in hys blud shedde.
               He shuld prepare hym selfe
towardes his neighbour also.
Fyrst incase he hath hurt hys
neyghbour in fame or goods,
he shuld reconcile hym selfe agayne,
wyth restitucion of thē
both againe. He that thus prepareth
hym self, doth eat worthelye
the bodye of Christe,

and he that doth not thus prepare
him selfe, eateth nothing
but the sacrament to his euerlastyng
damnaciō. I make no
mencion here of auriculer cō
                  fession,
as though that were a
thyng necessary to be done before
or after the receauynge of
the Sacrament.
               For thys confession is not
of God, as theyr lawe doeth
record. The glose vpō the decre
of penaunce. Distinct .v.
in penitencia.
               In the receauynge of thys
sacrament, ther be thynges requyred
both in the inward mā
and also in the outward man.
The inwarde preparacion is
when the man receauynge the
bread and the wine, being subiectes

and maters vnder the
iudgement and censure of the
senses, the mynde is eleuated
and lyfte vp into heauen: perswadyng
hym selfe by faythe,
that as truly appertaineth vnto
hym y• promyses and grace
of God throughe the merites
and death of Christ, as he sensibly,
and outwardly receiueth
the sacramente and wytnes of
gods promyses. And doubt no
more of an inward frendshyp,
familiaritie, cōcord, peace, loue
atonement, and fatherly petye
and compassyon, throughe
Christ by the meanes of faith,
then he douteth yt hys mouthe
outwardly doth receaue y• signes
& sacramēts of gods mercies.
To excitat in vs this faith

and beleue in the merytes of
Christ: the bread is called the
body, and the wyne hys blud,
after ye maner and frase of the
scripture.
               The vtward behauour and
gesture of the receauer, should
want al kind of suspiciō, shew,
or inclinacion of Idololatrye.
Wherfore seyng knelyng is a
shew and external signe of honoryng,
and worshipping, and
heretofore hath greuous and
damnable Idololatry ben cō
                  mitted
by the honoryng of the
sacrament, I woulde wyshe it
wer commaunded by the Magistrates,
that y• communicatours,
and receauers shuld do
it, standyng or syttynge. But
syttyng in myne opinion were
best, for many consideracions.

The Paschal lambe was eatē
standynge, whyche sygnifyed
Christ yet not to be come, that
shuld geue rest, peace, & quietnes.
Christ wyth his Apostles
vsed thys Sacramente at the
fyrst, syttyng: Declaring that
he was come that should quiet
and put at rest both body and
soule, and that the fygure of
the Passeouer frō thenceforth
shuld be nomore necessary, nor
that men shuld trauel nomore
to Ierusalem once in the year,
to seke and vse a sacramente of
the Lambe to come, that shuld
take awaye the synnes of the
worlde.
               After the receauinge of it,
there shoulde be thankes geuynge
of all the churche, for
y• benefites of Christes death.

Ther shoulde be prayer made
vnto god, that thei might perseuer,
and cōtinue in the grace
of God receaued. They shuld
helpe the poore wyth theyr almes.
This forme me thinketh
is most lyke vnto the fourme
of Christe, and the Apostles.
Howe farre the masse differeth
from thys, al men know.
               I praye God the best may
be taken, and the wurste lefte,
throughe oute all the worlde.
And al such as be yet infyrme
by reason of longe custome,
and lacke of knowledge, lette
them praye God, and searche
the scriptures, wythoute affeccion.
Suche as be peruerse
and obstinate, and wyll admyt
no reason, for them the ire and
dyspleasure of God is readye

and prest to punish them whē
he seeth tyme. As it is to be
sene by the Corinthes .i. Cor.
xi. that for the abuse of ye supper,
manye of them fell sycke,
and into dyseases. So wyl he
do wyth vs, if we neglecte hys
moste perfecte, and Godlye
institucion.
               Let vs repente therefore
wyth the Niniuites from our
foremer synnes, and beleue
the remyssyon of theym for
Goddes mercye in the deseruynges
of Christe. Farther
lette vs submytte oure selues,
all oure wysedome, and learnynge
vnto hys woorde: and
thynke that Christe and hys
Apostles haue instituted and
vsed, it canne in no wayes be
bettered by vs.
               
                  
And you my gracious Lord &
king restore the right vse of the
supper of the Lord, as Iosias
dyd the ryghte vse of the Paschal
Lambe .iiii. Reg. xxiii. ii.
Para. xxxv. after the worde of
God. The text now foloweth
of the fast of the Niniuites.
            
            
               Of fastynge.
               There was a fastyng
proclaymed, and
weryng of sackecloth,
from the greatest to
the smallest.
               Here be twoo thynges to be
noted in the frutes, and signes
of penitence. Fyrst concerning
the fast, and vilenes of the apparell,

sacke cloth.
               
                  THe hypocrites of the
world when they hear
of this fasting & puttyng
on of sackecloth, damne
strayghtwayes the doctryne
of faythe, and teache that God
saueth not onelye for Christes
sake whych only fayth apprehēdeth:
as though faith could
not only apprehend the mercy
of god, and yet haue fastynge
anexed with her. But this present
text confoundeth thys errour:
for it sayeth the Niniuites
fyrst beleued the Lord, and
then fasted. But lest we shuld
here erre, I wyl speake a lytle
of fastinge, that we maye loue
rather to faste well, then obstinately
to defend a false fast.
            
            
               
               ¶What is fasting.
               
                  FAstynge is a moderat
vse and takynge of
meate and drynke, lest
the fleshe shoulde by aboundaunce
and to muche of it, rebel
and ouercome the spirite.
And thys fast eyther it is continually,
or at certayne tymes
vsed.
               Continuallye, when as a
Christiane man moderatelye
fedeth hys bodye wyth thankes
geuyng, for necessary nutriment,
and not for to aboūde
or surfet. Thys fastynge, and
abstinēce, the scripture calleth
sobrietie .i. Petri. v.
               The faste done at certayne
tymes, is also eyther pryuate,
or publycke. Priuate when any
man consideryng and waiynge

hys owne infyrmyties,
bindeth hym selfe frō meates,
and drynkes, to tame and ouercome
the vehemente, and lasciuious
inclinacions thereof,
to the obedyence and rule of
the spirite .i. Corin. vii.
               A publycke fast is, when
for a publycke and commune
calamitie, trouble, or aduersytie,
the Magistrates commaunde
a solemne and publycke
abstynence and fast.
               But in bothe these fastes
there muste be vsed a circumspecte
and godlye dylygence,
least in the abuse of fastynge
we offende and prouoke the
Ire and dyspleasure of God
the more agaynste vs: we may
offende, fyrste yf wee faste

for anye other purpose then to
kepe the bodye in subiection to
the spirite. Therefore it is to
be taken hede of, we faste not
for merite or for custome.
               The seconde is, we offende
if we faste in the honour of any
creature. The thyrde, if for one
fastynge daye we make thre
gloto
                     •
                   festes, as the fashion is
for the moost parte. I woulde
wyshe therefore that the true
fast & abstinence wet brought
in agayne, and then the lorde
would be pleased I dout not.
               That they amende from the
greatest to ye smallest we learne
two thynges. Fyrste of what
greate effycacye the sermon of
Ionas was, that pleased all
people both greate and smalle.
The lyke hath not bene seene.

For it is easier for a Cooke to
please an hundreth mouthes,
wyth one mete, then a preacher
to order one sermon or oracion
to please ten heades. It were
well in our tyme if at euery sermon
were one of the magistrates
and of the people conuerted:
and at ten Sermones one
Byshop and one prieste. The
second, the faciliti and promptnes
of these Niniuites to beleue
and amend their religion,
and cōuersaciō, doth condemne
the vngodlye obstinacye and
frowardnes of such, as detract
and prolong their amendemēt,
and saye they wyl belyue when
the kynge commeth to age.
Thus the deuil geueth thē one
occasion or other to defer their
belefe. If the kings magesty,

and hys Nobles shoulde hate
the trueth, they woulde saye:
howe can we beleue the doctryne,
yt our learned, and wyse
Magystrates detesteth? If
the kynges maiestye and hys
nobles loue and fauoure the
best part, thei excuse thēselues
vpō the tender & younge age
of the kynge: as thoughe hys
Magesties yonge age or olde
age coulde make any religion
of God true or false: when in
deede all ages and powers
be or oughte to be subiecte vnto
the religion, and law made
allredye, and geuen to be obserued
of and by all menne, of
what sort condiciō, or state so
euer they be of.
               Thys thynge came

to the Kynge of Niniue,
who arose frome
his seate, doyng of his
apparell, clothed hym
selfe in sacke cloth.
               It is not wythoute a synguler
councell of the holye
goste that thys kynge is mencionated
of so copiously.
               Nether that hys behauoure
and doynges after hys conuercion,
is so diligentlye manyfested.
               Fyrste the Texte setteth
forth the manner of hys conuersion,
and sayeth: he returned
vnto God vpon the fame
and rumoure of Ionas preachynge.
               Wherefore we learne how

much the truth is wurthye to
be estemed, seyng that a kynge
vpon the brute thereof made
by hys people, embrased, and
resisted not (as now we se many
tymes done by the greatest
part of the world.) Euē so did
Iosias: as soone as he beynge
yet but a chylde, hearde of the
true boke of God, embraced it
.iiii. Reg. xxii. So dyd Dauid
and Iosaphat heare & graunt
to the admonicions of ye Prophetes.
All kynges therefore
and magistrates shuld harken
vnto the truthe, and learne it
them selues oute of the lawe
Deut. xvii. But thys studye
and knowledge of gods lawe
in Princes and kynges, the
Byshops, Priestes, and other
do let: bearyng them in hande

that it appertayneth nothinge
to theyr office to study and labour
in the worde of God, but
the iudgement and study therof
to be committed vnto them:
and so by y• same meanes they
perswade & cause prynces many
times to persecute the truth
and veritie by ignoraunce, as
the kynges of Israel dyd that
burned the wrytynges of the
Prophetes.
               But most gracious kyng,
and ye my lordes of hys most
honorable coūcel, Ye haue not
only heard the rumour & fame
of Gods word, but wyth your
owne eares haue heard youre
selfe the truth, and ye do credit,
and beleue the same: therefore
in al thynges expresse and declare
it in facte.
               
                  
And most gracious kynge
take ye hede that the vertues
ye learn and be brought vp in
in youth, ye practyse & exercise
them in age. And incase your
Magesty wil so do, beware of
one thing: y• poison of flaterie.
The whyche youre Magestye
may vse as a good medycine,
and not a poisō if ye take hede
of it. Yt wyl be poison, yf your
grace thynk your selfe to be at
al times, as flaterers wyl bear
youre hyghnes in hand to be.
It shall be a medicine, yf your
Magestye studye to be the
same in dede, that flaterie commendeth.
               Youre Magestye may see
an Example hereof in kynge
Iehoas, that in hys youthe
fauoured, and sette forthe the

truthe, but in hys elder dayes
he fell from it, by the meanes
of flatteroures that deceaued
hym.
               But youre Magestye shall
do best to folowe thys Godly
Kynge of the Niniuites, and
embrace contynually the word
of the lyuynge God. And thus
shal youre grace be the better
able to doo, incase youre highnes
woulde haue before you
euerye Sundaye one sermon,
whych shoulde brynge muche
knowledge & grace into youre
hyghnes courte.
               Nowe foloweth the fruite
of thys Godly kynges penitence.
Fyrste he ryseth from
his seate, and putteth on sackclothe.
               
                  
Of thys we learne that infayth
and true repentaunce, is
no diuersitie betwene the king
and a meane subiect. And thus
shall it be at ye later iudgemēt.
The rych, the poore, the kyng,
the subiect, y• bishop, ye prieste,
al shal apere naked before the
trone of Christe: and be holpe
nothyng there by anye tytle or
name of glory. Here the honor
and ryches haue theyr estimacion
and glorye. Let all men
therfore looke to amend theyr
fayth and lyuyng, here in thys
worlde.
               As for this external doing
on of sackeclothe, it was the
maner at that tyme so to doo,
and declared theyr repentaūce
and amendemente: And so I
woulde it were nowe. He that

offendeth in apparel, he wolde
remoue the pryde thereof and
goo soberlye: he that in meate,
would vse more sobryetie, Yet
noman shuld thyncke any holines
to be in the external vestiment,
nor yet any hurt or dā
                  nacion
in the meate: but the abuse
of both, displeaseth God.
As for the vestimentes of the
priest in ye ministerie, I wolde
wyshe the Magistrate to remoue
thē, for they either shew,
or not shewe vertue. If they
shewe not, they vse theym in
vayne: If they do declare and
shew vertue, eyther the vertue
is wyth them in deede; or absent.
If he that weareth them
haue the vertue, why sheweth
it he to the world? If he haue
not the vertue, then is he an

hypocrite, whom God hateth.
            
            
               ¶The other frute of penaūce
of the kynge wyth hys counsell,
beyng conuerted to God.
               
                  THere was as the texte
sayeth, a proclamacion
made throughe al
the Citye of Niniue, by the cō
                  maundement
of the kyng and
hys councell.
               In thys proclamacyon
fyrste muste be marked who
be the authours of thys proclamacion.
Then, what is cō
                  tayned
in the proclamacion.
The persons be the kyng, and
the Nobles of hys realme. In
these persons fyrst, note that
it is the Kynges offyces, and
the Peeres of the realme, to
pourge theyr cōmune wealth
from false relygyon, by Publycke,

and open proclamacions.
               So dyd Nabuchadnezer,
Darius, and Cirus, kynges
of moste notable fame: therefore
Christe calleth the Princes,
the Nurces of the church.
               And so I doubte not most
Gracious kynge, but youre
hyghnes wyll accordynge to
your tytle & style, pourge thys
Churche of Englande to the
puritie and synceritie of gods
woorde.
               Farther we learne howe
that the Prynces and councellours
of a realme, shoulde
helpe foorth the Godlye purposes
and statutes made for
the glorye of God wythin a
Realme.
               
                  
So was this kinges Godlye
purpose holpe by hys councel,
so Dauid, so Iosias. In that
the kynge and hys nobles do
confyrme the doynges of hys
people, we learne that Godlye
magistrates shuld not let, but
further and confyrme al godly
purposes and vertuous study
of theyr people, when they study
amendement of false relygion:
so did Iosaphat, Ezechias,
and Iosias.
            
            
               ¶The sūme of the proclamacion.
               
                  IT containeth the true
and ryghte forme of
repentaūce that pleaseth
God, whyche is contayned
in foure partes.
               Fyrst in outwarde sygnes
of heuynes. Then in callynge

vpon the Lorde. Thirdlye in
leauing the wicked and accustomed
yuel life. Forthly in the
trust and confydence of Gods
mercy. Of these partes we wil
speake somwhat by order.
            
            
               ¶Of the external sygnes of
a penitent harte.
               
                  TWo notes of penaūce
are here described: the
one abstynence from
meate, the other sorditie and
vylenes of apparell: for after
such sort, as naturall men say,
contraries are cured by cōtraries.
He that is geuen to hys
bodye, cannot please God by
penitence, excepte he come to a
sobernes: Neyther the proude
and arrogant appareled, except
he remoue the excesse and
abuse thereof.
               
                  
I would, and exhort therfore
as manye as dooe excede
and offend in these two, to returne
to penytence wyth the
kynge and people of Niniue:
if they woulde so dooe, they
shoulde not onely fynde grace
at Gods hande, but also more
healthe and sobernes of body,
more ryches in the cofer, more
plentye in the Realme, more
grace, wytte, and sobernes in
theyr housholde.
               That the beastes be tyed
vp also from their meate, it declareth
that the king and people
had to much a delite in wā
                  ton
and ouer much gainesse of
theyr beastes, whyche beynge
kept oute of theyr accustomed
pryde, shoulde not alure them

from theyr penitence, nor geue
them occasyon to returne agayne
to the former euyll.
               Farther it pleaseth so the
Lorde to punysh y• thing that
allureth mannes frayle nature
to synne, because the syn
of manne shoulde the better
be knowen: as wee see, by the
kyllynge of the leuiticall beastes
that neuer offended, God
woulde preache vnto manne
that hys synne deserued none
other thē presēt & sodain death:
so dyd the Lorde punyshe and
curse the earthe that Adam
& hys posteritie myght know
it was not a lyghte thynge
the transgression of Goddes
commaundemente, Genes. iii.

so do all creatures weepe and
mourne vntyll the tyme of the
reuelacion of the chyldren of
of God. Roma. viii. And thus
peryshed he the beastes wyth
man in the fludde. Gene. viii.
            
            
               ¶The seconde sygne.
               
                  LEst men shuld thynke
that the abstinence frō
meates, or the castinge
of of gay apparel for certaine
dayes, should deserue and meryt
thys fauoure and mercye
of God, it standeth in the proclamacion,
that they called cō
                  tinually
vpon the Lord. That
is to say: they asked feruentlye
and contynuallye healpe and
fauoure of God.
               Note in the conuersion of
thys Kynge, how that he comcommaundeth

not now to call
vpon straunge goddes, but
vpon on true and liuing god,
Euen so shoulde we do in the
dayes of oure trouble, accordynge
to the commaundemēt
of God and the example of al
the Patriarckes, Prophetes,
and the Apostles. But this is
to be noted that the texte sayeth,
they shoulde call strongly
vpon the Lorde: that is to say
wyth a penitente hart, that is
sorye for the euil, and wylling
to studye for euer after to do
good. We call 
                     •
                  arnestly vpon
the Lord two wayes: the one,
whē we aske of God to tourne
and kepe from vs hys ire and
dyspleasure. The other when
we desyre hym to take from
vs, and gyue vs grace to prepreserue

awaye from vs, the
sinnes that prouoked and merited
his dyspleasure & wrath.
               But we offende in this behalfe,
two maner of wayes.
Fyrst mē call vpon creatures.
The secōd they cal coldly, and
vnfaythfully, without an earnest
mynd to amend, and faith
vpon the promises of God,
for Christes sake. So dyd
Saule rather call to God to
auaide payne, thē for any loue
he had to vertue. For some assone
as the payne is remoued,
they retourne agayne to
theyr olde iniquitye, as Pharao.
Exod.
            
            
               The third note of penaunce.
               
                  Euery man turned from
hys wycked wayes,
and from fraude and

gyle whych they vsed before.
               Thys is the thyrde propertye
of penaunce, wythout the
whyche we be rather hypocrites,
then penitente Christians.
And the propertye is
thys, to forsake al euyll, and
fleshelye studyes, and applye
hym selfe to vertue and godlynes.
               Note fyrste that the texte
sayeth: Euerye man tourned.
If the Kynge offended, the
Counsel, the Bishop, the persō
the paryshe prieste, euerye one
amended: so let vs excepte we
wyll peryshe.
               And what shall we do to
tourne frome vs the Ire of
God, kyndeled, and inflamede
Shal we by any mans merits

and deseruynges? No sayeth
the text, but euery man amend
for hym selfe. And so concludeth.
Esa. lviii. chap. Ier. vii.
And because Auarice as S.
Paul sayth, is the mother and
rote of euyl, the Proclamacion
of the Kynge of Niniuites
is, that thei should leaue theyr
force, vyolence, & oppression: &
so make restitucion of the false
gotten goods. Here let al men
learne howe to be saued, that
haue gathered together they
care not whether wt or against
the lawe, wyth or agaynst charitye.
Let them leaue doynge
of thys vyolence, and oppresion,
and restore agayne all
false gotton goods, or else sure
they wyll peryshe. So dyd
zacheus. Luke .xix. And other

Godly men, and rich men that
repented. Let men looke vpon
that wyse saying of Salomō.
Pro. xxii. Spoile not ye poore,
because he is poore, neyther oppresse
not the afflycted in the
port. For the Lorde wyll take
vpon hym the defence of hys
cause.
            
            
               ¶The fourth fruite of penitence.
               Who can tell whether
God wyll be conuerted,
& moued wyth
petye, tourne from the
fury of hys wrath that
we peryshe not.
               In thys text we se to turne
and bowe the angre and dyspleasure
of God is a greate

matter, and that to afflicte the
bodye wyth fastynge, to praye,
and to chaunge the olde wycked
lyfe is verye expediente
to wynne hys fauoure: but all
these thynges be in vayne excepte
there be lykewyse a confidence,
and true fayeth in the
mercye of God. And thys is
the thynge that God mooste
deliteth in when the sinner confesseth
that he is mercyful for
hys promises sake in Christe,
and not for the worthynes of
hys penaunce. So doeth thys
Kynge in the ende of hys proclamacion
sette forth the mercye
of GOD to hys people,
whereby boeth he and they by
saued.
               That it semeth his oracion
to haue a doute in it, truly notwythstandynge

that he was
verye well perswaded of goddes
mercye. For as Ionas
proponed nothynge but Goddes
Ice, he maketh mencion
of hys mercye.
               The doute he putteth: eyther
to put awaye the slugerdnes
of hys people, eyther to
declare in hym selfe the fyghte
& battayle that is alwayes betwene
the spyrite, and the flesh
aboute Goddes promises. We
maye saye also that in desirynge
worldelye thynges of
GOD, we shoulde aske theim
wyth a condicyon. Mat. viii.
               We maye learne heare to
put awaye despayre, and trust
to the Lords mercy, although
he threaten neuer so much our
distruccion.
               
                  
Also here Princes maye learne
what proclamaciōs they
shoulde make in settynge
forth of religiō: such
as only extēd
to ye glory
and
mercy of God
in Christ. Howe the
people accepted thys proclamacion,
I wyll
shewe in the
next sermon.
               FINIS.
            
         
         
            
            ¶The Seuenth Sermon
vpon Ionas, made
by Ihon Hoper.
            ¶The text.
            
               
                  
                     ANd when God
saw theyr workes,
howe they
turned from their wicked
wayes, he repēted
of the yuel whyche he
sayed he would do vnto
thē: and dyd it not.
               
            
            Ye haue hearde howe thys
myghtye kynge at the preachynge
of Ionas, corrected
both hys faythe, and maners.
And how by publycke proclamacion,
he wylled al hys subiectes
to do the same. Of thys
fact of the Niniuites, we maye

learne how that it is our office
to obei vnto al godly and vertuous
commaundemēts, proclamaciōs,
and decrees of princes,
as many times as they cō
               maunde
amendement of relygyon
and maners. But oure
people, and especially the multitude
of Priests be otherwyse
affected: for they do dysobeye
both God and theyr kyng. It
were a charytable way yf they
haue anye thynge to obiect agaynst
thys reformacion, that
the kynges Magestie and the
coūsel godly intēdeth, to bring
forth argumentes, & not force,
and violence of armoure.
            God therfore seeth, that is
to say: approueth their works,
not because thei wer clothed in
sackcloth, but because thei turned

from theyr wycked waies,
that they had chaunged theyr
fals religiō, & restored ye goods
agayne, they had by vyolence
and extorcion takē from theyr
neyghbours, and euerye man
walked in hys vocacion. And
euen as the Lord pityed them,
so wyll he doo vs yf we amend
our faythe, and conuersacion,
and lyue in oure vocacion, accordyngly.

            That God repenteth on the

Niniuites: we learne that al y•
threatnīgs of god be cōdicionally,
yt is to say: to fal vpō vs

                  ¶The diuision of y• chapter.
                  
                     IT is diuided into two
partes. The one conteineth

how Ionas was angri
for y• merci & cōpassiō god toke
vpō y• penitēt Niniuits, wherfore
he is reprehended of god.
                  The second part cōtayneth
how Ionas beyng in the fieldes,
is taught of the Lords by
a tree that sodenly growed vp,
and sodenly peryshed agayne,
that he dyd noughte to be angrye
wyth gods doynges towards
the Niniuites, and declareth
farther that he coulde
do none other then saue them.
               
               
                  Therefore Ionas
was sore dyscontente
and angry, & he praied
vnto the Lorde, and
sayde: O Lorde was
not thys my saying (I

pray the) when I was
yet in my Countrey?
Therefore I hasted to
fly rather to Tharsis.
For I knowe well inough
that thou art a
mercyfull God, full of
cōpassion, longe suffering,
and of great kindnes,
and repentest whē
thou shuldest take punyshmente.
                  Of thys text we learne, first
how horrible and wycked the
peruersenes of oure nature
is, seyng Ionas (I can not tel
vpon what loue towards him
selfe,) is angrye: and not wyth
man, but with God, that wold

fauoure of mercy, the sorowful
Niniuites. Seyng ther was
suche imperfeccion and infyrmities
in the holye Sayntes,
how much nede haue we to see
what lyeth in vs myserable
and wr
                        •
                     tched synners?
                  Oute of thys texte also wee
learne what difficultie & hardnes
is in ye office of preaching,
if it be truely and wel done: cō
                     tinually
whether it happē and
come to passe yt he speaketh, or
it come not to passe, the preacher
stādeth in daūger of obloquie
and contempt: We maye
se an example hereof in Ionas
that preached by the worde of
God, the destruccion of Niniue:
whych if it had come so to
passe, they woulde haue called
Ionas a cruell tyraunte, and

seker of blud. And now that he
seeth the citi spared, he feareth
least he shoulde be accomted a
false prophet: not only among
hys owne countrimen the Israelites,
but also amonge the
Gentils, and then al his preachynge
shoulde be taken for a
mockery. Thys contempte so
sore feareth Ionas, and is therwythal
so troubled, that he offēdeth
God greuously. I may
accommodate y• same fortune
vnto my self and others right
wel. When we speake for a reformacion
of the church, scholes,
and polycyes, In to the
churche we wyshe to be putte
such ministers as can & would
teach the doctryne of the apostles,
and that they should not
be knowen by theyr vestimentes,

and shauings, but by their
doctryne: Thē, such as would
minister the sacramentes grauely,
relygyouslie, and simply,
as Christe and hys Apostles
dyd. In Baptisme, nothynge
to be vsed but the woorde and
the symple and bare water. In
the supper of the Lorde, to vse
the Ceremonies and Rites of
Christ and hys Apostles, and
al occacions of supersticion to
be auoidid. But although this
doctryn be as true as Christ &
his Apostles be, yet I perceiue
displeasure, & greate ennimitie
ryse here vpō to me & to other:
yea, not onely vnto vs that be
subiectes, but also to ye kyngs
magesty & his most honorable
councel. But the lord kepe vs
out of tēptacion, & gyue grace
and strength to do all thinges

to y• glorye of God, & to praye
for our enemyes. And as touchyng
scholes, specially y• vniuersities,
they muste be amended,
and good heades & rulers
apoynted in the Colleges, or
els ye word of god shuld be hindred
alwaies bi such as ought
most to set it forth. Such godly
mē as haue wherwtal shuld
helpe & prouide to haue schols
to bringe vp youthe in euerye
where, through thys realme: &
thē shuld godli & learned childrē
occupy ye place of supersticious
& ignoraunt men, wherwithal
this realme of Englād
is sore, & to much (god amende
it) pestered & hurt withal: this
might bishops in theyr dioceses
help wel if they intēded as
muche good as they beare the
worlde in hande they dooe:

and bestow some part o
                        •
                      theyr
exces vpō the towardly youth
of theyr dyoceses. So might y•
Nobilitie, and our worshipful
men of the shyre dooe: yea so
might euery person and curat
do, either with his goods help
forth the truth and old catholycke
faythe of Christe, eyther
wyth their goodwyls animate
them to learne the doctryne of
y• Patriarkes, Prophets, and
the apostles: and such as haue
the talent of teachyng, myght
rather teache, then play: helpe,
then hyndre: buylde, then pull
downe: helpe forth, then drawbacke:
promote God, rather
then the deuyl, fauour Christ,
then Antichrist: agre wyth the
kynge, then conspire wyth the
Pope. As concernyng the polic
                        •
                     e,

and reformacion therof, I
haue sayd my mind before: the
whych God geue grace it may
be accepted & folowed. If it be
not, yet I haue delyuered my
soule, & God shal requyre your
bluddes at your owne hande.
And incase any man be offended
wyth me for my true sayinge,
I had rather haue dyspleasure
of al the worlde, then
of God, that is able to damne

                        •
                     ath my bodye and my sowle.
In y• thyrd place Ionas putteth
an excellent discripcion of
God, the whych we should wel
kepe in mynde: that he is a pitiful
and mercyful God, longe
suffering and of much clemencie.
Thys descripcion of God
agreeth with Gods own wordes
spokē to Moses .cx.xxxiiii

the whych encoraged Iustes &
shulde do the same to vs if we
were of god. Great (doubtles)
was the synne of Ionas, that
toke an occasiō to be angry by
gods fauour and goodnes towardes
thys sorowful Citye.
Euen thus dyd the Pharises,
that were angry at Christ, because
he kept companye wyth
synners. Ionas was then, as
many mē be now adayes, that
thyncke wretched Synners
shoulde neuer fynde pardon
for theyr synnes before God.
Now foloweth a farther discripcion
of Ionas faute and
impaciencye.
                  And nowe O Lord
take my lyfe from me,

(I beseeche thee) for I
had rather dy thē liue.
                  Of thys text we learne two
thynges, fyrste howe sore and
haynously thys Ionas offended,
that rather desyred to dy,
thē god should haue pitye vpon
th
                        •
                     se penytente people, by
whose preseruaciō, he thought
some shame and rebuke shuld
happen vnto hym: because he
did afore speake, and threaten
theyr perdicion and losse.
                  Muche better and more
Godly dyd Moses and Paul,
that wyshed rather their owne
harme, thē ye losse of yt people.
Also thys texte declareth the
werynes and impaciencye of
the fleshe, that wyll not suffer

the troubles annexed vnto the
vocaciō, but rather wisheth to
dye, then to lyue. So did Elias
desyre death .iii. Reg. xix. so
that the text & experience▪ dayly
sheweth the best day that euer
a true preacher shal see, is
the day of hys deathe. But as
the deuyll hath vsed the vocacion
of Bishops and Priestes
in this present tyme, ther is no
day so terrible nor fearefull to
them, as the dai of death. The
cause therof, me thynketh S.
Augustine. Episto. cxlviii. ad
Ualerium sheweth right well.

is to say: Before al thynges, I
desyre that your Godlye prudence
would thynke nothynge
to be more lyght, facile, or ioyfull
in thys lyfe, chiefely nowe
thys tyme, then the offyce of a
Byshop, Priest, or Deacon, yf
the thynge be done lyghtlye,
or hypocriticallye: but before
God there is nothynge more
miserable, sorowful, and damnable.
Nowe foloweth the answer
of god to this angry mā.
               
               
                  ¶God maketh answer to
angry Ionas.
                  Then sayd the lord:
art thou so angry?
                  Of thys demaund & question
of the Lord, we learne how
he in a fume or hastye passion
(if a mā may speake so of god)

wil not cast away this infirme
and weake Ionas: but wyth
sufferaunce trayned hym to a
better and more aduised iudgemente.
                  So doeth Esaye reporte
of Gods nature. chap. xlii. He
wil not put out the towe kindled.
He dyd not onely consyder
the weakenes of the man, but
also the daungers and trouble
of hys pastoral vocacion. Pyty
                        •
                     ully
therfore doth god bear
wyth hym, and scholeth him to
a farther & better knowledge.
Of this mā we mai learn how
to be ware of hasty & rash passions
of Ire▪ for if there be not
in all oure actes a moderacion
thereof. we shal neuer doo, nor
iudge thinges vp ryghtly accordyng
to knowledge. If mē
                     
would remember this demaūd
of God towardes Ionas, they
woulde not be so angrye when
they be rebuked for their faultes,
but rather thanke y• admonitoure
for hys good admonicion
and warning of gods displeasure.
Now foloweth the secōd
part of the chapter.
                  And Ionas gat him
oute of the Citye, and
sat downe on the East
syde thereof, and there
made hym a Boothe,
and satte vnder it in
the shadowe, tyll he
myght see what shuld
Chaunce vnto the cytye.
                  
                     
Whē Ionas had no excuse
to make, why he was angrye,
nor woulde not confesse hys
faulte (for he answereth nowe
nothyng to the questyon God
demaundeth of hym) he goeth
hym selfe out of the Cit
                        •
                     e to se
the ende: whether ye Niniui
                        •
                     es
wold perseuer in their penaūce
begone or not. Of thys we learne
yf we be wrongfully angrye,
and admonyshed, if we
wyl not confesse the faulte, yet
shuld we consyder, and way it
the more deepelye. In that
he made hym selfe a boothe,
we see wyth what symplycitie
the good man was contented
wyth al, and likewyse howe he
hym selfe was contente to labour
to make hys own couch.
Our Byshops, and Priestes

haue all thynges prepared to
theyr handes, God geue them
grace better to deserue it. The
texte sayeth.
                  The Lorde God
prepared a wilde vine,
whych sprang vp ouer
Ionas, that he myght
haue shadowe aboue
hys heade, to delyuer
hym out of hys paine.
                  The Lorde here purposeth
to helpe the infirmities of Ionas,
and remoue the sinistre &
and false iudgement he had of
Gods mercye, by the ymage of
a yong tree. He bringeth forth
a yong tree that may geue shadow
to Ionas, wherof Ionas
reioyceth very much. But the

Lorde queeleth it a agayne
strayght way, and that maketh
Ionas eftsones angri. In the
myddest of hys fumes commeth
the Lord, and by a collacion
and similitude betwene &
symple tree, and the woorthye
Cytye of Niniue: he sheweth
Ionas his fault that was angry
for the mercy shewed wnto
the Citie. But in these thinges
be thynges to be marked.
Fyrst in Ionas, then in God,
thyrdly in the 
                        〈◊〉
                     .
                  In Ionas maye be sene
the ymage of a
                        ••
                     an that laboreth
and is oppressed with many
affeccions, and neuer contented
with y• doings of god.
We shoulde not folowe thys
fault, but submyt oure iudgementes
to his wyl. Saing alwaies

& in al gods works, thy
wylbe done, whether thou send
vs myrth or sorow, ioy or pain
for euery thing shalbe to ye best
vnto those that loue the lorde.
Ionas also in thys hys peruerse
& froward opinion to wt
                     draw
the mercy of god frō the
Niniuits, expresseth ye noughty
opinion that saieth, that sinners
can neuer be receaued into
grace after they fal once frō
the Lorde. They would abrogate
ye greatest work of god to
say hys mercye that it shoulde
not woorke where it pleaseth
hym: but where as it pleaseth
mans fancies to appoynte it.
The Lord doth not onelye fauour
and bear with Ionas infirmityes,
but also couereth
him from the burnyng & heate

of the sunne, and also teacheth
him by the tree, that he is offē
                     ded
wtout cause. what tree this
was it is not agreed vpon yet
among writers, but it maketh
no matter therof, it is ynough
we knowe it was a tree wyth
brode leaues, wherby the lord
would succour both the bodye
and knowledge of the infirme
Ionas. That it grewe vp sodenly,
and wythered away sodenly,
it beareth therein the ymage
and propertie of suche
honours, riches, and treasures
as be in thys world: whych sodenly
ryse, and sodenly fall agayne.
Noman therfore shuld
hasard or daunger hys sowle
for so britle and fraile things.
                  And by the withering away
of this lytle tree, God woulde

shew Ionas howe vncharitable
he was: angry that y• great
Citie of Niniue was saued: as
though he had sayd, if it greue
the somuch for the losse of this
lytle tre, shuld it not be a greater
grefe vnto the, to se the destruccion
of so greate a Citye?
For the tree sprang vp in one
nyght, and the Citie had stand
many hundred yeares. Againe
for the tree, Ionas laboured
neuer a dele, but God buylded
Niniue. The tree is but one
thynge, the Citie had greate
nombre both of men and catel.
And least Ionas myght haue
sayd: yea, but al men of the citie
be euyl, therfore worthy to
perysh: but God addeth to the
mater and sayth: there were in
the citie aboue a hundred and

twentye thousande persones
that knewe not betwene the
ryghte hande and the lefte:
that is to saye, chyldren, and
foules.
                  Of thys dialoge betwene
God and Ionas, we maye gather
thys generall, and vniuersal
doctrine, that god wyl saue
al penitente synners .i. Timo.
ii. for seyng he gaue hys onely
sōne for vs, whiles we wer yet
his enemies, how shuld it be, he
wold not in him giue vs al thī
                     ges.
Romaynes .viii. Mathe.
xi. But here of commeth oure
losse and perdicion, that we repente
not from oure euyll, as
the Proclamacion of the king
of Niniue commaunded the
people, and subiectes thereof,

that woulde not onelye men
to amend theyr yuel liues: but
also they shuld restore agayne
all false goten goodes, and
make restituciō therof, as well
to god as to man.
                  Restitucion towardes God
is, when al honoure and glory
is geuen vnto hym, as saynte
Paule sayeth .i. Timotheus .i.
But thys glorye is, and hathe
bene taken frō God by men of
euery sorte, as well by those of
the Ecclesiasticall polycye, as
those of the Ciuile policie.
                  Those of the Ecclesiastical
Policye take awaye thys
honoure and prayse from God
two waies. One by neglecting
the true doctrine, the other by
defe
                        •
                     dynge of false doctryne.

By negligence offend such as
know God and hys ministerie
bi the holi word of god, yet for
priuate respectes, ether for lucre,
or for feare of them selues,
suffer many tokens, monumē
                     tes
and ceremonyes of supersticion:
as is the dyuersitie of
meates for religions sake, (yet
I aproue the commaundemēt
of the Magistrates, that for a
Ciuile Policie, cause certayne
dayes apoynted to eat fish in)
ymages, forbyddyng of mariage
in the lent, the vse of suche
vestimentes or apparel as obscure
the mynysterie of Christes
churche, and representeth
the forme and fasshyon of the
Aaronicall ministerie of the
old law, abrogated, and ended
in Christ: eyther els seldom, or

neuer teach the people, neither
procure them to be taught. Al
those I exhort to restituciō, or
els doubtles theyr thefte wyll
bryng them to damnaciō. Let
them preach truly the woorde
of God, and minister his Sacramentes,
after the instituciō
of Christ, and thē theyr harme
done in time past, shall not be
thought vpon.
                  Ther be an other sorte, that
refuse not only to mocke thys
satisfaccion, but also obstinatly
maintaine and defend false
doctrine, and study to oppresse
the true doctryne. Of thys
sort is no smalle numbre. But
those I exhorte also to leaue
theyr yuel sayinges, and to
make restitucion.
                  As many as be of the laytie,

as thei be called, that is to sai:
not of the publicke ministerie
of the church robbeth also god
of hys glory & honoure. They
seke remedy for synne by another
meanes then through the
death of Christ, as by the marchaundies
of Masses, Indulgences.
Inuocaciō of saintes,
the peines of Purgatorie, but
I aduyse them to geue God
that for it appertayneth onlye
vnto hym. Harken vnto the
woord of God, and call vpon
hys name as he teacheth thorowe
Christ in spirit and veritie.
And thancke hym for all
hys gyftes he geueth bothe to
your body and soule.
                  At your death commende
your soules to hym, for Christ

Let al men cease

verye sore and daungerouslye
such as possesse the goodes of

such as haue stipēdes to teach

not wyth fyue hūdreth. Such
as enioye hospitales, almoshouses,
and the prouisyon of

commoditie. To al these I say
repente ye, and make restytucion.
                  Goodes be euyll spente.
Fyrste, if they be consumed in
an yuell case. As when they
be applyed to pryde and excesse
in apparel or meate and
drinke, to the oppressyon and
hurte of the poore. Eyther to
fynde a greate companye of ydle
and loyterynge men.
                  Then yf they be not vsed
to a good vse, to the edifiyng

of Christes Churche, the helpe
of the poore, the prisoners, and
suche lyke.
                  For in the latter iudgement,
the Lord shal aske what
care and charge we had of the
poore. Math. xxv. And we see
the rych man damned, because
he gaue not to Lazarus, Luc.
xvi. Unto those also I saye:
repent ye, and spend the giftes
of God after knowledge and
vertue, yf ye wyll not, ye shall
all peryshe, Luke. xiii. God
sleepeth not but seeth all oure
actes, aud noteth oure dooynges.

nor vse theyr goodes well, for
the offyce ye haue taken from
God, ye be bounde to compell
them to do it. And fyrste of all
(because ther is no mā but sinneth)
loke fyrst vnto your selues,
& thē wyth ye kyng of Niniue,
and the Nobles of hys
realme, repente ye, and restore
vnto God that is Gods, and
vnto mā, that which is for the
cōfort of your subiectes: good
lawes, and dilygent execucion
and vsage of the same. Then
compell both the spiritualtye
as they be called, and also the
temporaltie to make restituciō
both to God and man accordingly.
And now the lord hath

geuen you peace, because ye
myght haue leasure to do these
thyngs, as Paul saith .i. Tim.
ii. Do therfore as Salomon
did .iii. Re. viii. Abuse not the
peace in playing sportes, and
pastyme, but in the buildynge
of Gods temple, whych hath a
longe tyme layne desolate: Ye
haue an example. Num. v, and
in any case let that example be
folowed. Ther be the gestes of
Iosaphat the kynge wrytten
ii. Para. xvii. in the whych are
thre notable thynges. Fyrst he
toke away and remoued from
hys people, Idololatrie.
                  The seconde, he gaue them
true iudges, whose godly condicions
are wryttē in the same
booke. cap. xix. that feared the
Lorde, accepted in iudgement

no persōs, third. They receiued
no brybes, nor rewardes.
                  The thyrde he placed and apoynted
Priestes not in one
place but in all the Cytyes of
Iuda: and not to the ende they
shoulde playe and pastyme,
but to teache, and not euerye
thynge, but the lawe of God.
Al these thynges muste ye do,
mooste Gracious Kynge and
you my honourable Lordes
of hys highe and wysecouncel,
if ye wyll lyue in peace, and
quyetnes. I do not exhorte
your Maiestye nor your most
honorable Counsell lyghtlye,
but vpon greate, and wayghtye
consideracion to remoue al
these thynges, that be eyther
the Deuyl
                        •
                     , ether mannes inuincion.
                  
                     
For in the scripture I fynde
that God manye tymes is offended
when we giue 
                        •
                     ym but
halfe honour.
                  Howe well began Hiiu the
kynge of Israell .iiii. Regum.
x. But because he remayned in
the synnes of Hieroboam, hys
kyngdome was not onelye
afflycted, but at length distroied
also. Abolyshe therfore godlye
kynge all iniquytye, and
permit not Masse nor such abhominacion
to any man wyth
in youre hyghnes realme: no
not to the straungers, whyche
doubtles shoulde be an occacyon
of slaunder to youre realme,
and subiectes. For Asa
the kyng of Iuda .iii. Regum.
xv. remouyd hys mother from
the rule, and gouernaunce of

of the realme, because she had
an Idole in a groue, the which
her sonne the kyng brent. Thē
your magestie muste institute
true, faythfull, and iudges of
good conscyence. Then sende
suche priestes throughe youre
realme, that haue these twoo
condycions. Fyrste that they
teach, thē yt thie teach the word
of God. If your magestye doo
these thynges, then shall God
sed peace and quietnes to hys
pleasure. Farther, God shall
make you a feare and terrour
to fo
                        •
                     en and straunge nacions
that know not the liuing god.
                  And this your magesty shal
auoeyde the better, if ye beware
of flaterers, and thynk as Ioada
in hys youth fauored the
truthe of God, and in hys age

by flattery departed from it
iiii. Reg. xii. so the same yuell
and daunger maye corrupte
your hyghnes. Then if it may
please you to commaund more
sondry tymes to haue sermōs
before your magestie, it wyll
not be a lytle healpe to you yf
they be wel made, wel borne awaye,
and wel practised. And
seyng ther is in the yeare .viii.
M.vii.C.lx. houres, it shall
not be much for your highnes
no nor for al your housholde,
to bestow of thē .lii. in the yere
to heare the Sermon of God.
If your magesty do these thinges,
the blud of youre people
shal not be requyred at youre
hands. But I rede both kyng
and counsel to be admonished,
and to amend thynges amysse.

Yf not, the kynge of Niniue
wyth hys people, shall ryse a
                        •
                     
the later daye, and condempne
bothe kynge and counsell to
deathe. For they conuerted at
the preaching of one man: yea
at the preachyng of a straunger,
we haue not only heard yt
same by the mouth of straungers,
but also by the mouth of
our owne country men, & that
many tymes. Let vs therfore
beleue and amende, or els we
must peryshe.
                  God preserue for ye death of
Christ, the Kyngs magestie, al
hys honorable councell
wyth the hole realme.
Amen.
