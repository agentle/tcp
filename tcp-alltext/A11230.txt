               HAuing many times a deſire to read ſome ſpeciall Chapters in the Bible, I could not ſo readily finde the ſame but by turning ouer a great Volume: now for the readier finding thereof, I haue made this briefe collection of the contents of all the Chapters conteined therein, whereby the ſame may be the more eaſily found, for the better ſatisfying of ſuch, as ſhall haue the like deſire to reade the ſame. And ſo wiſhing the beſt vſe to be made thereof, I bid you Farewell.

The old teacheth by Figures and Ceremonies, that the Lawe was giuen terribly in lightning and thundring, to induce the people to the obſeruance thereof by feare: The new Teſtament came in more gloriouſly, with the gentle name of the Goſpell and good tydings, to enduce men to obſerue it by loue.

               FOr better vnderſtanding of the Contents of this Table, ye ſhall note that the Euangeliſts S. Mathew and S. Luke, haue diuerſly recited the generation of our Sauiour Chriſt, accordgin to the fleſh, and yet tende both to one ende, that is to proue (that according to that which is written of him in the propheſies) he is deſcended of the Royall blood of Dauid, and 
                     ••
                  ghtly ſucceeded him in the Kingdome. So the diuerſitie of the ſaid recitall conſiſteth in this, that S. Mathew ſetteth forth the ſaid generation deſcending from the father to the ſonne, and S. Luke aſcendeth from ſonne to father, which come all to one end. But to ſhewe the agreement of Saint Luke with S. Mathewe, we haue here ſet forth the generation by him deſcribed, deſcending after the order of S. Mathew, to the end that the one may be conferred with the other: furthermore S. Mathew deſcribeth the generation of Ioſeph, though it belong nothing to Ieſus Chriſt, after the fleſh, & S. Luke that of the Virgin Marie: for it was very neceſſarie to recite both, foraſmuch as women were commonly reputed of the line or kinred of their husbands and ſo as well of her husbands ſide as on her owne ofſpring, it is manifeſt that ſhe was of the Royall line of Dauid. 1. Iuda of the line of Nathan engendred Simeon called Ioas, which came to the Royall Seate, becauſe the poſteritie of Salomon failed in Ochoſ

                  Foraſmuch as it ſeemeth that S▪ Luke maketh no mention of the generation of Marie, but rather of Ioſeph, for he vſeth theſe words, that Ieſus was counted the ſonne of Ioſeph, which was of Heli, that is to ſay, the ſonne of Heli: we muſt vnderſtand that in this place the name of ſonne is taken for the name of ſonne in law to Heli, for that he tooke to wife the Virgin Mary daughter to the ſaid Heli, which manner of ſpeech is common in the Scripture: for we find that Noenn calleth Ruth her daughter which was but her ſtep-daughter, her ſonnes wife.
