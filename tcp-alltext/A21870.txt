her subiects vpon most extreme paines, from offending on the Seas: any persons in
their ships or goods, being the subiectes of any Prince, Potentate, or
State, in amitie with her Maiestie.
            
               THe Queenes Maiestie vnderstanding of some generall complaints made against
certeine of her subiects, that haue bene this last Summer on the Spanish
seas, to recouer of the Spaniards recompence for the notable iniuries by
arrests and barbarous cruelties committed in Spaine and Portingall, against
a great number of her subiects, (wherof no remedy could euer be had by order of
iustice) as that they in seeking to recouer the proper goods of the Spaniards,
should there with or by colour thereof, take the ships and goods of diuers subiects
of other Princes and States being in amitie with her Maiestie: Thereupon
her Highnesse, as before time she had alwayes done, commanded not onely her
Councell, but namely such principall officers, as by their office had charge of her Ports, and her high Admirall,
and the officers of all marine causes, to cause the truth of these generall complaints to be heard and examined:
And if they were found true, to see both restitution and full recompence to be made to her frends subiects dam
               
                  ••••
               ed,
and the offendours to be punished as farre foorth as the nature of their offence might deserue. And since
that her Maiesties former commandement giuen, and due restitution made to as many as could be found iustly
grieued, though a great number of the complainants were found to haue had no iust cause of their complaints,
for that colourably many taking vpon them without warrant to be common factors, pretended title to
the goods that were prooued merely Spaniards: her Maiestie did lately vnderstand, that one ship, belonging to
the Uenetians, and one other ship, claimed to belong to some of the subiects of the grand duke of Tuscane, with
which Seignorie and Duke her Maiestie professeth to be in perfect good amitie, and doth repute them as her
most louing frends, should be taken on the seas, vpon the coast of Portingal, and brought into some of her Ports,
in the West part of her realme. Thereupon her Maiestie being inwardly mooued in affection of her amitie to
those States, gaue order to haue these latter causes not onely speedily to be examined, and redressed, if the same
were true, but also did giue commandement, afore examination could be had, in respect the parties complaining
had not then any good proofes of the propertie of the goods, to haue the said vessels preserued with all their
goods and ladings: for which purpose there was choise made of such commissioners nere the Ports as the complainants
did name, whereby may appeare to the world, but specially to the Seignory of Uenice, and the grand
Duke of Tuscan, what regard was had by her Maiestie to shew all fauours to their subiects.
            And for further proofe of her Maiesties honorable & frendly meaning in this case, and of the diligence vsed by
her Councell for the execution of her commandement, it is certeine that the ship of Uenice with her lading
is in safety. So as whatsoeuer can any wise be prooued to belong to the Uenetians, is speedily and without
charge to be deliuered: and the other ship clamed by the Florentines, though in very truth the same is knowen
to be English, and lately taken by Spaniards, is also in safety to be deliuered to the Owners, as by the law shall
be iudged, and the goods also, as farre foorth as they be extant: and such as were afore the complaint made, taken
away, are either to be recouered, or recompence to be made by any that haue therein offended, contrarie to
special order prouided vpon bonds, that no person licenced to go to the seas, should at his returne with any prise,
breake any bulke, before the title to the goods were first examined in the Court of the Admiralty, and proued to
belong to the Spaniard. And for that purpose her Maiesty hath straitly charged, that the offendors in dispersing
any of the said goods of the Florentines, shall be apprehended, seuerely punished, and compelled to make full restitution
to the Owners. And so her Maiestie now commandeth, that whosoeuer shall heereafter breake any
bulke of the goods of any prise, (though the prise be lawfull) before the title thereto be allowed in the Court of
the Admiraltie, such offendour shall be imprisoned, and his ship with the prise also to be forfeited to her Maiesty,
whereby iustice may be done to all persons that haue iust cause of complaint. And like wise her Maiestie declareth
her intention to be, and so commandeth it to be executed, that if any person whatsoeuer, shall vpon the
seas take any ships that doe belong to any subiects of her frends & allies (with whom she is in amitie) and after
knowledge had that the said ships do belong to her frends, doe not forbeare to keepe them, or shall take out of

them any goods belonging to her said frends, the said persons so offending shall be reputed and tried as pirats,
and shall receiue the due punishment for piracy. And to the intent that all persons may vnderstand with what
conditions all persons seruing on the seas against the Spaniard, are licenced: her Maiestie hath commanded
that the very condition of the parties bonds that are licensed, should be annexed to this Proclamation, the
which being duely obserued, as her meaning is it should be, her Maiestie doubteth not but her actions shall be
thought consonant to honour, to iustice, and to the allowance of her frends and allies, leauing the false calumniations
of her enemies, and the auenge of their wilfull disturbance of the common peace of Christendome,
for satisfying of their ambition, to the iudgement of Almightie God, to whose wisdome and power onely belongeth
the chastisement of such as seeke for their owne ambition to confound the state of Christendome with
bloudy warres and depopulations of Christian countries, wherin they haue no interest. Giuen at her Maiesties
manor of Richmond, the third day of February in the three and thirtieth yere of her reigne. 1590.
            
               The forme of the Conditions limitted to be obserued by all such
as are licensed to go to the Seas against the Spaniardes.
               
                  THe condition of this Obligation is such, That where there is Commission of reprisall
graunted vnto A. B. to send to the Seas the good shippe called the P. of B. of the burden of
Tunnes, or thereaboutes, whereof I. N. goeth captaine and master, with men, ordinance,
and victuals sufficient for the same seruice, for the apprehending and taking of the
ships, goods, and marchandises of the king of Spaine, or anie of his subiects, as by the tenor
of the said Commission more at large appeareth: If therefore the said I. N. with the
said shippe the P. of B. and her companie, doe presentlie after their putting to Seas, with all possible speede
repaire to the coasts of Spaine, Portingall, the Ilands, and other remote places where the Spaniards and
Portingals doe most vse their traffique and trade of Marchandises, and doe not attempt any thing against any
of her Maiesties louing subiects, or the subiects of the French king, or of the kings of Scotland, Denmarke,
or any princes of Italie being in league with her Maiestie, the inhabitants of the vnited prouinces of the Low
countries, and Haunce townes, or any other Prince or Potentate being in good league and amitie with her
Maiestie, but onelie against the said king of Spaine and his subiects, and his and their ships, goods and marchandises,
and doe bring, or cause to be brought all such ships, goods and Marchandises as they shall happen
to take and apprehend by vertue of the said Commission, together with two or three of the chiefest persons of
euery ship which they shall take (whereof the Master and Pilot to be two) to some porte of this her Maiesties
Realme of England, as shall be most conuenient for them, and doe not breake bulke, waste, spoyle, sell, embezill,
or diminish any parte or parcell thereof, vntill they shall be adiudged in her Maiesties high court of the Admiraltie
to be good and lawfull prise, and thereupon an Inuentorie to be taken by the viceadmirall of the place
and porte where they shall so ariue, or his deputie, or other publike officers of the same, and an appraisement
be made of the said ships and goods by some six honest men inhabitants of the said port, and that the saide
Inuentorie and appraisement be returned into the said high court of the Admiraltie, within sixe weekes then
next after ensuing: That then &c.
               God saue the Queene.
