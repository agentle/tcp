               LET Fame, that all hunt after in their lyues,
               Liue regiſtred vpon our brazen Tombes,
               And then grace vs, in the diſgrace of death:
               When ſpight of cormorant deuouring Time,
               Then deuour of this preſent breath may buy:
               That honour which ſhall bate his ſythes keene edge,
               And make vs heires of all eternitie.
               Therefore braue Conquerours, for ſo you are,
               That warre agaynſt your owne affections,
               And the hudge armie of the worldes deſires.
               Our late edict ſhall ſtrongly ſtand in force,
               
                  Nauar ſhall be the wonder of the worlde.
               Our Court ſhalbe a lytlle Achademe,
               Still and contemplatyue in lyuing art.
               You three, Berowne, Dumaine, and Longauill,
               
               Haue ſworne for three yeeres tearme, to liue with me:
               My fellow Schollers, and to keepe thoſe ſtatutes
               That are recorded in this ſedule here.
               Your othes are paſt, and now ſubſcribe your names:
               That his owne hand may ſtrike his honour downe,
               That violates the ſmalleſt branch herein,
               If you are armd to do, as ſworne to do,
               Subſcribe to your deepe othes, and keepe it to.

               I am reſolued, tis but a thee yeeres faſt:
               The minde ſhall banquet, though the body pine,
               Fat paunches haue leane pates: and daynty bits
               Make rich the ribbes, but bancrout quite the wits.
            
            
               Dumaine.
               My louing Lord, Dumaine is mortefied,
               The groſſer manner of theſe worldes delyghts:
               He throwes vppon the groſſe worlds baler ſlaues
               
                  To loue, to wealth, to pome▪ I pine and die,
               With all theſe lyuing in Philoſophie▪
               
            
            
               Berowne.
               I can but ſay their proteſtation ouer,
               So much deare Liedge, I haue already ſworne,
               That is, to lyue and ſtudy heere three yeeres.
               But there are other ſtrickt obſeruances:
               As not to ſee a woman in that terme,
               Which I hope well is not enrolled there.
               And one day in a weeke to touch no foode:
               And but one meale on euery day beſide:
               The which I hope is not enrolled there.
               And then to ſleepe but three houres in the nyght,
               And not be ſeene to wincke of all the day.
               When I was wont to thinke no harme all nyght,
               And make a darke nyght too of halfe the day:
               Which I hope well is not enrolled there,
               O theſe are barraine taskes, too hard to keepe,
               Not to ſee Ladyes, ſtudy, faſt, not ſleepe.
            
            
               Ferd.
               Your othe is paſt, to paſſe away from theſe.
            
            
               Berow.
               Let me ſay no my liedge, and yf you pleaſe,
               I onely ſwore to ſtudy with your grace,
               And ſtay heere in your Court for three yeeres ſpace.
            
            
               Longa.
               You ſwore to that Berowne, and to the reſt.
            
            
               Bero.
               By yea and nay ſir, than I ſwore in ieſt.
               What is the ende of ſtudy, let me know?
            
            
               Ferd.
               Why that to know which elſe we ſhould not know.
            
            
               Ber.
               Things hid & 
                     •
                  ard (you meane) from cammon ſenſe.
            
            
               Ferd.
               I, that is ſtudies god-like recompence.
            
            
               Bero.
               Com'on then, I will ſweare to ſtudy ſo,
               To know the thing I am forbid to know:
               As thus, to ſtudy where I well may dine,
               When I to faſt expreſſely am forbid.
               Or ſtudie where to meete ſome Miſtris fine.
               When Miſtreſſes from common ſenſe are hid.
               Or hauing ſworne too hard a keeping oth,
               Studie to breake it, and not breake my troth.
               If ſtudies gaine be thus, and this be ſo,
               Studie knowes that which yet it doth not know,
               
                  Sweare me to this, and I will nere ſay no.
            
            
               Ferd.
               Theſe be the ſtopps that hinder ſtudie quit,
               And traine our intelects to vaine delight.
            
            
               Bero.
               Why? all delightes are vaine, but that moſt vaine
               Which with payne purchaſ'd, doth inherite payne,
               As paynefully to poare vpon a Booke,
               To ſeeke the lyght of trueth, while trueth the whyle
               Doth falſely blinde the eye-ſight of his looke:
               Light ſeeking light, doth light of light beguyle:
               So ere you finde where light in darknes lyes,
               Your light growes darke by looſing of your eyes.
               Studie me how to pleaſe the eye in deede,
               By fixing it vppon a fayrer eye,
               Who dazling ſo, that eye ſhalbe his heed,
               And giue him light that it was blinded by.
               Studie is lyke the heauens glorious Sunne,
               That will not be deepe ſearcht with ſawcie lookes:
               Small haue continuall plodders euer wonne,
               Saue baſe aucthoritie from others Bookes.
               Theſe earthly Godfathers of heauens lights,
               That giue a name to euery fixed Starre,
               Haue no more profite of their ſhyning nights,
               Then thoſe that walke and wot not what they are.
               Too much to know, is to know nought but fame:
               And euery Godfather can giue a name.
            
            
               Ferd.
               How well hees read to reaſon againſt reading.

               The Spring is neare when greene geeſe are a breeding.
            
            
               Duma.
               How followes that?

               In reaſon nothing.

               Something then in rime.
            
            
               Ferd.
               
                  Berowne is like an enuious ſneaping Froſt,
               That bites the firſt borne infants of the Spring.

               Well, ſay I am, why ſhould proude Sommer boaſt,

                  At Chriſtmas I no more deſire a Roſe,
               Then wiſh a Snow in Mayes new fangled ſhowes:
               But like of each thing that in ſeaſon growes.
               So you to ſtudie now it is too late,
               Clymbe ore the houſe to vnlocke the little gate.

               And though I haue for barbariſme ſpoke more

               Yet confident Ile keepe what I haue ſworne,
               And bide the pennance of each three yeeres day.

               Were Louers too, ill to example ill,
               Would from my forehead wipe a periurde note:

               To be ore-hard and taken napping ſo.
            
            
               King.
               Come ſir, you bluſh: as his, your caſe is ſuch.
               You chide at him, offending twice as much.
               You do not loue Maria? Longauile,
               
               Did neuer Sonnet for her ſake compile,
               Nor neuer lay his wreathed armes athwart
               His louing boſome, to keepe downe his hart.
               I haue been cloſely ſhrowded in this buſh,
               And markt you both, and for you both did bluſh.
               I heard your guyltie Rimes, obſerude your faſhion:
               Saw ſighes reeke from you, noted well your paſhion.
               Ay mee ſayes one! O Ioue the other cryes!
               One her haires were Golde, Chriſtal the others eyes.
               You would for Parradiſe breake Fayth and troth,
               And Ioue for your Loue would infringe an oth.
               What will Berowne ſay when that he ſhall heare
               
                  Fayth infringed, which ſuch zeale did ſweare.
               How will he ſcorne, how will he ſpende his wit?
               How will he triumph, leape, and laugh at it?
               For all the wealth that euer I did ſee,
               I would not haue him know ſo much by mee.
            
            
               Bero.
               Now ſtep I foorth to whip hipocriſie.
               Ah good my Leidge, I pray thee pardon mee.
               Good hart, What grace haſt thou thus to reproue
               Theſe Wormes for louing, that art moſt in loue?
               Your eyes do make no couches in your teares.
               There is no certaine Princeſſe that appeares.
               Youle not be periurde, tis a hatefull thing:
               Tuſh, none but Minſtrels like of Sonnetting.
               But are you not a ſhamed? nay, are you not
               All three of you, to be thus much ore' ſhot?
               You found his Moth, the King your Moth did ſee:
               But I a Beame do finde in each of three.
               O what a Scaene of foolrie haue I ſeene,
               Of ſighes, of grones, of ſorrow, and of teene:
               O mee, with what ſtrickt patience haue I ſat,
               To ſee a King transformed to a Gnat.
               To ſee great Hercules whipping a Gigge,
               And profound Sallomon to tune a Iigge.
               And Neſtor play at puſh-pin with the boyes,
               And Crittick Tymon laugh at idle toyes.
               Where lies thy griefe, o tell me good Dumaine?
               
               And gentle Longauill, where lies thy paine?
               And where my Liedges? all about the breſt.
               A Caudle hou!
            
            
               King.
               Too bitter is thy ieſt.
               Are we betrayed thus to thy ouer-view?

               Not you by mee, but I betrayed to you.

               To breake the vow I am ingaged in.
               I am betrayed by keeping companie
               With men like men of inconſtancie.
               When ſhall you ſee mee write a thing in rime?

               And therewithall to winne me, yf you pleaſe,
               Without the which I am not to be won:
               You ſhall this tweluemonth terme from day to day,

               A ieſtes proſperitie lies in the eare,
               Of him that heares it, neuer in the tongue

               Deaft with the clamours of their owne deare grones,

               But if they will not, throw away that ſpirrit,
               And I ſhall finde you emptie of that fault,
               Right ioyfull of your reformation.
