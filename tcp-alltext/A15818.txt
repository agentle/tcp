                  To the Courteous construers of indifferent iudgement.
                  
                     I See a sect, which leane to false reporte,
                     And finde some cause to cauill in disdaine:
                     I wishe they would leaue off that friendlesse sorte,
                     And not triumph in vauntes which are but vaine.
                     Their doubtful doomes delighting in disdaine,
                     Might frustrate be from follie, trust me true,
                     And not with contempt, the simpler sorte to view.
                  
                  
                     To Courteous construers, I doe this commende,
                     Which vvith good vvill, doe vveigh the vvilling mind,
                     Indifferentlie their iudgement to extend,
                     And yeelde reporte according as they finde:
                     And so shall I at no time be behinde
                     To vse my penne, and practise vvith my pate,
                     In vvilling sorte my fancies to relate.

                     With Courtesie their iudgement to inferre.

                     But fauour finde, my indeuour to protect,

                        with such toyes as they be:
                        So (trueth to tell) I must not faine,
                        that we

                        I am as readie as the best
                        to practise such an art.
                        Small practise sure I thinke will serue.
                        for nature hath vs taught:
                        For to forsake that which is good,
                        and take that which is naught.
                        In deede more readie for the worst,
                        then seeke the best to chuse:
                        For nature is an enemie,

                        is much for me to write:

                        For little saide, a smalle amendes
                        will serue to counterpoyse:
                        When too much mischiefe doth arise
                        by talkers tatling noyse.
                        But whist, me thinkes I heere a voyce

                        such were our due desires.
                        And when we had thus past the worst,
                        at length that place we founde:

                        So huge and monstrous of higth

                           I shall declare, the cause is such:
                        I minded was to stray,
                        And like a yongling lost my selfe,

                        Came then vnto my father Ayde,
                        
                        to helpe me at my neede.
                        And to be short, I did declare,
                        vnto him all my minde:

                        Why then quoth Ayde, come on thy way,
                        rise vp and go with me:
                        And I will shewe you a Castel cal'd

                           And were you at the Castel (Sir)
                        the better now apaide:
                        You are as welcome to this place,

                        For I am (Sir) solemnly sworne,
                        this Hold I do maintaine:

                        But Sirs, since that you come from thence

                        And though you are straungers to me,
                        yet what I can procure,
                        You shall commaund vnfainedly

                        Then Ayde and I both gaue him thankes,

                        as he woulde scape offence:
                        To shewe vs what we did Desire
                        
                        within the Houlde to see:
                        And charged him in any wise
                        from vs two not to be.

                        Truely Dilligence delited much,
                        to signifie and tell:
                        To burnish out his Masters praise,
                        it seem'd he lou'd it well.
                        So vp and downe from place to place,
                        by Dilligence directed:
                        He was not slow to shewe vs all,
                        no labour he detracted.
                        But thus in briefe to cut it off,
                        and make relation small:
                        Of any sight that euer I sawe,
                        it passeth most of all.
                        Then Ayde and I, when we had seene
                        enough to please our minde:
                        We asked Dilligence if he could
                        his Master for vs find
                        That we might yeeld him thankes,
                        for this his friendship shewed:
                        And alwaies resting to requite
                        the Courtesie bestowed.
                        Then Dilligence did bring vs both
                        to Gratulation kinde:
                        Who asked vs if we had found,
                        
                           the thing to please our minde.

                        and seene we neuer sawe:

                              An information giuen by Ayde vnto Youth.
                           Quoth Ayde to me, my Youth marke this,
                        in each time, state and season:
                        For to requite where paines are tooke,
                        me thinkes it were good Reason:
                        Shoulde wee depart and nothing giue
                        to Dilligence (O fie)
                        Since he hath taken all the paines
                        to feede and please our eye.
                        
                           
                              Youth.
                           I was forgetfull of the same,
                        of Trueth I must confesse:
                        I thanke you for remembring it
                        my duetie to expresse.
                        So then I called Dilligence,
                        
                        and gaue to him Rewarde:
                        Who gaue vs thankes with open mouth,
                        that easily might be heard.
                        So we departed from this Houlde,
                        
                        and did retyre then backe:
                        Vnto the place from whence we came,
                        
                           where I was in a wracke,
                        And Agonie of pensiue minde,
                        in place where I was lost:
                        And houling lay, with yelling voyce,
                        as one whome fortune tost.
                        Quoth Ayde (my Youth) I found you heere,

                        and then you shall perceaue,

                        Wherfore (O Youthes) marke now a Youth,
                        something to staiednesse bent:
                        Which spyes that romers raunge in ragges:
                        and lurke in deepe lament.
                        Who findes that likely Fortune is,
                        a fond incertaine Dame:
                        Which heapes more hazzardes to the heart,
                        then thought can thinke the same.
                        Who sées the stoute and lustie bloudes,
                        full quyetly abyde:
                        When as the hote and furiouse force,
                        is let out from their side.
                        I not commend the fickle friend,
                        that falles out for a strawe:
                        Nor that will rangle for a Rushe,
                        
                        ne deale so like a dawe.
                        For he that sweares by woundes and bloude,
                        and lookes so like a Bull:
                        When as he comes to doe the seate,
                        his hart is in his skull,
                        And hotest men of many wordes
                        are slewe enough in deedes:
                        And some will fainte that showe good face
                        when but their finger bleedes.
                        And he that doth prouoke so much.
                        the sober man to fight:

                        A prouerbe olde, in Englande here,
                        
                           the still sowe eates the draffe:

                        I must needes now declare a thing.
                        which co

                        Now somewhat of this craftie world
                        I breefly minde to say.
                        For I am priueledged in deede,
                        since Aide hath taken leaue:
                        A litle to disclose my minde,

                        the trueth to vnderstand.
                        The counterfeating crookes to catch,
                        and simple to allure:
                        The faithlesse fond and filthie fraude,
                        that dayly is in vre.
                        When as that one shall come to you,
                        and say he is right sad,
                        And hartely sory in his minde

                        for ill luckes that you had.
                        And by my troth I tell you true,
                        I would I could know how:
                        To helpe you in this your distresse,
                        I make to God a vowe.
                        Another comes professing eke,
                        for to remaine a friend:
                        And neuer to exempt his faith,
                        vntill his dayes do ende.
                        And saith, if I eke in stead may stand,
                        I pray you to be bolde:

                           that trueth doth nere repeate.
                        Not knowing how for to dissemble,
                        not knowing then to liue:
                        But God for his greate mercies sake
                        such filthie factes forgiue.
                        And root the vipers from their vaine,
                        of stinging at vnwares:
                        By whom the simple sillie soule,
                        is caught in doubtfull cares.
                        And thus the Author makes an end,

                        But forced by good will,
                        something for to present:

                           Doth make me waile in woful wise,

                        Then shal I ioy, as now I mourne,
                        that absence makes me rue.
                        But well, I must content
                        my dolefull minde with this:
                        We subiect are to fortunes lore,
                        as certaine true it is.
                        Yet this I doe persuade,
                        that absence hath no force:
                        A faithfull friend, to make vnkinde,

                        will so his friend forget:
                        But will remaine in former will,
                        and be not ouer set,

                        a matter of erection,
                        And though at first it seeme vnlike,

                     Verses vpon this Theame. Silence breaketh many Friendeshippes. Written vnto his friende G. P.
                     
                        IF Silence friendship breake,
                        then silent for to be:
                        Is euen the way to loose a friend,
                        as seemeth vnto me.
                        For when I call'd to minde
                        how longe my pen did rest,
                        From writing to him which deserues,
                        as well as doth the best:

                        That to my friend of all this time

                        For why? I dare not halfe so boldely now aspire,

Thou maist account me more willing then wittie, but iudge vprightly and weigh my wel willing minde with courtesie, and say this I pray thee (in my behalfe) that my meaning was to please and not offend, as he that knoweth thy thought (& mine) doth know it ful wel, & therefore sith I meane well, I pray thee with willing minde receaue it well, so shall I be desirous to endeuour my selfe still dayly more & more to the accōplishment of my well willing minde & earnest determination, such as heartie affection would set more vnto the view, but that skillesnesse doth hold me backe, & shutteth vp the gates of knowledge against me, & will not suffer me to haue aboade within that excellēt place, to the which is due such praise as my tongue hath not vtterance to commēd. But gentle Reader (to be short & knit vp the matter) I pray thee accept it (as it is) and beare an indifferent minde to iudge with modestie & not rashly to condemne me: let me not haue chaffe in steade of corne; that is skornes and mockes for good willes sake: but with a will receaue it well, & if thou well receaue it, my will shall not want to doe thee pleasure, at all times.

                  The Authours Verdict of his Booke.
                  THou little Booke, that thus presumes
                  to raunge in open view:
                  Thou shalt but get to me dispraise,
                  and busie heads renew,
                  To set these wylie wits aworke
                  some foolish faultes to finde:
                  We see it is the worldly course,
                  some thereto giue their minde.
                  I might haue kept thee still at home,
                  but friendes did me require,
                  To giue thee leaue to go abroad,
                  I graunted their desire.
                  And what by that now shall I get,
                  a mocke of some I knowe:
                  It is the state of worldly wightes
                  their floutes for to bestowe.
                  And as the Merchants mart for Coyne:
                  So Momus mockes for spight,
                  Whose Iolting toyes would be disnuld
                  of euerie honest wight.
                  Of trueth my Booke I do beleeue
                  thou shalt not so goe free,

                     Alas how should I pen thy praise,

                     But sooth to say, the flying Fame,
                     
                     that is as swifte as winde,
                     Hath bruted abroade sufficiently
                     of Chastnesse and her kinde.
                     One night Sir Morpheus did me leade,
                     and then vnto me shewed:
                     How Lucrese sate in heauen aboue
                     her seate was there bestowed.
                     And although she her life did end
                     in such a desperate wise:
                     Yet thou maist see she hath a roome,
                     aboue heere in the skies.
                     There saw I eke Zenobia
                     
                     that Gratious Queene so Chaste:
                     Sitting aloft in heauenly Throne
                     
                     which neuer aye shall waste.
                     And Etifriga sometime our Queene
                     in England heere did reigne,
                     I did behold her where she sate,
                     aske Morpheus if I feine.
                     A multitude of Matrons sure
                     was there as I did see:
                     Yet Morpheus tolde not me the names
                     but onely of these three.
                     For why (quoth he) I do not mind
                     to tell thee any more:
                     
                        If thou canst learne their names thy selfe,
                     then keepe them for thy store:
                     And write of them as thou thinkst good,
                     (but what should neede so much)
                     So bustly to take in hand,
                     It would but get thee gruch.
                     I answered him with words most milde.
                     and seemely countenance sure:
                     I thanke you that you would vouchsafe
                     these three to put in vre.
                     And when these wordes I spoken had,
                     sir Morpheus did depart,
                     
                        
                           Morpheus departeth
                        And I awaked from my sleepe,
                     and maruail'd in my heart,
                     What wight he was, and how I came
                     vnto those ioyfull sightes,
                     To view the place and to behold
                     those glorious heauenly wights:
                     And now to tell the full thereof
                     that I in sleepe did see,
                     I will assay with simple skil
                     which resteth now in me.
                     My thought I was thether by him led,
                     since he is God of Dreames:

                     Where I beheld most glorious Dames
                     
                     which shined like the Sunne:
                     For by their Chaste and Vertuous life
                     that heauenly place they wunne.
                     There might I view the Angells face,
                     there might I heare such songes:

                     Which to recouer by no meanes,

                     But Lord it is a world to see,
                     how foolish fickle youth:
                     Accompts the schoole a purgatorie,
                     a place of paine and ruth.

                        For to coniecture with my selfe
                        what voyce should be the same:
                        It answered me as I it heard,
                        I am the flying fame.
                        Which farther said, take pen in hand
                        and proue thy simple skill:
                        To blaze abroad a Matrons life
                        whose minde doth meane no ill.

                        with Godly zeale and grace:
                        
                           Lucrese if she were aliue
                        she could it not deface.
                        No day doth passe this Matrons handes
                        in any idle sporte:
                        She to the Church to serue her God
                        in due time doth resorte.
                        If any wight shall purchase heauen
                        for Godly life well spent:
                        
                           Fame told me that should be she,
                        high Ioue did so assent.
                        
                           And to conclude, if graftes of grace
                        doe growe in any wight:

                        And wishing is the most of all.

                        But wishing is a tickle chaunce,
                        Although we wish yet want we find.

                        How Time hath wrought, by Tract of Time,
                        
                        such things as to the show,
                        Did seeme vnlikely for to be,
                        as verie well I know,
                        For there are some of low degree,
                        and Progenie but base:
                        Are now come vp and set aloft,
                        did not Time do this case?
                        Yes surely beliue me now,
                        for Time can mountaines moue:
                        And Time doth worke much things that séeme,
                        vnlikely for to proue.
                        Within my time I haue ost seene,
                        great things and many straunge:
                        And dayly do still more and more,
                        as Time doth worke a chaunge.
                        
                           For Time will soften flinte so hard,
                        by Time some doe aspyre,
                        To winne the thing to please the minde,
                        and get their heartes desire.
                        And if their hearts Desire be got,
                        thanke hap and Time therefore:

                        that were full high in hap:

                              •
                           
                        
                        is euer nye the whippe.
                        But when too late, you do repent,
                        repentance will not serue:
                        Wherefore foresee, in time I warne,
                        from follie fond to swerue.
                        Take heede I say in time therefore,
                        so shall your state be blest:
                        And I shall cease, to write so much,
                        my pen shall take his rest.
                     
                  
                  
                     A praise of friendshippe.
                     
                        OF all the Iuels vnder heauen,
                        firme friendshipe is the best:
                        Oh happie man, that findes the same,
                        yea twise and double blest.
                        
                           A trustie friend is harde to finde
                        as Sages old doe tell:
                        But flattering friendes attend at hand
                        some profit out to smell.
                        And when for greedinesse of gaine
                        his friend he doth forsake:
                        That friendship is not faithfull fixt,
                        but as the lurking Snake
                        Lies hidden vp in leaues so greene,
                        to sting a man vnwares:
                        Euen so a fauning friend is found
                        to leaue a man in cares.
                        But fa

                        thou dost declare thy kinde:
                        Thou shew'st thy nature and thy moode,
                        and eke thy truthles minde.
                        O faithfull friendship, high in hap
                        thou dost no time Dissemble:
                        Thou swaruest not in time of neede,
                        though foes coulde make thee tremble,
                        Thou standest like a steadie rocke,
                        though friend be link'd in chaines:
                        And if thou maist expulse his thralles
                        thou thinkst it happy paines.
                        And to redresse him of his greeues,
                        and libertie to get:

                        as charge no time can let.
                        Such is a faithfull friend indeed
                              •
                           ,
                        but for a friend by shewes:
                        He is a friend but flatteringly
                        as well his conscience knowes.
                        A faithfull friend is neuer tried
                        till one be neare the brinke:
                        And that his f

                           iend is like to fall,
                        and i
                              •
                            he then doe shrinke:
                        
                           That friend will beare the name no more
                        of faithfull friend I say:
                        But counted as a fleeting friend
                        wherein there is no stay.
                        There are many kindes of frends god knows,
                        more then I can well name:
                        There are friends in words and not in deedes,
                        and friendes that faile with shame.
                        And friendes by former promise true
                        till stone is roulde on necke:
                        And then Godboy, they cannot stay
                              •
                           
                        
                        but feede thee with a becke.
                        Such is the friendship of this world:
                        O Lorde a faithfull friend,
                        Is rare to finde, and daintie sure
                        to haue vnto the end.
                        For faithfull friendes were neuer more
                        in scarcitie then now:
                        Nor neuer harder for to finde,
                        to God I make a vowe.
                        For I my selfe not long a goe,
                        by raunging wise did trie,
                        What seedes were sowne in friēdships groūd,
                        and where the chafte did lye.
                        And as the triall telles the trueth,
                        euen so I haue founde out:
                        To settle thinges within my thought,
                        which I tofore did doubt.
                        For why? that friend that laughes on thee
                        is not a friend in heart:
                        But outwardly he seemes thy friend
                        and inwardly thy smarte.
                        And suckes thee as the lurking Drone
                        which doth beguild the E
                              •
                           e:
                        So he lyes lurking in his den
                        some spite to worke to thee.
                        
                           And yet with 
                              •
                           auning smiling lookes,
                        he laughes vpon thee so:
                        To bleare thy eies, as who should say
                        he cannot be thy foe.
                        But trust him not for his faire lookes,
                        ne for his glosing vaine:
                        But vtterly detest such mates,
                        as flatter, fleare, and faine.
                        The greatest hay that God doth send,
                        is faithfull friendes to haue:
                        Whose constant stay doth not decline,
                        till vitall breath depraue.
                        Alas some kinde of friendes I knowe.
                        when state impouerisht sore:
                        Doe scornefully looke of that hap,
                        and knowe their friendes no more.
                        But faithfull friend
                              •
                           hip doth not vse
                        to fleete and fall away:
                        He saith I am a faithfull friend,
                        and so I meane to stay.
                        He doth not say it so in wordes,
                        but deedes approue it true:
                        A faithfull friend is faithfull still,
                        as we may dayly view.
                        Wherfore of faithfull friendship heere,
                        this little Epigram:
                        By vrgent cause did moue my minde,
                        and so it hether came.
                        And as of it in skillesse wise
                        I some thing here haue saide:
                        So of iust Dealing and Constancie,
                        
                        shal somewhat be displaied.
                        As I doe hope no grudging minde
                        shall murmure at the same:
                        But if they doe, the faults not mine,
                        for those that haunt that game,
                        
                           Constantly leaue, although they know
                        they offer open wrong:
                        Well what of that, the time shall trie
                        their trustie truth ere long.
                        But this I say, who so doth finde
                        a friend that is a friend:
                        Then vse him so as thou maist haue
                        his friendship to the end.
                     
                  
                  
                     A Prayse of Iust Dealing.
                     
                        TO liue in worlde and not deale iust,
                        a heynous faulte it is:
                        A crime which God doth not allowe
                        to come in seate of blisse.
                        For why? to liue Deceiptfully
                        
                        is lothsome in the sight,
                        Of sacred God that on high
                        a Iudge of. Prudent might.
                        Be iust in all thy dealings sure,
                        so shalt thou purchase Fame:
                        And win the p

                           aise of euery wight,
                        as worthie is the same.
                        For dealing iust doth carry laude
                        in thought of honest minde:
                        And lauding iust wilbe allowed,
                        as trueth hath it assign'd.
                        
                           Preace not among Deceiptfull mates
                        thy honest name to loose:
                        Ne leape thou yet in daungerous place
                        least thou thy selfe dost broose.
                        But leape vpright, and swarue thou not
                        ne leane no more then iust:
                        For if thou wrongfully be spied
                        
                           deceiptfully to thrust:
                        
                           Then shalt thou loose thy credit quite
                        not comming in the place:
                        Where as iust dealing doth abide,
                        but rooted out of race.
                        In dealing iust thy doings shall
                        so prosper and vphold:
                        As all the world will lende thee praise,

                        And God will blesse thee in the same,
                        and furtherance thee send:
                        For who so iustly seemes to deale,
                        doth neuer God offend.

                        He takes no bribes for to make good,
                        a matter which is ill.
                        He saith, if bribes that I should take,
                        I do not then deale iust:
                        I do offend my maker sore,
                        of truth confesse I must.
                        I shall be call'd vnto accounte,

                        Who dealeth as we giue desert,

                        Oh how can I excuse my selfe,
                        but fault vpon me take.
                        Thus saith the iust and honest man,
                        thus pondereth he in mind:
                        Thus must it be and thus it is,

                        vniust life none to make.
                        
                           I came not of a scrupulouse kinde,
                        lo thus iust dealing sayes:
                        Although that I derided be,
                        of those that vse that wayes.
                        I do defy them with my hearte,
                        they shall not lodge with me:

                        may vnto thee appeale.
                        And when I shall yelde vp my life,
                        a iust account to make:
                        How that with iustice I haue dealt
                        all briberie to forsake.
                        For doubt we not, our heauenly God
                        hath mercy still in store:
                        And hath aboundance to supply,
                        our want though it were more.
                        But God forbid we should presume,
                        vpon fond hope in vaine:
                        It is the way to purchase hell,
                        remission none to gaine.
                        For he that sinneth still in hope,
                        offendes the holy ghost:
                        And he that doth offend that God,
                        shall vengeance feele with most.
                        
                           For why the sinne against that God,
                        as Scripture doth declare:
                        Is more offenciue then the rest:
                        So Paul doth witnesse beare.
                        Wherefore God graunt we not offend,
                        in no respect with will:
                        But with a hearte vnfaynedly
                        aske pardon for it still.
                        And craue of God, with faithfull hearte,
                        his mercy may vs guyde:
                        That when our life shall yelde to death,
                        we may with him abide.

                        SOme Times a chaunce doth chaunce,
                        by chaunce to please the minde:
                        Some times againe, a chaunce doth chaunce,
                        that no such chaunce we finde.
                        If luckely there chaunce
                        a chaunce to thy delight:
                        Then I am sure that such a chaunce,
                        is ioyfull in thy sight.
                        If contrarie wise a chaunce,
                        do chaunce to bringe thee smart:
                        Then I am sure that such a chaunce,
                        is dolefull to thy heart.
                        Yet must we be content,
                        as well in chaunce of care:
                        As we are pleased in chaunce of mirth,
                        or chaunce that brings no feare.
                        For chaunces haue their chaunce,
                        like chaunces as they be:
                        And chaunce wil chaunce as chaūce doth please,
                        and so much chaunce for me.
                        Who seemes to wrest with chaunce,
                        may chaunce for to repent:
                        That chaunce hath so vnkindly chaunc'd.
                        to chaunce to his lament.
                        Then is it best Perchaunce,
                        
                        to be content with chaunce:

                        But I may vaunte and say,
                        more then I could before:
                        I haue my pleasure but too much,
                        and what doth youth wish more.
                        Some profit eke withall,
                        is matched for her mate:
                        
                           The countinance of cheerefull hue,
                        me thinkes doth blesse by state.
                        The quyetnesse of minde,
                        the fearefull feare excluded:
                        The fond surmyses of my heade,
                        with odiouse othes deluded.
                        So much doth me reioyce,
                        that all thinges past and donne:
                        As to my selfe oft times I say,
                        me thinkes I heauen haue wonne.
                        For those which alwayes haue,
                        beene pent in priuate paine:
                        When as they haue release thereof,
                        they double thinke their gaine.
                        Lo thus I do conclude,
                        in this my skillesse stile:
                        And thanke the Lord whose goodnesse greate,
                        hath holpen my exile.

                        Oh how before we thinke not of that part.

                        Abroad in world to seeke and search
                        where Faithfulnesse doth dwell.
                        What hast thou found him out,
                        and where he keepes his hould?
                        I, He keepes a marrish place,
                        that is both moist and colde.
                        Who bringeth him his foode?
                        firme friendes which neuer fayle:
                        
                           And what is that they bring to him?

                        Why doth he keepe away?

                        were neuer found to faine.
                        
                           Truemeaning cannot glose,
                        ne Faithfulnesse deceaue:

                        Yet God forbid true feare I should exempte:
                        The feare of God before myne eyes to be,
                        If I neglect, I counte it but contempt,
                        A gracelesse gift, from sinne it were not free.
                        But when I saw Fond Feare did me deceaue,
                        
                           Fond Feare farewell, of thee I take my leaue.
                     
                     
                        What lingring lyfe led I with doubtfull dayes,
                        What heauy happes by thee were brought to passe:
                        I feared thee Feare in hope to purchase prayse,
                        But when I saw thy truth like tickle glasse,
                        Then quoth I thus thou shalt not me deceaue,
                        
                           Fond feare farewell, of thee I take my leaue.
                     
                     
                        God graunt to those, with whom Fond Feare will bee,
                        A patient minde to suffer all their Illes:
                        That Hope may helpe, and Comforte let them see:
                        And Time may turne the worlde vnto their willes

                        But I say still, since Feare did me deceaue,
                        
                           Fond Feare farewell, of thee I take my leaue.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the burning of the eares.
                     
                        IF Talles so often told,
                        may moue vs to beleeue,
                        That trueth of force in them doth rest:
                        then let it not me greeue,
                        That I doe credite giue
                        vnto the saying old:
                        Which is, when as the eares doe burn
                              •
                           ,
                        some thing on thee is told.
                        Then trust me now for true,
                        in me it is approu'd:
                        For why, my eares haue burnt so hot
                        as I thereby am mou'd,
                        To write as heare you see,
                        for to foreshew my case:
                        That vnto fables fond and vaine,
                        our nature giueth place.
                        For if the right eare burne,
                        then thus the saying is:
                        No good on thee that time they speake
                              •
                           
                        
                        but sure how true it is,
                        I leaue it for to iudge,
                        to those that knowe the same:
                        For if I intermeddle farre,
                        I shall but purchase blame.
                        Well, when the left eare burnes,
                        then doe they speake thee good:
                        But surely I counte them both
                        a tale of Robin hood.
                        Belieue them who that list:
                        for I will leaue the same,
                        To him which is the righteous Iudge,
                        and Prince of peereles Fame.
