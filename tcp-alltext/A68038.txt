                        •
                     
and how God for his offence, turned his meat into loathſome Toades.
                  To the tune of Lord Darley.
                  
                     IN ſearching famous Chronicles,
                     it was my chance to reade
                     A worthy ſtory ſtrange and true,
                     whereto I tooke good heed,
                     Betwixt a Farmer and his Sonne,
                     this rare example ſtands;
                     Which well may moue the hardeſt hearts
                     to wéepe and wring their hands.
                  
                  
                     The Farmer in the Country dwelt,
                     whoſe ſubſtance had none end;
                     He ſent therefore his eldeſt Sonne,
                     in Paris for to dwell,
                     Where he becauſe a Marchant man,
                     and trafficke great he vſed,
                     So that he was exceeding rich,
                     till he himſelfe abuſed.
                  
                  
                     For hauing now the world at will,
                     his mind was wholly bent:
                     To gaming, wine, and wantonneſſe,
                     till all his goods were ſpent.
                     Yea ſuch exceſſiue riotouſneſſe
                     by him was ſhewed forth,
                     That he was thrée times more in debt,
                     then all his wealth was worth.
                  
                  
                     At length his credit cleane was crackt,
                     and he in Priſon caſt:
                     And euery man againſt him then
                     did ſet his action faſt.
                     There lay he lockt in yrons ſtrong,
                     for euer and for aye,
                     Vnable while his life did laſt,
                     his grieuous debt to pay.
                  
                  
                     And liuing in this carefull caſe,
                     his eyes with teares beſpent:
                     The lewdneſſe of his former life,
                     too late he did repent.
                     And being voide of all reliefe,
                     of helpe and comfort quite;
                     Vnto his Father at tho laſt,
                     he thus began to write.
                  
                  
                     Bow downe a while your héedfull eares,
                     my louing Father deare:
                     And grant A pray in gracious ſort,
                     my pitious plaint to heare.
                     Forgiue the ſoule offences all
                     of thy vnthrifty Sonne:
                     Which through the lewdneſſe of his life,
                     hath now himſelfe vndone.
                  
                  
                     O my good Father, take remorſe
                     on this my extreme need,
                     And ſuccour his diſtdeſſed ſtate,
                     whoſe heart for whe doth bleed.
                     In direfull dungeon here I lye,
                     my feet in fetters faſt:
                     Whom my moſt cruell Creditors
                     in Priſon ſo haue caſt.
                  
                  
                     Let pity therefore pierce your breſt,
                     and mercy moue your minde:
                     And to releaſe my miſery,
                     ſome ſhift, ſwéet Father, find.
                     My chiefeſt chéere is bread full browne,
                     the boords my ſofteſt bed:
                     And flinty ſtones my pillowes ſerue
                     to reſt my troubled head.
                  
                  
                     My garments all are worne to rags,
                     my body ſtarues with cold:
                     And crawling vermine eates my fleſh,
                     moſt grieuous to behold.
                     Deare Father, come therefore with ſpéed
                     and rid me out of thrall:
                     And let me not in Priſon dye,
                     ſith for your helpe I call.
                  
                  
                     The good old man no ſooner had
                     peruſed this written ſcrowle:
                     But trickling teares along his chéekes,
                     from watry eyes did roule.
                     Alas my ſonne, my ſonne, quoth he,
                     in whom I ioyed moſt,
                     Thou ſhall not long in Priſon be,
                     what euer it me coſt.
                  
                  
                     Two hundred heads of well fed beaſts,
                     he changed them for gold:
                     Foure hundred quarters of good Corne,
                     for ſiluer eke he ſold.
                     But all the ſame could not ſuffice,
                     this haynous debt to pay,
                     Till at the length conſtrain'd he was
                     to ſell his Land away.
                  
                  
                     Then was his ſonne releaſed quite,
                     his debt diſcharged cleane:
                     And he likewiſe as well to liue,
                     as he before had béene.
                     Then went his louing Father home,
                     who for to helpe his ſonne,
                     Had ſold his liuing quite away,
                     and eke himſelfe vndone.
                  
                  
                     So that he liued poore and bare,
                     and in ſuch extreme néed,
                     That many times he wanted food,
                     his hungry corps to féed.
                     His ſon meane time in weolth did ſwim,
                     whoſe ſubſtance now was ſuch,
                     That ſure within the City then,
                     few men were found ſo rich.
                  
                  
                     But as his goods did ſtill encreaſe,
                     and riches in did ſlide:
                     So more and more his hardned heart
                     did ſwell in hatefull pride:
                     But it fell out vpon a time,
                     when ten yéeres woe was paſt,
                     Vnto his ſonne he did repaire,
                     for ſome reliefe at laſt.
                  
                  
                     And being come vnto his houſe,
                     in very poore array:
                     It chanced ſo, that with his ſonne
                     great States ſhould dine that day.
                     The poore old man with hat in hand▪
                     
                     did then the Porter pray,
                     To ſhew his ſonne that at the gate
                     his father there did ſtay.

                     IT was an old man which with his poore wife
                     in great diſtreſſe did fall:
                     They were ſo féeble with age God wot,
                     they could not worke at all.
                     A gallant Sonne they had,
                     which liued wealthily:
                     To him they went with full intent,
                     to eaſe their miſery.

                     A hundred miles when they had gone,
                     with many a weary ſtep:
                     At length they ſaw their Sons faire houſe,
                     which made their hearts to leape.
                     They ſate them on the gréene,

                     With that they both replyed,

                     for ſuccour and reliefe. Alack, &c.
                  
                  
                     This is thy Father (gentle Sonne)
                     and I thy louiug Mother:
                     That brought thée vp ſo tenderly,
                     and lou'd thée aboue all other:
                     I bare thée in this wombe,
                     theſe breſts did nouriſh thée:
                     And as it chanſt, I often danſt
                     thée on my tender knée.
                  
                  
                     And humbly now we thée intreat,
                     my deare and louing Sonne:
                     That thou wilt doe for vs in our age,
                     as we for thée haue done.
                     Nay nay, not ſo, he ſaid,
                     your ſute is all in vaine:
                     Tis beſt for you, I tell you true,
                     to get you home againe. Alack, &c.
                  
                  
                     The world is not now as when I was born
                     all things are growne, more deare:
                     My charge of Children likewiſe is great,
                     as plainely doth appeare.
                     The beſt that I can doe,
                     will hardly them maintaine:
                     Therefore I ſay, be packing away,
                     and get you home againe. Alacke, &c.
                  
                  
                     The old man with his hat in his hand,
                     full many a legge did make:
                     The woman wept and wrung her hands,
                     and prayed him for Chriſt his ſake
                     Not ſo to ſend them backe,
                     diſtreſſed and vndone▪
                     
                     But let vs lie in ſome Barne hereby,
                     quoth ſhe, my louing Sonne. Alack, &c.
                  
                  
                     By no meanes would he thereto conſent,
                     but ſent them ſoone away:
                     Quoth he, You know the perill of Law,
                     if long time here you ſtay:
                     The ſtockes and the whipping poaſt
                     will fall vnto your ſhare:
                     Then take you héed, and with all ſpéed,
                     to your Country doe repaire. Alack, &c.
                  
                  
                     Away then went this wofull old man,
                     full ſad in heart and minde:
                     With wéeping teares his wife did lament
                     their Sonne was ſo vnkinde.
                     Thou wicked Childe, quoth they,
                     for this thy cruell déed,
                     The Lord ſend thée as little pitty
                     when thou doſt ſtand in néed.
                     Alack and alas for woe, &c.
                  
                  
                     His children hearing their Father ſet
                     his Parents thus at nought:
                     In ſhort time after to haue his Land,
                     his death by ſubtlety wrought:
                     What cauſe haue we, quoth they,
                     more kindneſſe to expreſſe,
                     Then he vnto his Parents did
                     in their great wretchedneſſe?
                     Alacke and alas for woe, &c.
                  
                  
                     They murthered him in pittifull ſort,
                     they waid not his intreats,
                     The more he pray'd compaſſionatly,
                     the greater were their threats,
                     Speake not to vs, quoth they,
                     for thou the death ſhalt die:
                     And with that word, with dagger & ſw

                     they mangled him monſtrouſly.
                     Alack and alas for woe, &c.
                  
                  
                     When they had got his ſiluer and gold,
                     according to their mind:
                     They buried him in a ſtinking ditch,
                     where no man ſhould him find.
                     But now behold and ſée,
                     Gods vengance on them all:
                     To gaine their gold, their Couſin came,
                     and ſlew them great and ſmall.
                     Alacke and alas for woe.
                  
                  
                     He came among them with a great club
                     in dead time of the night,

                     The murtherer taken was,
                     and ſuffered for the ſame:
