               To reyſe a toure ſo high ſo large and longe
            
            
               For to this day touchynge the great might
               Of this toure which babell men yit call
               Men fro ferre may haue therof a ſight
               It ſurmountith other tours all
               Of which werke thus it is bifall
               Of ſerpentes and many a great dragon
               It is no we callyd cheef habitacion
            
            
               That noman dare as they it ſe
               For wickyd eyre and for corruption
               By a great ſpace and in a grete cuntre
               Aproche nor nere that merueylous dungeon
               So venemous was that manſion
               And ſo orrible that noman dare approche
               Lyke to a mountayn byldyd on a roche
            
            
               And as men ſay that hadde therto repeyre
               This toure atteynith vnto the ſterres clere
               And tranſendeth the region of the eyre
               The ſtones and the ſyment were made of ſuch mater
               And the ioynynge ſo ſtedfaſte and entier
               Though fyre and water both dyd it aſſeyle
               But lytyll or nought their power ſhulde avayle
            
            
               It was made ſo mighty to endure
               So well aſſuryd by diſpoſicion
               That in this worlde no lyuynge creature
               Sawe neuer none lyke in compariſon
               Whoos rerynge vp was cheif occaſion
               And the riches of the maſonrie
               Were thrugh Nembrothe of pryde and ſurquedie
            
            
               Demyd proudly as in his auice
               He tranſcendyd all other in nobleſſe

               Felowe to god as by lykneſſe
               But god that can all worldely pride oppreſſe
               And make princes eclypſen in their glorie
               Suche as truſt in thynges tranſitorie
            
            
               The ſame lorde of his eternall might
               This toure which Nembroth lyſte to edifye
               He made with thondre and levyn light
               Therof to fall a full great partye
               The boiſtous wyndes and the rage ſkye
               And goddes power on that other ſyde
               Bygan thus abate a perrell of his pryde
            
            
               And in diſcente and fallynge of the ſtonys
               Of the werkmen full many a man was dede
               And oppreſſyd their backe broken and bones
               The maſonrye with their blode was rede
               Yit proud Nembrothe that of this werke was hede
               With all thies ſygnes his lorde he lyſt nat knowe
               For which his pompe was after brought ful lowe
            
            
               But in his errour procedith furth of newe
               Thought he wolde gete him ſelf aname
               Of melancoly can chaunge loke and hewe
               And beganne alſo to tempte and atame
               For to encreas and magnify his fame
               A newe toure to edifye ayen
               Lyke as god had ben blynde and nothynge ſeen
            
            
               He wolde haue raught vp to the ſterrys ſeuyn
               By thaſſent of them that can him firſt counſeyle
               Robbyd god and from him raught the he

               But who preſumith the lorde aboue taſſayle
               It were no reaſon that he ſhulde auayle
               Prynces may well ayenſt him cry loude
               But his powere may elipſe with no cloude
            
            
               For in the myddes of his grete empriſes
               This proude Nembroth makynge his maſons
               For to cumpas and caſt their deuiſes
               Geometries in their diuiſions
               But god that hath his aſpeccious
               Seynge thententis of euery erthly man
               As he that is moſte mighty and beſt can

               Their worldly power their dominacion
               Of his vengeable and moſte magnificence
               He can chaſtyce and ouir whelme downe
               The pryde of princes in euery region
               By enſaumple of Nembrothe as ye ſhal here
               Whoſe pompe raught aboue the ſterres clere
            
            
               For whanne his werkmen ſtode at a avantage
               And mooſt were beſy to his intencion
               And byfore that tyme ſpake all one langage
               All ſodenly by tranſmutacion
               There was of tonges made a diuiſion
               That in their wyrkynge as they can obreyde
               No man wiſt what that other ſaide
            
            
               And it is lykly accordynge with reaſon
               So as chaunge was made of their langages
               So of their hertys was made diuiſion
               Bothe of their wyll and of their corages
               And in aſcendynge of their worchynge ſtages

                  More by wiſdome than of armure and of ſtele
                  Stace of thebes can tell you full wele

                  This all and ſum there may be no ſocoure
                  Which brought the people in greate heuyneſſe
                  For Tireſia the greate dyuynour

                  Day and nyght he cryed after deth

                  The cruell conſtrent of his mooſt greuaunce
                  Was that his ſones had him in deſpite

                  For him to ſcorne was ſet all her delite
                  Was neuer none that ſtode in wors plyte
                  For thus liynge and deſtitute of chere
                  Vnto the goddes he made this prayer
               
               
                  Beſechynge theym with a full doolfull chere

                  Eche to brynge other to deſtruction
                  This was his prayer in ſubſtaunce
                  That eche on other may take vengeaunce

                  And finally this vnkyndly debate
                  Brought all thebes to diſtruction
                  zit was there made firſt a conuencion

                  Was none ſo faire fourmyd by nature
                  For of his bewtie he was peerles

                  Sacrifiſis ſolempne he began

                  A lawe was made which that bonde him ſore
                  That if that he bakwarde caſt his loke

                  There may no lawe louers wele conſtreyne
                  So importable is their dedly peyne

                  To lye in priſon it is a full greate charge
                  And to be ſtokked vnder key and lok
                  It well mery a man to goo at large
                  Than with yrons to be nailed to a blok

                     us of rome called Cloellius

                  Was in his tyme notable and glorious
                  And a greate duke full renomed of fame
                  But howe the peple of Equois toke firſt their name
                  Vnder ſupport that no man haue dyſdeyne
                  I wyll the proceſſe declare here in certeyne
               
               
                  Iohn Bochas ſayth there is a nacion
                  Which that firſt were called hunoys
                  And ſecondly alſo by ſucceſſion
                  Of full longe tyme named anathois
                  And olderlaſt men called him Equois
                  Lyke as I trowe myn auctour ſeyth the ſame
                  Of hors mooſt ſwyft they toke firſt the name
               
               
                  And as it is remembred in ſentence
                  By their manhode and famous hardyneſſe
                  Ageyne aliſaundre they made a ſtronge diffence
                  On horſbacke through their greate ſwyiftneſſe
                  Beſide the hyll pleynly to expreſſe
                  Which in Cronycles is called Cancaſus
                  This people of Equois were victorious
               
               
                  To their nobleſſe pleynly as I fynde
                  No thinge in erth was more expedient
                  In their conqueſt of Ethiope and ynde

                  Therby conquerynge all the oryent
                  So greate proweſſe was in their paſſage
                  That Equois brought all Egipt to ſeruage
               
               
                  Thus where euer Equois dyd abyde
                  They gate greate good to their poſſeſſion
                  And Graccus was their gouernoure and guyde

                  Put his brother pryuely in priſon

                  This yonge Cirus as made is mencion

                  Sought his brother called artaxerſes

                  Withoute frenſhip or fauour fraternal
                  That artaxerſes his wounde gan ſo ake
                  Conſtreyned was the feeld to forſake
               
               
                  And Cyrus was than furious as a leon
                  His aduerſaries gan mortaly to wake
                  But fals fortune full of colluſion
                  Vnder feynt ſmylinge a mowe gan him make
                  Which cauſed alas that day that he was take

                  To more encrece of his proſꝑite
                  In true wedlok he had ſonnes thre
               
               
                  The firſt of theym called darius
                  Arabratus named the ſeconde
                  And the thryd named was Othus
                  Manly princys lyke as it is founde
                  And of nature like as the kinge was bounde
                  Vnto darye as it is made mencion
                  Aboue echon he had affeccion
               
               
                  And for he dempt him able to the werre
                  By lyklihede of yerys yonge and grene
                  He caſt fully his nobleſſe to preferre
                  Of hye prudence thus he dyd mene
                  His impotence to ſupporte and ſuſtene
                  For he was feble in ꝑce to regne alone
                  He ſet vp darye with him in his throne
               
               
                  Which was a thinge ſtraunge and contrarious
                  Ageyne the cuſtum of perciens vſaunce
                  But he ſuppoſyd his ſonne darius

                  His faders ꝑty of naturall attendaunce
                  And ſhewe vnto him trouth and kindneſſe
                  His impotence to cheriſſhe of gentylneſſe
               
               
                  But in eſtatys oft it doth thus fall
                  Whan that princes be ronne ferre in age
                  Their childrens loue ageyne theym doth appall
                  Shewynge no frendſhip ſaue for auauntage

                  I finde a while howe he was fortunate
                  In his lecherye ay pompous and elate
                  And in a cyte called cyracuſe

                  Yit as it is put in remembraunce
                  An hundred knightes he had in gouernaunce
               
               
                  Of Centuryen he purchaſed an office
                  And that tyme he toke the ordre of knight
                  After choſyn a tribune of greate pryce
                  And gate greate fauoure in the peple ſight
                  And in this while it fell ſo anone right
                  Of Cyracuſys he was made duke and hede

                  Exiled him oute of their region
                  In his exyle as made is mencion
                  He coude finde no better cheuiſaunce

                  It was ſo wrought by medyacion

                  Ciracuſanis of one entencion
                  Called home ageyne into their toun

                  And in tokne of his diſconfiture
                  Within that temple of golde betyn clere
                  To his deſpyte they henge vp his banere
               
            
            
               Howe Siphax of Munedye kinge was take and dyed in priſon
               
                  HEre bochas breuely for a remembraunce
                  Writeth werres debates and batayles
                  That were that tyme in Itayle and fraunce
                  In ſpayne chaūpayne with marciall apparayles
                  And amonge other in his reherſayles
                  He telleth in affrik the great diſſencion
                  Atwene hanyball and worthy Scipion

                  Vpon their ſtoryes he byde nat but awhile
                  Here nat reherſinge their mighty werrys ſtronge
                  Nor of their ſtryues he doth nat here compyle
                  But doun deſſendynge dyrecteth furth his ſtyle
                  For to reherce and tell by writynge
                  The fall of Siphax in Munedye kinge
               
               
                  This ſaide Siphax batayles had tweyne
                  One with kinge Gabba he of very might
                  Had eke an other in which he dyd his payne
                  To mete maſmiſſa after anon right
                  And both kinges he put to the flight
                  And of Meſſulie I fynde by writinge
                  Howe Maſmiſſa was gouernour and kynge
               
               
                  This ſayd ſiphax thrugh his chiualrye
                  Made Maſmyſſa to fle his region
                  Conſtreynyd him to lyue by robbrye
                  To walke in foreſtys with beſtys vp and doun
                  And for diffaute as made is mencion
                  To ſaue his lyf he fonde no better refute
                  But fed him ſilf on rotys and on frute
               
               
                  
                  Oute of his realme maſmyſſa was enchaſyd
                  And conſtreyned to fle fro his cuntre
                  Fro mynde of folke his name was out raced
                  For no man wyſte where he ſhulde be
                  His liege men and folke of his cyte
                  Through all affryk knewe no better rede
                  Of his perſone but dempt that he was dede
               
               
                  Thus of kynge Siphax encrece gan the glorye
                  Which by force two kinges hath outrayed
                  And vpon them wonne the victorye
                  Put them to flight and the peple affrayed
                  That rome and cartage were of him diſmayed
                  And eche of theym dyd their laboure
                  Of their werrys to make him gouernoure
               
               
                  Vnto Siphax out of rome toun
                  As it is wretyn for a memoriall
                  To Numedye was ſent ſcipion
                  For this mater in eſpeciall
                  Out of cartage was ſent haſtruball
                  And at the caſtell where Siphax lay
                  Both tweyne arryued at one day
               
               
                  And by pleyne writinge as I haue conceyued
                  And as the ſtory remembreth in ſentence
                  At their cūmynge both were receyued
                  Of kinge Shyhax with greate reuerence
                  And through his notable manly diligence
                  As it is wretyn by gode recorde
                  He made theſe capteyns hertely of acorde
               
               
                  That they to gedre lay the ſame night
                  They had of Syphax ſo greate ſuerte
                  By promyſe made as he was true knight
                  That nouther of them ſhulde deceyuyd be
                  But there was founde greate duplycyte
                  Folowynge after who ſo can take hede
                  Lyke as this ſtorye ſhall deuyſe in dede
               
               
                  For by the fraude and falſnes moſte mortall
                  Compaſſed beforn it is thus befall
                  That by the ſleight of this haſtruball
                  As affricans be nye double all
                  Vnder ſuger can hide well their gall
                  So haſtruball by fals decepcion
                  Vnder fayre chere deſceyued Scipion
               
               
                  He brought in ſiphax by fals ſubtylte
                  And by his ſleyght peyntyd fayre langage
                  That he ſhulde with him allyed be
                  By full aſſente to haue in mariage
                  Sophaniſba a maydyn of cartage
                  Which was doughter yonge and faire withall
                  As ſeyth bochas to this haſtruball
               
               
                  The which thinge by craft was brought aboute
                  And accompliſſhed verely in dede
                  And by this mene pleynly out of doute
                  There firſt began rancoure and hatrede
                  Symulacion feynyd and falſhede
                  That atwene ſiphax and haſtruball alas
                  Scipion was diceyued in this cas
               
               
                  And after that done was this mariage
                  Syphax full enmye to this Scipion
                  With haſtruball rode in to cartage
                  And gan werraye agayn rome toun
                  And in this while as made is mencion
                  Kynge maſmyſſa out of wilderneſſe
                  Towarde Scipion in all haſte gan him dreſſe
               
               
                  With his people gan to make him ſtronge
                  Through helpe of ſcipion and of bellius
                  Went ageyne ſyphax and abode nat longe
                  His herte ageyne him was ſo enuyous
                  And on a day the ſtory telleth thus
                  With affricans and folkys of Cartage
                  Siphax the romayns met in the viſage
               
               
                  Of maſmyſſa the peple were ſo wode
                  Vpon Siphax auengyd for to be
                  Through their batayles cam to him there he ſtode
                  And maugre him and his cruelte
                  Of very manhode ſpace was none to fle
                  They brought him home thrugh their hye renoun
                  In to the hondys of worthy Scipion
               
               
                  Siphax was take thus or he was ware
                  Vnder his baner maugre all his might
                  And into rome led afore the chare
                  Of ſcipion the noble worthy knight
                  That wan the triumphe graunted him of right
                  And Siphoniſba afore to Sophax wif
                  Wed to maſmyſſe at the ende of all this ſtrif

                  This Shiphax was ſent out of the toun
                  In cheynes bounde without more taryinge
                  And at tyburny lay fetred in priſon
                  Dyed at miſcheef made ther his endynge
                  And for bycauſe that he was a kinge
                  The romayns made of marciall pyte
                  Him to be buried within their cite
               
            
            
               Howe Nabyn hauyng no title but by tyrannye toke on him to be kinge of macedoyne was ſlayne

                  This macedoyne as by olde writinges
                  Whilom was had in full great reuerence
                  Bycauſe only it floured in two thinges
                  Both in knighthode and ſouereyne ſapience
                  Mars there by manhode Pallas by prudence
                  And while theſe tweyne had gouernaunce
                  Of all welfare they had ſuffiſaunce
               
               
                  And while nobleſſe of theſe thinges tweyne
                  That is to ſey the floure of hye clergye
                  The hye renoun moſte famous and ſouereyne
                  Of marciall proweſſe and of chiualrye
                  Gouerned that londe by newe pollicie
                  Than ſtode that kingdom auctours reherce kōne

                  But at the laſte eclipſed was the light

                  This was cheef cauſe for ſhorte concluſion
                  That the nobleſſe of grece was brought baas
                  And macedoyne brought to confuſion
                  By couetiſe that ſet theym in ſuch caas

                  Of ſuch tyrauntys by ordre reherſinge
                  Nabyn was one that had gouernaunce
                  In macedoyne and was ther crounyd kynge
                  Without tytle there falſly regnynge
                  And for his frowarde contagious cruelte
                  He was behatyd of rome the cyte

                  To ſpoyle the cuntre beſtys to enchace
                  I cheriſſhed them with a benigne face
                  For a ceſon and gaue them liberte
                  By fals rauyne to robbe the cuntre

                  Gladiatores folkys dyd them call
                  For their ſwerdys were with ſteele made fyne
                  For to fight geyn wylde beſtys all
                  As lyons beerys bores wylde ſwyne
                  And the mounteyne where they dyd lyne
                  Called venuſe and through their cruelte

                  Spartharchus was their cheef capteyne
                  Brought vp nought and borne of lowe degre
                  But Claudius a mighty ſtronge romayn
                  Was ſent with power fro rome the cite
                  For to diffende and ſaue the cuntre
                  The hyll beſegynge afore them as he lay
                  He was rebuked bete and dryuen away
               
               
                  Many of them that kept the mounteyne

                  Amonges which was ſlayne a greate capteyne
                  That was felawe vnto Spartharchus
                  As I fynde he hight ynomaus
                  For whoos deth was take ſo great vengeaunce
                  That all the cuntre felt therof greuaunce
               
               
                  They of the mounteyne all of one aſſent

                  Tyll two conſulers fro rome doun
                  The firſt of them called lentulus
                  Both put to flight the ſeid ſpartharchus
               
               
                  Wherof the romayns greatly diſmayed
                  The Senatours of indignacion
                  Both aſſhamed and in them ſilf affrayed
                  Sent one craſſus a great lorde of the toun
                  With the noumbre of a Legion
                  And whan that he on Spartharchus firſt ſet

                  And afterwarde beſyde a great riuere
                  Called Salaire they had a greate batayle
                  Where Spartharchus ſtode in greate daungere
                  For his chere and countenaunce gan fayle
                  Thretty thouſande clad in plate and mayle

                  Without all this as made is mencion
                  Sixty thouſande in the felde lay dede
                  And ſixe thouſand were ſent to priſon
                  The feeld with blode ſteyned and made red
                  And foure thouſande quakynge in their drede

                  And Spartharchus at myſcheef put to flight
