            THE PREFACE.
            
               THere was neuer any thing by the wie of man ſo well deuiſed, or ſo ſurely eſtabliſhed, which (in continuāce of time) hath not been corrupted: as (emong other thinges) it may plainly appere by the common prayers in the Churche, commonly called diuine ſeruice: the firſte originall and grounde whereof, if a manne woulde ſearche out by the auncient fathers, he ſhall finde that theſame was not ordeyned, but of a good purpoſe, and for a great aduauncement of godlines: For they ſo ordred the matter, that all the whole Bible (or the greateſt parte thereof) ſhould be read ouer once in the yeare, intendyng thereby, that the Cleargie, and ſpecially ſuche as were Miniſters of the congregacion, ſhould (by often readyng and meditacion of Gods worde) be ſtirred vp to godlines themſelfes, and be more able alſo to exhorte other by wholſome doctrine, and to confute them that were aduerſaries to the trueth. And further, that the people (by daily hearyng of holy ſcripture read in the Churche) ſhould continuallye profite more and more in the knowlege of God, and bee the more inflamed with the loue of his true religion. But theſe many yeares paſſed, this Godly and decent ordre of the auncient fathers, hath bee ſo altered, broken, and neglected, by planting in vncertein ſtories, Legēdes, Reſpondes, Verſes, vaine repeticions, Commemoracions and Synodalles, that commonly when any boke of the Bible was begon: before three or foure Chapiters were read out, all the reſt were vnread. And in this ſorte, the boke of Eſaie was begon in Aduent, and the booke of Geneſis in Septuageſima: but they were onely begon, and neuer read thorow. After a like ſorte wer other bokes of holy ſcripture vſed. And moreouer, whereas ſ. Paule would haue ſuche language ſpoken to the people in the churche, as they mighte vnderſtande and haue profite by hearyng theſame: the ſeruice in this Church of England (theſe many yeares) hath been read in Latin to the people, whiche they vnderſtoode not, ſo that they haue heard with theyr cares onely: & their hartes, ſpirite and minde, haue not been edified thereby. And furthermore, notwithſtandyng that the auncient fathers had deuided the pſalmes into ſeuen porcions: wherof euery one was called a nocturne: now of late tyme a fewe of them haue been dailye ſayed (and ofte repeated) and the reſt vtterly omitted. Moreouer, the nōbre & hardnes of the rules called the pie, and the manifolde chaunginges of the ſeruice, was the cauſe, yt to turne the boke onlye, was ſo hard and intricate a matter, that many times, there was more buſines to fynd out what ſhould be read, then to read it when it was founde out.
            Theſe inconueniences therfore conſidered: here is ſet furth ſuche an ordre, whereby theſame ſhalbe redreſſed. And for a readines in this matter, here is drawen out a kalendar for that purpoſe, whiche is plaine and eaſy to be vnderſtanded, wherin (ſo muche as maie be) the readyng of holy ſcripture is ſo ſet furthe, that all thynges ſhall bee doen in ordre, without breakyng one piece therof from another. For this cauſe be cut of Anthemes, Reſpondes, Inuitatories, and ſuche like thynges, as did breake

the continuall courſe of the readyng of the ſcripture. Yet becauſe there is no remedy, but that of neceſſitie there muſt be ſome rules: therfore certein rules are here ſet furth, whiche as they be fewe in nōbre: ſo they be plain and eaſy to be vnderſtanded. So yt here you haue an ordre for praier (as touchyng the readyng of holy ſcripture) muche agreable to the mynde & purpoſe of the olde fathers, and a greate deale more profitable and commodious, then that whiche of late was vſed. It is more profitable, becauſe here are left out many thynges, whereof ſome be vntrue, ſome vncertein, ſome vain and ſuperſticious: and is ordeyned nothyng to be read, but the very pure worde of God, the holy ſcriptures, or that whiche is euidently grounded vpon the ſame: and that in ſuche a language & ordre, as is moſte eaſy & plain for the vnderſtandyng, bothe of the readers and hearers. It is alſo more cōmodious, bothe for the ſhortnes thereof, & for the plaines of the ordre, & for that the rules be fewe & eaſy. Furthermore, by this ordre, the curates ſhal nede none other bookes for their publique ſeruice, but this boke & the Bible: by the meanes wherof, the people ſhall not be at ſo great charge for bookes, as in tyme paſt they haue been.
            And where heretofore, there hath been great diuerſitie in ſaying and ſynging in churches within this realme: ſome folowyng Salſbury vſe, ſome Herford vſe, ſome the vſe of Bangor, ſome of Yorke, & ſome of Lincolne: Now from hēcefurth, all the whole realme ſhall haue but one vſe.
            And if any would iudge this waye more painfull, becauſe that all thynges muſt be read vpō the boke, where as before, by the reaſon of ſo often repeticion, they could ſaye many thinges by heart: if thoſe men will waye their labor, with the profite in knowlege, whiche dayely they ſhal obtein by readyng vpon the boke, they will not refuſe the payn, in conſideracion of the greate profite that ſhall enſue therof.
            And forſomuche as nothyng can, almoſte, be ſo plainly ſet furth, but doubtes maie riſe in the vſe & practiſyng of the ſame: to appeaſe all ſuche diuerſitie (if any ariſe) and for the reſolucion of all doubtes, concernyng the maner how to vnderſtande, do, and execute the thynges conteygned in this booke: the parties that ſo doubt, or diuerſly take any thyng, ſhall alwaye reſorte to the Biſhop of the Dioceſe, who by his diſcrecion ſhall take ordre for the quietyng and appeaſyng of the ſame: ſo that the ſame ordre be not contrary to any thyng conteigned in this boke.
            
               ❧Though it be appointed in the afore written preface, that al thinges ſhalbe read and ſonge in the churche, in the Engliſhe tongue, to thende that the congregacion maie be therby edified: yet it is not meante, but when men ſaye Matins and Euenſong priuately, they maye ſaie the ſame in any language that they thē
               ſelues do vnderſtande. Neither that any man ſhalbe bounde to the ſaying of them, but ſuche as from tyme to tyme, in Cathedrall and Collegiate Churches, Pariſhe Churches, and Chapelles to the ſame annexed, ſhall ſerue the congregacion.

               THE TABLE AND
               ❧ Kalender, expreſſing the ordre of the Pſalmes and Leſſons, to be ſayed at Matyns and Euenſong, throughout the yeare, excepte certayne proper feaſtes, as the Rules folowing more plainlye declare.
            
               
               
                  ❧
                  THE ORDRE
                  ❧ how the Pſalter is appoynted to bee redde.
               THe Pſalter ſhalbe red through, once euery Moneth, & becauſe that ſome Monethes be longer then ſome other be: it is thought good, to make thē euen by this meanes.
               To euery Moneth, as concernyng this purpoſe, ſhalbe appointed iuſt .xxx. dayes.
               And becauſe Ianuary and Marche hath one daye, aboue the ſayed nombre, and February whiche is placed betwene them bothe, hath onely .xxviii. daies, February ſhall borowe of either of the Monethes of Ianuary and Marche one daye, and ſo the Pſalter whiche ſhalbe red in Februarye, muſte bee begon the laſte daye of Ianuary, and ended the firſt daye of Marche.
               And whereas Maie, Iuly, Auguſt, October, and December, haue .xxxi. dayes a piece, it is ordred that theſame Pſalmes ſhall bee redde the laſt daye of the ſaied Monethes, whiche were red the daye before: ſo that the Pſalter maye bee begon agayne the firſt daye of the next Monethes enſuing.
               Now to know what Pſalmes ſhalbe red euery daye, looke in the Kalendar the nombre that is appointed for the Pſalmes, and then finde theſame noumbre in this Table, and vpon that noumbre ſhall you ſe, what Pſalmes ſhalbee ſayd at Matyns, and Euenſong.
               And where the .C.xix. Pſalme is deuided into .xxii. porcions, and is ouer long to bee red at one tyme: it is ſo ordred that at one tyme ſhall not bee red aboue .iiii. or .v. of the ſaied porcions, as you ſhall perceiue to bee noted in this Table.
               And here is alſo to be noted, that in this Table, and in al other partes of the ſeruice, where any Pſalmes are appoincted, the nombre is expreſſed after the greate Engliſhe Bible, whiche from the .ix. Pſalme vnto the .C.xlviii. Pſalme (folowyng the diuiſion of the Ebrues) doeth vary in nombres from the comō Latyn tranſlacion.

                  OVRE father whiche arte in heauen; hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heauen. Geue vs this daye our dayly breade. And forgeue vs our treſpaſſes, as we forgeue them that treſpaſſe agaynſt vs. And leade vs not into temptacion. But deliuer vs from euil. Amen.
            
            
               Then lykewyſe he ſhall ſaye.
               O Lorde, open thou my lyppes.
            
            
               Aunſwere.
               And my mouth ſhall ſhewe forth thy prayſe.
            
            
               Prieſt.
               O God, make ſpede to ſaue me.

               Prieſt.
               Glory be to the father, and to the ſonne, & to the holy goſt. As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer ſhall bee worlde without ende. Amen.

               Then ſhalbe ſayed or ſong without any Inuitatory this Pſalme. Venite exultemas. &c in Engliſhe, as foloweth.
               
                  O Come, let vs ſyng vnto the Lorde:Pſal. xc
                        •
                     . let vs hartely reioyce in the ſtrength of our ſaluacion.
               Let vs come before his preſence with thankes geuing: and ſhewe our ſelfe glad in hym with Pſalmes.
               For the Lorde is a great God: and a great kyng about all goddes.
               In his hande are all the corners of the earth: and the ſtrength of the hilles is his alſo.
               
                  The ſea is his, and he made it: and his handes prepared the drye lande.
               O come, let vs worſhip and fall downe: and knele before the Lorde our maker.
               For he is (the Lorde) oure God: and we are the people of his paſture, and the ſhepe of his handes.
               To day, yf ye wyll heare his voyce, harden not youre heartes: as in the prouocacion, and as in the daye of temptacion in the wildernes
               When your fathers tempted me: proued me, and ſawe my workes.
               Fortye yeares longe was I greued with this generacion, and ſayed: it is a people that do erre in their heartes: for they haue not knowne my wayes.
               Vnto whome I ſware in my wrath: that they ſhoulde not enter into my reſt.
               Glory be to the father, and to the ſonne: and to the holy goſt.
               As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer ſhalbe: worlde without ende. Amen.

               ¶ In the feaſtes of Chriſtmas, Thepiphanie, Eaſter, Thaſcencion, Penticoſt, and vpon Trinitie Sonday, ſhall be ſong or ſayed immediately after Benedictus this confeſſion of our chriſtian fayth.
               
                  Quicunque vult. &c.
                  WHoſoeuer will be ſaued: before all thynges it is neceſſary that he holde the Catholyke fayth.
               Whiche fayth, excepte euery one doe kepe holy and vndefiled: without doubte he ſhall peryſhe euerlaſtyngly.
               And the Catholike fayth is this: that we wurſhippe one God in Trinitie, and Trinitie in vnitie.
               Neyther confoundyng the perſones: nor deuydyng the ſubſtaunce.
               For there is one perſon of the father, another of the ſonne: and an other of the holy goſt.
               But the Godhead of the father, of the ſonne, and of the holy goſt, is all one: the glory equall, the maieſtie coeternal.
               Suche as the father is, ſuche is the ſonne: and ſuche is the holy goſt.
               The father vncreate, the ſonne vncreate: and the holy goſt vncreate.
               The father incomprehenſible, the ſonne incomprehenſible: and the holy goſt incomprehenſible.
               The father eternall, the ſonne eternall: and the holy goſt eternall.
               And yet they are not three eternalles: but one eternall.
               As alſo there be not three incomprehenſibles, nor three vncreated: but one vncreated, and one incomprehenſible.
               So lykewyſe, the father is almightie: the ſonne almightie, and the holy goſt almightie.
               And yet are they not three almighties: but one almighty.
               So the father is God, the ſonne God: and the holy goſt God.
               And yet are they not three Gods: but one God.
               So lykewyſe the father is Lorde, the ſonne Lorde: and the holy goſt Lord.
               And yet not three Lordes: but one Lorde.
               For like as we be compelled by the chriſtian veritie: to acknowledge euery perſon by himſelfe to be God and Lorde:
               So are we forbidden by the Catholike religion: to ſaye there be three Gods, or thee Lordes.
               The father is made of none: neither created nor begottē.
               The ſonne is of the father alone: not made nor created,

but begotten.
               The holy goſt is of the father and of the ſonne: neyther made nor created, nor begotten, but proceding.
               So there is one father, not three fathers: one ſonne, not three ſonnes: one holy goſt, not three holy goſtes.
               And in this trinitie, none is afore nor after other: none is greater nor leſſe then other.
               But the whole three perſons: be coeternall together and coequall.
               So that in all thinges, as it is afore ſayed: the vnitie in trinitie, and the trinitie in vnitie, is to be wurſhipped.
               He therfore that will be ſaued: muſt thus thinke of the trinitie.
               Furthermore, it is neceſſarye to euerlaſtyng ſaluacion: that he alſo beleue rightly in the incarnacion of our Lorde Ieſu Chriſte.
               For the right fayth is that we beleue & confeſſe: that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, the ſonne of God, is God and manne.
               God of the ſubſtaunce of the father, begotten before the worldes: and manne of the ſubſtaunce of his mother, borne in the worlde.
               Perfecte God and perfecte manne: of a reaſonable ſoule, and humayne fleſhe ſubſiſting.
               Equall to the father as touchyng his Godhead: and inferior to the father touchyng his manhode.
               Who although he be God and manne: yet he is not two, but one Chriſte.
               One, not by conuerſion of the Godhead into fleſhe: but by takyng of the manhode into God.
               One altogether, not by confuſion of ſubſtaunce: but by vnitie of perſon.
               For as the reſonable ſoule and fleſhe is one manne: So God and man is one Chriſte.
               Who ſuffered for our ſaluacion: deſcended into hell, roſe agayne the thirde daye from the dead.
               He aſcended into heauen, he ſitteth on the righthande of the father, God almightie: from whence he ſhall come to iudge the quicke and dead.
               At whoſe comming all men ſhall ryſe againe with theyr bodyes: and ſhall geue accompte of theyr owne workes.
               
                  And they that haue done good, ſhall goe into lyfe euerlaſting: and they that haue done euill, into euerlaſting fyre.
               This is the Catholyke fayth: whiche excepte a manne beleue faythfully, he cannot be ſaued:
               Glory be to the father, and to the ſonne: and to the holy goſt.
               As it was in the beginnyng, is nowe, and euer ſhalbe: worlde without ende. Amen.

vpon an Aſſe and a colte, the fole of the Aſſe vſed to the yoke. The diſciples went and dyd as Ieſus commaunded them, and brought the Aſſe and the colte, and put on them their clothes, and ſet him theron. And many of the people ſpred their garmentes in the way. Other cut downe braū
                     ches from the trees, and ſtrawed them in the waye. Moreouer the people that wente before, and they that came after cryed, ſaying: Hoſanna to the ſonne of Dauid: Bleſſed is he that commeth in the name of the Lorde: Hoſanna in the higheſt. And when he was come to Ieruſalem, all the citie was moued, ſaying: who is this? And the people ſayed: this is Ieſus the Prophete of Nazareth a citie of Galile. And Ieſus went into the temple of God, and caſt out al them that ſolde and bought in the temple, and ouerthrewe the tables of the money chaungers, and the ſeates of them that ſolde doues, and ſayed vnto them: It is written: My houſe ſhalbe called the houſe of prayer, but ye haue made it a denne of theues.

For this cauſe I wyll prayſe thee among the Gentiles, and ſyng vnto thy name. And agayne he ſayth: reioyce ye Gentiles with his people. And agayne: prayſe the Lord all ye Gentiles, and laude him all ye nacions together. And agayne Eſai ſayth: there ſhalbe the roote of Ieſſe, and he that ſhall riſe to reygne ouer the Gentiles: in him ſhal the Gentiles truſt. The God of hope fyll you with all ioy, and peace in beleuyng, that ye maye be riche in hope, through the power of the holy goſt.

A man clothed in ſofte raymet? beholde, they that weare ſofte clothyng, are in kynges houſes. But what wente ye out for to ſee? a Prophete? verely I ſaye vnto you, and more then a Prophete.

               But as for me, I wyll come into thy houſe, euen vpon the multitude of thy mercy, and in thy feare wyll I wurſhip towarde thy holy temple.

And after they were brought to Babilon, Ieconias begat Salathiell: Salathiell begate Zorobabel: Zorobabel begat Abiud: Abiud begate Eliachim: Eliachim begat Azor: Azor begat Sadoc: Sadoc begat Achin: Achin begat Eliud: Eliud begat Eleaſar: Eleaſar begat Matthan: Matthan begat Iacob: Iacob begat Ioſeph the huſbande of Marie: of whome was borne Ieſus, euen he that is called Chriſte. And ſo all the generacyons from Abrahā to Dauid, are .xiiii. generacions. And from Dauid vnto the captiuitie of Babilon, axe .xiiii. generacions. And from the captiuitie of Babilon vnto Chriſte, are .xiiii. generacions.
                  The birth of Ieſus Chriſte was on thys wyſe: When hys mother Mary was maryed to Ioſeph (beefore they came to dwell together) ſhe was founde with childe by the holy goſte. Then Ioſeph her huſbande (becauſe he was a righteous manne, and woulde not put her to ſhame) was minded prieuely to departe from her. But whyle he thus thought, behold, the Angel of the lord appeared vnto hym in ſlepe, ſaying: Ioſeph, thou ſonne of Dauid, feare not to take vnto thee Mary thy wyfe: for that which is conceiued in her, cummeth of the holye goſte. She ſhall bring furth a ſonne, and thou ſhalt call hys name Ieſus: for he ſhall ſaue his people from theyr ſinnes.
                  All thys was doone, that it mighte be fulfilled whiche was ſpoken of the lorde by the Prophete, ſaying: Beholde, a mayde ſhall bee with chylde, and ſhall brynge foorthe a ſonne, and they ſhall call hys name Emanuell, whiche if a manne interprete, is aſmuche to ſay as God with vs. And Ioſeph aſſone as he awoke out of ſlepe, did as the Angel of the lorde had bidden him: and he toke hys wyfe vnto hym, and knew her not, til ſhe had brought furth her firſt begotten ſonne, and called his name Ieſus.

fayth was rekoned to Abrahā for righteouſnes. How was it then rekoned? when he was in the circumciſion, or when he was in the vncircumciſyon? not in the tyme of circumciſion: but when he was yet vncircumciſed. And he receyued the ſygne of circumciſion, as a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, which he had yet being vncircumciſed: that he ſhould bee the father of all them that beleue, though they bee not circumciſed, that righteouſnes myght be imputed to them alſo: and that he myghte bee the father of circumciſion, not vnto them onely whiche came of the circumciſed, but vnto them alſo that walke in the ſteppes of the fayth that was in our father Abraham before the time of circumciſion. For the promyſe (that he ſhoulde bee the heyre of the worlde) happened not to Abraham, or to his ſeede, through the law, but through the righteouſnes of faythe. For if they, whiche are of the lawe, be heyres, then is fayth but vayne, and the promiſe of none effect.

And when they had ſene it, they publiſhed abroade the ſaying whiche was tolde them of that childe. And all they that heard it wondered at thoſe thinges whiche were tolde them of the ſhepeheardes. But Mary kepte all thoſe ſayinges, and pondered them in her heart. And the ſhepheardes returned, praiſing and lauding God, for all the thynges that they had hearde and ſeene, euen as it was tolde vnto them. And when the eyght daye was come that the childe ſhoulde be circumciſed, hys name was called Ieſus, whiche was named of the Angell before he was conceiued in the woumbe.

For we haue ſeene hys ſtarre in the Eaſt, and are come to wurſhip hym. When Herode the kyng had hearde theſe thynges, he was troubled and all the citie of Ieruſalem with hym. And when he had gathered al the chiefe prieſtes and ſcribes of the people together, he demaunded of them where Chriſte ſhoulde bee borne. And they ſayd vnto hym: at Bethleem in Iurie.
                     
                        
For thus it is written by the Prophete: And thou Bethleem in the land of Iury, art not the leaſte among the prynces of Iuda, for out of thee there ſhall come vnto me the capitaine that ſhal gouerne my people Iſraell. Then Herode (when he had prieuelye called the wiſe men) he inquired of them diligentlye what tyme the ſtarre appeared, and he bad them goe to Bethleem, and ſaid: goe your way thither and ſearche dilygentlye for the chylde. And when ye haue found him, bryng me woorde agayne, that I may come and woorſhip him alſo. whē they had hearde the kyng, they departed: and loe, the ſtarre whiche they ſawe in the Eaſte, wente beefore them tyll it came and ſtoode ouer the place wherein the chylde was. When they ſawe the ſtarre, they were exceading glad and wente into the houſe, and founde the childe with Mary hys mother, and fell downe flat and wurſhypped hym, and opened theyr treaſures and offered vnto hym giftes: Golde, Frankincenſe, and Mirre. And after they were warned of God in ſlepe (that they ſhould not goe agayne to Herode) they returned into theyr owne countrey another way.

And all that heard hym, were aſtonied at his vnderſtanding and anſwers. And when they ſaw hym, they meruailed, and his mother ſayd vnto him: Sonne, why haſte thou thus dealte with vs? Beholde, thy father & I haue ſought thee ſorowing. And he ſayd vnto them: how happened it that ye ſought me? wiſte ye not that I muſte go about my fathers buſines? And they vnderſtode not that ſaying, which he ſpake vnto them. And he went downe with thē, and came to Nazareth, and was obedient vnto them: but his mother kept all theſe ſayinges together in her heart.

Let hym that hath an office waite on his office. Let hym that reacheth, take hede to his doctrine. Let hym that exhorteth, geue attendaunce to his exhortacion. If any man geue, let hym do it with ſinglenes. Let him that ruleth, doe it with diligence. If any man ſhew mercy, let him do it with cherefulnes. Let loue bee with out diſſimulacion. Hate that whiche is euill, and cleaue vnto that whiche is good. Be kynde one to an other with brotherly loue. In geuing honour goe one before an other. Be not ſlothefull in the buſines which ye haue in hād. Be feruēt in the ſpirite. Apply your ſelues to the time. Reioyce in hope. Be pacient in tribulacion. Continue in praier. Diſtribute vnto the neceſſitie of the ſainctes. Be ready to harbour. Bleſſe them whiche perſecute you: bleſſe, I ſay, and curſe not. Be mery with them that are mery: wepe alſo with them that wepe: bee of like affeccion one towardes another. Bee not hie minded, but make youre ſelues equall to them of the lower ſorte.

the mariage. And when the wine fayled, the mother of Ieſus ſaide vnto him: thei haue no wine. Ieſus ſaid vnto her: woman, what haue I to doe with thee? mine houre is not yet come. His mother ſaid vnto the miniſters: whatſoeuer he ſayeth vnto you, do it. And there were ſtandyng there vi. waterpottes of ſtone, after the maner of the purifying of the Iewes, conteyning .ii. or .iii. fyrkyns a peece. Ieſus ſayde vnto them: fill the watter pottes with water. And they filled them vp to the brimme. And he ſaide vnto them: draw out now, and beare vnto the Gouernour of the feaſt. And thei bare it. When the ruler of the feaſt had taſted the water that was turned into wine, and knewe not whence it was (but the miniſters, whiche drewe the water, knewe) he called the bridegrome, and ſayd vnto him: Euerie man at the beginning doth ſet forth good wine, and when men be dronke, then that which is woorſe, but thou haſte kepte the good wine vntill now. This beginning of miracles did Ieſus in Cana of Galile, and ſhewed his glorye, and his diſciples beleued on him.

For ye ſuffre if a man bryng you into bondage: if a man deuour: if a man take: if a man exalt himſelfe: if a man ſmite you on the face. I ſpeake as concernyng rebuke, as though we hadde been weake in this behalfe. Howbeit, wherinſoeuer any man dare be bold (I ſpeake foliſhly) I dare be bold alſo. They are Hebrues, euen ſo am I. They are Iſraelytes, euen ſo am I. They

are the ſeede of Abraham, euen ſo am I. They are the miniſters of Chriſte, (I ſpeake as a foole) I am more: In labours more aboundaunte: In ſtripes aboue meaſure: In priſon more plenteouſly: In death ofte: Of the Iewes fyue tymes receiued I xl. ſtripes ſaue one: Thriſe was I beaten with rods: I was once ſtoned: I ſuffered thriſe ſhip wracke: Night and daye haue I been in the depe ſea. In iorneying often: in parels of waters: in parels of robbers: in ieopardyes of myne owne nacion: in ieopardyes among the heathen: in parels in the citie: in parels in wyldernes: in parels in the ſea: in parels among falſe brethren: in labour and trauayle: in watchynges often: in hunger and thyrſte: in faſtinges often: in cold and nakednes: beſide the thinges whiche outwardly happen vnto me, I am combred dayly, and do care for al congregacions. Who is weake, and I am not weake? who is offended, and I burne not? If I muſte nedes boaſt, I wil boaſt of the thinges that concerne myne infirmities.

                     WHen muche people were gathered together,Luc. viii. & were come to hym out of all cyties, he ſpake by a ſimilytude. The ſower went out to ſowe his ſede: and as he ſowed, ſome fell by the way ſide, and it was troden doune, and the foules of the ayre deuoured it vp. And ſome fell on ſtones, & aſſone as it was ſprong vp, it withered away, becauſe it lacked moiſtnes. And ſome fell among thornes, and the thornes ſprāg vp with it & choked it. And ſome fel on good ground, and ſprang vp and bare fruite an hundreth folde. And as he ſayed theſe thinges, he cryed: he that hath eares to heare, let hym heare. And his diſciples aſked hym, ſaying: what mane
                        •
                      of ſimilitude is this? And he ſayed: vnto you it is geuen to knowe the ſecretes of the kingdome of God: but to other by parables, that whē they ſee, they ſhould not ſee, & when they heare, they ſhould not vnderſtand. The parable is this: The ſede is the worde of God: thoſe that are beſide the way, are they that heare: thē cometh the deuyll and taketh away the worde out of their

heartes, leſte they ſhould beleue and be ſaued. They on the ſtones, are they which when they heare, receiue the worde with ioy: & theſe haue no rootes, which for a while beleue, and in time of temptacion go awaye. And that which fell among thornes, are they which when they haue heard, go furth, and are choked with cares and ryches, and voluptuous lyuyng, and bring furth no fruite. That whiche fell in the good grounde, are they whiche with a pure and good heart, heare the worde and kepe it, and bryng furth fruite through pacience.

                     taines out of their places, and yet haue no loue, I am nothing. And though I beſtowe all my goodes to fede the poore, & though I gaue my body euen that I burned, & yet haue no loue, it profiteth me nothyng. Loue ſuffreth long, & is courteous: loue enuieth not: loue doeth not frowardly, ſwelleth not, dealeth not diſhoneſtly, ſeketh not her owne, is not prouoked to anger, thynketh none euil, reioyſeth not in iniquitie. But reioyſeth in the truth, ſuffereth al thinges, beleueth all thynges, hopeth all thynges, endureth all thinges. Though that prophecying faile, eyther tongues ceaſe, or knowledge vaniſhe awaye, yet loue falleth neuer awaye. For our knowledge is vnperfect, and our propheciyng is vnperfect: But when that which is perfect is come, then that whiche is vnperfect ſhalbe done awaye. When I was a childe, I ſpake as a childe: I vnderſtode as a childe: I imagined as a childe. But aſſone as I was a man, I put awaye childiſhnes. Now we ſee in a glaſſe, euen in a darke ſpeaking: but then ſhall we ſee face to face. Nowe I knowe vnperfectly: but then ſhal I knowe euen as I am knowen. Nowe abydeth fayth, hope, and loue, euen theſe thre: but the chiefe of theſe is loue.

And they ſayd vnto him, that Ieſus of Nazareth paſſed by. And he cryed, ſaying: Ieſu thou ſonne of Dauid, haue mercy on me. And they which went before rebuked him, that he ſhould holde his peace. But he cryed ſo muche the more: thou ſonne of Dauid haue mercye on me. And Ieſus ſtode ſtyll, and commaunded hym to bee brought vnto hym. And when he was come nere, he aſked him, ſaying: what wilt thou that I doe vnto thee? and he ſayd: Lorde, that I may receyue my ſight. And Ieſus ſayd vnto him: receiue thy ſight, thy fayth hath ſaued thee. And immediatly he receyued his ſight, and folowed hym prayſing God.

But he aunſwered her nothyng at all. And hys diſciples came and beſought him, ſaying: ſend her awaye, for ſhe cryeth after vs. But he aunſwered, and ſayd: I am not ſent, but to the loſt ſhepe of the houſe of Iſraell. Then came ſhe & wurſhipped him ſaying: Lord, help me. He anſwered & ſaid: it is not mete to take the childrens

bread, and caſt it to dogges. She anſwered and ſayd: truth Lorde, for the dogges eate of the crummes which fal from theyr maiſters table. Then Ieſus aunſwered, and ſaid vnto her: O woman, great is thy faythe, be it vnto thee, euen as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole euen at the ſame time.

As for fornication & al vnclennes or couetouſnes, let it not bee once named among you, as it becūmeth ſainctes: or filthines, or foliſh talking, or ieſtyng,

whiche are not comely, but rather geuyng of thankes. For this ye knowe, that no whoremonger, eyther vncleane perſone, or couetous perſone (whiche is a wurſhypper of ymages) hath any inheritaunce in the kyngdome of Chriſt and of God. Let no man deceiue you with vayne woordes. For becauſe of ſuch thynges, cummeth the wrath of God vpon the childrē of diſobedience. Be not ye therfore companions of them. Ye were ſumtyme darkenes, but now are ye lighte in the Lord: walke as children of lighte, for the fruite of the ſpirite conſiſteth in all goodnes, and righteouſnes, & truth. Accepte that whiche is pleaſyng vnto the Lorde, and haue no felowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darkenes, but rather rebuke them. For it is a ſhame euen to name thoſe thinges, whiche are done of them in ſecrete: but all thynges when they are brought furth by the light are manifeſt. For whatſoeuer is manifeſte, theſame is lyghte: wherefore he ſayeth: awake thou that ſlepeſt, and ſtande vp from death, and Chriſt ſhall geue thee light.

But ſome of them ſayde: he caſteth out deuils through Beelzebub the chiefe of the deuils. And other tempted hym, and required of hym a ſygne from heauen. But he knowyng theyr thoughtes, ſayd vnto them: Euerye kyngdome deuyded agaynſte it ſelfe, is deſolate: and one houſe doeth fall vpon another. If Sathan alſo bee deuyded agaynſte hymſelfe, howe ſhall hys kyngdome endure? Becauſe ye ſaye that I caſte out deuilles throughe Beelzebub. If I by the helpe of Beelzebub caſt out deuils, by whoſe helpe doe your chyldren caſte them oute? Therefore ſhall they bee youre iudges. But if I with the fynger of God caſt out deuilles, no doubt the kyngdome of God is come vpon you. When a ſtrong manne armed watcheth hys houſe, the thynges that he poſſeſſeth are in peace. But when a ſtrōger then he commeth vpon him, & ouercummeth him, he taketh from him al hys harnes (wherein he truſted) and deuydeth his goodes. He that is not with me, is agaynſte me. And he that gathereth

not with me, ſcattreth abroade. Whē the vncleane ſpirite is gone out of a man, he walketh through drye places, ſeeking reſte. And when he fyndeth none, he ſayth: I wil returne agayne into my houſe whence I came out. And whē he cometh, he findeth it ſwept and garniſhed. Then goeth he and taketh to him .vii. other ſpirites worſe then himſelf: and they enter in & dwel there. And the end of that man is worſe then the beginning. And it fortuned that as he ſpake theſe thinges, a certayne womā of the cumpany lift vp her voyce, and ſaid vnto him: happy is the woumbe that bare thee, & the pappes which gaue thee ſucke. But he ſayd: yea, happie are they that heare the woorde of God, and kepe it.

Yea, and he which was borne of the bondewoman, was borne after the fleſhe: but he whiche was borne of the freewoman, was borne by promes: which thinges are ſpoken by an allegory. For theſe are two teſtamentes, the one from the mount Sina, which gendreth vnto bondage, whiche is Agar: For mount Sina is Agar in Arabia, and bordreth vpon the citie, whiche is nowe called Ieruſalem, and is in bondage with her chyldren. But Ieruſalem, whiche is aboue, is free, whiche is the mother of vs all. For it is written: Reioyce thou barren that beareſte no children: breake furth and crye, thou that trauayleſt not. For the deſolate hath many moe children then ſhe whiche hath an houſbande. Brethren we are after Iſaac the chyldren of promes. But as then he that was borne after the fleſhe, perſecuted him that was borne after the ſpirite: Euē ſo is it nowe. Neuertheleſſe, what ſayeth the ſcripture? put awaye the bonde woman and her ſonne. For the ſonne of the bondewoman ſhall not be heyre with the ſonne of the freewoman: So then brethren, we are not chyldren of the bondewoman, but of the freewoman.

One of hys diſciples (Andrewe, Simon Peters brother) ſayeth vnto hym: There is a lad here which hath fiue barley loaues and two fyſhes: but what are they among ſo manye? And Ieſus ſayd: make the people ſit downe. There was muche graſſe in the place: ſo the menne ſate downe, in number about fiue thouſande. And Ieſus toke the bread, and when he had geuen thankes, he gaue to the Diſciples, and the Diſciples to them that were ſet downe: & lykewiſe of the fiſhes aſmuch as they would. When they had eaten inough, he ſayd vnto his Diſciples: gather vp the broken meate whiche remayneth, that nothyng be loſte. And they gathered it together and fylled .xii. baſkettes with the broken meate of the fyue barley loaues: which broken meate remained vnto thē that had eaten. Then thoſe menne (when they had ſeene the miracle that Ieſus did) ſayd: thys is of a trueth the ſame Prophete that ſhoulde come into the worlde.

Then Iudas, whiche betrayed hym, aunſwered and ſaide. Maiſter, is it I? He ſayd vnto him: thou haſt ſayd.

Peter aunſwered, and ſayd vnto him: though all men be offended becauſe of thee, yet wyll not I be offended. Ieſus ſayde vnto hym: verely I ſaye vnto thee, that in this ſame nighte before the cocke krowe, thou ſhalt denye me thryſe. Peter ſayde vnto him: yea, though I ſhould dye with thee, yet wil I not denye thee, lykewiſe alſo ſayd all the diſciples. Then came Ieſus with them vnto a farme place, (whyche is called Gethſemane) and ſayde vnto the diſciples: Sit ye here, whyle I goe and praye yonder. And he toke with hym Peter and the twoo ſonnes of Zebede, and began to waxe ſorowful and heauie. Then ſayd Ieſus vnto them: My ſoule is heauie euen vnto the death: Tarye ye here and watche with me. And he went a litle farther and fel flat on his face and prayed, ſaying: O my father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſſe from me: neuertheleſſe, not as I wil but as thou wilt: And he came vnto the dyſcyples, and founde them aſlepe, and ſayde vnto Peter: what, coulde ye not watche with me one houre? watche and praye, that ye enter not into temptacion: the ſpirite is willing but the fleſh is weake. He went awaye once agayne and prayed, ſaying. O my father, if this cup may not paſſe away from me except I drincke of it, thy wil be fulfilled: and he came and found them aſlepe againe: for theyr eyes were heauie. And he left them, and went agayne and prayed the thirde tyme, ſaying the ſame wordes. Then commeth he to his dyſcyples, and ſayeth vnto them: Slepe on nowe and take your reſte. Behold, the houre is at hande, and the ſonne of man is betrayed into the handes of ſynners. Ryſe, let vs be going: behold, he is at hand that dothe betray me. Whyle he yet ſpake: loe, Iudas one of the number of the .xii. came, and with hym a greate multitude with ſweordes & ſtaues, ſent from the chiefe prieſtes and elders of the people. But he that betrayed hym, gaue them atoken, ſaying: whomſoeuer I kyſſe, theſame is he, holde him faſt. And furthwith he came to Ieſus, and ſayd: haile Maiſter, and kyſſed him. And Ieſus ſayd vnto him: frende,

wherfore art thou come? Then came they and layd handes on Ieſus, & toke hym. And behold, one of them which were with Ieſus, ſtretched out his hande and drewe his ſweorde, and ſtroke a ſeruaunte of the hye prieſt, & ſmote of hys eare. Then ſayde Ieſus vnto hym: put vp thy ſweorde into the ſheath, for al they that take the ſweord, ſhal periſh with the ſweord. Thynkeſt thou that I cannot nowe pray to my father, & he ſhall geue me, euen nowe, more then .xii. legions of Angels? But how then ſhal the ſcriptures be fulfylled? For thus muſte it be. In that ſame houre ſayd Ieſus to the multitude: Ye be come out as it were to a thefe with ſweordes and ſtaues, for to take me. I ſate dayly with you teaching in the temple. & ye toke me not. But all this is doone that the ſcriptures of the prophetes myght be fulfilled. Then al the diſciples forſoke him and fled. And they toke Ieſus and led hym to Cayphas the hye prieſt, where the Scribes and the Elders were aſſembled. But Peter folowed hym a farre of vnto the hye prieſtes palace: and went in, and ſate with the ſeruauntes to ſee the end. The chiefe prieſtes & the elders & al the counſel, ſought falſe witnes againſt Ieſus (for to put him to death) but found none: yea, when many falſe witneſſes came, yet found they none. At the laſt came .ii. falſe witneſſes, & ſayde: This felowe ſayde: I am able to deſtroye the temple of God, and to build it agayne in .iii. dayes. And the chiefe priſt aroſe, & ſaid vnto him: anſwereſt thou nothing? Why doe theſe beare witnes againſt thee? But Ieſus helde his peace. And the chiefe prieſt anſwered & ſaide vnto him. I charge thee by the liuing God, that thou tell vs, whether thou be Chriſt the ſonne of God. Ieſus ſaid vnto him: thou haſt ſaid. Neuertheleſſe I ſaye vnto you: hereafter ſhall ye ſee the ſōne of man ſitting on the right hande of power, and cummyng in the cloudes of the ſkie. Then the hye prieſt rēt his clothes, ſaying: he hath ſpoken blaſphemie, what nede we of any moe witneſſes? Beholde, now ye haue heard hys blaſphemie: what thynke ye? they aunſwered and ſayde: he is worthy to dye. Then did they ſpit in hys face, & buffeted him with fiſtes. And other ſmote hym on the face with the palme of their handes, ſaying: tel vs thou Chriſt, who is he that ſmote thee? Peter ſate without in the palace, and a damoſell came to hym, ſaying: thou alſo waſte with Ieſus of

Galilee: but he denied before thē al, ſaying: I wot not what thou ſaieſt. When he was gone out into the porche, another wēche ſaw hym, & ſaid vnto them that were there: This felow was alſo with Ieſus of Nazareth. And again he denied with an othe, ſaying: I doe not knowe the man. And after a while came vnto him they that ſtode by, and ſayd vnto Peter: ſuerly thou art euen one of them, for thy ſpeche bewrayeth thee. Then began he to curſe and to ſweare, that he knewe not the man. And immediatlye the cocke krewe. And Peter remembred the woorde of Ieſu, which ſayd vnto hym: before the cocke krowe, thou ſhalt denye me thriſe: and he wēt out and wept bitterly.Mat xxvii. When the mornyng was come, all the chiefe Prieſtes, and the Elders of the people held a counſel againſt Ieſus, to put him to death, & brought him bound and delyuered hym vnto Poncius Pilate the deputie. Then Iudas (which had betrayed hym) ſeeing that he was condemned, repented himſelfe, and brought againe the .xxx. plates of ſiluer to the chiefe prieſtes and elders, ſaying: I haue ſinned, betraying the innocente bloud. And they ſayde: what is that to vs? See thou to that: And he caſt downe the ſiluer plates in the temple, and departed, & went and hanged hymſelfe. And the chiefe prieſtes toke the ſyluer plates, and ſayde: It is not lawfull for to put them into the treaſure, becauſe it is the price of bloude. And they tooke counſel, & bought with them a potters fielde to burye ſtrangers in. Wherfore the fielde is called Haceldama, that is, the fielde of bloud, vntil this daye. Then was fulfilled that whiche was ſpoken by Ieremie the Prophete, ſaying: and they toke .xxx. ſyluer plates, the pryce of hym that was valued whome they bought of the children of Iſrael, and gaue them for the potters fielde, as the Lorde appointed me. Ieſus ſtode before the deputie, and the deputie aſked hym, ſaying: Art thou the kyng of the Iewes? Ieſus ſaid vnto him: thou ſaieſt: And when he was accuſed of the chiefe prieſtes and elders, he aunſwered nothyng. Then ſaid Pilate vnto him: heareſt thou not how many witneſſes they lay againſt thee? And he aunſwered hym to neuer a worde: inſomuche that the deputie marueiled greatly. At that feaſt, the deputie was wont to deliuer vnto the people a priſoner, whome they woulde deſyre. He had then a notable priſoner called

Barrabas. Therfore, when they were gathered together, Pilate ſaid: whether wil ye that I geue loce vnto you, Barrabas, or Ieſus which is called Chriſt? For he knewe that for enuy they had deliuered him. When he was ſet down to geue iudgemēt, his wife ſēt vnto him, ſaying: haue thou nothyng to doe with that iuſt man: For I haue ſuffered many thinges this day in my ſlepe, becauſe of hym. But the chiefe prieſtes and elders perſwaded the people that they ſhoulde aſke Barrabas, & deſtroye Ieſus. The deputie anſwered & ſaid vnto them: whether of the twaine wil ye that I let loce vnto you? They ſayde: Barrabas. Pylate ſayd vnto them: what ſhall I doe then with Ieſus, whyche is called Chriſt? They all ſayd vnto him: let hym be crucifyed. The deputie ſayd: what euill hath he done? But they cryed the more, ſaying: let hym be crucifyed. When Pylate ſawe that he coulde preuayle nothing, but that more buſines was made, he toke water & waſhed hys handes before the people, ſaying: I am innocent of the bloude of this iuſt perſone, ye ſhal ſee. Then anſwered al the people & ſaide: hys bloud be on vs & on our children. Then let he Barrabas loce vnto them, & ſcourged Ieſus, & deliuered hym to be crucifyed. Then the ſouldiers of the deputie toke Ieſus into the common hall, & gathered vnto him al the company: & they ſtripped him, & put on him a purple robe, & platted a croune of thornes, and put it vpon his head, & a reede in his righte hande, & bowed the knee before hym, & mocked hym, ſaying: hayle kyng of the Iewes: & whē they had ſpit vpō him, they toke the reede & ſmote him on the head. And after that they had mocked him, they toke the robe of him agayn, & put his owne raiment on him, & led him away to crucifye him. And as they came out, they foūd a manne of Cirene (named Simon) hym they compelled to beare hys croſſe. And they came vnto the place whyche is called Golgotha, (that is to ſay, a place of dead mens ſculs) & gaue him vineger to drincke mingled with gal. And when he had taſted therof he wolde not drynke. When they had crucified hym, they parted his garmentes, & did caſt lottes: that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the prophet: They parted my garmentes among them, & vpon my veſture did thei caſt lottes. And they ſate & watched him there, & ſet vp ouer his head the cauſe of his death written: This

is Ieſus the kyng of the Iewes. Then were there .ii. theues crucified with him, one on the ryght hande, and an other on the left. They that paſſed by, reuyled hym, waggyng theyr heades, & ſaying: thou that deſtroyedſt the temple of God, & didſt build it in thre daies, ſaue thy ſelfe. If thou be the ſōne of God, come downe from the croſſe. Lykewiſe alſo the high Prieſtes mocking him, with the Scrybes & elders, ſayde: he ſaued other, himſelfe he cannot ſaue. If he be the kyng of Iſraell let him now come down frō the croſſe, & we will beleue hym. He truſted in God, let him deliuer him nowe, if he will haue him, for he ſaid: I am the ſonne of god. The theues alſo which were crucified with him, caſt the ſame in his teeth. From the ſixt houre was there darckenes ouer all the land, vntyl the ninth houre. And about ye ninth houre, Ieſus cryed with a loud voice, ſaying: Ely, Ely, lamaſabathany? that is to ſay: my god, my god, why haſt thou forſakē me? Some of them that ſtode there, when they heard that, ſayd: This man calleth for Helias. And ſtreight way one of them ran & toke a ſpounge, & when he had filled it ful of vineger, he put it on a reede, & gaue him to drinke. Other ſayd: let be, let vs ſee whether Helias wil come & deliuer hym. Ieſus, when he had cryed agayne with a loude voyce, yelded vp the ghoſte. And beholde, the vayle of the temple dyd rente into two partes, frō the top to the botome, and the yearth did quake, and the ſtones rent, and graues did open, and many bodies of ſainctes, whiche ſlept, aroſe and wente out of the graues after hys reſurreccion, and came into the holy cytie and appeared vnto manye. When the Centurion, and they that were with him watching Ieſus, ſawe the yearthquake, and thoſe thinges which happened, they feared greatly, ſaying: Truely, this was the ſonne of God. And manye weomen were there (beholding him a farre of) which folowed Ieſus from Galilee, minyſtryng vnto him: Emong whiche was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Iames and Ioſes, and the mother of Zebedes children.

                     Pſal. lxiii.
                     WHat is he this that commeth from Edom, with red colored clothes of Boſra: (whyche is ſo coſtly cloth) & cummeth in ſo myghtely with all hys ſtrength? I am he that teacheth righteouſneſſe, & am of power to helpe. Wherfore then is thy clothyng red, and thy rayment lyke hys that treadeth in the wyne preſſe? I haue troden the preſſe my ſelfe alone, & of all people there is not one with me. Thus wyll I treade downe myne enemies in my wrath, and ſet my feete vpon them in myne indignacion. And theyr bloud ſhall beſpryng my clothes, and ſo wil I ſtayne al my rayment. For the daye of vengeaunce is aſſigned in my heart, and the yeare when my people ſhal be delyuered is come. I looked about me, and there was no man to ſhewe me any helpe. I merueiled that no man helde me vp. Then I helde me by myne owne arme, and my feruentneſſe ſuſtayned me. And thus wyll I treade downe the people in my wrath, and bathe them in my diſpleaſure, and vpon the yearth wil I lay theyr ſtrength. I wyl declare the goodnes of the Lord, yea and the praiſe of the Lorde for al that he hath geuen vs, for the great good that he hath done for Iſrael: which he hath geuen them of hys owne fauor, & according to the multitude of his louing kindneſſes. For he ſayde: theſe no doubt are my people, and no ſhrynking children, & ſo he was theyr ſauiour. In theyr troubles, he was alſo troubled with them: and the Aungell that went furth from his preſence, deliuered them. Of very loue and kyndenes that he had vnto them, he redemed them. He hath borne them and caried them vp, euer ſence the worlde began: But after they prouoked him to wrath & vexed his holy mynde, he was their enemy & fought againſt them himſelfe. Yet remēbred Iſrael the olde time of Moſes & his people, ſaying: where is he that broughte them from the water of the ſea, with them that fed hys ſhepe? where is he that hath geuen his holy ſpirite among them? he led them by the ryghthand of Moſes, with hys gloryous arme: deuiding the water before them (wherby he gate hym ſelfe an euerlaſtyng name) he led them in the depe, as an horſe is led in the playn, that they ſhould not ſtomble, as a tame beaſt goeth in the fielde: and the breath geuen of God, geueth hym reſte.
                  Thus (O God) haſt thou led thy people, to make thy ſelfe

a gloryous name withall. Looke down then from heauen, and beholde the dwellyng place of thy ſanctuary, & thy glory. How is it that thy gelouſy, thy ſtrength, the multitude of thy mercies and thy louing kindnes, wil not be intreated of vs? yet art thou our father. For Abraham knoweth vs not, neither is Iſraell acquaynted with vs: But thou Lord, art oure father and redemer, and thy name is euerlaſtyng. O Lorde, wherfore haſt thou led vs out of thy way? wherfore haſt thou hardened our heartes, that we feare thee not? Be at one with vs agayne for thy ſeruauntes ſake, and for the generacion of thyne herytage. Thy people haue had but alitle of thy Sanctuary in poſſeſſion, for oure enemies haue troden downe the holy place. And we were thyne from the begynning, when thou waſt not theyr Lorde, for they haue not called vpon thy name.
               
               
                  The Goſpell.
                  
                     AFter two dayes was Eaſter,Mar. xiiii. and the dayes of ſwete bread. And the hye prieſtes and the Scribes ſought how they myght take hym by crafte, and put him to death. But they ſayd: not in the feaſt day, leſt any buſines ariſe among the people. And whē he was at Bethanie in the houſe of Simon the leper, euen as he ſate at meate, there came a woman hauyng an Alabaſter boxe of oyntmente, called Narde, that was pure and coſtlye: and ſhe brake the boxe and powred it on hys heade. And there were ſome that were not contente within themſelues, and ſayde: what neded this waſte of oyntmente? for it myghte haue bene ſolde for more then .ccc. pence, and haue bene geuen vnto the poore. And they grudged againſt her. And Ieſus ſayde: let her alone, why trouble ye her? She hath done a good worke on me: for ye haue poore with you alwaies, & whenſoeuer ye wyll, ye maye do them good: but me haue ye not alwaies. She hath done that ſhe could, ſhe came afore hande to anointe my bodye to the burying. Verely I ſaye vnto you: wherſoeuer thys Goſpell ſhal be preached throughout the whole worlde, thys alſo that ſhe hath doone, ſhalbe rehearſed in remembraunce of her. And Iudas Iſcaryoth, one of the .xii. wente awaye vnto the hye Prieſtes to betraye hym vnto them. When they heard that,

they were glad, & promiſed that they would geue hym money. And he ſought how he might cōueniently betray him. And the firſt day of ſwete bread (when they offered Paſſeouer) hys diſciples ſayd vnto hym: where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayſte eate the paſſeouer? And he ſente foorthe two of hys diſciples, and ſayde vnto them: goe ye vnto the citie, and there ſhal mete you a man bearing a pitcher of water, folowe hym. And whitherſoeuer he goeth in, ſay ye vnto the goodmanne of the houſe, the maiſter ſaith: where is the geaſt chamber, where I ſhall eate Paſſeouer with my diſciples? And he wil ſhewe you a great parlor paued & prepared: there make ready for vs. And his dyſciples went furth, and came into the citie, & found as he had ſayde vnto them: and they made ready the Paſſeouer. And when it was nowe euentide, he came with the xii. And as they ſate at borde and did eate, Ieſus ſaide: verely I ſay vnto you, one of you (that eateth with me) ſhall betray me. And they began to be ſory, & to ſaye to hym one by one: is it I? & an other ſayd: is it I? he aunſwered & ſayd vnto them: it is one of the .xii. euē he that dippeth with me in the platter. The ſonne of man truely goeth as it is written of hym, but woe to that man by whome the ſonne of man is betrayed: Good were it for that man, if he had neuer bene borne. And as they did eate, Ieſus toke bread, & when he had geuen thankes he brake it, and gaue to them, and ſayd: Take, eate, thys is my body. And he toke the cup, and when he had geuen thankes, he toke it to them, and they all dranke of it. And he ſaid vnto thē: This is my bloud of the newe teſtamente, whyche is ſhed for many. Verely I ſaye vnto you: I wil drynke no more of the fruite of the vine, vntyll that day that I drynke it newe in the kyngdome of God. And when they had ſayde grace, they wente oute to mounte Olyuete. And Ieſus ſayeth vnto them: al ye ſhalbe offended becauſe of me, thys nighte. For it is written: I will ſmite the ſhepeheard & the ſhepe ſhalbe ſcatered: but after that I am riſen again, I wil go into Galile before you. Peter ſaid vnto him: & though al men be offēded, yet wil not I. And Ieſus ſaith vnto him: verely, I ſay vnto thee, that this day, euen in this night before ye cocke krow twiſe, thou ſhalt deny me thre times. But he ſpake more vehemētly: no, if I ſhould die with

thee, I wyl not denye thee. Likewiſe alſo ſaid they all. And they came into a place which was named Gethſemany, and he ſayde to hys diſcyples: ſit ye here whyle I goe aſyde and praye. And he taketh with hym Peter, and Iames, & Iohn, and began to waxe abaſhed and to be man agony, and ſaid vnto them. My ſoule is heauy, euen vnto the death: tary ye here and watche. And he went foorth a litle and fell down flat on the grounde, and prayed, that if it were poſſible, the houre might paſſe from hym. And he ſayde: Abba father, al thinges are poſſible vnto thee, take away this cup frō me: neuertheleſſe, not that I wil, but that thou wilte bee doone. And he came and founde them ſleping, and ſayth to Peter: Simon, ſlepeſt thou? Couldeſt not thou watche one houre? watche ye and pray, leſt ye enter into temptacion: the ſpirite truely is ready, but the fleſhe is weake. And agayn he went aſyde and prayed, and ſpake theſame wordes. And he returned and founde them aſlepe agayne, for theyr eyes were heauie, neither wiſte they what to aunſwere hym. And he came the thirde tyme and ſayd vnto them: ſlepe hencefurth and take your eaſe, it is inough. The houre is come: behold, the ſonne of manne is betrayed into the handes of ſynners: Riſe vp, let vs go: Loe, he that betrayeth me is at hād. And immediatly whyle he yet ſpake, commeth Iudas (whyche was one of the .xii.) and with hym a greate nomber of people with ſweordes and ſtaues, from the hye Prieſtes, and Scribes, and Elders. And he that betrayed hym, had geuen them a generall token, ſaying: whoſoeuer I do kyſſe, the ſame is he: take hym, and leade him awaye warely. And aſſoone as he was come, he goeth ſtrayghte waye to him, and ſaieth vnto him: Maiſter, Maiſter, and kiſſed him: and they laied theyr handes on him, and toke hym. And one of them that ſtode by drewe out a ſweorde, and ſmote a ſeruaunte of the hye Prieſte, and cutte of hys eare. And Ieſus aunſwered, and ſayd vnto them: ye be come out as vnto a thefe with ſweordes and ſtaues, for to take me: I was dayelye with you in the temple teachyng, and ye tooke me not: but theſe thynges come to paſſe that the Scryptures ſhoulde bee fulfylled. And they all forſooke hym and ranne awaye. And there folowed hym a certayne young manne clothed in linnen vpon the bare, and the young menne caught hym,

and he left hys linnen garment and fled from them naked. And they led Ieſus awaye to the hygheſt Prieſt of all, and with him came all the hye prieſtes, and the Elders, and the Scribes. And Peter folowed hym a great waye of (euen til he was come into the palace of the hye Prieſt) and he ſate with the ſeruauntes, and warmed hymſelfe at the fyre. And the hye Prieſtes and all the counſell ſoughte for wytneſſe agaynſt Ieſu, to put hym to death, and found none: for many bare falſe witnes agaynſt hym, but theyr witneſſes agreed not together. And there aroſe certayne and broughte falſe witneſſe againſt him, ſaying: we heard him ſaye: I will deſtroy this temple that is made with handes, and within .iii dayes I wyll builde an other made without handes. But yet theyr witneſſes agreed not together. And the hye prieſt ſtode vp among them, and aſked Ieſus, ſaying: anſwereſte thou nothing? Howe is it that theſe beare witneſſe agaynſt thee? But he helde hys peace, and aunſwered nothyng. Agayne the hye prieſt aſked hym, and ſayde vnto him: arte thou Chriſt the ſonne of the bleſſed? And Ieſus ſayd: I am. And ye ſhall ſee the ſonne of man ſitting on the ryght hand of power, and cumming in the cloudes of heauen. Then the hye prieſte rente hys clothes, and ſayde: what nede we any further of witneſſes? ye haue heard blaſphemy, what think ye? And they all condemned hym to be worthye of death. And ſome began to ſpytte at hym, and to couer his face, and to beate hym with fiſtes, & to ſay vnto hym: Areade, and the ſeruauntes buffeted hym on the face. And as Peter was beneth in the palace, there came one of the wēches of the hieſt prieſt, and when ſhe ſaw Peter warming himſelfe, ſhe loked on him, and ſayde: waſt not thou alſo with Ieſus of Nazareth? And he denied, ſaying: I knowe him not, neither wote I what thou ſayeſte. And he went out into the porche, and the cocke krewe. And a damoſell (when ſhe ſaw him) began again to ſay to them that ſtoode by: this is one of thē. And he denyed it againe. And anone after they that ſtoode by, ſayd agayne vnto Peter: ſuerlye thou arte one of them, for thou art of Galyle, & thy ſpeache agreeth therto. But he began to curſe and to ſweare, ſaying: I knowe not thys man of whome ye ſpeake. And againe the Cocke krewe: and Peter remembred the worde that Ieſus had ſayde vnto hym:

before the cocke crow twiſe, thou ſhalt denie me thre times. And he began to wepe.

And the hye Prieſtes accuſed him of manye thinges. So Pylate aſked hym agayne, ſaying: aunſwereſte thou nothyng? Beholde howe manye thynges they laye vnto thy charge.

Ieſus yet aunſwered nothing, ſo that Pylate merueiled. At that feaſt Pylate did deliuer vnto them a prieſoner, whomſoeuer they would deſyre. And there was one that was named Barrabas, which lay bounde with them that made inſurreccion: he had committed murther. And the people called vnto hym, and began to deſyre hym, that he would doe accordyng as he had euer done vnto them. Pylate aunſwered them, ſaying: will ye that I let looce vnto you the kyng of the Iewes? For he knewe that the hye prieſtes had delyuered hym of enuie. But the hye prieſtes moued the people, that he ſhould rather delyuer Barrabas vnto them. Pilate anſwered agayne, and ſayd vnto them: what wyll ye that I then doe vnto him, whome ye call the king of the Iewes? And they cried againe, crucifye him. Pilate ſaid vnto them: what euil hath he done? And they cried the more feruently, crucifye him. And ſo Pylate wylling to content the people, lette looce Barrabas vnto them, and delyuered vp Ieſus (whē he had ſcourged him) for to be crucified. And the ſouldiours led hym awaie into the common hall, and called together the whole multitude, & they clothed him with purple, and they platted a croune of thornes and crouned hym withall, and began to ſalute him: Hayle king of the Iewes. And they ſmote him on the head with a reede, and dyd ſpit vpon hym, and bowed theyr knees and wurſhypped hym. And when they had mocked hym, they toke the purple of him, and put hys owne clothes on hym, and led hym out to crucifye hym. And they compelled one that paſſed by called Symon of Cirene (the father of Alexander and Rufus) whych came out of the fielde, to beare hys croſſe. And they brought hym to a place named Golgotha (which, if a man interprete it, is the place of dead mennes ſculles) and they gaue him to drinke, wine mingled with mirrhe, but he receiued it not. And when they had crucifyed hym, they parted hys garmentes, caſtyng lottes vpon them what euery man ſhoulde take. And it was about the thirde houre, and they crucifyed him. And the title of his cauſe was written: The kyng of the Iewes. And they crucyfyed with hym two theues: the one on hys ryghte hand, and the other on hys left. And the ſcripture was fulfilled, whiche ſaieth: he was counted among the wicked. And they that wente by, railed

on him, wagging their heades, and ſaying: A wretch, thou that deſtroyeſt the temple and buildeſt it agayne in three dayes: ſaue thy ſelfe and come downe frō the croſſe. Lykewyſe alſo mocked him the hye prieſtes among them ſelues with the Scribes, and ſayed: he ſaued other men, himſelfe he cannot ſaue. Let Chriſt the king of Iſraell deſcend now from the croſſe, that we may ſee and beleue. And they that were crucified with him, checked him alſo. And when the ſixt houre was come, darkenes aroſe ouer all the earth, vntill the ninth houre. And at the ninth houre Ieſus cryed with a loude voyce, ſaying: Eloy, Eloy, lamaſabathany? whiche is (if one interprete it) my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? And ſome of them that ſtoode by, when they heard that, ſayed: beholde, he calleth for Helias. And one ranne & fylled a ſponge full of vineger, and put it on a reede, & gaue hym to drincke, ſaying: let hym alone, let vs ſee whether Helias will come and take hym downe. But Ieſus cryed with a loude voice, and gaue vp the goſt. And the vayle of the temple rente in .ii. peces, from the top to the bottom. And when the Centurion (which ſtode before him) ſawe that he ſo cryed, and gaue vp the goſt, he ſayde: truely this man was the ſonne of God. There were alſo women a good waye of, beholdyng hym: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Iames the litle, and of Ioſes, & Mary Salome (whiche alſo when he was in Galile had folowed hym, and miniſtred vnto hym) and many other women, whiche came vp with hym to Ieruſalē. And nowe when the euen was come (becauſe it was the day of preparyng that goeth before the Sabboth) Ioſeph of the citie of Aramathia, a noble counſaylour, whiche alſo loked for the kingdome of God, came and went in boldely vnto Pilate, and begged of him the body of Ieſu. And Pilate merueiled that he was already dead, and called vnto hym the Centurion, and aſked of hym, whether he had been any while dead. And when he knewe the trueth of the Centurion, he gaue the body to Ioſeph. And he bought a linnen clothe, and toke hym downe, and wrapped him in the linnen clothe, and layed him in a ſepulchre that was hewen out of a rocke, and rolled a ſtone before the doore of the ſepulchre. And Mary Magdalene, and Mary Ioſes behelde where he was layde.

                        WHere as is a teſtamēt, there muſt alſo (of neceſſitie) be the death of him that maketh the teſtamēt.Hebr. ix. For the teſtament taketh authoritie when men are dead: for it is yet of no value, as lōg as he that maketh the teſtamēt is a liue, for which cauſe alſo, neyther the firſt teſtament was ordayned without bloud. For when Moſes had declared all the commaū
                        demente to all the people, accordyng to the lawe, he tooke the bloud of calues, and of Goates, with water and purple wolle, and yſope, and ſprinckled both the booke & all the people, ſaying: this is the bloud of the teſtamente, whiche God hath appointed vnto you. Moreouer he ſprinkled the tabernacle with bloud alſo, and all the miniſtring veſſels. And almoſt al thinges are by the lawe, purged with bloud, and without ſheding of bloud is no remiſſion. It is nede then, that the ſimilitudes of heauenly thinges be purified with ſuche thinges: but that the heauenly thinges themſelfes, be purified with better ſacrifices then are thoſe. For Chriſte is not entred into the holy places that are made with handes (whiche are ſimilitudes of true thinges) but is entred into very heauen, for to appeare nowe in the ſight of God for vs: not to offer himſelfe often, as the hye prieſt entreth into the holy place euery yere with ſtraūge bloud: for then muſt he haue often ſuffred ſence the worlde began. But nowe in the end the of the world hath he appeared once, to put ſinne to flight by the offering vp of himſelf. And as it is appointed vnto all men that they ſhall once dye, and then cometh the iudgement: euen ſo Chriſt was once offered to take away the ſinnes of many, and vnto them that looke for him, ſhall he appeare agayne without ſynne, vnto ſaluacion.

                        THe feaſt of ſwete bread drewe nye, whiche is called Eaſter, and the hye prieſtes & Scribes ſought howe they might kill hym, for they feared the people.

Then entred Sathā into Iudas whoſe ſirname was Iſcarioth (whiche was of the numbre of the .xij.) and he went his waye and commoned with the hye prieſtes and officers, howe he might betray hym vnto them. And they were glad, and promiſed to geue hym money. And he conſented, and ſought oportunitie to betraye hym vnto them, whē the people were away. Then came the daye of ſwete breade, when of neceſſitie paſſeouer muſt be offred. And he ſent Peter and Iohn, ſaying: goe & prepare vs the paſſeouer, that we may eate. They ſayed vnto him: where wylt thou that we prepare? And he ſayed vnto them: beholde, when ye entre into the citie, there ſhall a manne meete you bearing a pitcher of water, him folowe into theſame houſe that he entreth in, and ye ſhall ſaye vnto the good man of the houſe: the maiſter ſayeth vnto thee: where is the geaſt chambre where I ſhall eate the paſſeouer with my diſciples? And he ſhall ſhewe you a great parlour paued: there make ready. And they wente and founde as he had ſayed vnto them, and they made ready the paſſeouer. And when the houre was come, he ſate downe, and the .xij. Apoſtles with him. And he ſayd vnto them: I haue inwardly deſyred to eate this paſſeouer with you, before that I ſuffre.
                     For I ſaye vnto you: henceforth I will not eate of it any more, vntill it be fulfilled in the kingdome of God. And he tooke the cup, and gaue thankes, and ſayd: Take this, and deuide it among you. For I ſay vnto you: I will not drinke of the fruite of the vine, vntill the kingdome of God come. And he toke bread, & when he had geuē thankes, he brake it, and gaue vnto them, ſaying: This is my body, which is geuen for you: This do in the remembraunce of me. Lykewyſe alſo when he had ſupped, he tooke the cuppe, ſaying: This cup is the newe teſtamente in my bloude, whiche is ſhed for you. Yet beholde, the hande of him that betrayeth me, is with me on the table. And truly the ſonne of manne goeth as it is appointed: but woe vnto that manne, by whom he is betrayed. And they began to enquire among themſelues, whiche of them it was that ſhould do it. And there was a ſtriefe among them, whiche of them ſhoulde ſeme to be greateſt. And he ſayde vnto them: the kinges of nacions reigne ouer them, & they that haue authoritie vpon them, are called gracious Lordes: but ye ſhall not be ſo.

But he that is greateſt among you, ſhalbe as the yonger, and he that is chiefe, ſhalbe as he that doth miniſter. For whether is greater he that ſitteth at meate, or he that ſerueth? Is not he that ſitteth at meate? But I am among you, as he that miniſtreth, Ye are they which haue bydden with me in my temptacions. And I appointed vnto you a kyngdome, as my father hath appointed to me, that ye may eate and drinke at my table in my kingdome, and ſit on ſeates, iudgeyng the .xii. tribes of Iſrael. And the Lorde ſayd: Simon, Simon behold, Sathan hath deſired to ſift you, as it were wheat: But I haue prayed for thee, that thy fayth fayle not. And whē thou art conuerted, ſtrength thy brethren. And he ſayd vnto hym: Lorde I am ready to go with thee into prieſon, and to death. And he ſayd: I tell thee Peter, the Cocke ſhall not krowe this daye, tyll thou haue thriſe denied that thou knoweſt me. And he ſayde vnto them: when I ſēt you without wallet, and ſcrip, and ſhoes, lacked ye any thing? And they ſayd, no. Then ſayd he vnto them: but now he that hath a wallet, let hym take it vp, and likewiſe his ſcrip. And he that hath no ſweord, let hym ſell his coate and bye one. For I ſay vnto you, that yet theſame which is written, muſt be perfourmed in me: euen among the wicked was he reputed: For thoſe thynges whiche are written of me haue an ende. And they ſayed: Lord, behold, here are .ii. ſwordes: and he ſayd vnto them: it is ynough. And he came out, and wēt (as he was wont) to Mount Oliuete. And the diſciples folowed hym. And when he came to the place, he ſayde vnto them: pray, leſte ye fall into temptacion. And he gate hymſelfe from them about a ſtones caſt, and kneled downe and prayed, ſaying: Father, yf thou wilt, remoue this cup from me: Neuertheleſſe, not my will, but thyne be fulfilled. And there appeared an Aungel vnto him from heauen, coumfortyng hym. And he was in an agony and prayed the longer: and hys ſweate was lyke droppes of bloud, tricklyng downe to the ground. And whē he aroſe from prayer, and was come to his diſciples, he founde them ſlepyng for heauineſſe, and he ſayed vnto them: why ſlepe ye? Ryſe and praye, leſte ye fall into temptacion. Whyle he yet ſpake, behold, there came a companye, and he that was called Iudas, one of the .xii.

went before thē, and preaſed nye vnto Ieſus, to kiſſe hym. But Ieſus ſayd vnto him: Iudas, betrayeſt thou the ſōne of man with a kiſſe? When they whiche were about hym ſawe what would folow, they ſayde vnto him: Lord, ſhall we ſmyte with the ſweorde? And one of them ſmote a ſeruaunt of the hye prieſt, and ſtroke of his ryght eare. Ieſus aunſwered and ſayd: ſuffre ye thus farre forth. And when he touched his eare, he healed hym. Then Ieſus ſayd vnto the hye prieſtes, and rulers of the temple, and the elders, whiche were come to him: Ye be come out as vnto a thefe, weth ſwordes and ſtaues. When I was dayly with you in the temple, ye ſtretched forth no handes againſte me: but this is euen your very houre, and the power of darkenes. Then toke they hym & led hym, & brought him to the hye prieſtes houſe. But Peter folowed a farre of. And when they had kindled a fyer in the middes of the palace, and were ſette downe together: Peter alſo ſate downe among them. But when one of the wenches behelde hym, as he ſate by the fyer (and loked vpon him) ſhe ſayed: this ſame felow was alſo with him. And he denied him, ſaying: woman, I knowe hym not. And after a lytle whyle, another ſaw him, and ſayd: thou art alſo of them. And Peter ſayd: man, I am not. And about the ſpace of an houre after, an other affirmed, ſaying: verely, this felowe was with hym alſo, for he is of Galile. And Peter ſayed: man, I wot not what thou ſayeſt. And immediately whyle he yet ſpake, the Cocke krewe. And the Lorde turned backe and loked vpon Peter. And Peter remembred the worde of the Lord, howe he had ſayed vnto him: before the Cocke krowe, thou ſhalt deny me thriſe: and Peter went out and wept bitterly. And the men that tooke Ieſus mocked hym, and ſmote hym: and when they had blindfolded him, they ſtroke hym on the face, and aſked hym, ſaying: Areade, who is it that ſmote thee? And many other thynges deſpitefully ſayde they agaynſt hym. And aſſone as it was daye, the Elders of the people, and the hye prieſtes and Scribes, came together, and led hym into theyr counſell, ſaying: Art thou very Chriſte? tell vs. And he ſayed vnto them: yf I tell you ye will not beleue me, and yf I aſke you, you will not aunſwere me, nor let me goe: hereafter ſhall the ſonne of man ſit on the right hande of the power of God.

Then ſayed they all: Art thou then the ſonne of God? he ſayde: Ye ſaye that I am. And they ſayed: what nede we of any further witnes? for we oure ſelues haue heard of his owne mouth.

                        THis I warne you of, and commende not, that ye come not together after a better maner, but after a worſe. For firſt of all, whē ye come together in the congregaciō, I heare that there is diſcencion among you, and I partly beleue it. For there muſt be ſectes among you, that they whiche are perfect amōg you, may be knowen. When ye come together therfore into one place, the Lordes ſupper cannot bee eaten, for euery man beginneth afore to eate his owne ſupper. And one is hungry, & another is dronken. Haue ye not houſes to eate and drynke in? deſpiſe ye the congregacion of God, and ſhame them that haue not? what ſhall I ſaye vnto you? ſhall I prayſe you? In this I prayſe you not. That whiche I deliuered vnto you, I receyued of the Lorde. For the Lorde Ieſus, theſame night in whiche he was betrayed, tooke bread: and when he had geuen thankes, he brake it, & ſayd: Take ye & eate, this is my body, whiche is broken for you. This doe ye in the remembraunce of me. After theſame maner alſo, he toke the cup when ſupper was done, ſaying: this cup is the newe teſtament in my bloud. This dooe, as oft as ye drinke it, in remembraunce of me. For as often as ye ſhall eate this bread, and drinke this cuppe, ye ſhall ſhewe the Lordes death tyll he come. Wherfore, whoſoeuer ſhall eate of this bread, or drinke of the cuppe of the Lorde vnworthely, ſhalbe giltie of the bodye and bloud of the Lorde. But let a man examin himſelfe, and ſo let hym eate of the bread, and drinke of the cup. For he that eateth and drynketh vnworthely, eateth and drinketh his owne damnacion, becauſe he maketh no difference of the Lordes

body. For this cauſe many are weake & ſicke among you, and many ſlepe. For if we had iudged our ſelfes: we ſhould not haue been iudged. But when we are iudged of the Lorde, we are chaſtened, that we ſhould not be damned with the worlde. Wherfore my brethren, when ye come together to eate, tary one for an other: If any man hongre, let him eate at home, that ye come not together vnto condemnacion. Other thynges will I ſet in ordre when I come.

                        THe whole multitude of them aroſe, and led hym vnto Pylate. And they began to accuſe hym,Luc. xxiii. ſaying: we found this felowe peruertyng the people, and forbyddyng to paye tribute to Ceſar: ſaying that he is Chriſt a king. And Pilate appoſed him, ſaying: art thou the king of the Iewes? he anſwered hym & ſayed: thou ſayeſt it. Then ſayed Pilate to the hye prieſtes and to the people: I fynd no faut in this man. And they were the more fierce, ſaying: he moueth the people, teaching throughout all Iury, and began at Galile, euen to this place. Whē Pilate heard mencion of Galile, he aſked whether the man were of Galile. And aſſone as he knewe that he belonged vnto Herodes iuriſdiccion, he ſente hym to Herode, whiche was alſo at Ieruſalē at that time. And when Herode ſaw Ieſus, he was excedyng glad, for he was deſyrous to ſee him of a long ſeaſon, becauſe he had heard many thynges of him, & he truſted to haue ſeen ſome miracle done by hym. Then he queſtioned with hym many wordes. But he anſwered him nothing. The hye prieſtes and Scribes ſtode furth & accuſed him ſtraightly. And Herode with his men of warre, deſpiſed him. And when he had mocked hym, he arayed hym in whyte clothing, and ſent hym again to Pylate. And theſame daye Pylate and Herode were made frendes together. For before they were at variaunce. And Pylate called together the hye prieſtes, and the rulers, and the people, and ſayd vnto them: ye haue brought this man vnto me, as one that peruerteth the people: and behold, I examine hym before you, and finde no faute in this man of thoſe thynges wherof ye accuſe hym, no nor yet Herode: For I ſent you vnto him, and loe, nothing worthy of death

is done vnto him: I will therfore chaſten hym, and let hym looce. For of neceſſitie he muſt haue let one looce vnto them at that feaſt. And all the people cryed atonce, ſaying: awaye with him, and deliuer vs Barrabas: (whiche for acertayne inſurreccion made in the citie, and for a murther, was caſt in priſon.) Pilate ſpake againe vnto thē, willing to let Ieſus looce. But they cryed, ſaying: crucifye hym, crucifye him. He ſayed vnto them the thirde time: what euill hat he done? I finde no cauſe of death in hym: I wyll therfore chaſten him, and let hym go. And they cryed with loude voyces, requiring that he myght be crucified. And the voyces of them and of the hye prieſtes preuayled. And Pilate gaue ſentence that it ſhould be as they required, and he let looce vnto them him that (for inſurreccion and murther) was caſt into priſon, whom they had deſired: & he deliuered to them Ieſus, to do with hym what they would. And as they led hym awaye, they caught one Symon of Ciren comming out of the field: and on him layde they the croſſe, that he myght beare it after Ieſus. And there folowed him a great company of people, and of women, which bewailed and lamented him. But Ieſus turned backe vnto them, and ſayed: ye daughters of Ieruſalem, wepe not for me: but wepe for your ſelfes and for your children. For behold, the dayes will come, in the whiche they ſhall ſaye: Happy are the baren, & the woumbes that neuer bare, and the pappes whiche neuer gaue ſucke. Then ſhall they begyn to ſay to the mountaynes, fall on vs: and to the hylles, couer vs. For if they do this in a grene tree, what ſhall be done in the dry? And there were two euill doers led with him to be ſlaine. And after that thei were come to the place (whiche is called Caluarie) there they crucified hym and the euill doers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. Then ſayd Ieſus: father forgeue them, for they wote not what they do. And they parted his rayment and caſt lottes. And the people ſtoode and behelde. And the rulers mocked hym with them, ſaying: he ſaued other men, lette hym ſaue himſelfe yf he be very Chriſte the choſen of God. The ſouldiers alſo mocked hym, and came and offred hym vinegre, and ſayd: if thou be the kyng of the Iewes, ſaue thy ſelfe. And a ſuperſcripcion was writtē ouer hym, with

letters of Greke, and Latin, and Hebrue: This is the king of the Iewes. And one of the euil doers whiche were hanged, railed on him, ſaying: If thou be Chriſte ſaue thy ſelfe and vs. But the other anſwered and rebuked him, ſaying: feareſt thou not God, ſeyng thou art in theſame damnacion? we are righteouſly puniſhed, for we receyue accordyng to our dedes: but this man hath done nothing amiſſe. And he ſayde vnto Ieſus: Lorde, remembre me when thou comeſt into thy kyngdome. And Ieſus ſayd vnto him: verely I ſay vnto thee: to day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe. And it was about the .vi. houre: and there was darkneſſe ouer all the earth, vntill the .ix. houre, and the Sonne was darkened. And the vayle of the temple did rente, euen through the middes. And when Ieſus had cryed wyth a loude voyce, he ſayed: Father, into thy handes I commend my ſpirite. And when he thus had ſayed, he gaue vp the goſte. When the Centurion ſawe what had happened, he glorified God, ſaying: verely, this was a righteous man. And all the people that came together to that ſyght, and ſawe the thinges which had happened, ſmote their breſtes and returned. And all his acquaintaunce, and the women that folowed him from Galile, ſtode a farre of, beholdynge theſe thynges. And beholde, there was a man named Ioſeph a counſailor, and he was a good man and a iuſt: theſame had no conſented to the counſaile and dede of them, whiche was of Aramathia, a citie of the Iewes, whyche ſame alſo waited for the kingdome of God: he wente vnto Pylate and begged the body of Ieſus, and tooke it downe, and wrapped it in a lynnen clothe, and layed it in a ſepulchre that was hewen in ſtone, wherein neuer man before had been layde. And that daye was the preparyng of the Sabboth, and the Sabboth drue on. The women that folowed after, whiche had come with him from Galile, behelde the ſepulchre, and howe his bodye was layde. And they returned, and prepared ſwete Odours & oyntmentes: But reſted on the Sabboth daye, accordyng to the commaundemente.

                     O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou heareſt not: and in the night ſeaſon alſo I take no reſt.
                     And thou continueſt holy: O thou worſhip of Iſrael.
                     Our fathers hoped in thee, they truſted in thee: and thou diddeſt deliuer them.
                     They called vpon thee, and were helped: they put theyr truſt in thee, and were not confounded.
                     But as for me, I am a worme and no manne: a verye ſkorne of men, and the out caſt of the people.
                     All they that ſee me, laugh me to ſkorne: they ſhote out their lippes, and ſhake the head, ſaying.
                     He truſted in God that he woulde deliuer hym: let hym deliuer him if he will haue him.
                     But thou arte he that tooke me out of my mothers wombe: thou waſte my hope when I hanged yet vpon my mothers breſtes.
                     I haue been left vnto thee euer ſence I was borne: thou art my God, euen from my mothers woumbe.
                     O, goe not from me, for trouble is here at hande: and there is none to helpe me.
                     Many Oxen are come about me: fatte Bulles of Baſan cloſe me in on euery ſyde.
                     
                        They gape vpon me with their mouthes: as it were a rampyng and roaryng Lyon.
                     I am powred out like water, and all my bones are out of ioynte: my hearte alſo in the middes of my body, is euen lyke melting waxe.
                     My ſtrength is dried vp like a potſherd, and my tongue cleaueth to my gummes: and thou ſhalt bring me into the duſt of death.
                     For (many) dogges are come about me: and the coūſaile of the wicked lay ſiege againſt me.
                     Thei pearced my handes and my fete: I may tell all my bones, they ſtande ſtaring and loking vpon me.
                     They part my garmentes among them: and caſt lottes vpon my veſture.
                     But be not thou farre from me, O Lorde: thou arte my ſuccour, haſte thee to helpe me.
                     Deliuer my ſoule from the ſworde: my derling from the power of the dogge.
                     Saue me from the Lyons mouthe: thou haſte hearde me alſo from among the hornes of the Vnicornes.
                     I wil declare thy name vnto my brethren: in the middes of the congregacion wil I prayſe thee.
                     O praiſe the Lorde, ye that feare him: magnifie him all ye of the ſede of Iacob, and feare ye hym all ye ſede of Iſrael.
                     For he hath not deſpiſed nor abhorred the lowe eſtate of the poore: he hath not hid his face from him, but when he called vnto him, he heard him.
                     My praiſe is of thee in the great congregaciō: my vowes will I performe in the ſight of them that feare him.
                     The poore ſhall eate & be ſatiſfied: they that ſeke after the Lorde ſhall praiſe hym, your hearte ſhall liue for euer.
                     All the endes of the worlde ſhall remembre themſelues and be turned vnto the Lorde: and all the kynreds of the nations ſhall worſhip before him.
                     For the kingdome is the Lordes: and he is the gouernour among the people.
                     All ſuche as be fatte vpon earth: haue eaten and worſhipped.
                     All they that go downe into the duſt, ſhall kneele before

him: and no man hath quickened his owne ſoule.
                     My ſeede ſhall ſerue hym: they ſhalbe counted vnto the Lorde for a generacion.
                     They ſhall come, and the heauens ſhall declare hys righteouſnes: vnto a people that ſhalbe borne, whome the Lorde hath made.
                     Glory be to the father. &c.
                     As it was in the beginning. &c.

                     The Collect.
                     ALmyghty and euerlaſtynge God, by whoſe ſpirite the whole body of the Churche is gouerned & ſanctified: receiue our ſupplicacions and prayers, whiche we offre before thee for all eſtates of men in thy holy congregacion, that euery membre of theſame, in his vocacion and miniſterye, may truly and godly ſerue thee: through our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte.
                     MErcifull God, who haſte made al men, and hateſt nothyng that thou haſte made, nor wouldeſt the deathe of a ſynner, but rather that he ſhould be cōuerted and liue: haue mercy vpon all Iewes, Turkes, Infidels, and Heretikes, and take from thē all ignoraunce, hardnes of hearte, and contempt of thy word: And ſo fetche them home, bleſſed Lorde, to thy flocke, that they may be ſaued among the remnant of the true Iſraelites, and be made one folde, vnder one ſhepehearde, Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde: who lyuethe and reigneth. &c.

                        THe lawe (whiche hath but a ſhadowe of good thynges to come,Heb. x. and not the very faſhion of thinges themſelues) can neuer with thoſe ſacrifices, whiche they offre yere by yere continually, make the commers therunto perfite. For would not then thoſe ſacrifices haue ceaſed to haue been offred, becauſe that the offerers once purged, ſhoulde haue had nomore conſcience of ſynnes? Neuertheleſſe, in thoſe ſacrifices is there mencion made of ſynnes euerye yeare. For the bloud of Oxen and of Goates cannot take awaye

ſinnes. Wherfore, whē he commeth into the worlde, he ſayeth: Sacrifice & offeryng thou wouldeſt not haue, but a body haſt thou ordayned me. Burnt offeringes alſo for ſinne haſte thou not allowed. Then ſayd I: loe, I am here. In the beginning of the booke it is written of me, that I ſhould do thy will, O God. Aboue, when he ſayth, Sacrifice and offeryng, & burnt ſacrifices, and ſynne offeringes, thou wouldeſt not haue, neither haſte thou allowed them (whiche yet are offered by the lawe) then ſayed he: loe, I am here to do thy will, O God: he taketh away the firſt to eſtabliſhe the later, by the whiche will, we are made holy, euen by the offering of the body of Ieſu Chriſt once for all. And euery prieſt is ready dayly miniſtring and offerynge often times one maner of Oblacion, which can neuer take away ſynnes. But this man, after he hath offered one ſacrifice for ſinnes, is ſet downe for euer on the ryghte hande of God, and from henceforth tarieth tyll his foes be made his foote ſtoole. For with one offeryng hath he made perfect for euer, them that are ſanctified. The holy goſte hymſelf alſo beareth vs record, euen when he told before: This is the teſtament that I will make vnto them: After thoſe daies (ſayeth the Lord) I will put my lawes in theyr heartes, and in their myndes will I write them, & their ſynnes and iniquities will I remembre nomore. And where remiſſion of theſe thynges is, there is nomore offeryng for ſinne. Seeyng therefore brethren, that by the meanes of the bloud of Ieſu, we haue libertie to enter into the holye place, by the newe and liuyng waie, whiche he hath prepared for vs, through the vayle (that is to ſay, by his fleſhe:) And ſeing alſo that we haue an hye prieſt whiche is ruler ouer the houſe of God, let vs drawe nye with a true hearte in a ſure fayth, ſprinkeled in our heartes from an euil conſcience, and waſhed in our bodyes with pure water: Let vs kepe the profeſſion of our hope, without waueringe (for he is faythfull that promiſed) and let vs conſidre one another, to the intent that we may prouoke vnto loue, and to good workes, not forſakyng the felowſhipe that we haue among our ſelues, as the maner of ſome is: but let vs exhorte one another, and that ſo muche the more, becauſe ye ſee that the daye draweth nye.
                  
                  
                     
                     The Goſpell.
                     
                        WHen Ieſus had ſpoken theſe wordes, he wēt furthe with his diſciples ouer the broke Cedron,Iohn. xviii. where was a garden, into the whiche he entred with his diſciples. Iudas alſo which betrayed him, knewe the place: for Ieſus oft times reſorted thither with his diſciples. Iudas then after he had receyued a bende of men (and miniſters of the hye prieſtes & Phariſeis) came thyther with Lanterns, and fyerbrādes, and weapons. And Ieſus knowinge all thinges that ſhould come on him, wēt furth, and ſaied vnto them: whom ſeke ye? They anſwered him: Ieſus of Nazareth. Ieſus ſayeth vnto them. I am he. Iudas alſo which betraied him, ſtode with thē. Aſſone then as he had ſaied vnto them, I am he, they went backewarde, & fell to the grounde. Then aſked he them agayne. whom ſeke ye? They ſayed: Ieſus of Nazareth. Ieſus anſwered: I haue tolde you that I am he. If ye ſeke me therfore, let theſe goe theyr waye: that the ſaying might be fulfilled whiche he ſpake. Of thē which thou gaueſt me, haue I not loſt one. Then Simon Peter hauing a ſworde, drew it, and ſmote the hye prieſtes ſeruaunt, and cut of his right eare. The ſeruauntes name was Malchus. Therfore ſayeth Ieſus vnto Peter, put vp thy ſweord into the ſheath: ſhall I not drinke of the cuppe which my father hathe geuen me? Then the companye and the captayne, and the miniſters of the Iewes, tooke Ieſus and bound hym, and led hym awaie to Anna firſte: for he was father in lawe to Cayphas, whiche was the hye prieſte theſame yere. Cayphas was he that gaue counſell to the Iewes, that it was expediente that one man ſhoulde dye for the people. And Simon Peter folowed Ieſus, and ſo dyd an other diſciple: that diſciple was knowen to the hye prieſt, and wente in with Ieſus into the palace of the hye prieſte. But Peter ſtode at the doore without. Then wente out that other diſciple (whiche was knowen to the hye prieſte) and ſpake to the damoſell that kept the doore, and brought in Peter. Then ſayde the damoſell that kept the doore vnto Peter: Art not thou alſo one of this mannes diſciples? he ſayd: I am not. The ſeruauntes and miniſters ſtode there,

which had made a fyre of coales: for it was colde, and they warmed themſelues. Peter alſo ſtode among them & warmed himſelfe. The hye prieſt then aſked Ieſus of his diſciples, and of his doctrine. Ieſus aunſwered him: I ſpake openly in the worlde: I euer taught in the Synagoge, and in the tēple, whither all the Iewes haue reſorted, and in ſecrete haue I ſayed nothing. Why aſkeſt thou me? Aſke thē which heard me, what I ſayd vnto them. Beholde, they cā tell what I ſayde. When he had thus ſpoken, one of the miniſters, which ſtode by, ſmote Ieſus on the face, ſaying: Aunſwereſt thou the hye prieſt ſo? Ieſus aunſwered hym: If I haue euil ſpoken, beare witneſſe of the euill: But if I haue well ſpoken, why ſmiteſt thou me? And Annas ſente hym bounde vnto Cayphas the hye prieſt. Symon Peter ſtode and warmed himſelf. Then ſayd they vnto him: Art not thou alſo one of his diſciples? He denyed it, & ſayde: I am not. One of the ſeruaūtes of the hye prieſtes (his coſin whoſe eare Peter ſmote of) ſayed vnto him: did not I ſee thee in the garden with him? Peter therfore denied again: and immediatly the Cocke crewe. Then ledde they Ieſus from Cayphas into the hall of iudgemente. It was in the morninge, & they themſelfes wente not into the iudgemente hall, leſte they ſhoulde be defiled, but that they myghte eate the Paſſeouer. Pilate then went out to them, & ſayd: what accuſacion bringe you againſte this man? They anſwered and ſayd vnto hym: If he were not an euil doer, we would not haue deliuered him vnto thee. Then ſayd Pylate vnto them: take ye him and iudge him after your owne lawe. The Iewes therfore ſayed vnto him: It is not lawfull for vs to put any manne to deathe: that the woordes of Ieſus myght be fulfilled, which he ſpake, ſignifying what death he ſhoulde dye. Then Pylate entred into the iudgemente hall againe, & called Ieſus, and ſayed vnto him: Art thou the king of the Iewes? Ieſus anſwered: ſayeſte thou that of thy ſelfe, or did other tel it thee of me? Pylate anſwered: am I a Iewe? Thine owne nacion, & hye prieſtes haue deliuered thee vnto me: what haſt thou done? Ieſus anſwered: my kyngdome is not of this worlde: yf my kyngdome were of this worlde, then would my miniſters ſurely fight, that I ſhoulde not be deliuered to the Iewes: but nowe is my kingdome not from hence. Pylate therefore ſayed

vnto him: Art thou a kynge then? Ieſus anſwered: thou ſaieſt that I am a king. For this cauſe was I borne, & for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould beare witnes vnto the trueth. And all that are of the truethe, heare my voyce. Pylate ſayde vnto hym: what thyng is truethe? And when he had ſayd this, he wente out againe vnto the Iewes, & ſayeth vnto them: I finde in him no cauſe at all. Ye haue a cuſtome that I ſhoulde deliuer you one loce at Eaſter: wil ye that I loce vnto you the king of the Iewes? Thē cried they al again, ſaying: Not him, but Barrabas: theſame Barrabas was a murtherer.John. xix. Then Pilate toke Ieſus therfore, & ſcourged him. And the ſouldiers wounde a croune of thornes, & put it on his head. And they dyd on him a purple garmente, & came vnto him and ſayed: hayle king of the Iewes: and they ſmote him on the face. Pylate went furth againe, and ſayd vnto them: beholde, I brynge him furth to you, that ye may know that I finde no faulte in him. Thē came Ieſus furth, wearing a croūe of thorne, and a robe of purple. And he ſayth vnto them: beholde the man. When the hye prieſtes therefore and miniſters ſawe hym, they cryed, ſayinge: crucifie hym, crucifie hym. Pylate ſayth vnto them: take ye hym & crucifie him, for I finde no cauſe in him. The Iewes aūſwered him: we haue a lawe, and by our lawe, he ought to die, becauſe he made himſelfe the ſonne of God. When Pilate heard that ſaying, he was the more afrayed, & went againe into the iudgemēt hall, & ſayeth vnto Ieſus: whence art thou? But Ieſus gaue him none anſwere. Thē ſayd Pilate vnto him: Speakeſte thou not vnto me? knoweſte thou not that I haue power to crucifie thee, and haue power to looce thee? Ieſus anſwered: Thou couldeſt haue power at all agaynſte me, excepte it were geuē thee frō aboue: Therfore he that deliuered me vnto thee, hath the more ſinne: And from thencefurth ſought Pilate meanes to looce him: but the Iewes cryed, ſayinge: yf thou let hym goe, thou arte not Ceſars frende: for whoſoeuer maketh himſelfe a kynge, is againſte Ceſar. When Pilate heard that ſaying, he broughte Ieſus furth, and ſate downe to geue ſentence in a place that is called the Pauement, but in the Hebrue tong Gabbatha. It was the preparinge day of Eaſter, about the. vi. houre. And he ſayeth vnto the Iewes: beholde youre king.

They cryed, ſaying: away with hym, awaye with hym: crucyfy hym. Pylate ſayeth vnto them: ſhall I crucyfy your kyng? The hye prieſtes aunſwered: we haue no king but Ceſar. Then deliuered he him vnto thē to be crucyfied. And they toke Ieſus and ledde hym awaye. And he bare his croſſe, and wente furthe into a place whiche is called the place of dead mennes ſculles: but in Hebrue golgotha: where they crucyfyed hym, and two other with hym: on either ſide one, and Ieſus in the middeſt. And Pilate wrot a title and put it on the croſſe. The writing was, Ieſus of Nazareth kyng of the Iewes. This title read many of the Iewes: for the place where Ieſus was crucified, was nie to the citie. And it was written in Hebrue, Greke, and Latin. Then ſayd the hye prieſtes of the Iewes to Pilate: write not kyng of the Iewes, but that he ſayd: I am kyng of the Iewes. Pilate aunſwered: what I haue wrytten, that haue I written. Thē the ſouldiers, when thei had crucified Ieſus, toke his garmentes and made .iiii. partes, to euery ſouldier a parte, and alſo his coate. The coate was without ſeme, wrought vpon throughout. They ſayed therfore among themſelues: let vs not deuide it, but caſt lottes for it, who ſhall haue it. That the ſcripture might be fulfylled ſaying: They haue parted my rayment among them, and for my coat dyd they caſte lottes. And the ſouldiours dyd ſuche thinges in dede. There ſtode by the croſſe of Ieſus his mother and his mothers ſyſter, Mary the wyfe of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. When Ieſus therefore ſawe his mother, and the diſciple ſtandynge, whome he loued, he ſaieth vnto his mother: woman, behode thy ſōne. Then ſayd he to the diſciple: beholde thy mother. And frō that houre the diſciple toke her for his owne.
                     After theſe thinges, Ieſus knowing that all thynges were now performed, that the ſcripture might be fulfilled, he ſaieth: I thriſt. So there ſtode a veſſel by full of vineger: therfore they filled a ſponge with vineger, and wounde it about with Iſope, and putte it to his mouth. Aſſone as Ieſus then receyued of the vineger, he ſayed: It is finiſhed, and bowed his head and gaue vp the goſte. The Iewes therefore, becauſe it was the preparing of the Sabbothe that the bodyes ſhoulde not remayne vpon the Croſſe on the Sabboth day (for that Sabboth day, was an hie daye)

beſought Pilate, that their legges might be broken, and that they might be taken downe. Thē came the ſouldiours and brake the legges of the firſte, and of the other whiche was crucified wyth hym. But when they came to Ieſus, and ſawe that he was deade already, they brake not his legges: but one of the ſouldiours with a ſpeare thruſt him into the ſide, & forth with came there out bloud and water. And he that ſawe it bare recorde, and his recorde is true. And he knoweth that he ſayeth true, that ye myght beleue alſo. For theſe thinges were done that the ſcripture ſhould be fulfilled: ye ſhall not breake a bone of him.
                     And againe an other ſcripture ſaieth: they ſhall loke vpon him, whom they haue pearced. After this, Ioſeph of Aramathia (whiche was a diſciple of Ieſus, but ſecretly for feare of the Iewes) beſoughte Pylate that he might take downe the bodye of Ieſus. And Pylate gaue him lycence: He came therfore and tooke the bodye of Ieſus. And there came alſo Nicodemus (whiche at the beginning came to Ieſus by nyght) and brought of myrre and Aloes mingled together, about an hundreth pounde weight. Then tooke they the body of Ieſu, and wounde it in linnen clothes with the odours, as the maner of the Iewes is to burye. And in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a newe Sepulchre, wherin was neuer man layd: There layd they Ieſus therefore, becauſe of the preparynge of the Sabbothe of the Iewes, for the Sepulchre was nye at hande.

                  For my ſoule is full of trouble: & my life draweth nye vnto hell.
                  I am counted as one of them that goe downe vnto the pytte: and I haue bene euen as a manne that hathe no ſtrengthe.
                  Free among the dead, lyke vnto them that bee wounded and lye in the graue, whiche be out of remembraunce: and are cut awaye from thy hande.
                  Thou haſte layed me in the loweſte pitte, in a place of darcknes: and in the depe.
                  Thyne indignacion lyeth harde vpon me: and thou haſt vexed me with all thy ſtormes.
                  Thou haſt put awaye myne acquayntaunce far from me: and made me to be abhorred of them.
                  I am ſo faſt in priſon: that I cannot gette forth.
                  My ſight fayleth for very trouble: lord I haue called dayly vpon thee, I haue ſtretched out my handes vnto thee.
                  Doeſte thou ſhewe wonders among the dead? or ſhall the dead riſe vp agayne and prayſe thee?
                  Shall thy louing kindnes be ſhewed in the graue? or thy faythfulneſſe in deſtruccion.
                  Shall thy wonderous workes be knowne in the darke? and thy righteouſnes in the lande where all thynges are forgotten.
                  Vnto thee haue I cryed, O Lorde: and earlye ſhall my prayer come before thee.
                  Lord, why abhorreſt thou my ſoule? and hideſt thou thy face from me?
                  I am in miſery, and lyke vnto him that is at the pointe to dye: (euen from my youth vppe) thy terrours haue I ſuffered with a troubled mynde.
                  Thy wrathfull diſpleaſure goeth ouer me: and the feare of thee, hath vndone me.
                  They came rounde aboute me dayelye lyke water: and compaſſed me together on euery ſyde.
                  My louers and frendes haſt thou put awaye from me: and hid myne acquayntaunce out of my ſyght.
                  
                     Glory be to the father, and to the ſonne: and to the holy ghoſte.

In which ſpirite he alſo went and preached to the ſpirites that were in priſon, whiche ſome tyme had beene diſobedient, when the long ſuffring of God was once looked for in the dayes of Noe, whyle the arke was a preparing: wherin a fewe, that is to ſaye, eyghte ſoules were ſaued by the water, lyke as Baptiſme alſo nowe ſaueth vs: not the putting awaye of the fylthe of the fleſhe, but in that a good conſcience confenteth to God by the reſurreccion of Ieſus Chriſt, which is on the right hande of God: and is gone into heauen: Angels, powers, and might, ſubdued vnto hym.

                        WHen the euē was come, there came a riche mā of Aramathia named Ioſeph,Mat. xxvii whiche alſo was Ieſus diſciple. He wente vnto Pilate & begged the body of Ieſus. Then Pilate cōmaūded the body to be deliuered. And whē Ioſeph had taken the bodye, he wrapped it in a cleane linnen clothe, & layed it in his newe toumbe, which he had hewen out euen in the rocke, & rolled a greate ſtone to the doore of the Sepulchre, & departed. And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary ſytting ouer agaynſt the Sepulchre. The nexte daye that folowed the daye of preparing, the high prieſtes and Phariſeis came together vnto Pilate, ſaying: Sir, we remembre that this deceyuer ſayed while he was yet aliue: After iii. dayes I will riſe againe: Commaunde therfore that the Sepulchre bee made ſure vntyll the thirde daye, leſte his

diſciples come and ſteale him awaye, and ſay vnto the people, he is riſen from the dead: and the laſt erroure ſhall be worſe then the firſte. Pylate ſayed vnto them: ye haue the watche, goe your waye, make it as ſure as ye can. So they wente and made the Sepulchre ſure with the watche menne, and ſealed the ſtone.

And when he had ſtowped doune, he ſaw the lynnen clothes lying, yet wente he not in. Then came Simon Peter folowing hym, and went into the ſepulchre and ſawe the lynnen clothes lye, and the napkin that was aboute his heade, not lying with the lynnen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by it ſelfe.

he ſawe and beleued. For as yet they knewe not the ſcripture that he ſhoulde ryſe againe from death. Then the diſciples went awaye agayne vnto their owne home.

                        moned together & reaſoned: Ieſus himſelfe drue nere and went with thē. But their eyes were holdē that they ſhould not knowe hym. And he ſayd vnto them: what maner of communicacions are theſe that ye haue one to another as ye walke, and are ſad? And the one of them (whoſe name was Cleophas) aunſwered, and ſayd vnto him: art thou onely a ſtraunger in Ieruſalen, and haſte not knowen the thinges whiche haue chaunced there in theſe dayes? he

ſayd vnto them: what thynges? And they ſayd vnto him: of Ieſus of Nazareth, whiche was a Prophete, mightie in dede and word before God and all the people: and how the hie prieſtes, and our rulers, deliuered him to be condemned to death, and haue crucified hym. But we truſted that it had been he whiche ſhoulde haue redemed Iſraell. And as touching all theſe thinges, to daye is euen the third daye that they were doen. Yea, and certayne women alſo of our companye made vs aſtonied, whiche came earely vnto the Sepulchre and founde not his body, and came ſaying, that they had ſene a viſion of Angels, whiche ſayed that he was alyue. And certayne of them whyche were wyth vs, went to the Sepulchre, and found it euen ſo as the women had ſayed: but him they ſawe not.

And he began at Moſes and al the prophetes, and interpreted vnto them in all Scriptures which were written of him. And they drue nye vnto the toune, whiche they wente vnto. And he made as thoughe he woulde haue gone further. And they conſtrayned hym, ſayinge: abyde with vs, for it draweth towardes nyght, and the day is farre paſſed. And he wente in to tary with them. And it came to paſſe as he ſate at meate with them, he toke breade and bleſſed it, and brake, and gaue vnto them. And their eyes were opened, and they knewe him, and he vaniſhed out of their ſight. And they ſayd betwene themſelues: dyd not our heartes burne within vs, whyle he talked with vs by the waye, and opened to vs the Scriptures? And they roſe vp theſame houre and returned to Ieruſalē, and found the eleuen gathered together, and them that were with them, ſaying: the Lorde is ryſen in dede, and hath appered to Simon.

For the inhabiters of Ieruſalē, and their rulers, becauſe they knewe him not, nor yet the voices of the prophetes, which are read euery Sabboth day, thei haue fulfilled thē ī cōdēning him.

And when they found no cauſe of death in him, yet deſired they Pilate to kyll hym. And when they had fulfylled all that were written of hym, they toke hym downe from the tree, and put hym in a Sepulchre. But God rayſed hym agayne from death the thirde daye, and he was ſene manye dayes of them whiche wente with him from Galile to Ieruſalem: which are his witneſſes vnto the people. And we declare vnto you, how that the promes (which was made vnto the fathers) GOD hath fulfilled vnto their children (euen vnto vs) in that he rayſed vp Ieſus agayne: Euen as it is written in the ſecond Pſalme: Thou art my ſonne, this daye haue I begotten thee. As concernyng that he rayſed him vp from death, nowe no more to returne to corrupcion, he ſayed on this wiſe: The holy promiſes made to Dauid, wil I geue faythfullye to you. Wherefore he ſayeth alſo in an other place: Thou ſhalt not ſuffre thyne holy to ſee corrupcion. For Dauid (after that he had in his tyme fulfilled the wyll of GOD) fell on ſlepe, and was layed vnto his fathers, and ſawe corrupciō. But he whom God rayſed agayne, ſawe no corrupcion. Bee it knowne vnto you therefore (ye men and brethren) that throughe thys man, is preached vnto you the forgeuenes of ſinnes, and that by hym all that beleue, are iuſtified from all thynges, from which ye could not be iuſtified by the lawe of Moſes. Beware therfore, leſt that fall on you, whiche is ſpoken of in the Prophetes: behold ye deſpiſers, and wonder, and periſhe ye: for I doe a worke in your daies, which ye ſhall not beleue, though a man declare it you.

Behold my handes & my feete, that it is euen I my ſelfe. Handle me and ſee, for a ſpirite hath not fleſhe and bones, as ye ſee me haue. And when he had thus ſpoken, he ſhewed them his handes,

and his fete. And whyle they yet beleued not for ioye, and wondered, he ſayed vnto them: Haue ye here any meate? And they offered him a peace of a broyled fiſhe, and of an Honye combe. And he tooke it and dyd eate before them. And he ſayed vnto them: theſe are the wordes whiche I ſpake vnto you, whyle I was yet with you: That all muſt nedes be fulfilled, whiche were written of me in the Lawe of Moſes, & in the Prophetes, and in the Pſalmes. Then opened he their wittes, that they mighte vnderſtande the ſcriptures, and ſayed vnto them: Thus it is written, and thus it behoued Chriſte to ſuffer, and to riſe agayne from death the thirde daye, and that repentaunce and remiſſion of ſinnes, ſhoulde bee preached in his name among all nacions, and muſte begin at Ieruſalem.

Of ſynne, becauſe they beleue not on me: Of righteouſnes, becauſe I go to my father, and ye ſhall ſee me nomore: Of Iudgement, becauſe the Prince of this worlde is iudged already. I haue yet many thinges to ſaye vnto you, but ye cannot beare them awaye nowe, howbeit when he is come (which is the ſpirite of trueth) he will leade you into all trueth.

He ſhall glorifie me, for he ſhall receyue of myne, and ſhall ſhewe vnto you.

                     Beholde, the iye of the Lorde is vpon them that feare him: and vpon them that put theyr truſt in his mercy.

                           •…
                        . of a trueth I perceyue that there is no reſpecte of perſones with God, but in all people, he that feareth hym, and worketh righteouſnes, is accepted with him. Ye know the preaching that God ſente vnto the children of Iſrael, preaching peace by Ieſu Chriſte, whiche is Lorde ouer all thynges: whiche preaching was publiſhed throughout all Iewry (and beganne in Galile after the baptiſme whiche Iohn preached) howe God annointed Ieſus of Nazareth with the holy goſte, and with power. Whiche Ieſus wente about, doyng good, and healyng all that were oppreſſed of the deuill. For God was with him. And we are witneſſes of all thinges whiche he did in the lande of the Iewes and at Ieruſalem, whome they ſlewe and hanged on tree:

Hym God rayſed vp the thirde day, and ſhewed him openly, not to all the people, but vnto vs witneſſes (choſen before of God for theſame entente) which did eate and drinke with hym, after he aroſe from death. And he commaunded vs to preache vnto the people, and to teſtifie that it is he, whiche was ordayned of God to be the iudge of quicke and dead. To hym geue all the Prophetes witneſſe, that through his name whoſoeuer beleueth in hym, ſhal receiue remiſſion of ſynnes. Whyle Peter yet ſpake theſe wordes, the holy goſt fell on all them whiche heard the preaching. And they of the circumciſiō which beleued, were aſtonied, as many as came with Peter, becauſe that on the gentiles alſo, was ſhedde out the gifte of the holy goſt. For they heard them ſpeake with tongues & magnifye God. Then aunſwered Peter: can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptiſed whiche haue receyued the holy goſt as well as we? And he commaunded them to be baptiſed in the name of the Lorde. Then prayed they hym to tarye a fewe dayes.

                     SO God loued the worlde, that he gaue his only begotten ſōne, that whoſoeuer beleueth in him, ſhould not periſhe, but haue euerlaſting lyfe. For God ſent not his ſonne into the worlde, to condemne the worlde, but that the worlde through him myght be ſaued. He that beleueth on hym is not condēned. But he that beleueth not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not beleued in the name of the onely begotten ſonne of God. And this is the condemnacion: that lyght is come into the worlde, and men loued darkenes more then lyght, becauſe theyr dedes were euill. For euery one that euill doeth, hateth the light, neyther cummeth to the light, leſte his dedes ſhould be reproued. But he that doeth trueth, cummeth to the light, that his dedes may be knowen, howe that they are wrought in God.

Theſame came to Ieſus by nyght, & ſayd vnto him: Rabby, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no mā could doe ſuche miracles as thou doeſt, excepte God were with him. Ieſus anſwered, and ſayd vnto him: Verely, verely, I ſaye vnto thee: except a man be borne from aboue, he cannot ſee the kingdome of God. Nicodemus ſayed vnto him: howe can a man be borne when he is olde? can he enter into his mothers wombe and bee borne agayne? Ieſus anſwered: verely, verely, I ſay vnto thee: except a man be borne of water, and of the ſpirite, he cannot entre into the kyngdome of God. That whiche is borne of the fleſhe, is fleſhe, and that whiche is borne of the ſpirite, is ſpirite, Maruayle not thou that I ſayed to thee, ye muſt bee borne from aboue. The wynde bloweth where it luſteth, & thou heareſt the ſounde therof, but canſt not tell whence it commeth and whither it goeth: So is euery one that is borne of the ſpirite. Nicodemus anſwered, and ſayed vnto hym: howe can theſe thinges be? Ieſus anſwered, and ſayd vnto him: art thou a maiſter in Iſrael, and knoweſt not theſe thinges. Verely, verely I ſay vnto thee: we ſpeake that we do knowe, and teſtifie that we haue ſeen: and ye receyue not our witnes. If I haue told you yearthly thinges, and ye beleue not: howe ſhall ye beleue yf I tell you of heauenly thynges? And no manne aſcendeth vp to heauen, but he

that came downe from heauen, euen the ſonne of manne whiche is in heauen.

                     DEarely beloued, let vs loue one another:i. Iohn. iiii. for loue commeth of God. And euery one that loueth is borne of God, and knoweth God. He that loueth not, knoweth not God: for God is loue. In this appeared the loue of God to vs ward, becauſe that God ſent his onlye

begotten ſonne into the worlde, that we myght lyue through him. Herein is loue, not that we loued God, but that he loued vs, & ſent his ſonne to be the agremēt for our ſynnes. Dearely beloued, if God ſo loued vs, we ought alſo to loue one another. No mā hath ſeen God at any time. If we loue one another, God dwelleth in vs and his loue is perfecte in vs. Hereby knowe we that we dwell in hym and he in vs: becauſe he hathe geuen vs of his ſpirite. And we haue ſeen, and do teſtifie, that the father ſent the ſonne to be the ſauiour of the worlde: whoſoeuer confeſſeth that Ieſus is the ſonne of God, in him dwelleth God, and he in God. And we haue knowen & beleued the loue that God hath to vs. God is loue, & he that dwelleth in loue, dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein is the loue perfect in vs, that we ſhould haue truſte in the day of iudgemēt. For as he is, euen ſo are we in this world. There is no feare in loue, but perfect loue caſteth out feare: for feare hath painefulnes. He that feareth, is not perfect in loue. We loue him, for he loued vs firſt. If a man ſaye: I loue God, & yet hate his brother, he is a lyar. For howe canne he that loueth not hys brother, whom he hath ſeen, loue God whome he hath not ſeen? And this commaundement haue we of him: that he whiche loueth God, ſhould loue his brother alſo.

                     THere was a certaine riche man, whiche was clothed in purple and fyne white, & fared deliciouſly euery day: And there was a certaine begger, named Lazarus, which lay at his gate full of ſores, deſiring to bee refreſhed with the crummes which fel from the ryche mannes borde, and no man gaue vnto hym. The dogges came alſo & licked his ſores. And it fortuned, that the begger dyed, and was caried by the Angels into Abrahams boſome. The riche man alſo dyed and was buried. And being in hell in tormentes, he lift vp his iyes & ſawe Abraham a farre of, and Lazarus in his boſome, and he cryed & ſayd: father Abraham, haue mercy on me: and ſend Lazarus, that he may dippe the tippe of his finger in water, and coole my tonge, for I am tormented in this flame.

But Abraham ſayed: Sonne, remembre that thou in thy lyfe tyme, receiuedſt thy pleaſure: & contraryewiſe, Lazarus receiued payne: But nowe is he comforted and thou art punniſhed. Beyond all this, betwene vs and you there is a great ſpace ſet, ſo that they which would go frō hence to you cannot: neither may come from thence to vs Then he ſayd: I pray thee therfore father, ſende hym to my fathers houſe (for I haue fyue brethren) for to warne them, leſte they alſo come into this place of tormēt. Abrahā ſayd vnto him: they haue Moſes and the Prophetes, let them heare them. And he ſayd: nay father Abraham, but if one come vnto them from the dead, they will repent. He ſayd vnto him: If thei heare not Moſes and the Prophetes, neither will they beleue, though one roſe from death agayne.

When he had left ſpeaking, he ſayde vnto Simon: launche out into the depe, & let ſlip your nettes to make a draught.

But theyr nette brake, and they beckened to theyr felowes (whiche were in the other ſhip) that they ſhoulde come and helpe them. And they came and fylled bothe the ſhippes, that they ſonke agayn. When Simon Peter ſawe this, he fell downe at Ieſus knees, ſaying: Lorde, goe from me, for I am a ſinful man. For he was aſtonied and al that were with him, at the draught of fiſhes which they had taken: & ſo was alſo Iames and Iohn the ſonnes of Zebede, which were parteners with Simon.

We are buried then with hym by baptiſme for to dye: that lykewiſe as Chriſte was rayſed from deathe, by the glory of the father, euen ſo we alſo ſhoulde walke in a newe lyfe. For if we bee graft in deathe lyke vnto him: euen ſo ſhall we bee partakers of the reſurreccion: Knowyng thys, that our olde manne is crucifyed with him alſo, that the body of ſinne, might vtterly be deſtroyed, that hēcefurth we ſhould not be ſeruaū

Wherfore, yf we be dead with Chriſte, we beleue that we ſhal alſo liue with him, knowing that Chriſt being rayſed from deathe, dyeth no more. Deathe hathe no more power ouer him. For as touching that he died, he died concerning ſinne once. And as touchyng that he lyueth, he liueth vnto god: Lykewyſe conſider ye alſo, that ye are dead, as touchyng ſynne, but are alyue vnto God, through Ieſus Chriſte our Lorde.

and there remembreſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leaue there thyne offryng before the alter, and goe thy waye firſte, and be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gifte.

Neyther let vs bee defyled with fornycacion, as ſome of them were defyled with fornicacion, and fel in one daye three and twentie thouſande. Neyther lette vs tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them tempted, and were deſtroyed of ſerpentes. Neyther murmure ye, as ſome of them murmured, & were deſtroyed of the deſtroyer. All theſe thynges happened vnto them for enſaumples: But are written to put vs in remembraunce, whome the endes of the worlde are come vpon. Wherefore lette hym that thynketh he ſtandeth, take hede leſt he fall. There hath none other temptacion taken you, but ſuche as foloweth the nature of man. But God is faythfull, whiche ſhall not ſuffer you to bee tempted aboue your ſtrength: but ſhal in the middes of the temptacion make a way, that ye may be hable to beare it.

For the children of this world are in their nacion wiſer then the chyldren of lighte.

                     BRethren, as perteining to the goſpel,i Cor. xv which I preached vnto you, whiche ye haue alſo accepted, and in the which ye continue, by yt which alſo ye are ſaued: I doe you to wete after what maner I preached vnto you,

yf ye kepe it, except ye haue beleued in vaine. For firſt of all I deliuered vnto you that whiche I receyued, howe that Chriſt dyed for our ſinnes, agreeyng to the ſcriptures: and that he was buried, & that he aroſe agayne the thirde daye, accordyng to the ſcriptures: And that he was ſeene of Cephas, then of the .xii. After that was he ſene of mo then fiue hundreth brethren at once, of whiche many remayne vnto this daye, and many are fallen a ſlepe. After that appeared he to Iames, then to al the Apoſtles. And laſt of al he was ſene of me, as of one that was borne out of due time. For I am the leaſt of the apoſtles, which am not worthy to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe I haue perſecuted the congregacion of God. But by the grace of God, I am that I am. And his grace whiche is in me: was not in vayne. But I laboured more aboundauntly then they al: yet not I, but the grace of God whiche is with me. Therefore, whether it were I or they, ſo we preached and ſo ye haue beleued.

Two men wente vp into the temple to pray, the one a Phariſe and the other a Publican. The Phariſe ſtoode and prayed thus with hymſelfe. God, I thanke thee that I am not as other men are, extorcioners, vniuſte, adulterers, or as this Publican. I faſt twiſe in the weke: I geue tythe of all that I poſſeſſe. And the Publican ſtāding a farre of, woulde not lift vp his eyes to heauen, but ſmote vpon his breſt, ſaying: God, bee mercifull to me a ſynner. I tell you, thys manne departed home to hys houſe iuſtifyed more then the other. For euery man that exalteth himſelfe ſhalbe broughte lowe: And he that humbleth himſelfe ſhal be exalted.

If the miniſtracion of death, through the letters figured in ſtones, was glorious, ſo that the childrē of Iſrael could not beholde the face of Moſes, for the glory of hys countenaūce (whiche glory is done away:) why ſhall not the miniſtracion of the ſpirite be much more glorious? for if the miniſtracyon of condemnacyon be gloryous, muche more dooethe the miniſtracion of righteouſnes excede in glorye.

And when he had taken hym aſyde frō the people, he put his fingers into his eares: & did ſpyt, and touched his tongue, and looked vp to heauen & ſighed, and ſayde vnto him: Ephata, that is to ſay, be opened. And ſtraight waye his eares were opened, and the ſtring of hys tongue was looced, and he ſpake playne. And he cōmaunded them that they ſhould tel no man. But the more he forbad them, ſo muche the more a great deale they publyſhed, ſaying: He hath doone all thynges well, he hath made both the deaffe to heare, and the dumme to ſpeake.

                     TO Abraham and his ſede were the promiſes made.Gala. iii. He ſayeth not in the ſeedes, as manye: but in thy ſeede, as of one, whiche is Chriſte. This I ſay, that the lawe whiche began afterward, beyond iiii. C. and .xxx. yeres, doeth not diſanul the teſtament that was confirmed afore of God vnto Chriſtewarde, to make the promiſe of none effect. For if the inheritaunce come of the lawe, it cummeth not now of promiſe. But god gaue it to Abraham by promiſe. Wherefore then ſerueth the lawe? The lawe was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion (til the ſeede came, to whom the promiſe was made) and it was ordayned by Aungels in the hand of a mediator. A mediator is not a mediator of one: But God is one. Is the law then agaynſt the promiſe of God? God forbidde. For if there had beene a lawe geuen whiche coulde haue geuen lyfe: then no doubt righteouſnes ſhoulde haue come by the lawe. But the ſcripture concludeth all thinges vnder ſinne, that the promiſe, by the fayth of Ieſus Chriſte, ſhoulde bee geuen vnto them that beleue.

For I tel you,Luc x. that many prophetes and kinges haue deſired to ſe thoſe thinges which ye ſe, & haue not ſene them, and to heare thoſe thinges which ye heare, and haue not heard them. And beholde, a certayne lawyer ſtoode vp and tempted hym, ſaying: Maſter, what ſhall I doe to inherite eternall lyfe? he ſayd vnto him: what is written in the lawe? howe readeſt thou? and he aunſwered, and ſayd: Loue the Lorde thy God with all thy hearte, and with all thy ſoule; and with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind: and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. And he ſayde vnto hym: Thou haſt aunſwered right. This doe and thou ſhalt liue: but he willing to iuſtifye hymſelfe, ſayde vnto Ieſus: And who is my neighbour: Ieſus aunſwered and ſayde.
                  
                     A certayne man deſcended from Ieruſalem to Hierico, and fell among theues, whiche robbed him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leauing him halfe dead. And it chaunced that there came downe a certayne Prieſte that ſame waye, and when he ſawe hym, he paſſed by. And likewiſe a Leuite, when he went nye to the place, came and loked on him, and paſſed by. But a certayne Samaritane as he ioueneied, came vnto him: and when he ſaw him, he had compaſſion on him, and went to, and bounde vp his woundes, and powred in oyle and wine, and ſet him on his owne beaſt and brought him to a commō inne, and made prouiſion for hym. And on the morowe, when he departed, he toke out two pence, and gaue them to the hoſte, and ſayde vnto him: Take cure of hym, & whatſoeuer thou ſpendeſt more, when I come agayn, I wil recompence thee. Which now of theſe three, thinkeſt thou was neighbour vnto him that fel among the theues? and he ſayde: he that ſhewed mercy on hym. Then ſayde Ieſus vnto hym: goe, and doe thou lykewiſe.

Contrarilye, the fruite of the ſpirite is loue, ioy, peace, long ſuffering, gentlenes, goodnes, faithfulnes, mekenes, temperaunce. Agaynſte ſuche there is no lawe.

And one of them, when he ſawe that he was clenſed, turned backe agayn, & with a loude voyce praiſed God, and fel downe on his face at his feete, & gaue him thankes. And the ſame was a Samaritane. And Ieſus aunſwered, and ſayde: Are there not .x. clenſed? but where are thoſe ix? There are not found that returned agayne to geue God

prayſe, ſaue onely thys ſtraungier. And he ſayd vnto hym: aryſe, goe thy way, thy fayth hath made thee whole.

For in Chriſt Ieſu neither circumciſion auaileth any thing at all, nor vncircumciſyon: but a newe creature. And as many as walke according vnto this rule, peace be on them, and mercye, and vpon Iſraell that pertaynethe to God.

Therfore I ſay vnto you: be not careful for your life, what ye ſhal eate or drinke: nor yet for your body, what raimēt ye ſhal put on. Is not the life more worth thē meat? & the body more of value then raiment? Behold the foules of the ayre, for they ſow not, neyther doe they reape, nor cary into the barnes: and your heauenly father feedeth them. Are ye not muche better then they? Whiche of you (by taking carefull thoughte) can adde one cubite vnto hys ſtature? And why care ye for rayment? Conſider the Lilies of the fielde, howe they growe. They labour not: neyther doe they ſpinne. And yet I ſaye vnto you, that euen Salomon in all his royaltie, was not clothed lyke one of theſe. Wherefore, if God ſo clothe the graſſe of the fielde (whiche though it ſtande to day, is to morow caſt into the fornace:) ſhall he not muche more doe the ſame for you, O ye of lytle fayth? Therefore take no thoughte, ſaying: what ſhall we eate, or what ſhall we drynke, or wherwith ſhall we be clothed? after al theſe thinges doe the gentiles ſeeke. For your heauenlye father knoweth that ye haue nede of all theſe thinges. But rather ſeeke ye firſte the kyngdome of God, and the righteouſnes thereof, and all theſe thynges ſhalbe miniſtred vnto you. Care not then for the morowe: for the morowe day ſhall care for it ſelfe: ſufficiente vnto the daye is the trauail therof.

                     ANd it fortuned that Ieſus went into a Citie called Naim,Luc. vii. and many of hys diſciples went wyth him, and muche people. When he came nie to the gate of the citie, beholde, there was a dead man caried out, which was the only ſonne of hys mother, and ſhe was a wedowe, & muche people of the citie was with her. And when the Lorde ſawe her, he had compaſſion on her, and ſayed vnto her: weepe not. And he came nye, and touched the coffen, and they that bare hym ſtode ſtill. And he ſayde: yong man, I ſaye vnto thee, aryſe. And he that was dead, ſate vp, and began to ſpeake. And he delyuered him to his mother. And there came a feare on them all. And they gaue the glory vnto God, ſaying: A great Prophet is ryſen vp among vs, and God hath viſited his people. And this rumor of him wēt forth throughout al Iewrye, and throughout al the regions which lye round about.

                     THere was a certayne Ruler, whoſe ſonne was ſycke at Capernaum. Aſſene as the ſame hearde, that Ieſus was come out of Iewry into Galile, he went vnto him, & beſought him that he would come doune and heale hys ſonne. For he was euen at the pointe of death. Then ſayed Ieſus vnto hym: except ye ſee ſignes and wonders, ye wyll not beleue. The Ruler ſaieth vnto him: Syr, come doune or euer that my ſōne dye. Ieſus ſaieth vnto hym: go thy waye, thy ſonne lyueth. The man beleued the worde that Ieſus had ſpoken vnto hym. And he went hys waye. And as he was goyng doune, the ſeruauntes mette hym, and told hym, ſaying: thy ſonne liueth. Then enquyred he of them the houre, when he beganne to amende. And they ſaid vnto him: yeſterdaye at the ſeuenth houre, the feuer left hym. So the father knewe that it was the ſame houre, in the whiche Ieſus ſayd vnto hym. Thy ſonne lyueth, and he beleued, and all hys houſholde. Thys is againe the ſeconde miracle that Ieſus did, when he was come out of Iewry into Galile.

vntyll ſeuen tymes: but ſeuentie tymes ſeuen times. Therfore is the kyngdome of heauen lykened vnto a certayne man that was a kyng, which woulde take accoumptes of his ſeruauntes.

The ſeruaunt fell doune, and beſoughte hym, ſaying: ſyr, haue pacience with me, and I wyll paye thee all. Then had the Lorde pytye on that ſeruaunt, and loced hym, and forgaue him the debt. So the ſame ſeruaunt went out, and founde one of his felowes which ought hym an. C. pence, and he layed handes on hym, and toke hym by the throte, ſaying: paye that thou oweſt. And hys felowe fell doune, and beſoughte him, ſaying: haue pacience with me, and I wyll paye thee all. And he woulde not, but wente and caſt hym into pryſon, tyll he ſhoulde paye the debt. So, when hys felowes ſawe what was doen, they were very ſory, and came and tolde vnto their Lorde all that had happened. Then hys Lorde called hym and ſaid vnto him. O thou vngracyous ſeruaunt, I forgaue thee all that debt, when thou deſyredſt me: ſhouldeſt not thou alſo haue had compaſſion on thy felowe, euen as I had pitye on thee? And his Lorde was wroth, and deliuered him to the Iailers, tyll he ſhould paye all that was due vnto him: So lykewiſe ſhall my heauenly father do alſo to you, if ye from your heartes forgeue not (euery one his brother) their treſpaces.

But againſt Iſrael he ſayeth: all daye long haue I ſtretched furth my handes vnto a people that beleueth not, but ſpeaketh againſt me.

                     AS Ieſus walked by the ſea of Galile,Math. iiii. he ſawe two brethren: Simon, whiche was called Peter, & Andrew his brother, caſting a net into the ſea (for they were fyſhers) and he ſayeth vnto them: folowe me, and I will make you to become fiſhers of men. And they ſtreight way left their nettes, and folowed him. And when he was gone furth from thence, he ſawe other two brethrē, Iames the ſonne of Zebede, and Ihon his brother, in the ſhip with Zebede theyr father, mendyng theyr nettes, and he called them. And they immediately lefte the ſhippe and theyr father, and folowed hym.

But he ſayd vnto them: except I ſee in his handes the printe of the nayles, and put my finger into the printe of the nayles, and thruſt my hande into his ſyde, I will not beleue. And after eight dayes, againe his diſciples were within, and Thomas with them. Then came Ieſus when the doores were ſhut, and ſtode in the middes, and ſaied: peace be vnto you. And after that, he ſayed to Thomas: bryng thy finger hither, and ſee my handes, and reache hither thy hande, and thruſt it into my ſyde, and be not faythleſſe, but beleuyng. Thomas aunſwered and ſayed vnto hym: my Lorde and my God. Ieſus ſayed vnto hym: Thomas, becauſe thou haſte ſeen me, thou haſte beleued: bleſſed are they that haue not ſeen, & yet haue beleued. And many other ſygnes truely dyd Ieſus in the preſence of his diſciples, whiche are not written in this booke.

And whē he iourneyed, it fortuned that as he was come nigh to Damaſco, ſodenly there ſhyned rounde aboute hym a light from heauen, and he fel to the earth, & heard a voice ſaying to him: Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? And he ſaid:

what art thou Lorde? And the Lorde ſayde: I am Ieſus whom thou perſecuteſt. It is hard for thee to kicke againſt the pricke. And he both trēbling and aſtonied, ſayed: Lord, what wilt thou haue me to doe? And the Lord ſayed vnto him: ariſe and goe into the citie, & it ſhalbe tolde thee what thou muſt doe.

And Saul aroſe from the earth, and when he opened his iyes, he ſawe no man: But they led hym by the hande, and brought hym into Damaſco. And he was three daies without ſight, and neither did eate nor drinke. And there was a certaine diſciple at Damaſco, named Ananias, & to him ſayed the Lord in a viſion: Ananias? and he ſayd: behold, I am here Lord. And the Lord ſayde vnto him: ariſe and goe into the ſtrete (whiche is called ſtreight) and ſeke in the houſe of Iudas, after one called Saul of Tharſus. For beholde, he prayeth, and hath ſeen in a viſion a manne named Ananias, cumming in to him, & putting his handes on him, that he might receiue his ſight. Then Ananias aunſwered: Lord, I haue heard by many of this man, how muche euill he hath done to thy ſainctes at Ieruſalem: & here he hath aucthoritie of the hye prieſtes, to bind al that call on thy name. The Lord ſayd vnto him: go thy way, for he is a choſē veſſel vnto me, to beare my name before the Gentiles, and kinges, and the childrē of Iſrael. For I wil ſhewe him, how great thinges he muſt ſuffer for my names ſake. And Ananias went his way, and entred into the houſe, and put his hādes on him, and ſayd: brother Saul, the Lord that appeared vnto thee in the way as thou cameſt, hath ſēt me, that thou mighteſt receiue thy ſight, & be filled with the holy goſt. And immediately there fel frō his iyes as it had been ſcales, & he receiued ſight, and aroſe, and was baptiſed, and receiued meate, and was coumforted. Then was Saul a certayne dayes with the diſciples whiche were at Damaſco. And ſtraight way he preached Chriſte in the Sinagogues, howe that he was the ſonne of God. But all that hearde him were amaſed, and ſayde: is not this he that ſpoyled them whiche called on this name in Ieruſalem, and came hither for that intent,

that he might bring them bound vnto the hie prieſtes? But Saul encreaſed the more in ſtrength, and confounded the Iewes whiche dwelt at Damaſco, affirming that this was very Chriſte.

And the ſame hath nowe poſſeſſed a plat of grounde, with the rewarde of iniquitie: and when he was hanged, he burſt a ſunder in the middes, and all hys bowels guſhed oute: And it is knowen vnto all the inhabiters of Hieruſalem: in ſo muche that the ſame fielde is called, in theyr mother tongue, Acheldama, that is to ſay, the bloude field. For it is written in the booke of Pſalmes: hys habitacion be voyde, and no man be dwelling therin, and hys buſſhoprike let an other take. Wherfore, of theſe men whiche haue companied with vs (all the time that the Lorde Ieſus had all his conuerſacion among vs, beginnyng at the baptiſme of Iohn vnto that ſame day, that he was takē vp from vs) muſt one be ordeyned, to be a witnes with vs of hys reſurreccion.

And when they prayed, they ſayde: Thou Lorde, whiche knoweſt the heartes of all men, ſhew whether of theſe two thou haſt choſen, that he may take the roume of this miniſtraciō and Apoſtleſhip, from which Iudas by tranſgreſſion fell, that he might goe to his owne place. And they gaue furth theyr lottes, and the lot fell on Mathias, and he was coumpted with the eleuen Apoſtles.

                     ANd in the ſixth moneth, the Aungell Gabriell was ſent from god vnto a citie of Galile, named Nazareth, to a virgin ſpouſed to a mā, whoſe name was

Ioſeph, of the houſe of Dauid, and the virgins name was Mary. And the Angel went in vnto her & ſaid: Hayle ful of grace the Lorde is with thee: Bleſſed art thou among women. When ſhe ſawe hym, ſhe was abaſhed at hys ſaying: and caſt in her mind, what maner of ſalutacion that ſhould be. And the Angel ſayd vnto her: feare not Mary, for thou haſt found grace with god: Beholde, thou ſhalt conceiue in thy wombe, and beare a ſonne, and ſhalt call his name Ieſus: He ſhalbe great, & ſhalbe called the ſonne of the hygheſte. And the Lorde God ſhall geue vnto hym, the ſeate of his father Dauid, and he ſhall reigne ouer the houſe of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdome there ſhall be none ende. Then ſayd Mary vnto the Angel: How ſhal this be, ſeeing I know not a man? And the Angel anſwered and ſaid vnto her: the holy goſt ſhall come vpon thee, and the power of the higheſt ſhall ouerſhadow thee. Therfore alſo that holy thing whiche ſhal be borne, ſhalbe called the ſonne of God. And beholde, thy coſin Elizabeth, ſhe hath alſo conceiued a ſonne in her age. And this is her ſixth moneth, which was called baren: for with god ſhall nothing be vnpoſſible. And Mary ſayd: beholde the handmayde of the Lorde: be it vnto me, accordyng to thy woorde. And the angel departed from her.

Wherfore he ſayth: when he went vp an hie, he led captiuitie captiue, & gaue gyftes vnto menne. That he aſcended, what meaneth it, but that he alſo deſcended firſt into the loweſt partes of the earth? he that deſcended, is euen the ſame alſo that aſcēded vp aboue all heauens, to fulfil al thinges. And the very ſame made ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophetes, ſome Euangeliſtes, ſome ſhepeheardes and teachers: to the edifying of the Saintes, to the woorke & miniſtracion, euen to the edifying of the body of Chriſte, till we all come to the vnitie of faith, & knowledge of the ſome of god, vnto a perfect man, vnto the meaſure, of the full perfect age of Chriſt.

That we hencefurth ſhould be no more children, wauering and caried about with euery winde of doctrine, by the wylines of men, through craftines, wherby they lay awayte for vs, to deceiue vs. But let vs folowe the trueth in loue, and in all thinges grow in him, which is the head, euen Chriſt, in whom if al the body be coupled & knit together, throughout euery ioynte, wherwith one miniſtreth to an other (according to the operacion, as euery parte hath his meaſure) he encreaſeth the body, vnto the edifying of it ſelfe through loue.

Neither let that manne thynke, that he ſhall receiue any thing of the Lorde. A waueryng mynded man, is vnſtable in all his wayes. Let the brother whiche

is of lowe degree, reioyce when he is exalted. Agayne, let him that is riche, reioyce when he is made lowe. For euen as the flower of the graſſe, ſhall he paſſe awaye.

And her neighbours and her coſins hearde howe the Lord had ſhewed greate mercye vpon her, and they reioyſed wyth her. And it fortuned that in the eight day they came to circumciſe the childe: & called his name Zacharias, after the name of his father. And his mother anſwered, & ſayd: not ſoo, but he ſhall be called Iohn. And they ſayed vnto her. There is none in thy kinred that is named wt this name. And they made ſignes to his father, howe he woulde haue him called. And he aſked for writing tables, and wrot, ſaying: his name is Iohn. And they meruayled all. And hys mouthe was opened immediatly, & his tonge alſo, and he ſpake & prayſed God. And feare came on al thē that dwelt nye vnto them. And all theſe ſayinges were noyſed abrode throughout all the hyll countrey of Iury, and al they that heard them laied thē vp in their heartes, ſaying: what maner of chylde ſhall thys be? And the hande of the Lorde was with him. And his father Zacharias was filled with the holy goſt, and prophecied, ſaying: Prayſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, for he hath viſited and redemed his people. And hathe rayſed vp an horne of ſaluacion vnto vs, in the houſe of his ſeruaunt Dauid. Euen as he promiſed by the mouth of his holy Prophetes, which were ſence the world began. That we ſhould be ſaued from our enemies, & from the hand of all that hate vs. That he would deale mercifully with our fathers, & remembre his holy couenaunte. And that he woulde performe the othe which he ſware to our father Abrahā for to geue vs. That we deliuered out of the handes of our enemies, myght ſerue hym wythout feare, all the dayes of our lyfe, in ſuch holines and righteouſnes as are acceptable before him. And thou child ſhalt be called the prophete of the hieſt, for thou ſhalte goe before the face of the Lorde to prepare his wayes: to geue knowledge of ſaluacion vnto his people for the remiſſiō of ſinnes. Through the tendre mercy of our God, wherby the day ſpring frō an hie hath viſited vs. To geue light to thē that ſate in darkenes, & in the ſhadowe of death, to guyde our feete into the waye of peace. And the child grewe and waxed ſtrong in ſpirite, and was in wildernes tyll the day came, when he ſhould ſhewe himſelfe vnto the Iſraelites.

                     Caſte furthe the lyghtnynge, and teare them: ſhote out thyne arrowes and conſume them.
                     Sende downe thyne hand from aboue: delyuer me and take me out of the great waters, frō the hande of ſtraunge children.

                     Saue me, and delyuer me from the hande of ſtraunge children: whoſe mouth talketh of vanitie, and their right hande is a right hand of iniquitie.
                     That our ſonnes maye growe vp as the yong plantes: and that our doughters maye be as the pollyſhed corners of the temple.

                        AT the ſame tyme Herode the kynge ſtretched furthe his handes to vexe certayne of the congregacion. And he kylled Iames the brother of Iohn with the ſworde. And becauſe he ſaw that it pleaſed the Iewes, he proceded farther and tooke Peter alſo. Then were the dayes of ſwete breade. And when he had caught him, he put him in priſon alſo, & delyuered him to foure quaternions of ſouldiers to be kept, entending after Eaſter to bryng him furthe to the people. And Peter was kept in priſon, but prayer was made with out ceaſſing, of the congregacyon vnto God for him. And when Herode would haue brought him out vnto the people, the ſame night ſlept Peter betwene two ſouldiers bounde with two chaynes: And the kepers before the dore, kept the priſon. And beholde the angell of the Lorde was there preſent, and a lyght ſhyned in the habitacion. And he ſmote Peter on the ſide, and ſtiered him vp, ſaying: aryſe vp quickely. And his chaines fel of from his handes. And the angell ſayd vnto him: gyrde thy ſelfe, and bind on thy ſandales. And ſo he dyd. And he ſayeth vnto him: caſt thy garment aboute thee and folowe me. And he came out and folowed him, and wyſt not that it was trueth whiche

was done by the angell, but thought he had ſeen a viſion. When they were paſt the firſt and the ſecond watche, they came vnto the yron gate, that leadeth vnto the citie, which opened to them by the owne accorde. And they went out, and paſſed thorowe one ſtrete, and furthwith the angel departed from hym. And when Peter was come to himſelfe, he ſayd: now I know of a ſuertie that the Lord hath ſente hys angell, and hathe delyuered me out of the hande of Herode, and from all the waytyng for of the people of the Iewes.

Simon Peter aunſwered, and ſayed: Thou art Chriſt the ſonne of the lyuing God. And Ieſus anſwered, and ſaid vnto hym. Happy art thou Simon the ſonne of Ionas, for fleſhe and bloude hath not opened that vnto thee: but my father which is in heauen. And I ſay alſo vnto thee, that thou art Peter: and vpon this rocke I wyl buylde my congregacion. And the gates of hel ſhall not preuail agaynſt it.

And behold a woman in that citie (whyche was a ſynner) aſſone as ſhe knewe that Ieſus ſate at meate in the Phariſeis houſe, ſhe brought an Alabaſter boxe of oyntemente, and ſtode at his feete behind him weping, and began to waſhe his feete with teares, and dyd wype them with the heares of her head, and kyſſed his feete, and anoynted them with the oyntment. When the Phariſee (which had bidden him) ſaw that, he ſpake within himſelfe, ſaying: if this mā were

a prophete, he would ſurely knowe who and what maner of woman this is that touched him, for ſhe is a ſinner. Ieſus aunſwered and ſayed vnto him: Simon, I haue ſomewhat to ſay vnto thee. And he ſaid: Maiſter ſay on. There was a certayne lender whiche had two debters, the one ought him fiue hundreth pence, and the other fiftie. When they had nothing to pay, he forgaue them bothe. Tell me therfore, whiche of them will loue him moſt? Simon aunſwered, and ſayd: I ſuppoſe that he to whome he forgaue moſte. And he ſayd vnto him: thou haſt truely iudged. And he turned to the woman, and ſayde vnto Simon: Seeſte thou this woman? I entred into thy houſe, thou gaueſt me no water for my feete: but ſhe hath waſhed my feete with teares, and wiped them with the heares of her head. Thou gaueſte me no kyſſe: but ſhe ſence the tyme I came in, hath not ceaſſed to kyſſe my feete. My head with oyle thou didſt not anoint, but ſhe hath anointed my feete with ointment. Wherfore I ſay vnto thee: many ſinnes are forgiuē her, for ſhe loued much. To whome leſſe is forgeuē, the ſame doeth leſſe loue. And he ſaid vnto her: thy ſinnes are forgeuē thee. And they that ſate at meate with him, began to ſay within themſelues. Who is this which forgeueth ſinnes alſo? And he ſayd to the woman.

Wherfore, yf thy hande or thy foote hynder thee, cut him of, and caſt it from thee.

If I had not done among them the workes whiche none other man did, they ſhould haue had no ſynne. But nowe haue they both ſeen and hated: not onely me, but alſo my father. But this happeneth that the ſaying might be fulfilled that is written in theyr lawe. They hated me without a cauſe.

And I heard the noumbre of thē whiche were ſealed, & there were ſealed an .C. and xliiij.M. of all the tribes of the childrē of Iſrael.
                     Of the tribe of Iuda were ſealed xii.M.

And all the Angels ſtode in the compaſſe of the ſeate, and of the elders, & of the foure beaſtes, and fell before the ſeate on their faces, and worſhipped God, ſaying: Amē. Bleſſing and glory, and wiſedome, and thankes, and honour, and power, and might be vnto our God for euermore. Amen.

            And if any of thoſe be an open and notorious euill liuer, ſo that the congregacion by hym is offended, or haue doen any wrong to his neighbours, by worde, or dede: The Curate ſhall cal hym, & aduertiſe hym, in any wiſe not to preſume to the lordes table, vntill he haue openly declared hymſelfe, to haue truly repented, and amended his former naughtie life: that the congregacion maie thereby be ſatiſfied, whiche afore were offended: and that he haue recompenſed the parties, whom he hath dooen wrong vnto, or at the leaſt bee in full purpoſe ſo to doe, as ſone as he conueniently maie.

                  DErely beloued in the Lord, ye that minde to come to the holy Cōmunion of the bodie & bloud of our ſauiour Chriſt, muſt cōſidre what S. Paule writeth to the Corinthians, how he exhorteth all perſones

diligently to trie and examine themſelues, before thei preſume to eate of that breade, and drynke of that cup: for as the benefite is great, yf with a truly penitent heart, and lyuely fayth, we receyue that holy Sacrament: (for then we ſpiritually eate the fleſhe of Chriſte, and drynke his bloude, then we dwel in Chriſt and Chriſt in vs, wee bee made one with Chriſt, & Chriſt with vs) ſo is the daunger great, yf we receyue the ſame vnworthely, for then wee become gyltie of the body and bloud of Chriſt our ſauiour, we eate and drynke our owne damnacion, not conſideryng the Lordes bodie. We kindle Gods wrathe ouer vs, we prouoke hym to plague vs with diuerſe diſeaſes, and ſondery kyndes of death. Therfore yf any here be a blaſphemer, aduouterer, or bee in malice, or enuie, or in any other greuous cryme (excepte he be truely ſory therefore, and earneſtly mynded to leaue the ſame vices, and do truſt hym ſelfe to bee reconciled to almightie God, and in Charitie with all the worlde) lette hym bewayle his ſynnes, and not come to that holy table, leſt after the takyng of that moſt bleſſed breade: the deuill enter into hym, as he dyd into Iudas, to fyll hym full of all iniquitie, and brynge hym to deſtruccion, bothe of body and ſoule. Iudge therfore your ſelfes (brethren) that ye bee not iudged of the lorde. Let your mynde be without deſire to ſynne, repent you truely for your ſynnes paſt, haue an earneſt and lyuely faith in Chriſte our ſauior, be in perfect charitie with all men, ſo ſhall ye bee mete partakers of thoſe holy miſteries. And aboue all thynges: ye muſt geue moſte humble and heartie thankes to God the father, the ſonne, and the holy ghoſte, for the redempcion of the worlde, by the death and paſſion of our ſauior Chriſte, both God and man, who did humble hymſelfe euen to the death vpon the croſſe, for vs miſerable ſynners, whiche laye in darknes and ſhadowe of death, that he myghte make vs the children of God, and exalte vs to euerlaſtyng lyfe. And to thend that wee ſhoulde alwaye remembre the excedyng loue of oure maiſter, and onely ſauior Ieſu Chriſte, thus dying for vs, and the innumerable benefites, whiche (by his precious bloudſhedyng) he hath obteigned to vs, he hath lefte in thoſe holy Miſteries, as a pledge of his loue, and a continuall

all remembraunce of theſame his owne bleſſed body, & precious bloud, for vs to fed vpon ſpiritually, to our endles comfort and conſolacion. To him therfore with the father and the holy ghoſt, let vs geue (as we are moſt bounden) cōtinual thankes, ſubmitting our ſelfes wholy to his holy wyll and pleaſure, and ſtudying to ſerue hym in true holines and righteouſnes, all the dayes of our lyfe. Amen.

                  ¶And if vpon̄ the Sonday or holy daye, the people be negligent to come to the Communion: Then ſhall the Prieſt earneſtly exhorte his pariſhoners, to diſpoſe themſelfes to the receiuing of the holy cōmunion more diligētly, ſaiyng theſe or like wordes vnto thē.

                    next, I do intende by Gods grace, to offre to all ſuche as ſhalbe godlye diſpoſed, the moſte comfortable Sacrament of the body and bloud of Chriſte, to be taken of them, in the remembraunce of his moſte fruitfull and glorious Paſſion: by the whiche paſſion, we haue obteigned remiſſion of our ſinnes, and be made partakers of the kyngdom of heauen, whereof we bee aſſured and aſſerteigned, yf wee come to the ſayde Sacrament, with heartie repentaunce for our offences, ſtedfaſt faithe in Goddes mercye, and earneſt minde to obeye Goddes wyll, and to offende nomore. Wherefore our duetie is to come to theſe holy miſteries, with moſte heartie thankes to bee geuen to almightie GOD, for his infinite mercie and benefites geuen and beſtowed vpon vs his vnworthie ſeruauntes, for whom he hath not onely geuen his body to death, and ſhed his bloude, but alſo doth vouchſaue in a Sacrament and Miſtery, to geue vs his ſayed bodye and bloud to feede vpon ſpiritually. The whiche Sacrament being ſo Diuine and holy a thing, and ſo comfortable to them whiche receiue it worthilye, and ſo daungerous to them that wyll preſume to take theſame vnworthely: My duetie is to exhorte you in the meane ſeaſon,

to conſider the greatnes of the thing, and to ſerche and examine your owne conſciences, and that not lyghtly nor after the maner of diſſimulers with GOD: But as they whiche ſhoulde come to a moſte Godly and heauenly Banket, not to come but in the mariage garment required of God in ſcripture: that you may (ſo muche as lieth in you) be founde worthie to come to ſuche a table. The waies and meanes therto is.
               Firſt that you be truly repentaunt of your former euill lyfe, and that you confeſſe with an vnfained hearte to almightie God, youre ſynnes and vnkyndnes towardes his Maieſtie committed, eyther by wyll, worde, or dede, infirmitie or ignoraunce: and that with inward ſorowe and teares you bewaile your offences, and require of almightie god, mercie and pardō, promiſing to him (from the botome of your heartes) thamendment of your former lyfe. And emonges all others, I am commaunded of God, eſpecially to moue and exhorte you, to reconcile your ſelfes to your neyghbours, whom you haue offended, or who hath offended you, putting out of your heartes all hatred and malice againſt them, and to be in loue and charitie with all the worlde, and to forgeue other, as you would that god ſhould forgeue you. And yf any man haue doen wrong to any other: let hym make ſatiſfaccion, and due reſtitucion of all landes & goodes, wrongfully taken awaye or withholden, before he come to Goddes borde, or at the leaſt be in full mynde and purpoſe ſo to do, aſſone as he is able, or els let hym not come to this holy table, thinking to deceiue God, who ſeeth all mennes heartes. For neyther the abſolucion of the prieſt, can any thing auayle them, nor the receyuyng of this holy ſacrament doth any thyng but increaſe their damnacion. And yf there bee any of you, whoſe conſcience is troubled and greued in any thing, lackyng comforte or counſaill, let hym come to me, or to ſome other diſcrete and learned prieſt, taught in the lawe of God, and confeſſe and open his ſinne and griefe ſecretly, that he maie receiue ſuche ghoſtly counſail, aduiſe, and comfort, that his conſcience maye be releued, and that of vs (as of the Miniſters of GOD and of the churche) he may receyue comforte

and abſolucion, to the ſatiſfaccion of his minde, and auoydyng of all ſcruple and doubtfulnes: requiryng ſuche as ſhalbe ſatiſfied with a generall confeſſion, not to be offended with them that do vſe, to their further ſatiſfying, the auriculer and ſecrete confeſſion to the Prieſt: nor thoſe alſo whiche thinke nedefull or conuenient, for the quietnes of their owne conſciences, particulerly to open theyr ſinnes to the Prieſt: to be offended with them that are ſatiſfyed, with their humble confeſſion to GOD, and the generall confeſſion to the churche. But in all thinges to folowe and kepe the rule of charitie, and euery man to be ſatiſfyed with his owne conſcience, not iudging other mennes mindes or conſciences: where as he hath no warrant of Goddes word to theſame.

And then ſhall adde one or two of the Collectes afore written, as occaſion ſhall ſerue by hys diſcrecion. And then turning him to the people ſhall let them departe with the accuſtomed bleſſing.

               For auoydyng of all matters and occaſion of diſcencion, it is mere that the bread prepared for the Cōmunion, be made through all this realme, after one ſorte and faſhion: that is to ſay, vnleauened, and rounde, as it was afore, but without all maner of printe, and ſome thing more larger and thicker then it was, ſo that it may be aptly deuided in diuers pieces: and euery one ſhalbe deuided in two pieces, at the leaſte, or more, by the diſcrecion of the miniſter, and ſo diſtributed. And men muſt not thinke leſſe to be receiued in parte, then in the whole, but in eche of them the whole body of our ſauioure Ieſu Chriſte.
               And forſomuche as the Paſtours & Curates within this realme, ſhall continually fynde at their coſtes and charges in their cures, ſufficient bread and wine for the holy Communion (as oft as their Pariſhioners ſhalbe diſpoſed for their ſpirituall comforte to receiue the ſame) it is therfore ordred, that in recompēce of ſuch coſtes and charges, the Pariſhioners of euery Pariſhe ſhall offre euery Sonday, at the tyme of the Offertory, the iuſt valour and pryce of the holy lofe (with all ſuche money, and other thynges as were wont to be offered with the ſame) to the vſe of their Paſtours and Curates, and that in ſuche ordre and courſe, as they were wonte to fynde and pay the ſayed holy lofe.
               Alſo that the receyuing of the Sacramente of the bleſſed body and bloud of Chriſt, may be moſte agreable to the inſtitucion therof and to the vſage of the primatiue Churche: In all Cathedrall and Collegiate churches, there ſhall alwayes ſome Communicate with the prieſt that miniſtreth. And that theſame may be alſo obſerued euery where abrode in the countrey: Some one at the leaſt of that houſe in euery paryſhe, to whom by courſe after the ordynaunce herein made, it apperteyneth to offer for the charges of the Communion, or ſome other whom they ſhall prouyde to offre for them, ſhal receiue the holy Communion with the prieſt: the which maye bee the better done, for that they knowe before, when theyr courſe commeth, and may therfore diſpoſe themſelfes to the worthy receyuing of the Sacramente. And with him or them who doeth ſo offre the charges of the Communion: all other, who be then Godly diſpoſed therunto, ſhall lykewiſe receiue the Communion. And by this meanes the Miniſter hauyng alwayes ſome to communicate with him, may accordingly ſolempniſe ſo high and holy miſteries, with al the ſuffrages & due ordre appointed for the ſame. And the prieſt on the weke day, ſhal forbeare to celebrate the Comnion, excepte he haue ſome that will communicate with him.

And whoſoeuer willingly vpon no iuſt cauſe, doeth abſent themſelfes, or doeth vngodly in the Pariſhe churche occupy thēſelues: vpon proffe therof, by the Eccleſiaſticall lawes of the Realme, to bee excōmunicate, or ſuffre other puniſhement, as ſhal to the Eccleſiaſtical iudge (accordyng to his diſcrecion) ſeme conuenient.
               And although it bee read in aunciente writers, that the people many yeares paſt, receiued at the prieſtes handes, the Sacramēt of the body of Chriſt in theyr owne handes, & no commaundement of Chriſt to the contrary: Yet foraſmuche as they many tymes conueyghed theſame ſecretelye awaye, kept it with them, and diuerſly abuſed it to ſuperſticion and wickednes: leſt any ſuche thing hereafter ſhould be attempted, and that an vniformitie might be vſed, throughout the whole Realment is thought cōuenient the people commonly receiue the Sacrament of Chriſtes body, in their mouthes, at the Prieſtes hande.

                  IT appeareth by auncient wryters, that the Sacrament of Baptiſme in the olde tyme was not commō
                  lye miniſtred but at two tymes in the yeare, at Eaſter and whitſontyde, at whiche tymes it was openlye miniſtred in the preſence of all the congregacion: Whiche cuſtome (nowe beeynge growen out of vſe) although it cannot for many conſideracions be well reſtored agayne, yet it is thought good to folowe the ſame as nere as conueniently maye be: Wherfore the people are to be admoniſhed, that it is moſte conueniente that Baptiſme ſhoulde not be miniſtred but vpon Sondayes and other holye dayes, when the moſte numbre of people maye come together. As well for that the congregacion there preſent maye teſtifie the receyuyng of them, that be newely Baptiſed, into the numbre of Chriſtes Churche, as alſo becauſe in the Baytiſme of Infantes, euery manne preſent maye be put in remembraunce of his owne profeſſion made to God in hys Baptiſme. For whiche cauſe alſo, it is expedient that Baptiſme be miniſtred in the Engliſhe tounge. Neuertheleſſe (yf neceſſitie ſo require) children oughte at all tymes to be Baptiſed, eyther at the Churche or els at home.

               When there are children to be Baptiſed vpon the Sonday, or holy daye, the parentes ſhall geue knowlege ouer nyght or in the mornyng, afore the beginnyng of Mattens to the curate. And then the Godfathers, Godmothers, and people, wyth the children, muſte be ready at the churche doore, either immediatly afore the laſt Canticle at Mattens, or els immediatly afore the laſt Canticle at Euenſong, as the Curate by hys diſcrecion ſhal appoynte. And then ſtandyng there, the pryeſt ſhall aſke whether the chyldren bee Baptiſed or no. If they aunſwere. No. Then ſhall the prieſt ſaye thus.
               
                  DEare beloued, foraſmuche as al men be conceyued and borne in ſinne, and that no man borne in ſynne, can entre into the kyngdom of God (except he be regenerate, and borne a newe of water, and the holy ghoſt) I beſeche you to cal vpon God the father through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that of his bounteouſe mercy he wyl graūt to theſe childrē that thing whiche by nature they cannot haue, that is to ſaye, they maye be Baptized with the holy ghoſt, and receyued into Chriſtes holy churche, and bee made lyuely membres of the ſame.
               
                  Then the prieſt ſhall ſaye.

them with thy holy goſt, that by this holſome lauer of regeneration, whatſoeuer ſynne is in them, maye be waſhed cleane away, that they beyng deliuered from thy wrath, may be receyued into tharke of Chriſtes Church, and ſo ſaued from peryſhing: and being feruente in ſpirite, ſtedfaſte in fayth, ioyfull through hope, rooted in charite, maye euer ſerue thee: And finally attayne to euerlaſting lyfe, with all thy holy and choſen people. This graunte vs we beſeche thee for Ieſus Chriſtes ſake our Lord. Amen.

                     AT a certayne tyme they broughte children to Chriſte that he ſhoulde touche them, and hys dyſciples rebuked thoſe that broughte them. But when Ieſus ſawe it, he was diſpleaſed, and ſayed vnto them: ſuffre litle children to come vnto me, and forbyd them not: for to ſuche belongeth the kyngdome of God. Verely I ſay vnto you: whoſoeuer doeth not receyue the kyngdome of God, as a litle child: he ſhall not entre therin.

Ye perceyue howe by hys outwarde geſture and dede, he declared hys good wyll towarde them. For he embraced them in his armes, he laied his handes vpon thē, and bleſſed thē: doubte

ye not therfore, but earneſtlye beleue, that he will lykewyſe fauourably receiue theſe preſente infantes, that he will embrace them, with the armes of hys mercy, that he will geue vnto them the bleſſing of eternall lyfe: and make them partakers of his euerlaſting kyngdome. Wherfore we beeing thus perſwaded of the good will of our heauenlye father toward theſe infantes, declared by his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt: And nothyng doubting but that he fauourablye alloweth thys charitable woorke of ours, in bringyng theſe children to his holy baptiſme: let vs faythfully and deuoutely geue thankes vnto him: And ſaye the prayer whiche the Lorde himſelfe taught. And in declaracion of our fayth, let vs alſo recyte the articles conteyned in our Crede.

                  Aunſwere.
                  I will.
               
               
                  ¶Then the prieſt ſhall take the childe in his handes, and aſke the name. And namyng the chylde, ſhall dippe it in the water thryſe. Firſt dipping the rightſide: Second the leftſide: The thirde time dipping the face towarde the fonte: So it be diſcretely and warely done, ſaying.
                  ¶ N. I Baptize thee in the name of the father, and of the ſonne, and of the holy goſt. Amen.
               
               
                  ¶And if the childe be weake, it ſhall ſuffice to powre water vpon it, ſaying the foreſayde woordes. N. I Baptize thee. &c. Then the Godfathers and Godmothers ſhall take and laye theyr handes vpon the chylde, and the miniſter ſhall put vpon hym hys whyte veſture, commonly called the Criſome: And ſay.
                  Take thys whyte veſture for a token of the innocencye, whiche by Gods grace in this holy ſacramente of baptiſme, is geuen vnto thee: and for a ſygne wherby thou art admoniſhed, ſo long as thou liueſt, to geue thy ſelfe to innocencie of liuing, that after thys tranſitory lyfe, thou mayeſt be partaker of the life euerlaſting. Amen.
               
               
                  Then the Prieſt ſhall annoynte the infante vpon the head, ſaying.
                  ALmightie God the father of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, who hath regenerate thee by water and the holye goſte, and hath geuen vnto thee remiſſion of all thy ſinnes: he voucheſaue to annoynte thee with the vnccyon of hys

holy ſpirite, and bring thee to the inheritance of euerlaſting lyfe. Amen.
               
               
                  When there are many to be Baptiſed, this ordre of demaunding, Baptiſyng, puttyng on the Criſome, and enoyntyng, ſhalbe vſed ſeuerally with euery childe. Thoſe that be firſt Baptiſed departyng from the fonte; and remaynyng in ſome conuenyente place within the Churche, vntill all bee Baptiſed. At the laſte ende, the prieſt callyng the Godfathers and Godmothers together: ſhall ſay this ſhort exhortacion folowing.
                  
                     FOr aſmuche as theſe children haue promiſed by you to forſake the deuil and all his woorkes, to beleue in God, and to ſerue hym: you muſte remember that it is youre partes and duetie, to ſee that theſe infantes bee taughte, ſo ſoone as they ſhalbe hable to learne, what a ſolemne vowe, promyſe, and profeſſyon, they haue made by you. And that they maye knowe theſe thynges the better: ye ſhall call vpon them to heare ſermons, and chiefely you ſhall prouyde that they maye learne the Crede, the Lordes prayer, and the ten commaundementes in thengliſhe tonge: and al other thinges, whiche a Chriſtian manne oughte to knowe and beleue, to hys ſoules healthe. And that theſe children may bee vertuouſlye broughte vp to leade a godly and Chriſtian lyfe: remembryng alwayes that Baptiſme doeth repreſent vnto vs our profeſſion, whiche is, to folow thexaumple of our Sauiour Chriſte, and to bee made lyke vnto him, that as he dyed and roſe agayne for vs, ſo ſhould we (whiche are Baptiſed) dye from ſinne, and ryſe agayne vnto ryghteouſneſſe, continually mortifying all oure euyll and corrupte affeccions, and daylye procedyng in all vertue and godlines of liuing.
                  
                     ¶The miniſter ſhall commaunde that the Criſomes bee broughte to the churche, and delyuered to the Prieſtes after the accuſtomed manner, at the Purificacyon of the mother of euerye chylde. And that the chyldren be brought to the Buſſhope to bee confirmed of hym, ſo ſoone as they can ſaye in theyr vulgare tongue the articles of the faythe, the Lordes prayer, and the ten commaundementes, and be further inſtructed in the Cathechiſme, ſette foorthe for that purpoſe, accordyngly as it is there expreſſed.
                     And ſo lette the congregacyon departe in the name of the Lorde. ¶Note, that if the number of children to bee Baptiſed, and multytude of people preſente bee ſo great that they cannot conuenientlye ſtand at the churche doore: then let them ſtande within the churche in ſome conueniente place, nygh vnto the Churche doore: And there all thinges be ſayde and done, appoynted to bee ſayde and done at the churche doore.
                  
               
            
            
               
               
                  Of them that be Baptiſed in priuate houſes in tyme of neceſſitie.
               
                  
                     ¶The paſtours and curates ſhal oft admonyſhe the people, that they differ not the baptiſme of infantes any longer then the Sondaye, or other holy daye nexte after the childe bee borne, onleſſe vpon a great and reſonable cauſe declared to the curate and by hym approued.
                     And alſo they ſhall warne them that without great cauſe, and neceſſitie, they Baptiſe not children at home in theyr houſes. And when great nede ſhal compel them ſo to doe, that then they miniſter it on thys faſhion.
                     ¶Firſt let thē that be preſent call vpon god for his grace, and ſaye the Lordes prayer, if the tyme will ſuffer. And then one of them ſhal name the childe, and dyppe hym in the water, or powre water vpon hym, ſaying theſe woordes
                  
                  ¶N. I Baptiſe thee in the name of the father, and of the ſonne, and of the holy goſt. Amen.
               
               And lette them not doubte, but that the chylde ſo Baptiſed is lawfully and ſufficiently Baptiſed, and oughte not to bee Baptiſed agayne, in the Churche. But yet neuertheleſſe, yf the chylde whiche is after thys ſorte Baptiſed dooe afterwarde lyue, it is expedyente that he bee broughte into the Churche, to the entente the Prieſte maye examyne and trye, whether the chylde bee lawfullye Baptiſed or no. And yf thoſe that bring any childe to the Churche doe aunſwere that he is already Baptiſed: Then ſhall the Prieſte examyne them further.
               
                  
                     ¶By whome the childe was Baptiſed?
                     Who was preſent when the childe was baptiſed?
                     Whether they called vpon god for grace and ſuccour in that neceſſitie?
                     With what thyng, or what matter, they dyd Baptiſe the childe?
                     With what woordes the childe was Baptiſed?
                     Whether they thinke the chylde to be lawfully and perfectly Baptiſed?
                  
               
               
                  And yf the miniſter ſhall proue by the aunſwers of ſuche as brought the childe that al thinges were done, as they ought to be: Then ſhall not he chriſten the chylde agayne, but ſhall receyue him, as one of the flocke of the true chriſtian people, ſaying thus.
                  
                     
                     I Certifye you, that in this caſe ye haue doen wel, and accordyng vnto due ordre concernyng the Baptiſing of thys childe, whiche being borne in originall ſinne, and in the wrath of God, is now by the lauer of regeneracion in Baptiſme, made the chylde of God, and heyre of euerlaſtyng lyfe: for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte doeth not denye his grace and mercie vnto ſuche infantes, but moſt louingly doeth call them vnto him. As the holy goſpell doeth witnes to our coumfort on this wiſe.
                  
                     Marke. x.
                     AT a certayne tyme they broughte chyldren vnto Chriſt that he ſhoulde touche them: and his diſciples rebuked thoſe that brought them. But when Ieſus ſawe it, he was dyſpleaſed, and ſayde vnto them: Suffer litle chyldren to come vnto me, and forbydde them not, for to ſuche belongeth the kyngdome of God. Verely I ſay vnto you: whoſoeuer doeth not receyue the kingdome of God as a litle childe, he ſhal not enter therin. And when he had taken them vp in his armes, he put his handes vpon them, and bliſſed them.
               
               
                  After the goſpell is read: the miniſter ſhall make this exhortacion vpon the woordes of the goſpell.
                  
                     FRendes, ye heare in this goſpell the woordes of our Saueour Chriſt, that he commaunded the children to be broughte vnto him, how he blamed thoſe that woulde haue kepte them from hym, howe he exhorted all men to folowe theyr innocencie: ye perceiue how by his outward geſture and dede, he declared hys good wil towarde them, for he enbraced them in his armes, he layed hys handes vpon them and bleſſed them. Doubte you not therefore, but earneſtlye beleue, that he hathe lykewiſe fauourablye receyued thys preſente infante, that he hathe enbraced him with the armes of hys mercie, that he hath geuen vnto hym the bleſſyng of eternall lyfe, and made hym partaker of his euerlaſting kingdome. Wherefore we being thus perſwaded of the good will of oure heauenlye father, declared by his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt towardes this infant: Let vs faythfully and deuoutly geue thankes vnto hym, and ſaye the prayer whiche the Lorde himſelfe taught, and

in declaracion of oure faythe, let vs alſo recyte the articles conteyned in our Crede.
               
               
                  Here the miniſter with the Godfathers and Godmothers ſhall ſaye.
                  OVr father whiche art in heauen, halowed be thy name: let thy kyngdome come. &c.
               
               
                  Then ſhall they ſaye the Crede, and then the Prieſte ſhall demaunde the name of the chylde, whiche beeyng by the Godfathers and Godmothers pronounced, the miniſter ſhall ſaye.

                     TAke this whyte veſture for a token of the innocencie, whiche by goddes grace in the holy ſacramente of Baptyſme is geuen vnto thee, and for a ſygne wherby thou arte admonyſhed ſo long as thou ſhalte liue, to geue thy ſelfe to innocencie of liuing, that after this tranſitory lyfe, thou mayeſt be partaker of the lyfe euerlaſtyng.

                  FOr aſmuche as thys chylde hathe promyſed by you to forſake the deuill and all his woorkes, to beleue in God, and to ſerue him, you muſt remember that it is your partes and duetie to ſee that this infante be taught, ſo ſoone as he ſhalbe hable to learne, what a ſolemne vowe, promyſe, and profeſſyon he hath made by you, and that he maye knowe theſe thinges the better, ye ſhall call vpon him to heare ſermons: And chiefly ye ſhall prouide that he may learne the Crede, the Lordes prayer, and the ten commaundementes in the Engliſhe tongue, and al other thynges which a chriſtian man ought to knowe and beleue to his ſoules health,

and that this child may be vertuouſly brought vp to leade a godly and a chriſtian life.

                  TO thende that confirmacion may be miniſtred to the more edifying of ſuche as ſhall receyue it (accordyng to Saint Paules doctrine, who teacheth that all thynges ſhoulde be doen in the church to the edificacion of the ſame) it is thought good that none hereafter ſhall be confirmed, but ſuche as can ſaye in their mother tong, tharticles of the fayth, the lordes prayer, & the ten commaūdemētes: And can alſo aunſwere to ſuche queſtions of this ſhort Cathechiſme, as the Buſhop (or ſuche as he ſhall appoynte) ſhall by hys diſcrecion appoſe them in.

               ¶Firſt, becauſe that when children come to the yeres of diſcrecion and haue learned what their Godfathers and Godmothers promiſed for them in Baptiſme, they maye then themſelfes with their owne mouthe and with their owne conſent, openly before the churche, ratifie and confeſſe the ſame, and alſo promiſe that by the grace of God they wyll euermore endeuour themſelues faythfully to obſerue and kepe ſuche thinges, as they by their owne mouth and confeſſion haue aſſented vnto.

               ¶Thirdely, for that it is agreable with the vſage of the churche in tymes paſt, wherby it was ordeined that confirmacion ſhoulde be miniſtred to them that were of perfecte age, that they beynge inſtructed in Chriſtes religion, ſhoulde openly profeſſe their owne fayth, and promyſe to be obedyent vnto the wyl of God.

            And if the perſones that would be maried dwel in diuers paryſhes, the bannes muſt be aſked in both paryſhes, and the curate of the one paryſhe ſhall not ſolemnize matrimonie betwixt them, without a certificate of the bannes beyng thriſe aſked, from the curate of thother paryſhe.
            At the daye appointed for Solemnizacion of matrimonie, the perſones to bee maried ſhall come into the bodye of the Churche, with theyr frendes and neyghbours. And there the prieſt ſhall thus ſaye.
            
               
                  DErely beloued frendes, we are gathered together here in the ſight of God, and in the face of his congregacion, to ioyne together this man, and this woman, in holy matrimonie, whiche is an honorable eſtate inſtituted of God in paradiſe, in the time of mans innocencie, ſignifying vnto vs the miſtical vnion that is betwixt Chriſt and his churche: whiche holy eſtate, Chriſte adorned and beutifyed wyth his preſence, and firſt miracle that he wrought, in Cana of Galile, and is commended of Saincte Paule to be honourable emong all men, and therfore is not to be enterpriſed, nor taken in hande vnaduiſedly, lightely, or wantonly, to ſatiſfie mens carnall luſtes & appetites, lyke brute beaſtes that haue no vnderſtandyng: but reuerently, diſcretely, aduiſedly, ſoberly, and in the feare of God. Duely cōſideryng the cauſes for the whiche matrimonie was ordayned. One cauſe was the procreacion of children, to be brought vp in the feare and nurture of the Lorde, and prayſe of God. Secondly it was ordeyned for a remedye againſt ſynne, and to auoyde fornicaciō, that ſuche perſons as be maried, might lyue chaſtly in matrimony, and kepe themſelfes vndefiled membres of Chriſtes body. Thirdely for the mutuall ſocietie, helpe and comfort, that the one ought to haue of the other, both in proſperitie and aduerſitie. Into the which holy eſtate theſe two perſons preſent, come now to

For be ye well aſſured, that ſo many as be coupled together otherwayes then Gods worde doth allowe: are not ioyned of God, neither is their matrimonie lawfull.
            
            
               At whiche day of mariage if any man doe allege any impediment why they may not be coupled together in matrimonie: And will be bound, & ſureties with him, to the parties, or els put in a caucion to the full value of ſuche charges, as the perſons to be maried doe ſuſteyne, to proue his allegacion: then the Solemnizacion muſt be differed, vnto ſuche time as the trueth be tryed. Yf no impediment be alleged, then ſhall the curate ſaye vnto the man.

               I .N. take thee .N. to my wedded wife, to haue and to hold from this day forward, for better, for wurſe, for richer, for poorer, in ſyckeneſſe, and in health, to loue, and to cheriſhe, till death vs depart: accordyng to Gods holy ordeinaunce: And therto I plight thee my trouth.
            
            
               Then ſhall they looce theyr handes, and the woman taking agayn the man by the right hande ſhall ſay.

               Then ſhall they agayne looce theyr handes, and the man ſhall geue vnto the woman a ryng, and other tokens of ſpouſage, as golde or ſyluer, laying the ſame vpon the booke: And the prieſt taking the ring ſhal delyuer it vnto the man: to put it vpon the fowerth finger of the womans lefte hande. And the man taughte by the prieſt, ſhal ſay.

               Then the man leauyng the ryng vpon the fowerth fynger of the womans left hande, the miniſter ſhall ſay.
               ¶Let vs pray.
O Eternal god, creator and preſeruer of al mankind, geuer of al ſpirituall grace, the author of euerlaſting life: ſende thy bleſſing vpon theſe thy ſeruauntes, this man and this woman, whome we bleſſe in thy name, that as Iſaac and Rebecca (after bracellets & Iewels of golde geuen of thone to thother for tokens of their matrimonye) liued faithfully

together: So theſe perſons may ſurely performe and kepe the vowe and couenaunt betwixt them made, wherof this ring geuen, and receiued, is a token and pledge. And may euer remayne in perfite loue and peace together: And lyue according to thy lawes: through Ieſus Chriſte our Lorde. Amen.
            
            
               Then ſhall the Prieſte ioyne theyr ryghtehandes together, and ſay.
               ¶Thoſe whome god hath ioyned together: let no man put a ſunder.
            
            
               Then ſhall the miniſter ſpeake vnto the people.
               FOr aſmuche as .N. and .N. haue conſented together in holy wedlocke, and haue witneſſed the ſame here before God and this cumpany: And therto haue geuen and pledged their trouth either to other, and haue declared the ſame by geuing and receiuing golde and ſiluer, and by ioyning of handes: I pronounce that they be man and wyfe together: In the name of the father, of the ſonne, and of the holy goſt. Amen.
            
            
               And the miniſter ſhall adde this bleſſing.

Looke, O lord, mercifully vpon them from heauen & bleſſe them: And as thou dideſt ſende thy Aungell Raphaell, to Thobie, and Sara, the daughter of Raguel, to their great comfort: ſo vouchſafe to ſende thy bleſſinge vpon theſe thy ſeruauntes, that they obeyng thy wil, and alway beyng in ſafetie vnder thy proteccion: may abyde in thy loue vnto theyr lyues ende: through Ieſu Chriſt our Lorde.

                     O
                   God whiche by thy mightie power haſt made all thinges of naught, whiche alſo after other thinges ſet in order diddeſte appoint that out of man (created after thine owne image and ſimilitude) woman ſhould take her beginning: and knitting them together, diddeſt teache, that it ſhould neuer be lawful to put aſonder thoſe, whome thou by matrimonie haddeſt made one: O God, which haſt conſecrated the ſtate of matrimonie, to ſuch an excellent miſterie, that in it is ſignified and repreſented the ſpiritual mariage & vnitie betwixte Chriſt and his church: Loke mercifully vpon theſe thy ſeruauntes, that both this manne maye loue his wyfe, according to thy woorde (as Chriſt did loue his ſpouſe the churche, who gaue himſelfe for it, louing and cheriſhinge it euen as his owne fleſhe:) And alſo that this woman may be louing and amiable to her houſebande as Rachael, wyſe as Rebecca, faithful and obedient as Sara: And in al quietnes, ſobrietie, and peace, bee a folower of holy and godlye matrones. O lorde bleſſe them bothe, and graunt them to inherite thy euerlaſtinge kingdome, throughe Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde. Amen.
            
            
               Then ſhall the prieſte bleſſe the man and the woman, ſaiyng.
               Almightie god, which at the beginning did create our firſt parentes Adam and Eue, and did ſanctifie and ioyne them together in mariage: Powre vpon you the richeſſe of his grace, ſanctifie and ✚ bliſſe you, that ye maye pleaſe him bothe in bodye and ſoule: and lyue together in holy loue, vnto your lyues ende. Amen.
            
            
               Then ſhalbe ſayed after the goſpell a ſermon, wherin ordinarely (ſo oft as there is any marige) thoffice of man and wyfe ſhall bee declared, according to holy ſcripture. Or yf ther be no ſermon, the miniſter ſhall reade this that foloweth.
               Al ye whiche bee maried, or which entende to take the holy eſtate of matrimonie vpon you: heare what holy ſcripture dooeth ſay, as touching the duetie of houſebādes towarde their wiues, and wiues towarde their houſebandes.
               
                  Saincte Paule (in his epiſtie to the Epheſians the fyfthe chapter) doeth geue this commaundement to all maried men.
               Ye houſebandes loue your wyues, euen as Chriſt loued the churche, and hathe geuen himſelfe for it, to ſanctifie it, purgeyng it in the fountaine of water, throughe the word, that he might make it vnto him ſelfe, a glorious congregacion, not hauing ſpot or wrincle, or any ſuche thing, but that it ſhoulde be holy and blameles. So men are bounde to loue their owne wyues, as their owne bodyes: he that loueth his owne wyfe, loueth himſelfe. For neuer dyd any man hate his owne fleſhe, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it, euen as the lorde dothe the congregacion, for wee are membres of his bodye, of his fleſhe, and of his bones. For this cauſe ſhall a man leaue father and mother, and ſhalbe ioyned vnto his wyfe, and they two ſhalbe one fleſh. This miſtery is great, but I ſpeake of Chriſt, and of the congregacion. Neuertheleſſe, let euery one of you ſo loue his owne wyfe, euen as himſelfe.
               
                  Coloſ. iii.Lykewyſe the ſame Saint Paule (writing to the Coloſſians) ſpeaketh thus to all menne that be maried: Ye men loue your wiues and be not bitter vnto them.

                     . Pet. iii.Heare alſo what ſaint Peter thapoſtle of Chriſt, (whiche was himſelfe a maried man) ſayeth vnto all menne that are maried. Ye huſbandes dwel with your wyues according to knowledge: Geuyng honor vnto the wyfe, as vnto the weaker veſſell, and as heyres together of the grace of lyfe, ſo that your prayers be not hindred.
            
            
               Hitherto ye haue hearde the duetie of the huſbande towarde the wyfe. Nowe lykewiſe ye wiues, heare and learne your duetie towarde your huſbandes, euen as it is playnely ſet furth in holy ſcripture.
            
            
               
                  Ephe. v.Saint Paule (in the forenamed Epiſtle to the Epheſians) teacheth you thus: ye weomen ſubmit your ſelues vnto

your owne huſbandes as vnto the lord: for the huſband is the wiues head, euen as Chriſt is the head of the churche: And he alſo is the ſauiour of the whole bodye. Therefore as the Churche, or congregacion, is ſubiecte vnto Chriſte: So lykewiſe let the wiues alſo be in ſubieccion vnto theyr owne huſbandes, in all thinges. And againe he ſaieth: Let the wyfe reuerence her huſbande. And (in his Epiſtle to the Coloſſians) Saincte Paule geueth you this ſhort leſſō.Coloſ. iii.
Ye wiues ſubmit your ſelues vnto your owne huſbandes, as it is conueniente, in the Lorde.
               Saincte Peter alſo doeth inſtructe you very godly,i. Peter. iii. thus ſayeng: Let wiues be ſubiect to their owne huſbandes, ſo that if any obey not the woorde, they may be wonne without the woorde, by the conuerſacion of the wiues: Whyle they beholde your chaſte conuerſacion, coupled with feare, whoſe apparell let it not be outwarde, with broyded heare, and trymmyng about with golde, eyther in putting on of gorgeous apparell: But leat the hyd man, whiche is in the hearte, be without all corrupcion, ſo that the ſpirite be mylde and quiete, whiche is a precious thing in the ſight of God. For after this maner (in the olde tyme) dyd the holy women, whiche truſted in God, apparell themſelues, beeyng ſubiecte to theyr owne huſbandes: as Sara obeyed Abraham callyng him lorde, whoſe daughters ye are made, doyng wel and beyng not diſmaied with any feare.

And as thou preſeruedſt Thobie and Sara by thy Aungell from daunger: So reſtore vnto this ſicke perſon his former health (if it be thy will,) or els geue hym grace ſo to take thy correccion: that after this painfull lyfe ended, he may dwel with thee in lyfe euerlaſtyng. Amen.
            
            
               Then ſhall the miniſter exhorte the ſicke perſon after this fourme, or other lyke.
               
                  DErely beloued, knowe this, that almightie God is the Lorde ouer lyfe, & death, and ouer all thinges to them perteining, as yougth, ſtrength, helth, age, weakeneſſe, and ſickeneſſe. Wherfore, whatſoeuer youre ſickeneſſe is, know you certaynly that it is Gods viſitacion. And for what cauſe ſoeuer this ſickeneſſe is ſent vnto you: whether it bee to trye your pacience for the example of other , and that your fayth maye be founde, in the daye of the Lord, laudable, gloryous and honourable, to the encreaſe of glory, and endleſſe felicitie: Orels it be ſente vnto you to correcte and amende in you, whatſoeuer doeth offende the iyes of our heauenly father: knowe you certaynlye,If the perſon viſited bee very ſicke, then the curate may end his exhortacion at this place. that yf you truely repente you of youre ſynnes, and beare youre ſickneſſe paciently, truſtyng in Gods mercye, for his deare ſonne Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, and rendre vnto him humble thankes for his fatherly viſitacion, ſubmytting your ſelfe wholy to his will: it ſhall turne to your profite, & helpe you forward in the right way that leadeth vnto euerlaſting lyfe. ☞ ¶ Take therfore in good worth, the chaſtement of the Lord: For whom the Lord loueth, he chaſtiſeth. Yea (as Saincte Paul ſayeth,) he ſcourgeth euery ſonne, whiche he receyueth: yf you endure chaſtiſement, he offereth himſelfe vnto you as vnto his owne children. What ſonne is he that the father chaſtiſeth not?

Yf ye be not vnder correccion (wherof all the true children are partakers) then are ye baſtardes and not children. Therfore ſeing that whan our carnall fathers doe correct vs, we reuerently obey them, ſhall we not nowe muche rather be obedient to our ſpirituall father, and ſo lyue? And they for a fewe dayes do chaſtiſe vs afer their owne pleaſure: but he doeth chaſtiſe vs for our profite, to thentente he may make vs partakers of his holines. Theſe wordes, good brother, are Gods wordes, and wrytten in holy ſcripture for our coumfort and inſtruccion, that we ſhould paciently and with thankes geuyng, beare oure heauenly fathers correccion: whanſoeuer by any maner of aduerſitie it ſhall pleaſe his gracious goodnes to viſite vs. And there ſhould be no greater coumfort to chriſtian perſons, then to be made lyke vnto Chriſte, by ſufferyng paciently aduerſities, troubles, and ſickeneſſes. For he himſelfe went not vp to ioy, but firſt he ſuffered payne: he entred not into his glory, before he was crucified. So truely our waye to eternall ioy, is to ſuffre here with Chriſte, and our doore to entre into eternall lyfe: is gladly to dye with Chriſte, that we may ryſe againe from death, and dwell with him in euerlaſting lyfe. Nowe therfore taking your ſickeneſſe, whiche is thus profitable for you, paciently: I exhorte you in the name of God, to remembre the profeſſion, which you made vnto God in youre Baptiſme. And foraſmuche as after this lyfe, there is accompte to bee geuen vnto the ryghteous iudge, of whom all muſt be iudged without reſpect of perſons: I require you to examine your ſelfe, & your ſtate, both towarde God and manne, ſo that accuſyng and condemning your ſelfe for your owne faultes, you may fynde mercy at our heauēly fathers hand, for Chriſtes ſake, and not be accuſed and condemned in that fearefull iudgemēt. Therfore I ſhall ſhortly rehearſe the articles of our fayth, that ye may knowe whether you doe beleue as a chriſtian man ſhould beleue, or no.
            
            
               Here the miniſter ſhall rehearſe the articles of the faythe, ſaying thus.
               Doeſt thou beleue in God the father almightie?
            
            
               And ſo forth as it is in Baptiſme.
            
               This may be done before the miniſter begyn his prayers as he ſhall ſee cauſe.
Then ſhall the miniſter examine whether he be in charitie with all the worlde: Exhortyng hym to forgeue from the botome of his herte, all perſons that haue offended hym: and if he haue offended other, to aſke them forgeueneſſe: and where he hath done iniurie or wrong to any man, that he make amendes to his vttermoſte power. And if he haue not a fore diſpoſed his goodes, let him then make his wyll. (But men muſt be oft admoniſhed that they ſette an ordre for theyr temporall goodes and landes, whan they be in helth.) And alſo to declare his debtes, what he oweth, and what is owyng to hym: for diſcharging of his conſcience, and quietneſſe of his executours. The miniſter may not forget, nor omitte to moue the ſicke perſon, (and that moſt earneſtly) to lyberalitie toward the poore.
                  ¶Here ſhall the ſicke perſon make a ſpeciall confeſſion, yf he fele his conſcience troubled with any weightie matter. After which confeſſion, the prieſt ſhall abſolue hym after this forme: and the ſame forme of abſolucion ſhall be vſed in all pryuate confeſſions.
               
               
                  OVre Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, who hath lefte power to his Churche to abſolue all ſinners, whiche truely repente and beleue in hym: of his great mercye forgeue thee thyne offences: and by his autoritie committed to me, I abſolue thee from all thy ſinnes, in the name of the father, and of the ſonne, and of the holy goſt. Amen.
            
            
               And then the prieſt ſhall ſaye the Collecte folowyng.
               Let vs praye.
O Moſte mercifull God, whiche accordyng to the multitude of thy mercies, doeſt ſo put awaye the ſinnes of thoſe which truely repent, that thou remēbreſt thē nomore: open thy iye of mercy vpon this thy ſeruaunt: who moſte earneſtly deſireth pardon and forgeueneſſe: Renue in him, moſte louing father, whatſoeuer hath been decayed by the fraude and malice of the deuill, or by his owne carnal wil, and frailnes: preſerue and continue this ſicke membre in the vnitie of thy Churche, conſider his contricion, accept his teares, aſwage his payne as ſhalbe ſeen to thee moſte expediente for hym. And foraſmuche as he putteth hys

full truſt only in thy mercy: Impute not vnto hym his former ſinnes, but take him vnto thy fauour: through the merites of thy moſt derely beloued ſōne Ieſus Chriſt. Amen.
            
            
               Then the miniſter ſhall ſaye this Pſalme.
               IN thee, O Lorde, haue I put my truſt,Jn te domine ſperaui. pſal. lxxi. lette me neuer be put to confuſion, but ridde me, and deliuer me in thy righteouſnes: enclyne thyne eare vnto me, and ſaue me.
               Be thou my ſtrong holde, (wherunto I may alwaye reſorte) thou haſte promyſed to helpe me: for thou art my houſe of defence and my caſtell.
               Deliuer me (O my God) out of the hande of the vngodly: out of the hande of the vnrighteous and cruell manne.
               For thou (O Lorde God) art the thyng that I long for, thou art my hope euen from my youth.
               Through thee haue I been holden vp euer ſince I was borne: thou arte he that tooke me out of my mothers wombe, my prayſe ſhalbe alwaye of thee.
               I am become as it were a monſter vnto many: but my ſure truſt is in thee.
               Oh let my mouth be filled with thy prayſe (that I maye ſyng of thy glory) and honour all the daye long.
               Caſt me not awaye in the tyme of age: forſake me not when my ſtrength fayleth me.
               For myne enemies ſpeake againſt me: and they that lay waite for my ſoule, take their counſayle together, ſaying:
               God hath forſaken hym, perſecute hym and take him: for there is none to deliuer him.
               Goe not ferre from me, O God: my God, haſte thee to helpe me.
               Let them be confounded and periſhe, that are agaynſte my ſoule: let them be couered with ſhame and diſhonoure, that ſeke to doe me euill.
               As for me, I wyll paciently abyde alwaye: and wyll prayſe thee more and more.
               My mouth ſhall dayly ſpeake of thy righteouſneſſe and ſaluacion: for I knowe no ende therof.
               I will goe forth in the ſtrength of the Lorde God: and will make mencion of thy righteouſneſſe onely.
               Thou (O God) haſte taught me from my youth vp vntill nowe: therfore will I tell of thy wondreous workes.
               
                  Forſake me not (O God) in myne olde age, when I am gray headed: vntill I haue ſhewed thy ſtrength vnto this generacion, & thy power to all thē that are yet for to come.
               Thy righteouſneſſe (O God) is very high, and greate thynges are they that thou haſte done: O God who is lyke vnto thee?
               O what great troubles and aduerſities haſte thou ſhewed me? and yet diddeſt thou turne and refreſhe me: yea, and broughteſt me from the depe of the earth agayne.
               Thou haſte brought me to great honour: and comforted me on euery ſyde.
               Therfore will I praiſe thee, & thy faythfulnes (O God) playing vpon an inſtrument of muſicke: vnto thee wyll I ſyng vpon the harpe, O thou holy one of Iſrael.
               My lippes will be fayne, when I ſyng vnto thee: and ſo will my ſoule whom thou haſte deliuered.
               My tounge alſo ſhall talke of thy ryghteouſneſſe all the daye long: for they are confounded and brought vnto ſhame, that ſeke to doe me euill.
               Glory be to the father. &c.
               As it was in the begynnyng. &c.
               Addyng this antheme.
               O Saueour of the worlde ſaue vs, whiche by thy croſſe and precious bloud haſte redemed vs, helpe vs we beſeche thee, O God.
            
            
               Then ſhall the miniſter ſaye.
               THe almyghty Lord, whiche is a moſte ſtrong tower to all thē that put their truſt in hym, to whom al thinges in heauen, in earth, and vnder earth, doe bowe and obey: be nowe & euermore thy defence, and make thee know and fele, that there is no other name vnder heauen geuen to man, in whome and through whome, thou mayeſt receyue helth and ſaluation, but onely the name of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. Amen.
            
            
               ¶If the ſicke perſon deſyre to be annoynted, then ſhall the prieſt annoynte hym vpon the forehead or breaſt onely, makyng the ſigne of the croſſe, ſaying thus.
               
                  AS with this viſible oyle thy body outwardelye is annoynted: ſo our heauenly father, almightie god, graunt of his infinite goodnes, that thy ſoule inwardly may be annointed with the holy goſt, who is the ſpirite of al ſtrength, comfort, reliefe, and gladnes. And voucheſafe for his great mercy (if it be his bleſſed will) to reſtore vnto thee thy bodely health, and ſtrength, to ſerue hym: and ſende thee releaſe of all thy paynes, troubles and diſeaſes, both in bodye and mynde. And howſoeuer his goodnes (by his diuine and vnſearcheable prouidence) ſhal diſpoſe of thee: we his vnworthy miniſters and ſeruauntes, humbly beſeche the eternall maieſtie, to doe with thee, accordyng to the multitude of his innumerable mercies, and to pardone thee all thy ſynnes, and offences, committed by all thy bodely ſences, paſſions, and carnall affeccions: who alſo voucheſafe mercifullye to graunt vnto thee goſtly ſtrēgth, by his holy ſpirite, to withſtand & ouercome al tēptacions & aſſaultes of thine aduerſary, that in no wiſe he preuaile againſte thee, but that thou maiſt haue perfect victory & triumph againſt the deuil, ſine, & deth, through Chriſt our lord: Who by his deth, hath ouercomed the prince of death, & with the father, & the holy goſt euermore liueth & reigneth god, world without end. Amen.
               HOw long wilt thou forget me (O Lord?) for euer?

               Conſider, and heare me (O Lord my God) lighten myne eyes, that I ſlepe not in death.
               Leſt myne enemy ſay, I haue preuayled agaynſte hym: for if I be caſt down, they that trouble me will reioyce at it.
               But my truſt is in thy mercy, and my hearte is ioyful in thy ſaluacion.

But if the ſycke perſon be not hable to come to the churche, and yet is deſyrous to receyue the Communion in his houſe, then he muſt geue knowlege ouer night, or els early in the morning to the curate, ſygnifying alſo how many be appoynted to communicate with him. And if the ſame day there be a celebracion of the holy Communion in the churche, then ſhal the prieſt reſerue (at the open communion) ſo muche of the ſacrament of the body and bloud, as ſhall ſerue the ſicke perſon, and ſo many as ſhal Communicate with him (if there be any.) And ſo ſoone as he conuenientlye may, after the open Communion ended in the churche, ſhall goe and miniſter the ſame, firſte to thoſe that are appoynted to communicate with the ſicke (if there be any) and laſt of al to the ſicke perſone himſelfe. But before the Curate diſtribute the holy Communion: the appoynted generall confeſsyon muſt be made in the name of the communicantes, the curate adding the abſolucion with the comfortable ſentences of ſcripture folowyng in the open Communion: and after the communion ended, the Collecte.
               Almightie and euerliuyng God, we moſte hartely thanke thee. &c.

And hauing a conuenient place in the ſycke mannes houſe (where he may reuerentely celebrate) with all thynges neceſſary for the ſame, and not being otherwiſe letted with the publike ſeruice or any other iuſt impediment: he ſhall there celebrate the holy communion after ſuche forme and ſorte as herafter is appoynted.

               I Knowe that my redemer lyueth, and that I ſhall ryſe out of the earth in the laſt day,Iob. xix. and ſhalbe couered again with my ſkinne, and ſhall ſee God in my fleſhe: yea and I my ſelfe ſhall beholde hym, not with other but with theſe ſame iyes.
               WE brought nothyng into this world,i. Timo. vi. Iob. i. neyther may we carye any thyng out of this worlde. The Lorde geueth, and the Lorde taketh away. Euen as it pleaſeth the Lorde, ſo commeth thynges to paſſe: bleſſed be the name of the Lorde.
            
            
               When they come at the graue, whyles the Corps is made ready to be layed into the earth, the prieſt ſhall ſaye, orels the prieſt and clearkes ſhall ſyng.
               
                  MAnne that is borne of a woman,Job. ix. hath but a ſhorte tyme to lyue, and is full of miſery: he cummeth vp and is cut downe lyke a floure, he flyeth as it were a ſhadowe, and neuer continueth in one ſtaye.
               ¶In the myddeſt of lyfe we be in death, of whom may we ſeke for ſuccour but of thee, O Lorde, which for our ſinnes iuſtly art moued: yet O Lorde God moſte holy, O Lorde moſte mighty, O holy and moſte mercifull ſauiour, deliuer vs not into the bytter paynes of eternall death. Thou knoweſt, Lorde, the ſecretes of our heartes, ſhutte not vp thy mercyfull iyes to oure prayers: But ſpare vs Lorde moſte holy, O God moſte mighty, O holy and mercifull ſauiour, thou moſte worthy iudge eternal, ſuffre vs not at our laſt houre for any paynes of death, to fall from thee.
            
            
               
               Then the prieſt caſtyng earth vpon the Corps, ſhall ſaye.
               
                  I Commende thy ſoule to God the father almightie, and thy body to the grounde, earth to earth, aſſhes to aſſhes, duſt to duſt, in ſure and certaine hope of reſurreccion to eternall lyfe, through our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, who ſhall chaunge oure vile body, that it may be lyke to his gloryous body, according to the mighty workyng wherby he is hable to ſubdue al thinges to himſelfe.
            
            
               Then ſhalbe ſayed or ſong.
               
                  Apoca. xiiii.
                  I Heard a voyce from heauen, ſaying vnto me: Write, bleſſed are the dead which dye in the Lord. Euen ſo ſayeth the ſpirite, that they reſt from their labours.
               Let vs pray.
                  WE commend into thy hādes of mercy (moſt mercifull father) the ſoule of this our brother departed. N. And his body we commit to the earth, beſeching thine infinite goodneſſe, to geue vs grace to lyue in thy feare and loue, and to dye in thy fauour: that when the iudgemente ſhall come whiche thou haſte committed to thy welbeloued ſonne, both this oure brother, and we, may be found acceptable in thy ſight, and receyue that bleſſing, whiche thy welbeloued ſonne ſhall then pronounce to all that loue and feare thee, ſaying: Come ye bleſſed children of my father: Receyue the kyngdome prepared for you before the beginning of the worlde. Graunt this, mercifull father, for the honour of Ieſu Chriſte our onely ſauior, mediator, and aduocate. Amen.
            
            
               This prayer ſhall alſo be added.
               
                  ALmightye God, we geue thee hertie thankes for this thy ſeruaunt, whom thou haſt deliuered from the miſeries of this wretched worlde, from the bodye of death and all temptacion. And, as we truſt, haſte brought his ſoule, which he committed into thy holy handes, into ſure conſolacion and reſt: Graunt we beſeche thee, that at the daye of iudgemente, hys ſoule and all

the ſoules of thy elect, departed out of thys lyfe, may with vs and we with them, fullye receyue thy promiſſes, and bee made perfite altogether, thorowe the glorious reſurreccion of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſte our Lorde.

               That he hath enclined his eare vnto me: therfore will I call vpon him as long as I liue.
               The ſnares of death compaſed me round about, and the paynes of hel, gatte hold vpon me: I ſhal finde trouble and heauines, and I ſhall call vpon the name of the Lorde (O Lorde) I beſeche thee deliuer my ſoule.
               Gracious is the lord, and righteous: yea our god is mercifull.
               The lorde preſerueth the ſimple: I was in miſery and he helped me.
               Turne agayn then vnto thy reſt, O my ſoule: for the lord hath rewarded thee.
               And why? thou haſt deliuered my ſoule from death, mine eyes from teares, and my feete from falling.
               I will walke before the lorde, in the lande of the liuyng.
               I beleued & therefore will I ſpeake: but I was ſore troubled.
               I ſayde in my haſte: all men are lyers.
               What rewarde ſhall I geue vnto the lorde: for all the benefites that he hath done vnto me?
               I wil receiue the cup of ſaluacion: and cal vpon the name of the Lorde.
               I wil pay my vowes now in the preſence of all his people: right dere in the ſight of ye lorde is the death of hys ſaintes.
               Beholde (O Lorde) how that I am thy ſeruaunt: I am thy ſeruaunt and the ſonne of thy handemayde, thou haſte broken my bondes in ſunder.
               I will offer to thee the ſacrifyce of thankes geuyng: and will call vpon the name of the Lorde.

                  O Lorde thou haſt ſearched me out, and knowen me. Thou knoweſt my downſitting and mine vpriſing: thou vnderſtandeſt my thoughtes long before.
               Thou arte about my path, and about my bed: and ſpyeſte out all my wayes.
               For loe there is not a woorde in my tongue: but thou (O Lorde) knoweſt it altogether.
               Thou haſt faſhioned me, behynde and before: and layed thyne hande vpon me.
               Such knowlage is to woonderfull and excellente for me: I cannot attayne vnto it.
               Whither ſhall I goe then from thy ſpirite? or whither ſhall I goe then from thy preſence?
               If I clime vp into heauen, thou art there: If I goe down to hell thou art there alſo.
               If I take the winges of the morning, and remaine in the vttermoſt partes of the ſea.
               Euen there alſo ſhall thy hande leade me: and thy ryght hande ſhall holde me.
               If I ſay: peraduenture the derkenes ſhal couer me, then ſhall my night be turned to day.
               Yea the darkenes is no darkenes with thee: but the night is all cleare as the day, the darkenes and lyght to thee are both a lyke.
               For my reines are thyne, thou haſt couered me in my mothers wombe, I wil geue thankes vnto thee: for I am fearfully, and wunderouſly made, marueilous are thy woorkes, and that my ſoule knoweth ryghte well.
               My bones are not hyd from thee: though I bee made ſecretly, and faſhioned beneath in the yearth.
               Thyne eyes did ſee my ſubſtaunce, yet beyng vnperfect: and in thy booke were all my members written.
               Whiche daye by daye were faſhioned: when as yet there was none of them.
               How deare are thy counſels vnto me, O God? O howe great is the ſumme of them?
               
                  If I tell them, they are moe in noumbre then the ſande: when I wake vp, I am preſent with thee.
               Wilt thou not ſley the wicked, O God? departe from me ye bloud thriſtie men.
               For they ſpeake vnrighteouſly againſt thee: and thine enemies take thy name in vaine.
               Do not I hate them, O Lorde, that hate thee? and am not I greued with thoſe that ryſe vp agaynſt thee?
               Yea I hate them right ſoore: euen as though they were myne enemies.
               Trye me, O God, and ſeke the grounde of myne heart: proue me, and examine my thoughtes.
               Looke well if there be any way of wickednes in me: and leade me in the waye euerlaſtyng.

               O put not your truſt in princes, nor in any childe of man: for there is no helpe in them.
               For when the breath of man goeth furth, he ſhall turne agayne to his earth: and then all his thoughtes periſhe.
               Bleſſed is he that hath the God of Iacob for his helpe: and whoſe hope is in the Lorde his God.
               Whiche made heauen and earth, the ſea, and al that therin is: whiche kepeth his promyſe for euer.
               Whiche helpeth them to ryght that ſuffer wrong: whiche feedeth the hungry.
               The Lorde looceth men out of priſon: the Lorde geueth ſight to the blynde.
               The Lorde helpeth them vp that are fallen: the Lorde careth for the righteous.
               The Lorde careth for the ſtraungers, he defendeth the fatherleſſe and widdowe: as for the waye of the vngodly, he turneth it vpſyde downe.

                  i. Cor. xv.
                  CHriſte is riſen from the dead, and become the firſte fruites of them that ſlepte. For by a manne came death, and by a manne came the reſurreccion of the dead. For as by Adam all dye: euen ſo by Chriſte ſhall all be made alyue: but euery manne in his owne ordre. The firſte is Chriſte, then they that are Chriſtes at his commyng. Then commeth the ende, when he hath delyuered vp the kyngdome to God the father, when he hath put downe all rule and all authoritie and power. For he muſt reygne till he haue putte all his enemyes vnder his feete. The laſte enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed, is death. For he hath put all thinges vnder his feete. But when he ſayeth all thinges are put vnder him, it is manifeſt that he is excepted, whiche did put all thinges vnder hym. When all thynges are ſubdued vnto hym, then ſhall the ſonne alſo hymſelfe be ſubiecte vnto hym that put all thynges vnder him, that God may be all in all. Els what doe they, which are baptized ouer the dead, if the dead ryſe not at all? Why are they then baptized ouer them? Yea, and why ſtand we alwaye then in ieoperdie? By our reioyſing, which I haue in Chriſt Ieſu our Lord, I dye dayly. That I haue fought with beaſtes at Epheſus after the maner of men, what auauntageth it me, if the dead ryſe not againe? Let vs eate, and drynke, for to morowe we ſhall dye. Be not ye deceyued: euill wordes corrupt good maners. Awake truely out of ſlepe, and ſinne not. For ſome haue not the knowledge of God. I ſpeake this to youre ſhame. But ſome manne will ſay: howe aryſe the dead? with what body ſhall they come? Thou foole, that whiche thou ſoweſt, is not quickened excepte it dye. And what ſoweſt thou? Thou ſoweſt not that body that ſhalbe: but bare corne, as of weate, or of ſome other: but God geueth it a body at his pleaſure, to euery ſeede his owne body. All fleſhe is not one maner of fleſhe: but there is one maner of fleſhe of mē, an other maner of fleſhe of beaſtes, an other of fiſhes, and an other of birdes. There are alſo celeſtiall bodyes, and there are bodyes terreſtriall. But the glory of the celeſtiall is one, and the glory of the terreſtrial is an other. There is one maner

glory of the ſunne, and an other glory of the moone, and an other glory of the ſtarres. For one ſtarre differeth from an other in glory. So is the reſurreccion of the deade. It is ſowen in corrupcion, it riſeth agayne in incorrupcion. It is ſowen in diſhonoure, it ryſeth agayne in honoure. It is ſowen in weakenes; it riſeth againe in power. It is ſowen a naturall body, it ryſeth agayne a ſpirituall bodie. There is a natural body, and there is a ſpiritual body: as it is alſo written: the firſt man Adam was made a lyuing ſoule, and the laſt Adam was made a quicknyng ſpirite. Howebeit that is not fyrſt which is ſpirituall: but that whiche is naturall, and then that which is ſpirituall. The firſt man is of the earth, earthy: The ſeconde manne is the Lorde from heauen (heauenly.) As is the earthy, ſuche are they that are earthy. And as is the heauenly, ſuch are they that are heauenly. And as we haue borne the image of the earthy, ſo ſhal we beare the ymage of the heauenly. This ſaie I brethren, that fleſhe and bloud can not enherite the kingdome of God: Neither doth corrupcion inherite vncorrupcion. Beholde, I ſhewe you a miſtery. We ſhal not al ſlepe, but we ſhall al be chaunged, and that in a momente, in the twynkelyng of an iye by the laſte trumpe. For the trumpe ſhal blowe, & the dead ſhal riſe incorruptible, and we ſhalbe chaunged. For this corruptible muſt put on incorrupcion:& this mortal muſt put on immortalitie. When this corruptible hath put on incorrupcion, & this mortal hath put on immortalitie: then ſhal be brought to paſſe the ſaying that is writtē: Death is ſwalowed vp in victory: Death where is thy ſting? Hell where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſynne: & the ſtrēgth of ſinne is the law. But thākes be vnto God, which hath geuen vs victory, through our lord Ieſus Chriſt. Therfore my deare brethrē, be ye ſteadfaſt & vnmouable, alwaies riche in the worke of the lord, foraſmuch as ye know, how that your labour is not in vaine, in the lord.
            
            
               The leſſon ended, then ſhal the prieſt ſaye.

            LYke as the hart deſireth the water brookes:Quem admedum. pſal. xlii. ſo longeth my ſoule after thee, O God.
            My ſoule is a thirſt for god, yea, euen for the liuing god: when ſhall I come to appeare before the preſence of God? My teares haue beene my meate day and nighte: whyle they dayly ſay vnto me, where is nowe thy god?
            Nowe when I thinke thereupon, I powre out my heart by my ſelfe: for I went with the multitude, and brought them furth vnto the houſe of God, in the voyce of praiſe and thankeſgeuing, emong ſuche as kepe holy day.
            Why art thou ſo full of heauines (O my ſoule) and why art thou ſo vnquiete within me?
            Put thy truſt in god, for I wil yet geue him thankes, for the helpe of his countenaunce.
            My God, my ſoule is vexed within me: therefore will I remember thee concerning the land of Iordane, and the litle hill of Hermonim.
            One deepe calleth an other becauſe of the noyſe of thy water pypes: al thy waues and ſtormes are gone ouer me. The lorde hath graunted his louing kyndeneſſe on the daye tyme: and in the nighte ſeaſon dyd I ſyng of hym, and made my prayer vnto the god of my lyfe.
            I will ſay vnto the God of my ſtrength, why haſte thou forgotten me? why goe I thus heauelye, whyle the enemye oppreſſeth me?
            My bones are ſmitten a ſoonder, whyle myne enemies (that trouble me) caſt me in the teeth: namely while they ſay dayly vnto me, where is nowe thy God?
            Why art thou ſo vexed (O my ſoule) and why arte thou ſo diſquieted within me?
            O put thy truſt in god, for I will yet thanke hym whiche is the helpe of my countenaunce, and my God.
            Glory be to the father, and to the ſonne: & to the holy goſt.

               OF CEREMONIES
               ❧ Why ſome be aboliſhed and ſome retayned.
            
               OF ſuche Ceremonies as be vſed in the Churche, and haue had their beginnyng by thinſtitucion of man: Some at the firſt were of godly intent and purpoſe deuiſed, and yet at length turned to vanitie and ſuperſticiō: Some entred into the Church by vndiſcrete deuocion, and ſuche a zele as was without knowleage: and forbecauſe they were winked at in the beginning, they grewe dayly to more and more abuſes, whiche not onely for their vnprofitableneſſe, but alſo becauſe they haue muche blynded the people, and obſcured the glory of God, are worthy to be cut away, and cleane reiected. Other there be, whiche although they haue been deuiſed by man: yet it is thought good to reſerue them ſtill, aſwell for a decent ordre in the Churche (for the whiche they were firſt deuiſed) as becauſe they pertaine to edificacion: Wherunto all thynges doen in the Churche (as the Apoſtle teacheth) ought to be referred. And although the kepyng or omittyng of a ceremonie (in it ſelfe conſidered) is but a ſmall thing: Yet the wilful and contēptuous tranſgreſſion, and breaking of a common ordre, and diſcipline, is no ſmal offence before God. Let al thinges bee done emong you (ſayeth Saincte Paule) in a ſemely and due ordre. The appointemēte of the which ordre, pertaineth not to priuate menne: Therfore no manne ought to take in hande, nor preſume to appointe or alter any publike or common ordre in Chriſtes Churche, excepte he be lawfully called and autorized therunto. And whereas in this our tyme, the myndes of menne bee ſo diuerſe, that ſome thynke it a greate matter of conſcience to departe from a peece of the leaſte of theyr Ceremonies (they bee ſo addicted to theyr olde cuſtomes) and agayne on the other ſyde, ſome bee ſo newe fangle that they woulde innouate all thyng, and ſo doe deſpyſe the olde that nothyng canne lyke them, but that is newe: It was thought expediente not ſo

muche to haue reſpecte howe to pleaſe and ſatiſfye eyther of theſe parties, as howe to pleaſe God, and profite them bothe. And yet leſte any manne ſhould bee offended (whom good reaſō might ſatiſfie) here be certaine cauſes rendered, why ſome of the accuſtomed Ceremonies be put awaye, and ſome be retained and kept ſtill.
            Some are put awaye, becauſe the great exceſſe and multitude of them hathe ſo encreaſed in theſe latter daies, that the burthen of them was intollerable: wherof ſaincte Auguſtine in his tyme complained, that they were growen to ſuche a noumbre: that the ſtate of chriſtian people was in wurſe caſe (concerning that matter) then were the Iewes. And he counſayled that ſuche yocke and burthen ſhoulde be taken awaye, as tyme woulde ſerue quietely to doe it. But what woulde ſaincte Auguſtine haue ſayed yf he hadde ſeen the Ceremonies of late dayes vſed among vs? wherunto the multitude vſed in his tyme was not to bee compared. This our exceſſiue multitude of Ceremonies, was ſo great, and many of them ſo darke: that they dyd more confounde, and darken, then declare and ſetteforth Chriſtes benefites vnto vs. And beſides this, Chriſtes Goſpell is not a Ceremoniall lawe (as muche of Moſes lawe was,) but it is a religion to ſerue God, not in bondage of the figure or ſhadowe: but in the freedome of ſpirite, beeyng contente onelye with thoſe ceremonies whiche doe ſerue to a decente ordre and godlye diſcipline, and ſuche as bee apte to ſtirre vppe the dulle mynde of manne, to the remembraunce of his duetie to God, by ſome notable and ſpeciall ſignificacion, whereby he might bee edified.
            ¶Furthermore, the moſt weightie cauſe of the aboliſhement of certaine Ceremonies was, that they were ſo farre abuſed, partely by the ſuperſticious blindenes of the rude and vnlearned, and partelye by the vnſaciable auarice of ſuche as ſoughte more theyr owne lucre then the glorie of God: that the abuſes coulde not well bee taken awaye, the thing remayning ſtyll. But nowe as concerning thoſe perſones, whiche peraduenture will bee offended for that ſome of the olde Ceremonies are retained ſtill: Yf they conſyder, that wythoute ſome Ceremonies it is not poſſible to kepe anye ordre or quite diſcipline in the church: they ſhall

eaſilye perceiue iuſte cauſe to refourme theyr iudgementes. And yf they thinke muche that anye of the olde dooe remayne, and woulde rather haue all deuiſed a newe: then ſuche menne (grauntyng ſome Ceremonies conueniente to bee hadde) ſurelye where the olde maye bee well vſed: there they cannot reaſonablye reproue the olde (onelye for their age) withoute bewraying of theyr owne folye. For in ſuch a caſe they oughte rather to haue reuerence vnto them for theyr antiquitie, yf they wyll declare themſelues to bee more ſtudious of vnitie and concorde, then of innouacions and newe fangleneſſe, whiche (as muche as maye bee with the trewe ſetting foorthe of Chriſtes religion) is alwayes to bee eſchewed. Furthermore, ſuche ſhall haue no iuſte cauſe with the Ceremonies reſerued, to bee offended: for as thoſe bee taken awaye whiche were moſte abuſed, & dydde burden mennes conſciences withoute any cauſe: So the other that remaine are retained for a diſcipline, and ordre, whiche (vpon iuſt cauſes) may be altered and chaunged, and therfore are not to be eſtemed egual with goddes lawe. And moreouer they be neyther darke nor dumme ceremonies, but are ſo ſet forth that euery man may vnderſtande what they dooe meane, and to what vſe they do ſerue. So that it is not like that they, in time to come, ſhoulde be abuſed as the other haue been. And in theſe all our dooynges wee condemne no other nacions, nor preſcribe anye thing, but to oure owne people onelye. For we thinke it conueniente that euery countreye ſhould vſe ſuche ceremonies, as they ſhall thynke beſte to the ſetting foorth of goddes honour & glorye: and to the reducyng of the people to a moſte perfecte and Godly lyuing, without errour or ſuperſticion: and that they ſhoulde putte awaye other thinges, whiche from time to time they perceyue to be moſte abuſed, as in mennes ordinaunces it often chaunceth diuerſlye in diuerſe countreyes. *⁎*
