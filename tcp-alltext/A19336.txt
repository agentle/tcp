               THis preſent treatyſe is deuyded in four pryncypall partes. Of the whiche euery parte conteyneth thre other ſynguler partes as in the maner folowyng is ſhewed.
            
            
               ¶ Pars prima.
               ¶ The fyrſt pryncypall parte is of the bodely dethe. And therunto belongeth thre other ſynguler partes.
               ¶ The fyrſt of the thre is how remembraūce of dethe cauſeth a man to meke and humble hym ſelfe folio .ii.

               ¶ The thyrde is howe Remembraunce of deth cauſeth a man vncōſtrayned to take vpon hym to do penaūce and to accepte it with a glad herte folio .xv.
            
            
               ¶ Pars ſecunda.
               ¶ The ſeconde pryncypall parte is of the laſte day of Iugement & conteyneth in hym ſelfe thre other ſynguler partes.
               ¶ The firſt of theſe .iii. is how accuſacōn yt ſhall be atte the day of Iugement is thyng to be dred folio .xxiii.
               ¶ The ſeconde is how the laſt day of Iugement is terryble & not without cauſe. for ther muſt be gy

uen a due rekenyng and acompt of euery thynge folio .xxvii.
               ¶ The thyrde is how ye terryble abydyng of the extreme ſentence cauſeth doubtes to be had of the Iugement folio xxxiiii
            
            
               ¶ Pars tercia.
               ¶ The .iii. pryncypall parte is of helle or of the Infernall gehenne & conteyneth in it ſelfe thre other ſynguler partes.

            ¶ Explicit tabula.
         
         
            
            ¶ Here after foloweth the prologue of the foure laſt thynges.
            MEmorare nouiſſima et meternū
               non peccabis Eccleſiaſtici ſeptimo capitulo. Eccleſiaſticus ſayth in his ſeuenth Capitre theſe wordes folowynge Bere well in thy mynde the laſt thynges / & thou ſhalt neuer falle in ſynne. Alſo Saynte Auſtyn ſayth in his book of me dytacyons. That man ought rather haue in fere and eſchewe the abhomynacōn & fylthe of ſynne / than ony other crueltees of the Infernall tormentes. Loo thenne how ye knowlege of theſe four laſt thynges and frequentyng the memorye & remembraūce of them called vs from ſynne / and draweth vs to vertue / & conformeth vs to all gode werkes. Wherfore by the helpe of the dyuyne Inſpyracyon I haue purpoſed to reherſe and ſaye a lytyll of theſe four tynges. As whiche they be / and what they be / and alſo to declare ſomwhat of euery of them ſyngulerly by them ſelfe / precyouſly & dygnely by ſaynges & auctorytees of ſayntes / and generally by examples and ſaynges of auctoryſed clerkes. It is to be noted that after the ſayeng of ſaynces men ſayt comynly. ther be foure the laſt thynges. And whiche they be it appereth clerely by the wordes of Saynt Bernard in a ſermon where he ſayth

in all thy werkes haue remembraunce of thy laſte thynges / whiche be four. That is to wyte fyrſte. Bodely dethe. Seconde. The daye of Iugement▪ Thyrde. The paynes of helle. Fourth. The glorie of heuen. O what thyng is more horrible than dethe. What thyng is more dredefull & terryble than ye day of Iugement. what thyng is more Importable to be ſuffred than the gehēne & paynes of helle And what is a more Ioyefull blyſſe than celeſtyall glorye. Saynt Bernard ſayd in the ſame ſermon Theſe ben the four wheles of the chare / wherof the Remembraunce bryngeth mānes ſoule to the euerlaſtyng glorye of paradyſe. Theſe ben alſo iiii. moeuynges yt awake the ſpiryte of man to ye ende that he diſprayſe alle worldly thynges & retorne vnto his creatour & maker. Lo it is then both cōuenyent & proufytable yt they be had contynuelly in remembraūce. & therfore ſayth ye wyſe man in ye xxviii. chapitre of Eccleſiaſticꝰ. Bere in thy mynde ye laſt & fynall thyng is & loke alway perfyghtly vpon them to thentent yt they may be ſurely fixed & printed in thy memorie Now ſyn all this proceſſe princypally & ſoueraynly enforſeth hymſelfe tenduce euery crature to haue an aſſured mynde & an hole remembraūce of theſe iiii. laſt thynges / & yt they may cordyally be enprynted with in your hertes. Therfor it is conſonant & accordyng yf it ſo may pleaſe. yt this preſent treatyſe may be entytled and

bere the name of the Cordyall.
         
      
      
         
            ¶ Thus endeth the prologue of this booke named Cordyall. Whiche treateth of the four laſt and fynall thynges that ben to come. And here begynneth the fyrſte parte of the ſayd four laſt thynges.
            
               THe fyrſt parte of the four laſt thȳ
                  ges. wherof the remembraunce withdraweth a man fro ſynne is deth preſent or temporell And therfore ſeyth ſaynt Bernard in a bok called the Myrour of monkes. The moſt ſouerayn phyloſophye is to thynke all way on deth. And he that beryth it in his mynde in what place ſo euer he go ſhall neuer ſynne. Saynt Auſtyn ſayth in his boke of exortacyons. There is noo thyng that ſoo well reuoketh and calleth a man from ſynne as often Remembraūce of dethe. Certayn it is yt thynge whiche cauſeth a man to be humble to dyſprayſe hymſelfe and to do penaunce.
            
            
               
                  ¶ How Remembraūce of dethe maketh a man to be humble & meke.
               
               ¶ The fyrſt chapitre of the fyrſt parte pryncypal
               
                  I Say that recordyng the Remē
                  braūce of deth maketh a man to be meke & humble hym ſelfe. And therfor ſayth Saynt Auſtyn in the book that he

made of our lord. A man knowyng himſelfe to be mortall. it ſhal put from hym all maner of pryde In very trouthe all our other thynges as well good as badde be incerteyne. But of deth oonly we maye be well enſured And how be it that the hour therof to vs is hydde and incerteyn. Yet alway ſhe is approchyng & ſhal ſurely come without longe taryeng. And to this purpoſe ſayth Eccleſiaſtics in his .xiiii. chapitre. Bere well in remembrance that deth ſhal not tarye. It is alſo wryten in Thoby yt deth haſteth & yt there may no fleeng 
                     •
                  uayle. Alſo by the comune lawe of nature euery man muſt paye his mortall trybute. Saynt Bernarde ſayth in a ſermon O wretched man why dooſt thou not dyſpoſe thy ſelfe to be redy at all houres / thynke that thou arte now dede / lyns thou knoweſt well that neceſſaryly it behoueth the to dye. Remembre wel how thyn eyen ſhall tourne in thy hede & the veynes breke in thy body. & thyn herte ſhal deuyde in two partes by the righte ſharpe anguyſſhe and payne of deth. Who is he thenne yt ought not to drede & make hȳſelfe humble. whan he knoweth certaynely yt he muſt retourne and become erthe. Now truly there ſhall be none excepcyon of perſones. But al ſhall paſſe that waye For as it is wryten in the ſeconde booke of kynges. Whe ſhall all dye / and the erthe ſhall ſwolowe vs as it dooth water caſt therupon / whiche neuer

retourneth. We rede alſo that this worde (Mors) in latyn maye well ſo be called. For it is a bytter morſell vnto all men in ſoo moche yt no creature maye eſcape it. And therfore it is ſayd in the boke of dyſprayſyng of the worlde. Dethe cutteth doun and dyſtroyeth all thynges create and made in fleſhe. She bothe beteth doun the hye men & lowe / for the hath domynacion vpon worldly lyuyng thynges She regneth Imperyally ouer the nobles and dredeth no lyuyng creature / for her power is comyn ouer prynces and dukes. She taketh aſwell the yonge as the olde. And whan ſhe ſmyteth / ſhe hath mercy of no creature. Alle thynges create in fleſſhe peryſſheth vnder her honde Nor ther be none ſo ſtronge / but that the beteth them doun without reſcuſe. And ther is no thynge beryng lyfe / but that ſhe deſtroyeth and waſteth it without ony eſcape. And the neyther taketh mede allyaunce ne frendſhyp. What ſhall I ſhore ſaye / euydently dethe ſpareth no body. For neyther poore ne ryche ſhall mowe eſcape out of her cheyne. Certaynly I vnderſtande now that dethe is thende of all worldely lyuynge thynges. And therfore it is wryten in Ietha the Poete. That deth taketh away and dooth anyntyſe all quycke thynges. Lo it is not ſayde that the wyſe Cathon and the good Socrates ben dede. Whiche gyueth example that there is neyther ſcyence

ne doctryne that may preſerue one fro the ruynouſe darte of deth. It is writen in Eccleſiaſtes in the ſeconde chapitre. Aſwell dyeth the wyſe man as the fole. It is wryten in Iſaye in the .xxxiii. chapitre. Were are now become the lettred men. where ben the prechers of the worde of god. Where be they that were wont to teche the childern. Theſe queſtions implyed as moche as to ſaye they lyue not / & be goon & paſte in the comyn courſe with other & dede of this worlde. Now by cauſe Ietha named but only the two afore ſpecyfyed. I praye the telle me / Where is now Hector of Troye / where is become Iulius Cesar / where is Alexander the grete / where is Iudas Machabeꝰ / where is the myghty Sampſon. where is Craſſus the riche / where to the fayre Abſolon / where is Galyen the phyſycyen / & Auycenne his felowe / where is the wyſe Salomon / where is Aryſtocle the phyloſopher / & where is Virgyle the right experte poete / be not all theſe dede and paſſed out of this worlde as pylgryms and geſtes. & departed hens in a right ſhort ſpace. yes certaynly ther is not one lefte a lyue of them. al their Ioyes were but vanytees and are fayled / & theyr dayes be conſumed & paſſed. & as the Pſalter ſeyth man paſſed his dayes reſemblyng a ſhadowe & one tyme he is hole & ſtrō
                  ge of all his membres / & on the morow ſeke & leyde in the erthe. And as Cathon ſayth. Our lyfe

is gyuen vnto vs to be full of doubte and of fragylyte. This appereth alſo clerely by a phyloſophre named (Secundus) whom thēperour (Adryane) queſtyoned with of yt beyng & theſtate of man whiche anſwered as foloweth. Man is ſubget vnto deth  doſt of the place where he is a voyager paſſyng / ſemblably vnto a pece of ſnowe. Alſo lyke a reed bery and lyke a newe apple by whiche thynge is euydencly ſhewed / how frayle / how ſleder / & alſo how lytyll endurȳ
                  ge is the lyfe of a man. And not oonly the lyf of poure people. But alſo the lyfe of alle humane creatures / be they neuer ſo ryche or puyſſaūt. For deth is a comyne thynge & ſpared noo body. And alle be it ſhe is cruwell and peruerſe / yet ſhe kepeth egally one lawe in takyng as wel kynges & prynces as poure folkes. Thus geueth ſhe grete cauſe to wepe yf it be welred & taken that is wryten of her. And therfore ſeyth (Iob) in the xx chapytre of his book of the riche fyers and orgulous man. All though his pryde be inhaūſed vnto the ſkye yt his hede ſhold touche ye clowdes / yet in then de he ſhal torne to nough te & be lyke a dong hyll. And they that haue ſeen hym ſhall axe / where is he now / and noo thynge ſhalbe foūde of hym / nomoie thā of a fleyng dreme paſſed in the nyghte. Baruch) in his .iii. chapytre demaūdeth / where be nowe the prynces of ye people ye where woute to haue domynacion ouer ye

Tell me nowe where be the Amerouſe people of this worlde yt late were among vs. In trouthe there is nothyng lefte of them but aſſhes & wormes. Thynke thenne and remembre often tymes / what thyng they be / and what they haue ben here tofore.

And to be plonged togyder in thebrachementes or paynfull Iehennes ſempyternall with them yt haue ben there felawes in doyng ſynnes & commyttyng vyces withoute repentaunce penaunce & ſatyſfaccyon.

                  uyleged for as it is wryten in the book of ſapience the .vii. chapytre / the entre of this lyfe is one and comune to all & ſemblably ſoo is the Iſſue. Iob ſayth in his xx chapytre. This man dyeth ſtronge luſty and riche / his bowelles be full of greece and his bones full of mery. And this other dyeth lene and feble full of ſorowe and withoute ony riches / that notwithſtondyng they ſhall ſlepe both in powdre and wormes ſhall ete them. Loo how the riche and puyſſaunt men of this world haue theyr deth comune and egall with the poore people. And therfore it is wryten in (Eccleſiaſte) in the x chapytre The lyfe of al puyſſant lordſhip is righte breyf. For this day this man is a kyng / & tomorow he is dede. of ſuche a kyng is red in the ſeconde chapytre of the fyrſt boke of Machabees how his glory is a foule doūghyll and as vyle as a worme / he is to day enhaunſed / and to morowe ther is nothyng to be foū
                  de of hym / we haue an exāple accordyng of one

of the hygheſt and mooſt excellence prynce of this worlde. That is to wete Alexandre the grete kynge of Macedone / that ſubdewed vnto his obeyſance the vnyuerſal worlde in ſuche maner / that he was demed to be only lord of the erthe. And it is redde that this Alexandre the grete ſomtyme kynge of Grece obteyned many vyctoryes in many ſtraunge londes. And in his goynge by diuerſe regyons ſubdewed vnto his Iuriſdiccyon all the worlde. And in a nother place is red of hym that he was kynge of kynges / and that he ſaw all Realmes ſubget vnto hym. wherby the voys of his renomme and fortune made an hole monarche That is to ſay an hole Empyre of al the worlde. For it was ones alle bonde & ſubget vnto him without dyſobeyſſaunce. And ſoo he was gretteſt of alle the large worlde. But what thyng therof enſued. After he hadde tryumphantly goten the only Empyre of the vnyuerſall worlde / was not that ye ſtableneſſe of regne. the ꝑpetuyte of myghte / the helthe of his body and the longe enduryng of his lyf naturall. Certeynly noo. But he was ſubdewed by ye ſame thynge that is comune vnto all / that is to wete. Dethe / whiche is the laſt recourſe after alle fortune and deſtenyes. Than myghte Alexander well ſay atte houre of his dethe as Iob ſayde in the xvi. chapytre of his boke. I am he that ſomtyme was riche and mygh

ty / & ſodeynly am beten downe / for he obteyned onnly his Empyre. But oonly by the ſpace of .xii yeres. And therfore it is wryten of hym in a nother place. That he regned and was obeyed xii. yeres. And after that he was ſubget vnto dethe / of whome lyueth yet the renomme & can not dye. Semblably compleynynge hym ſelfe of the deth. he myght ſaye as is wrytey in (Iob) the xix chapytre. My glory hath dyſpoyled me / and hath taken away the crowne fro my hede. ſhe hath alſo vtterly deſtroyed me. where thrugh I am loſt. Lo how it appereth manyfeſtely herby. ye deth is thende of all men. And alſo yt how be it (Iulius ceſar) had all the worlde vnder his Empyre / yet his glorye fayled hym & reſted lorde but of a tombe of viii fote longe. Wherby it ſemeth that the mageſte Royall all worldly puyſſance all proſperous thynges / & the ordynaunce of dayes / paſſe brefly from man withoute taryenge when the hour of deth is comen / & therfore ſeyth an other poete. yf yt be wyſe. thy wyſdom departeth with thy deth / yf yt be habondaūt in rycheſſe / it leueth the atte thy deth / yf thou be a prudent man / thy prudence fynyſſheth with thy deth / yf yt be honeſt / by dethe is it taken from the / yf yt be ſtronge thy myght fayleth the by deth. Certeynly thenne I now knowe that the yeres yt paſſe / taketh from vs all thynges / wherfore then yf yt be ryche ſtronge or fayre. what vayleth

it / yf thou be a byſſhop / a priour or an abbot what vayleth it / yf thou be a grete excellente myghty lord / yf thou be a kynge or a pope / what vayleth it. all paſſeth right haſtly without longe taryeng. And here reſteth but oonly the merytes / wherof ye good ſhall cauſe vs to be gloryfyed. And therfore ſayd Iſydore in an omely. My right welbeloued bretheren / we oughte to thynke how breef & ſhort is the worldely felycyte / how lytyll is the glorye of this worlde / and how frayle & faylynge is the temporall myght therof And therfore euery man maye ſaye / where be the kynges. where be the prȳ
                  ces / where be the emperours / where be the riche and myghty men of this worlde. they be all paſt lyke a ſhadow & vanyſſhed lyke a dreme of ye nyght. for though one wolde ſeke them they wyll not be foūde here / what ſhall I more ſay / the kynges be paſſed & ye prynces be dede neuertheleſſe there be many yt wenen to lyue long & neuer to dye. But alwayes to reſt in this preſent lyfe. Certeynly they be foles. For it ſhall not be ſo. But they ſhall dye as other prynces & men haue done. For as Seneca ſeyth in his epiſtles to Lucyll. The yſſue of this preſent lyfe is deth. It is writen by a poete named Ieta. The deth vndothe all lyuyng thyng / and euery lyfe fynyſſeth by dethe. Certayn the worldly deth cōcludeth all ye vayn felycytees of men. For yf thou dyde preche ye fayth of Abraham / the pyte of

Ioſeph. The charyte of Moyſes. The ſtrengthe of Samſon. The ſwetneſſe of Dauyd The myracles of Elyzeus. The richeſſe and prudence of kyng Salomon the beaute of Abſolon. And in we pynf occupyed the extremytees of all theſe in declaryng theyr endes / the hyſtoryes wolde ſhewe yt there is but one concluſyon. That is to ſay deth. Here it appereth righte manyfeſtly by the thyng a fore ſayd / that heaute lynage condycions wytte richeſſe nor worſhyp can not kepe a man / but that he muſt ſtumble & fall & rotourne to aſſhes. for all thyng that is engendred renneth alway towarde his deth. Ouyde ſayth yt all thyng that is engendied aſketh & requyreh to come agayne to theyr vnyuerſall modre. That is to ſaye the erthe. For all that hath ben and paſte-afore / maye be reſembled to a rennyng ryuer. Semblably I fele it by myſelfe wretche. that am brought all mooſt to nothynge / and haue not knowen hit. for my dayes be paſte fro me lytyll / and lytyll as a ſhadowe. and I am dryed as the wydered hey. Certeynly we be no thyng but powder. Mennes dayes be lyke the floures in a medowe. And them ſelfe may be lykeneth to the heye. Now auyſe the thenne / for man is a thyng that endureth but ſhort ſpace and is of reſemblaūce to the floure / that groweth in the medowe. It is wryten in Iſaye the .xl. chapitre All humane fleſſhe is hey / and his glory

lyke the flours of the felde. Verely all people be heye / and all heye dryeth and wydereth / as the floure that is fallen But the worde of oure Lorde remayneth and is perdurable / wherfore then dothe a man ſet hym ſelfe in pompe and pryde beynge lyke the wydred hey of the felde. It is wryten by Innocente in the boke of our myſerable condycyons. That humayn fleſſhe is the veſſell of fylthe / and a veſſell of teeres / a drye thought / a ſtynkyng ſacke. The lyfe of the fleſſhe is laboure. The concepcyon of the fleſſhe is but fylthe. The ende therof is rotenneſſe. And the byrthe is but vyle. It was fyrſt a ſparme. That is to ſaye. The ſeed of man / and now it is a ſtynkynge ſacke. and after fynally ſhall be wormes mete in the erthe. Now wherfore ſholde a man then be proude. Saynt Bernard ſeyth in his book of Meditacyons / wherfore ſholde a man waxe proude ſythen ye concepcōn of man is in ſyn̄e. And of all the byrthe in payne / the lyfe in labour / & neceſſaryly all muſte dye. And after deth tourne to wormes / and after wormes to fylthe & ſtenche. Loo thus fynally euery man is clerely conuerted & torned out of all humanyte. Conſyder than the begynnyng of thy lyfe / the myddle / & alſo the laſt ende. And thou ſhalte fynde therin a ryghte grete occaſyon and cauſe to meke and humble thy ſelfe. Nowe what ſayſt yt / what thynkeſt yt / what rekenynge

makeſt thou of thy ſelfe. arte thou ought but powder of the erth. It is wryten in the .xii. chapytre / but more playnly in the iii. chapytre of the ſame Eccleſiaſtes. The powdre recometh to the erthe that it come fro That is to wete to right a fowle roten erth full of wormes And therfore wryteth. Iob in his .xvii. chapytre. I haue ſayd to rotenneſſe / thou art my fader and my moder / and I haue ſayd to the wormes ye be my brethern & my ſuſtres. It is redde in Eccleſiaſticus in the xvii chapytre that euery man is erth and aſſhes / and therof haue take theyr beyng. And alſo it was ſayd to a man. Thou arte but powdre / & to powdre ſhalt retorne. And as Aleyn amonyſſeth & warneth the / when yu ſhalte lye in the colde erth. thou ſhalt torne to powdre & wormes mete / and from thenſforth there ſhall no creature be in wyll to loke vpon the. For thy fleſſhe ſhall be more ranke in ſtynche than the fleſſhe of a roten hounde. To this purpoſe ſayth ye holy man Saynt Bernarde / what is a more vyle and ſlynkyng thynge than the careyne of man. And what is a more odeous thynge to beholde thā a dede man The more delectable he hath been in his lyffe to the contrarye his loke ſhalbe horryble after his dethe / what ſhall it proufyte vs richeſſes / delectacyons and worldely worſhyppes. The richeſſe defende vs not from dethe. nor delectacōns from the

wormes. nor the worſhippes from foule ſtynkynges. O myghty god eternall / in how myſerable chaunce is man incloſed Certeyne my righte dere frende / yf thou though▪ teſt dylygently of ye thynges afore ſayd. thou ſholdeſt therby fynde a right grete occaſyon to meke and humble thyſelfe. For the Remembraūce of dethe cauſeth humylyte in man. It appereth well by the thrydde booke of Lrynges in the .xxi. chapytre of kynge Achab / whiche when he herde by Hely the manaſſynge of dethe / and that it approched hym. He meked hȳ ſelfe in ſuche wyſe that oure Lorde ſayde to the forſayd Hely. Seeſt thou not how Achab humbled hymſelfe for me. It is ſayde alſo that ſome tyme / whenne men made and created a pope. there was brought before hym a pece of flax and therin ſet fyre / ſayeng this wordes folowynge. Righte thus paſſeth the vayne glorye of this worlde. Lyke to ſaye. That as the fyre brenneth lyghtly the flaxe / and conuerteth hit in to aſſhes. Semblably the glorye of this worlde fayleth and paſſeth. Iſydory reporteth alſo. That auncyently it was accuſtomed atte the coronacyon of the Emperour of Conſtantynoble Whenne he was ſette in his mooſt glorye. A maſſon ſholde come before hym & ſhewe hym thre or foure maner of marbell ſtones / ſayeng that he ſholde cheſe. of whiche of thoſe he wolde haue his tombe made. It is redde

of Saynte Iohan the aumener that was ſome tyme patryarke of Alexander that hadde commaunded to make his Tombe / and wolde in noo wyſe hit ſholde be fully fynyſſhed. And ordeyned that in grete and ſolempne feſtes / whenne he was in his hygheſt honoure / one ſholde come vnto hym and ſaye that thy Tombe is not fully accomplyſſhed nor perfourmed / gyue commaundementes that hit be fynyſſhed. For thou knoweſte not howe thou ſhalte dye / nor whanne that theff wyll come / whiche is to vnderſtonde the fende. That enforceth hym ſelfe alway to deſtroye ſoules. And whye dyde the Pope the Emperour and the patryarke theſe thynges / whiche where the men mooſt excellente in eſtate of all the worlde / but onely to confeſſe and knowelege to themſelfe that they were mortall / and that they oughte not to enhaunſe them ſelfe in pryde nor fortefye them in hope of longe lyfe / wherby they ſholde haue the more power in this vayne worldly glory / but that they myght haue before hem thenne the Remembraunce of dethe to cauſe them to be the more humble in alle theyr werkes. And therfore ſayth the prophete. Lino we alle people that men be comen and made of erthe. And therfore they muſte neceſſaryly dye. It is alſo wryten in Eccleſyaſtes in the .xli. chapytre. All thynges that be come of the erthe / ſhall

be conuerted agayne to the erthe / wherof man is comen as it is well knowen. And therfore ſeyth Iheremias the prophete in the .xxii. chapytre. Erthe. erthe. erthe. Now herken my wordes. He called man thryes erthe / by cauſe he maye ſoo be named in thie maners. Fyrſte he is erthe / for he is made of the erthe. Secondly his conuerſacyon is in the erthe. And fynally he retourneth in to the erthe. Soo is he erthe in his creacyon / in his conuerſacyon / and in his dethe. He is erthe by his nature in his lyfe. And in his ſepulture he hath ſanoured the erthe. he hath lyked the erthe / he hath deſyred and coueyted the erthe. The body of man is taken and doluen in the erthe. And yet he forgeteth the celeſtyall thynges / and pleteth for the terreſtyall. And geueth batayll for the erthe. He goothe. He cometh. And tourneth abowte the erthe to haue the erthe. And oftentymes in anguyſſhes / payne / and laboure / now here / now there. And alle for the erthe / and neuer ſeaſynge tyll he hym ſelfe / whiche is come from the erthe / be retourned agayne to his fyrſte moder. That is to ſaye / the erthe. It maye be ſayde / as it is wryten in the iii. book of the Liynges in the ſeconde Chapytre. Loo howe I departe and paſſe the comune waye of the vnyuerſall erthe. And for as moche as we be bounden with ſlyme of the erth / doūge of the erthe / and be right vyle

thynge / wherfore ſholde we thenne be proude of oure ſelfe / knowynge we be come from the erthe / lyuyng in the erthe / conuerſyng in the erthe / and fynally ſhall recourne in to the erth / as euery day it appereth euydently vn to all people
            
            
               
                  ¶ How Remembran̄ce of dethe maketh a man to dyſpyſe all thynges.
               
               ¶ The ſeconde chapytre of this fyrſte pryncypall parte.
               REmēbraunce of dethe cauſeth a man to myſlyke alle erthely vayne thynges. and to repute them as no thynge. Therfore ſayth Saynte Iherome in his prologue of the Bible. That eaſely he dyſpyſeth all bad thynge / that alwaye remembreth / howe he muſte dye. The concupyſcence of eyen is dyſpyſed whenne one remembreth that he ſhall ſhortly parte and leue alle erthely thynges. The concupyſcence of the fleſſhe is diſpyſed / whenne one remembreth / that his body ſhal become wormes mete. In a momente the pompe and pryde of this lyfe is ſette atte nought / whenne a man counterpeyſeth in his herte / how he that wolde be aboue all other / ſhall be haſtely caſte in to erthe vnder the fete of other. For this cauſe ſaythe Saynt Iherome in a pyſtle that he ſente vnto Lypryane. Remembre the well of thy dethe / and

thou ſhalt not ſynne. He thenne that alwaye bererth in remembraunce / how he muſt dye. diſprayſeth eaſely alle thynges preſente / dyſpoſyng hymſelfe to alle good thynges that be to come. Certaynly (Eſau) conſyderynge howe dethe was nyghe vnto hym / dyſprayſed lyghtely all worldely thynges. It is alſo wryten in (Geneſis) in the fyue and twenty chapytre. Loo beholde I dye and what ſhall proufyte me all thoos thynges that I am borne vnto. Iſydore) Alſo aduertyſynge hym ſelfe of the ſhortneſſe of this preſent lyfe / whiche is ſoo ſoone paſſed / and that all that men ſeme to haue in poſſeſſyon here ſhall be lefte ſodeynly by deth / exorted euery man to dyſprayſe ſuche thynges. Saynge yf thou wylte be in reſte and peas / deſyre no thynge of this worlde / and ſo thou ſhall be quyete in thy corage / yf thou put from the alle the deſyres and curyous beſyneſſes of this preſente lyfe. Set a parte alle thynge that may dyſtourbe and lette thy good purpoſe. be thou dede to the worlde / and the worlde to the / and as though thou were dede / beholde the vayn glorye of this worlde. And as a man paſſed / dyſſeuer▪ and depart the from the voluptuouſneſſe of this worlde. And as a man fynyſſhed / haue this world in no cheerte. And as a man paſſed oute of this worlde / purge the of all maner of fylthes. And alſo whyle thou art a lyue diſprayſe

all that thou mayſte not haue when thou art dede Seneca ſayth. that there may noo thyng proufyte the ſo moche in that temperaūce and diſprayſyng of all worldely thynges as ſhall do to thenke often of the ſhort endurynge / and the Incerteynte of this preſent lyfe. Thene my right dere frende / Remembre often in thy corage / howe thou muſte dye. It is redde in a booke made of the gyfte of dirde. Howe longe a go
                     •
                   / there was a righte wyſe phyloſophie that hooly abandoned hym to the vanytees of this wretched worlde / whiche in a tyme herde redde of the longe lyfe of Auncyente faders / and of eueryche of them was ſayd in the ende he is dede. As is wryten in Geneſis. in the fyfthe chapytre. Thenne he thoughte in hym ſelfe / that ſemblably deth ſholde happen vnto hym as it dyde vnto thoſe / for he was righte olde. And haſtely he entred in to relygyon / and toke the ordre of the frere prechoures / and was after made mayſter of Theologye in Parys. And from that daye forthe lyued a full holy lyfe. O how well hadde this man before his eyen the wordes of Eccleſiaſtes. in the enleuenthe chapytre. Sayeng. That man / whiche hadde lyued many yeres alwaye gladde and Ioyfull / he oughte to remembre well his laſte dayes / and the comynge of the horryble tenebrouſe tyme. For thenne it ſhall be but vanytee / 

to argue of thynges paſte for his remedye. Certeynly atte the daye of dethe appereth vanyte of vanytees / and howe alle thynges ſhall be thenne vayne and noughte. For this cauſe it is wryten in Eccleſiaſtes in the thrydde chapytre. Alle thynges here be reſtynge vnder vanytee / and trewe it is all thynges of this worlde / and eueryche of them be vayne. For our lyfe / and euery worldely creature is but vanytee. And therfore ſayth the Prophete. That vnyuerſally euery lyuynge man is vanytee. Thou weneſt to lyue longe / and many a yeres to poſſeſſe delycyouſly thy temporall goodes▪ Certayne my righte dere frende. It ſhall be alle other wyſe For man is made ſemblable vnto vanyte and his dayes paſſe as a ſhadowe. Beholde nowe and ſee howe thy dayes ſhall be but ſhorte / and thenne an other ſhall come and take thy poſſeſſyons. Vnto this purpoſe ſayth Cathon Promytte neuer to thy ſelfe that thou ſhalte haue longe ſpace of lyfe. For in what place ſoo euer thou entre / dethe foloweth alwaye the ſhadowe of thy body. And therefore yf thou loke vpon the wordes that be ſayde. And alſo conceyue dilygentely in thy herte that ſhall be ſhewed the here after / thou ſholdeſt rather ſay theſe wordes than otherwyſe. I goo nowe to my dethe / and truſte to lyue after by a longe ſpace. Alle

be it perauenture this is the laſt daye of my lyfe. The holy & bleſſed man Saynte Luke) ſayth in his xii. chapytre. O thou foule / this nyghte thy ſoule ſhall be axed of the and be certayne that the dyſpoſycyon of thy tabernacules is but lyghte. As is wryten in the ſecō
                  de epiſtle of ſaynt (Petre in ye fyrſt chapytre Thynke thenne that thou arte dede / when thou knoweſte neceſſaryly that after a nombre of yeres thou art certeyn to dye Therfore dyſprayſe all tranſytory thynges that muſte be haſtly left. as is to ſey withoute ony taryenge though it be lothe vnto the. The poete telleth ye wyſdom.

                  entis of londes poſſeſſyon of rycheſſe. the makynge of walled townes / the byldyng of houſes / the gloryous maner of lyuyng atte the table as well in pleaſant drynkes / as in delycyous metes. the feyre ſofte beddes well hanged and dreſſed the whyte table clothes / the bryght burnyſſed cuppes / the ryche garmentes contrary to good maner the grete flokkes or herdys of beeſtes. The grete countreyes of arable londes / the vyneyerdes plenteuouſly ſette with vynes / and the Ioye and the loue of his propre childern / yet ſhall alle this be relynquyſſhed paſſe and be loſte / and nothynge be founde therof here after. By theſe thynges maye be ſeen that in this preſente lyfe is noo thyng ſtable nor permanente / whiche oughte to cauſe diede. Therfore wryteth (Eccleſiaſtes) in

the ſeconde chapytre. I haue gretely exalted my werkes. I haue edyfyed me fayre houſes. I haue planted vynes. I haue made gardeyns / wherin I haue graffed of alle maner of trees. I haue alſo caſte poondes / and ſtagnes / and haue ſette trees in the foreſt I haue hadde ſeruauntes and chamberers. and grete companye in my houſholde more thanne euer hadde ony afore me in Iheruſalem. I haue had grete flockes of ſhepe / and droues of beſtes. I haue aſſembled for me golde and ſyluer. and gadered the treſoure of kynges / and of the prouynces / my neyghbours. And alſo haue herde afore me ſyngers / bothe men and wymmen / and many delectacōns of the childern of men. And haue done ſoo moche / that I haue ſurmounted in richeſſe alle that haue ben before me in Iheruſalem Wyſdome alſo hath alle wayes perſeuered in me and alle that euer myne eyen haue deſyred. I haue not denyed them not defended / but that they haue vſed all voluptuouſneſſe / and they haue had noo delectacyon / but in ſuche thynges that I had ordeyned them / & when that I tourned me & behelde well all theſe thynges / and the werkes that my handes had wrought & loked vpon the labour that I had many tymes ſwette in. & all for noughte. I perceyued then and knewe well / that all my werkes were but vanyte and affeccyon of ſpyryte. And yt vnder the ſonne

in this worlde was noo thyng permanent nor ſure. Now in trouth all thȳ

That al thyng of this world. yt was is & ſhalbe. peryſſeth in the moment of an houre. what proufyteth than to haue ben / to be nowe / or to be herafter. Certeyne thyſe be thre thynges blowyng without flours For all thyngis yt were be or ſhalbe haue a finyſſynge The worlde paſſeth & the concupyſcens therof alſo. And therfore it is ſayd / wherfore taketh a wyſeman thought for to gete treſoure whiche is ſone loſte. And ſaynt Bernarde ſayth in his book of medytacōns. wherfore maketh ony man treſour here of ryches / ſythen wt out delay bothe that yt is aſſembled & he that gadereth hit paſſen & be loſte togyder.

Euery man therfore thenne do penaunce / & deſerue the fruyte of grace. For here cometh ye lord to aſke the fruyte of our lyf For this cauſe Iob conſyderynge the ſhortneſſe of this preſente lyfe / had leuer and chaſe to haue repentaūce preſently / than afterwarde wherby ſholde growe no fruyte The ſame Iob ſayde in his .x. chapytre. ſhall not my ſhort dayes breefly fynyſſhe / yes in trouthe The lyfe preſent is right ſhorte. Alas then a lytyll whyle lete me cō
                  playne and bewayle my ſorowe a fore my departyng in to the tenebrous derkeneſſe of dethe with out retornyng. And it is alſo ſayd in Iob the xiiii. chapytre. That mannes dayes be breef. It is wryten in the fyrſt pyſtle ad Corintheos in ye evii. chapytre / the tyme is breef / were it not better then now breefly to ſuſteyne a lytyll payne / then afterward when it cannot profyt to repent without profyt & bewayle it infynytely. Saynt Auſtyn ſeyth ye better is a lityl bytterneſſe in ye mouthe / then eternally to ſuffre payn in al ye hole body of man. Alſo he ſeyth in a ſermon / yt ye lyfe of euery man frō his youthe to his age is but ſhort / though Adā lyued yet. & ſholde this day dye what ſholde it auātaged him to haue lyued ſo longe. ſothly lytyll or noughte / but he myght ſey ye tyme of my lyf is paſt And

alſo ſayth a wyſe man / what ſholde it profyte a man to lyue. CC. yeres when at his deth. he ſhal thynke all his lyfe is paſſed as wynde. And ſaynt Auſtyn ſayth vpon the Pſalter. If thou haddeſt lyued ſens Aoam was chaſed oute of paradyſe terreſtre tyll nowe / and that thou ſholdeſte dye this daye / thou ſholdeſt thynke thy lyfe not longe / whiche ſo ſoone ſholde paſſe. Now how longe ſoo euer a mannes lyfe be / take that it maye be lengthed aſmoche more to cauſe many yeres / yet it ſhall fayle and vanyſſhe / as the ſhynynge of the morowe ſonne. And the ſame. Saynte Auſtyn ſeyth in an Omely. that we be more frayle & brotyll / then though we were made of glaſſe. For al be it that glaſſe is brotyll / yet yf it be well kept it may endure right longe. But mannes lyfe be it neuer ſo well and dilygently kept it may not longe endure. Therfore it is wryten to the Hebrues in the .ix. chapitre. It is eſtablyſſhed and ordeyned euery creature ones to dye. And Senek ſayth in his book of remedyes ayenſt fortune That our lyfe is but a pylgremage & when one hath longe walked / he muſt fynally retorne This neceſſite to dye / & ſhortneſſe of ye lyfe of man was wel conſydered by ye paynym Xerſes. Of whom ſaynt Iherom wrote in a pyſtle to Elyodorꝰ ſayng yt this puyſſāt kyng xerſes / whiche ſubuerted ye monteyns & couored the ſees / beynge ones in right hye place loked

vpon the Infynyte multytude of his hooſt & tendrely wepte / by cauſe he knew yt none of thoos whom he behelde ſholde lyue ouer an. C. yeres It is a thyng right neceſſary in the worlde / yt mannes lyfe be not longe laſtynge. And as Balam ſayth. It is lykened to a tree hauyng .ii. wormes fretynge in the rote / the one blak & the other white in ye ſymylytude of the day & the nyght / whiche Inceſſantely gnawe the rote of the tree of lyfe. Saynt Auſtyn vpon the ſayng of Saynte Iohan in his .iii. chapitre treatyng vpon this queſtyon Quid eſt vita noſtra &c) This lyfe is a doubtfull lyfe / a blynde lyfe & a nedy lyfe / humours make hit to bolne. ſorowes make hit feble / hete dryeth hit / eyer dyſpoſeth hit to ſekeneſſe / mete maketh hit to ſwelle / faſtyng maketh hit lene / playes maketh hit to erre / waylynge deſtroyed hit / beſyneſſe conſtreyneth hit / ſewer

                  e maketh hit rude / rekles riches enhaunſeth hit pouerte abateth hit / wepyng abaſſheth hit / youthe maketh hit wanten / age maketh hit to yelde. ſekeneſſe maketh hit to breke. And after all this cometh deth / whiche deſtroyeth & maketh an ende therof wt all his Ioyes in ſuche wyſe. as whenne the Ioyes be paſt / all ſemeth as they had neuer ben. Alſo it is redde in the book of Sapyence in the .ii. chapitre. That the dayes of our lyfe nys but ſhorte / & yet are they full of greuaunce / we be made & wote not wherof

And after we ſhall be. as we hadde neuer ben. For oure dayes paſſen as dothe a ſhadowe. It is red in the ſame book of Sapyence in the ſame chapitre. That our lyf paſſeth like the trace of a clowde & ſhal fayle as the lytyll clowde. that is broken by the myghte of the ſonne beames. It is wryten in Iob the .vii. chapitre. Beholde how my dayes be all paſſed / and I ſhall goo forthe in the pathe / & ſhall neuer retourne ageyn. Alſo the ſame Iob ſayth in the .ix. chapitre My dayes are paſſed more lyghtly than a curroure or a meſſanger. They are gone lyghtly awaye as ſhyppes done that be charged with apples. Or as an egell dooth flee for his mete. Iob ſayth alſo My dayes be paſſed more lyghtly than clothe is cutte from the lome. and they be all waſted withoute ony hope of recouerey. O lord god Remembre then. is my lyfe oughte but wynde / & ſhall not my eyen retorne ageyn to ſee ye good thynges to come To ye purpoſe ſpeketh Petre de bloys in his boke called Aurora. My lyf ſhalbe ſooner out of this worlde / than a webbe of clothe cut from the lome Remēbre yu then how thy lyfe may be reſembled to the wynde. Loo now my righte dere frende howe ſhorte / howe lytyll / howe mutable / how diſceyuȳg is this our lyfe preſente / for as it is ſayd in Eccleſiaſtes in the .xviii. chapitre. It is grete age in a man to be .C. yere olde▪ but by ſucceſſion of tyme it is gretely amynyſſhed

It is wryten in the Pſalter. The dayes of our yeres be .lxx. & yf we may come to foure ſcore yere / the ſuperplus is no thynge but labour & ſorowe. But what is it of .lx. yere or yet of Cought this to be taken of a longe tyme & a grete ſpace of yeres. Certeynly nay in regarde towarde the ſempiternyte. It ought rather be named a moment thā a ſpace of tyme. for to oure lord a .M. yere is but as yeſterday. whiche lightly is paſt. Derely this lyfe in ſhort & tranſytory / paynfull & wretched / hit is not onely to be thoughte nor poyſed for the ſhorteneſſe. But moche more for the incerteynte therof whiche is doubtfull / and ful of caſuel peryll / & we be not ſure therof day nor hour. And whenne it ſheweth vs ſewerte & peas thenne ſodeynly cometh deth / & with hit perauenture ye falſe theif Sathan Therfore ſayth to vs a poete. who is he knowynge hymſelfe to lyue many yeres / ſens we knowe not whether we ſhall dye to morowe or ſooner. It is wryten in Iſaye the xxxviii. chapitre ſaynge. Dyſpoſe thy hous / for yu ſhalt dye ſone / & not longe lyue. Iſaye ſeyth alſo in the ſame Chapitre / yt my lyfe is hyt from me as a pece of clothe from the lome. And whenne I began fyrſt the lyffe. then began dethe to approche toward me. For this cauſe it is ſayde in the book of Sapience in the .v. chapitre / we be ſoone born. & ſone leue our beyng. To this purpoſe ſeyth Senek in his pyſtles. Eueryday

we dye. & euery day is taken away from vs parte of our lyfe. Than thus what is oure lyfe ought ellys but a paſſage / or a rennyng toward deth / & therfor it is not vnreſonable yt ſhe be lykened to an Orylage / whiche gooth alway from degre to degre cōtynually mouynge tyll it come to a certayne poynt / & then it ſtryketh ſodenly vpon ye belle / whiche cōſtreyneth the ſowne Semblably our lyfe paſſeth alway & renneth tyll it come to a certeyn poynte. That is to wyte The hour of our deth whiche oure lorde hath prefixed / and no man may it paſſe / and than our lyf falleth and fayleth without remedye. Awake thenne & entende wyſely to the ende of thy lyfe For thyn Orylage hath but fewe degrees to renne. and euery houre ſhe ouerpaſſeth many. And whenne it cometh to the laſte / thou ſhalt ſtomble ſodeynly in to the cauerne or caue of dethe. Now herken what a Poete ſayth. The preſente lyfe is ſhort alway fleynge / and fadeth as a ſhadowe / & departeth & falleth ſodeynly / when one wenes that ſhe be mooſt permanente and abydyng / & in the myddes of our lyfe / we be often at our deth. And therfore haue we in Eccleſiaſtes in the .ix. chapytre. That man knoweth not his ende / but as a fyſſhe taken with a nette / & the bryddes with a trappe. Semblably men be takē at inconuenyent tymes / thꝰ cometh our ende & dethe is ye laſt thyng to all thȳges beryng lyfe. It is

wryten in a book of the lyfe & of the dedes of grete Alexand

                  . O how happy ſholde a man be yf he had alwaye in Remembraunce of the eternall Ioyes / & drad deth yt is ordeyned as well to the nobles as to the poore peple whiche cometh to the grete peryll & daūger of the ſoule whenne it is unpurueyed. Loo here then my right dere frende / yu ſeeſt well yt the lyfe of man is but a thyng dyked aboute. & enuyroūde with ruynous deth / oure fleſſhe is but aſſhes. And ſuche as was the begynnyng / ſuche ſhalbe the ende / ſaynte Bernarde ſayth. whē
                  ne I Remembre that I am but aſſhes / and that myn ende approched my drede and fere is withoute ende / and I wexe colde as aſſhes. And therfore as▪ Saynt Gregory ſaythe. That man ſollycyteth well his good werkes / that thenketh allewaye vpon his laſt ende And we ſhold drede that euery day ſholde be oure laſte daye. And alwaye haue in mynde / that neceſſaryly we muſte dye / who maye haue thenne a bolde corage conſyderynge the ſhortneſſe the grete Incerteynte of oure lyfe / the approchyng of oure dethe whiche is comyng / who is he alſo yu ought not thynke dilygē
                  tely that our dayes & our yeres fayle and waſte as the ſmoke. And ye man naturelly born lyueth but a ſhort ſpace / and fadeth as a floure / and fleeth a waye lyke a ſhadowe / who is he alſo that calleth thyeſe thynges to mynde / and peyſes them

well in his herte / and ſo ſubdeweth the deuyll the fleſſhe and the worlde & repenteth hym in this ſhorte ſpace. To ſay you trouth there be none that deferre and be neclygent ſoo to doo / but oonly thoſe that be all blynded in malyce and lacke of grace. O how grete a payne ſhall enſewe of neclygence. Thappoſtle ſayth to the Hebrues in the ſeconde-chapitre. Howe ſhall we flee that dyſpyſe ſoo gret an helthe. As to ſay we myght haue heuen yf we wolde. And Saynte Effran ſayth. My right dere brotheren and frendes. yf we be neclygent in the lytyll ſpace of tyme that we haue nowe / we ſhall haue noo maner of excuſacion to allegge for remedye of our ſynnes. Therfore dyſprayſe not the ſhortneſſe of this tyme. But doo penaunce whyle ye haue ſpace here For after it wyll be to late & without fruyte. And better is to doo penaunce here / than Infynytely and worlde without ende to repente hit. Nowe haſte ye therfore and tary not. Leſt that ye fynally be ſhet out with the fyne fatuat and fonned virgyns. Saynt Mathewe ſeyth in his .xxv. chapitre Loo here is the ſpouſe come / and thoos that were redy / ben entred with hȳ to the weddyng / wherup on Saynt Gregory ſaythe. That the palays of the herte myghte well aſauoured howe wonderfull was that worde. Here is the ſpouſe whiche is come. How ſwete was that worde to them. that entred with hym to the

weddyng. And how bytter was ye other worde. the yates be ſhytte & cloſed. My dere frende yf yu dyde ſauour & vnd

                  ſtonde well all this thynges & beheldeſt them well in thyne hert. Certeynly yu woldeſt renne with all dilygence for to do penaūce. & wolde not leſe ſo vnproufytably. & without fruyte ye acceptable tyme & dayes of thy helthe / for no maner of voluptuoꝰ playſers or other ydleneſſe And as it is wryten in ye Apocalips in the .ii. chapitre. Remē
                  bre the fro whens thou arte falle or departed / and do penaunce. It is red howe in dayes paſſed it happened in the Abbey of Cleruaulx yt an holy man beyng in his prayers herde a voys makyng a pyteous lamentacyon. And as he aſked who it was. a ſoule anſwered ſayeng I am the ſoule of a dāpned man / complaynyng myne vnhappy cauſe of condemnacōn. And then he demaūded hym of his payn. whiche anſwered yt of all thynges yt cauſeth mooſt payn to a dāpned ſoule was loſſe of tyme / that god hadde ordeyned man by his grace that he in a lytyll tyme myghte haue done penaūce. whiche ſholde delyuere hym from the euerlaſtyng peynes of the gehenne of helle. To this purpoſe ſayd Hugo of ſaynt Dyctour. The lackyng of the ſighte of our lorde / and faylyng of all the goodes of grace / that we myght haue hadde ſholde ſurmoū
                  te and be more greuous vnto the / thanne all the Infernall tourmentes. Lete vs do good werkes

whyle we haue tyme / leſt we ſaye in repentaunce. As is ſayd in Iheremyas in the .viii. chapitre. That is to wete. Herueſt is paſt. Somer is fynyſſhed / & we be not ſaued / wherfore my frendes I requyre & humbly praye you / that ye wyll amende your ſelfe in ſhorte tyme & make you redy in this .x. hour / for the euenyng haſteth hym. And the rewarder ſhall come to yelde euery man after his werkes. Hit may appere by theſe examples / how Remēbraunce of dethe ſholde induce a man to do penaūce. It is red of a felonous & a cruell knyght. whiche wolde neuer accept nor do ony penaūce enioyned hym by pope Alexander. And at laſt the pope gaue hȳ his rynge / yt he ſholde here it on his fynger / by way of penaūce. And as often as he behelde him to thynke on his dethe. And whan he had boren hit a ſpace of tyme with ye Remembraūce on a day he come ageyn to the pope ſayng he was redy to ſhryue hȳ & to fulfyll euery other maner of penaunce. that he wolde enioyne hym. It is red of an other ſynner yt in lyke wyſe wolde do noo penaūce / & at laſt his confeſſoure enioyned hym / that he ſholde commaunde his ſeruaunt to preſente hym euery daye atte his table with the fyrſte meſſe / a ſtaffe the rynde ſcorched of / ſayenge. Syr Remembre that neceſſaryly ye muſt dye / not knowynge where / whenne / in what maner nor howe. And as this was a good whyle contynued

/ becauſe of that Remembraūce / all that he ete torned hym to grefe and trouble. And thenne he called agayne for his confeſſour / ſayeng he was redy to do and obey ony penaūce that he wolde ordeyne. For his herte was merueylouſly broughte in grete trouble by the fere of dethe / whiche he was in. Loo by theſe thynges a fore reherſed / appereth thenne clerely Inough how Remembraū
                  ce of deth cauſeth a man to humble hym ſelfe / to dyſpyſe all worldly thynges / and acceptably take vpon hym to doo penaū
                  ce and conſequently to eſchewe ſynnes And therfore my righte dere brethern & frendes. Remembre you often / ye & right often that ye ſhall dye. And ye here in your myndes the dethe / ye ſhalte well come by that remē

               ¶ Here begynneth the ꝓlogue of the ſeconde partye of the four laſt thynges.
               THe ſeconde parte of the foure laſte thynges wherof frequentynge ye Remembraūce reuoketh & calleth vs from ſyn̄e. Is the laſt and fynall day of Iugement / of whiche ye Remē

As who ſayth / yf yu kneweſt how ſtrayte a Rekenyng ſhalbe at the day of dome of all ſyn̄es aſwel gret as ſmale. Certeynly yu woldeſt not laughe / but rather ſorowe & complayne. Now is here the place to wepe and to put awaye ſynnes. And thoos that now wepe for theyr ſynnes ſhall laugh herafter. Saynt Gregory ſayth in his Omelye. That the gladneſſe of this tyme preſent ought to be but ſuche. as therby the bytterneſſe of the day of Iugemente be not put out of Remembraunce. Therfore it is wryten in Eccleſiaſtes the .xxxviii. chapitre. Here my Iugement in Remembraūce. And alſo our lord by his ꝓphete in ye pſalter ſeyth when I ſhall ſee or take the tyme. I wyll deme & do Iuſtyce to euery one. & Iohell ſayth in his laſt chapitre. Alle men aryſe & come togydres in to the vale of Ioſephat. For there I ſhall ſytte & Iuge all maner of peple aboute me. Iheremyas in his ſeconde chapitre ſayth yt our Lorde ſayth. I ſhall amownte with you in Iugement. Of this Iugement is wryten in Ozee the fourthe chapitre. Ye childern of Iſrahell / here ye the worde of our lord of the fynall Iugemente that perteyneth to oure Lorde vpon thenhabytantes of ye erth. Sothely this Iugement is gretely

to be doubted. Therfore ſayth the prophete. I dred for thy Iugementes. It is wryten in the book of Sapyence in the .v. chapytre. They that ſee the grete Iuge / ſhall be horrybly troubled / playnynge and waylyng the drede of theyr ſoules. Certeynly in this daye ſhall all people be troubled / & they that dwell in the vttereſt partye of the worlde ſhall fere thoſe tokens and ſygnes / & they ſhall doubte them / & not with oute cauſe. For they ſhall be merueylouſly horryble Saynt Luke ſeyth in his xxi chapitre / whenne the ſone of man ſhall ſhewe hymſelfe. That is to ſey The childe of the virgyne marye comynge in a clowde in mageſte with a gret puyſſaūce / thenne ſhall the ſygnes ſhewe in the ſonne / in the mone / and in the ſ

Men vnyuerſally of all ye world ſhall fall downe for the drede and fere that they ſhall haue thenne. O thou wretched man. Remembre of the terryble comynge of this Iuge / that is bothe god and man / whiche a fore hym hath a brennyng fyre. And a ſtronge tempeſte. I ſaye there ſhall a fyre go afore hym. whiche ſhall flamme holy aboute his enemyes. It is wryten to the Hebrues in the tenthe chapytre. Ryght terryble is the abydynge of this Iugement. And the fere therof / whiche ſhall deſtroye hys aduerſaryes. And

Malachyas ſayth in his iii. chapitre. See here the day yt ſhall come flāmynge lyke a chemenye. And thenne it ſhall brenne all proude men / and thoos yt haue commytted felonye It is redde in Iſaye in the .xlvi. chapitre. Here is our lorde yt ſhall come & Iuge by fyre. And Iohell in his .ii. chapitre ſayth He ſhall haue a fyre before his face deuourynge and behynde hym a brennyng flamme. For this cauſe ſayth Malachyas in his thrydde chapitre / who ſhall he be thenne that ſhall nowe ſee oure Lorde. For he ſhall be as a fyre glowynge / ſette to make clene / and purge ſyluer / who is thenne he of deuoute corage that ſhall not drede with alle his herte this Iuge and his comyng. And therfor ſayth ſaynt Gregory vpon Ezechyell / who may haue ye corage / but that ſhal fere and dred the preſence of the eternall Iuge / when all thȳges ſhal come thenne to the ſyght of euery man / & all thynges done afore by delectacyon ſhall be with righte grete drede called to Remembraūce. Certayn as it is wryten in ye Prouerbys in the .xxxviii. chapitre. The euyll men thynken not of the Iugement But they yt deſyren & dreden god / haue in theyr hertis all good thynges. ſaynt Bernard ſayth in a proſe. truly I drede ſore the vyſage of the Iuge yt ſhall come to whom noo thyng can be hyd / & ſhal noo thyng reſt vnpunyſſhed. & who ſhall he be of vs yt ſhall not dred when yt Iuge ſhall come whiche

ſhall haue fyre brennyng before hym to the deſtruccyon of all ſynners. Certeynly this laſt Iugemente ought gretly to be dred and for .iii. cauſes. The fyrſte the accuſementes ſhalbe in many maners. whiche all ſynneis ought greuouſly to wayle. The ſeconde is the right ſtrayte ſentence vpon our gouernaunce that ſyngulerly ſhall be made to euery thyng. The thyrde is the horryble feerfull abydynge of the Iugement / whiche thenne by the Iuſt Iuge ſhalbe terrybly gyuen Theſe thynges all ſynners ought tymerouſly drede / whiche by conſequens the Remembraunce therof ſholde withdrawe man from doynge ſynne.
               ¶ Here endeth the prologue of the ſeconde parte.

                  THe fyrſte thing thē
                  ne. where by the fynal Iugement oughte ſpecyally to be drad is the many and dyuerſe accuſacyons / whiche ſhall be there agaynſt all ſynners / wherfore it is to be knowen that we fynde in holy ſcryptures ſeuen thynges that accuſe ſynners atte the grete daye of Iugement. The fyrſte is oure propre conſcyence / whiche ſhall argue ageynſt the ſynner / 

not ſecretely / but manyfeſtely thenne afore all. It is wryten in Danyele in the ſeuenthe chapitre. Thy Iugemente is ſette / and thy bookes be open. That is to wete / the conſcyences / whiche thenne be openly vttered In thoſe bokes be conteyned the ſciences of lyf or of deth / of glory and of confuſyon / of ſaluacyon perpetuell / or dāpnacyon eternall. It is red alſo in the .xx. chapitre of the Apocalyps. That dede men ſhall be Iuged of the thynges wryten in theyr owne bokes. That is to ſaye / in theyr conſciences Therfore it is wryten in the Pyſtle to the Romayns in the ſeconde chapitre That theyr conſcyences ſhall bere them wytteneſſe. For as wytteneſſe of the euyll conſcyence is thaccuſacyon / the payne. and the tourment of ſynners. Right ſo ſhal the good cōſcyence be helpe and ſaluacyon to the good creatures. The ſeconde thyng that ſhal accuſe the ſynners / ſhall be the fendes and the euyll ſpyrytes / whiche falſly & trayterouſly haue procured & ſturred men to ſynne. And of alle that the ſynner hathe done they wyll accuſe hym / as one thef accuſeth an other of one felony done by them both. It is wryten in the Apocalyps the .xii. chapitre. The fende is called the accuſer of bretheren. And Saynt Auſtyn ſay the. They be all before the Iudycyall ſete of Iheſu Cryſte. And there the deuellys ſhall be redy▪ whiche ſhall reherſe the wordes of our profeſſyon

and ſhall appoſe to oure face that we haue done / and wherin we haue ſynned / and in what place / and what we oughte to haue done / and lefte it vndone. Truly our aduerſary that ſame fende ſhall ſay thenne. O righte wyſe and Iuſte Iuge. Deme this man to be myn for his ſynnes. For he wyll not be thyne by grace. He is thyne by nature. He is myne by his myſery. He is thyn by thy paſſion. He is myn by perſuaſyons. He hathe bendyſobeyſaunte vnto the. He hath ben concentyng vnto me. He hath receyued of the / yt ſtole of Immortalyte / & of me this blacke garmente that he wereth of perpetuell deth he that lefte thy lyuere & hath taken myn. he hath lefte thy Ioye and blyſſe. & hath taken my ſorowe and payne. O thou Iuſte Iuge. Iuge hym therfore to be myn / and that he be condampned with me perpetually. Thyſe wordes ſayd our lorde vnto. Saynte Auſtyne. The thyrde thynge that accuſeth ſynners. ſhall be angeles / & the happy goode ſpyrytes. Certayne it is to be beleued / that he that hath gyuen them oure ſoules to kepe / ſhall requyre to haue Reaſon of that kepyng. And as thoſe that neuer lye nor wyll take vpon them the ſynne or faute of other / muſte nedys ſaye / they be not to blame. But the gylte is in vs ſynners / whiche wolde not obey nor byleue them.

perteyneth yf he hele not his pacyent whiche is diſobeyſaūt vnto hym. And therfore hit is wryten in Iheremye the one and fyfty chapitre / we haue hadde Babylon in cure / and yet ſhe is not heled. Theſe be the wordes of the Angeles as they wyll ſaye / we haue doone all that was neceſſary to be done to Babylon to the ende that ſholde be cured & heled. But it is in her defaut yt ſhe is not he led. This Babylon is to be lykened to mānes ſoule The .iiii. thyng yt ſhall accuſe ſynners / ſhall be creatures. And yf thou axed me / whiche creatures they be. I anſwere the / all and eueryche oon of them by them ſelfe. For and the creatoure of alle thynges be offended. all the good creatures ſhall haue hym in hate / thath hath dyſpleaſed hym. For as Iob ſaythe in his twentyeſt Chapytre. The heuens ſhall ſhew and lyfte vppe the euyll werkes of the ſynners / and the erthe ſhall adreſſe hym agaynſt them. For oure lord ſhall call vnto hym the heuen aboue / and the erthe be nethe to dyſcerne his people. And therfore ſayth Cryſoſtome vppon the Goſpell. of Saynte Mathewe. There is noo thynge that we ſhall mowe remedye by anſwere that daye / whenne the heuen and the erthe / the ſonne and the mone / the nyghte and the daye / and all the worlde ſhall bere wyteneſſe agaynſte vs for oure ſynnes. The refore ſaythe Saynte

Gregory. If thou axe me / who ſhall accuſe the I ſay to the / all the worlde. And that the creatures ſhall not oonly accuſe the ſynners. But alſo ſhal requyre the creatour of alle thynges to take vengeance on them for theyr ſyn̄es. To this purpoſe it is wryten in the book of Sapyence in the fyfthe chapitre. He ſhall arme all creatures to take vengeance on his ennemyes. And with hym ſhall fyght all the worlde agaynſte thoſe / that haue ben Inſenſate. that is to wyte / ayenſt ſynners. All creatures ſeeng him that is maker of all thynges ſhall chaſe them to cauſe tourmentes to be gyuen vppon thoos that haue not be Iuſte. The fyfthe thynge that ſhall accuſe the ſynners / they ſhall be myſerable perſones / that haue ſuffred ſoo many wronges. For thenne they ſhall accuſe thoos that haue done them wrong peyn and tourment. At that tyme ſhall the worde of the ꝓphete be verifyed whiche ſayth. I haue knowen well that our lorde wyll gyue Iugemente / for the poore folkes yt haue ſuffered wrong. & ſhal auenge the quarell of thoos yt be Impotent for he yt beholdeth the depe botoms of the ſees / & ſytteth aboue all the Cherubyns & Seraphyns / & gooth aboue all the wyndes. He is more terryble to be drad in his counſelles and wylles than is the ſones of men He ſhall Iuge then̄e poore mennys cauſe that haue ben cōſtant. And ſhall holde ayenſt thoſe that

haue done them many anguyſſhes Then̄e ſhall the fader of Orphans / & the Iuge of wydewes venge all wronges / the pacyence of poore folkes ſhal not thenne peryſſhe The ſubgettes ſhall alſo accuſe the felones & neclygente prelates & curates And therfore ſayth ſaynt Bernarde vpon the Cantycles. O how cruell oure lord ſhall be vpon the ſones of men. Certeyn the wretched ſynner ſhal ſay thenne all for nought to the monteyns. Fall ye vpon vs and to the Rockes couer ye vs. They ſhall come then̄e before the trybunall ſete of Iheſu Cryſte / where ſhall be herde full greuous accuſacions by thoos that haue payd theyr wages / and boren theyr diſpenſes wrongfully / & theyr ſynnes ſhall not be defaced nor hydde of thoſe yt fraudelently haue blynded their doctours and confeſſours. The vithyng yt ſhall accuſe ſynners / ſhal be malyce and ſynne / we rede in Iheremye the ſeconde chapitre Thy malyce ſhall accuſe the / & thy refuſyng ſhall blame the For the ſynnes ſhall thenne be bonden vnto the necke of ſynners. To this purpoſe ſeyth Ozee in his xiii chapitre / the iniquyte of Effraym is bounde togydre & his ſynnes be not hyd / we rede myn iniquytees be truſſed & leyde in myne necke / and as the ſtolen good taken on ye necke of a thef accuſeth him ſemblably ſyn̄e ſhal then accuſe the wretched ſynner It is wryten alſo in the Prouerbys the fyfthe Chapytre. Iniquytees

ſhall take the felone ſynners / & there eueryche of them ſhall be taked and ſtrayned with coordys of theyr ſyn̄es. And the Prophete ſeyth. The coordys of my ſynnes haue enuyroūde / & goon rounde about me. By the whiche coordys I ſaye alſo the wycked folkes by deuellys ſhall be drawen in to helle. Certeynly they fall in to theyr nettes. & be taken by theyr baytes / we red of the properte of an Archyn whiche / yt when he entreth in to a gardey ne / he lodeth hym with apples ſtykynge on his pryckes. And when ye gardener comes. he wold flee but he is thenne ſo laden that he can not away / & ſo he is there taken with all his apples. Semblably falleth hit to the ſynner / yt is all laden with ſynnes / and at the grete daye of Iugemente he is with them taken and accuſed / wherfore ſayth the Pſalter. Our lorde ſhall be knowen in makynge his Iugementes & handwerkes / and the ſynner ſhall be taken. Vpon the whiche ſayth Cryſoſtom Our owne thoughtes / & ſpecially our werkes ſhal be afore our eyen / & ſhall accuſe vs afore god. And therfore ſayth ſaynt Bernarde. Our werkes and we ſhall ſpeke togyder & ſaye. O myſerable ſynner thou haſte made vs / we ben thy werkes / we wyll not leue the / but go with the to thy Iugemente. It is red in Ezechiell the .xviii. chapitre. Lyke as the Iuſtice of the right wys man ſhalbe on and for hym. Righte ſoo the felony of the felon ſhall

Loke vppon the woūdes that ye haue made him. knowlege the ſyde that ye haue wounded & hurt / whiche hath ben opened for you. But ye haue not well entred therin.

               ¶ The ſeconde Chapitre of the ſeconde parte.
               THe ſeconde thynge that ſhall cauſe the extreme & laſt Iugement to be dredefull / ſhall be the ſtrayte Rekenynge and accomptes of oure vyle dedys in all thyng. Saynt Luke ſayth in his .xvi. Chapitre. yelde Reaſon of thy dedys / for after this lyf thou ſhalt mowe no more werke. My righte dere frēde. yf thou ſholdeſt gyue a Rekenyng & accomptes of a thouſande ponde / before a temporall lord prudent & wyſe thou woldeſt be full well ware and take good hede how thou ſholdeſt make hym a Iuſt and a due

Rekenynge. Haue thou thenne moche more thoughte and be more dredefull to yelde good Rekenynge and accomptes of all thynge that thou haſte commytted and done / and of thy dute lefte vndone / whenne thou ſhalte come before god / his angelles / and all his ſayntes. In whoos preſens neceſſaryly thou muſte accompte. And not onely of the grete thynges but alſo of the ſmale. ye vnto ye leſt part of them And as it is wryten in the thirde chapitre of Iſaye Our lorde ſhall come to Iuge with all his mooſt Auncyent people. zacharyas in his .xiiii. chapitre ſayth. Oure lorde my god ſhall come / and his ſayntis with hym. That is to wyte. To the generall Iugemente / whiche ſhall be done before alle openly and not in hydeles. And therfore it is gretely to be doubted. For it is wryten in zophonyas in the thyrde chapitre. He ſhall holde his Iugement in the mornyng by daye lyght. and ſhall not hyde hym. There ſhalbe then̄e many dyuerſe Reaſons to gyue Rekenyng of all thynges. Fyrſte of oure ſoule / whiche hath ben commytted and gyuen vs by God. Nowe truly yf a kynge hadde delyuered his doughter to one of his ſubgettes yt he entyerly loued / entendyng to make her a quene in his Reame. And yf the ſayde ſubgette hadde not kepte her well / who wolde doubte / but that the Lrynge wolde haue a Rekenynge / and knowe the cauſe / how

and why / his doughter hadde be ſoo euyll and ſoo neclygentely kepte / what ſhall the kyng of heuen do thenne to hym that hath taken his doughter to kepe That is to wyte. The ſoule / whiche he loueth ſpecyally / and entendeth to enhaunſe to Royall dignyte in heuen yf he haue kept her euyll ſhal not god therfore axe to haue therof rekenyng and reaſon / yes hardely It is wryten in Deutronom

                  repe thoughtfully thy ſelfe and thy ſoule alſo. And Saynte Auſtyn ſayth. It is a greter loſſe of one ſoule / thenne of a thouſande bodyes. Saynte Bernarde ſayth in the book of his Medytacōns That alle this preſente worlde maye not be eſtemed nor valued to ſoo hyghe a pryce as one ſoule. Alſo he ſayth / wherfore makeſt thou thy ſelfe facte and enourneſt thy fleſſhe with precyous ſtones / whiche after a fewe dayes wormes ſhall ete within thy ſepulture. And wherfore makeſte thou not thy ſoule fayre with good maners and vertues / whiche atte the daye of dome ought to be preſented to God and his Angelles / wherfore takeſt thou none hede to make her fayre and clene ageynſt that tyme. And why applyeſt thou rather to thy fleſſhe. then ne to her / why putteſt thou the chamberer before the lady as to be gouerned rather by thy fleſſhe / thanne by thy ſoule. It is a grete abuſyon. ſaynt Bernard ſeyth hȳ
                  ſelfe in the book of dyſprayſyng

of the worlde. Now a dayes the cure & the charge of the ſoule is deſpyſeth and lefte / and thaccomplyſſhemente of all theyr deſyre is after ye wyll of the fleſſhe / they drede not to do ſynne nor remembre not how they ſhall be rigorouſly punyſſed My right dere frende wylt yu thenne loue better thynges of lytyll valewe than thoos that ben more dygne & of here pryce Enhaunſe not thy body & ſuffre neuer the lady to be come Chamberer. To this purpoſe ſayth Cryſoſtome. Yf we dyſprayſe our ſoule / we may not ſaue our body. Truly the ſoule is not made for the body / but the body is made for the ſoule. Thenne he that dyſprayſeth the hygheſt and fyrſt thynge and enhaunſed the ſeconde and the loweſt / hurteth bothe the one and the other. But he that kepeth therin good ordre / exalteth and kepeth that that is chyef / & dyſprayſeth that / that is ſeconde for he heleth that / that is mooſt dygne and fyrſte. That is for to ſaye the ſoule. If thou wylte than ſaue thy ſoule / and yelde god a good rekenyng there of. Inſtructe her with ſcyence and dyuyne vertues. Plato ſayth in his book of Thymeo. The ſoule is Ioyned with the body to thentent that ſhe may lerne ſcyence & vertue. If ſhe come wt wynnynges ſhe ſoo to be reſceyued of her maker / & yf not ſhe then to be ſent in to helle there to remayne in tourment and paynes perpetuell. Secondly we muſt yelde Reaſon &

rekenyng of our body. It is our caſtell commytted and delyuered vs by god wherfore ſayth Saynte Bernard He kepeth well a good caſtell / that kepeth well his body. There ſhall be axed rekenynge of the kepyng of this caſtell. As wether the enmyes of our Lorde / whiche be vyces and voluptuouſneſſe of the fleſſhe / haue be reſceyued therin atte ony tyme. And yf his frendes and his ſeruauntes / whiche be vertues and good werkes / haue ben ſhamefully chaſed oute. If we haue done ſoo / it is a grete ſygne and ſuſpeccyon of oure perdycyon. And we ſhall nedely yelde Reaſon and Rekenynge. Thefore our body is as a Mare that oure Lorde hath gyuen vs to vſe for the prouffyte of our ſoule / of the whiche we ſhall yelde Rekenyng. As in thre thynges. It is wryten in Eccleſyaſtyco the thre and therty chapitre. The mete / the Rodde and the burdon is gyuen to the aſſe. The brede the oyſcyplyne and the werke is gyuen to the ſeruaū
                  te. Certeynly our body ſygnyfyeth as well a mare and an aſſe / as a ſeruaunt / vnto whom is gyuen the brede for ſuſtentacōn of nature The rodde of dyſcyplyne. for to refrayn vanytees. And the burdon of good werkes / for the peefeccyon of penaunce. Oure Lorde thenne ſhall axe of this his Mare / his Aſſe / or his Seruaunt / yf we haue mynyſtred to hym his mete dyſcretely not to largely nouryſſhynge.

For he that nouryſſheth ouer delycyouſly his ſeruaunt / ſhall fynde hym after the more fyers and proude. It is wryten in the Prouerbys the nyne and twenty Chapitre. And alſo not to yeue the body ouer lytyll of that / that is neceſſary to hit. For ſoo we myght be homycydes of oure owne fleſſhe. Ayenſt this ſpeketh Saynte Bernarde in a Pyſtle to the Bretheren of the mounte of God ſayeng. There be many other excercyſes of the body / in the whiche it is neceſſary to labour as in wakynges / faſtynges / whiche impecheth not / nor letteth ſpyrytuall thynges. For yf they were lette other by defaute of ſpyryte / or by ſekeneſſe of the body / he that ſoo ſholde take awaye from his body theffect of good werke. The true deſyre of his ſpyryte. The good example to be ſhewed to his neyghbour / & the honour to God his maker. He ſholde doo ſacrylege / and be culpable of all this thynges ayenſte God. Yet ſayth ſaynte Gregory in his Moralys in the one and therty chapitre. By abſtynence ſholde the vyces of the fleſſhe be quenched. Certaynely yet whenne we putte awaye our enemye we gryue our owne fleſſhe. Secondely oure lorde ſhall aſke vs / yf we haue corrected oure body with the Rodde of dyſcyplyne in refraynynge hit from Rebellyon and other vayne Iolytees. Sayut Bernarde ſayth vpon the Cantycles. that the dyſacuſtomynge of

good werkes / muſte be chaſtyſed & holpen by the bytte of diſcyplyne. He ſayth alſo in a Pyſtle. O how well good diſpoſicyon yeldeth diſcyplyne to the ſtate of the body. and the habytacōn of ye thoughtes abateth the ſlepe of the hede. ſhe ordeyneth the contynuaunce of the vyſage. ſhe tempereth the tonge / ſhe refrayneth the throte / ſhe appeſeth the Ire / & dreſſeth the goyng Thyrdely our lord ſhall aſke / yf we haue laboured our body in vertue & in werkes of penaunce. Therof ſayth ſaynt Auſtyn in his book of Baptyſyng of children That Adam was chaſed oute of Paradyſe terreſtre / becauſe yt delycyous place it ſholde ſygnyfye / that labour whiche is contrary to delyte ſhold be ſhewed vnto the tendre fleſſhe of the childern. And therfore our bodyes may be called a laborȳg beſt. which our lord hath ſente vs to do & accomplyſſe the werkes of penaunce. Holde not the body then in yoleneſſe / in an moche as yu knoweſt not / how longe hit ſhall abyde with the. But perfourme the werkes of penaūce. Leſt perauenture he aſketh it agayn that hath lence hit the. Cryſoſtom ſayth. If yu haue borowed an Oxe or an Horſe / thou wylte anone ſette hym a werke leſt he be aſked agayn of the on the morow / why wylt not thou ſemblably do with thy body. as thou wylt do w▪ the Horſe or Oxe. Thus then noryſſhe dyſcretely thy body / whiche is lent the by Iheſu Cryſt in ſuche wyſe as

thy nature may be ſuſteyned / & the vyces ouercome & thy body corrected by the rodde of diſcyplyne / ſo as it may be obedyent & reſplendyſſhyng in Chaſtyte. Inſtructe it to good labours / ſo that hit chaſe away all ydleneſſe & fynally that thou mayſte yelde our lord a good & a Iuſt Rekenyng there of atte the daye of Iugement. Thyrdely we muſte yelde rekenyng of our next kynneſmen. Fyrſte the fader of the ſone. As is wryten in the fyrſt boke of Lrynges in the ſeconde chapitre & the thirde of Hely that was punyſſhed for his childeren becauſe he knewe they dyde a myſſe / & corrected not theyr defautes Therfor is alſo wryten in Salomon the nyne & twenty chapytre. Lerne and teche thy ſone. And to the ſame purpoſe ſayd A wyſe man. If thou haue a ſone / correcte hym yf he ſynne. leſt by right thou abye not his treſpace. Secondely the Prelate ſhall gyue Rekenyng of his ſubgette or dyoceſan. For it is wryten in Ezechyell the eght and therty Chapitre. My ſone I haue ſette the to be a beholder & ouerſeer of men in the hous of Yſrahell. when thenne thou hereſt ony of the wordeſt of my mouth ſhew them on my behalfe That is to wyte If I ſaye to a felon. O theff yu ſhalt dye an euyll deth. And yf thou ſhewe not my ſayeng to hym. to thentent that he may amende hym / yf he dye in that wyckedneſſe. I ſhal aſke of thy hāde his lyfe agayne. Item the

ſame Ezechyell ſayth in his .xxxiii. chapytre. Beholde and ſee how I am my ſelfe aboue all my other herdemen. And I ſhall aſke my beſtayll of theyr hondes The lordes or Prynces Royall ſhall yelde rekenȳg & accomptes of theyr ſubgettis As it appereth in the Book of Nombres in the .xxv. chapitre / where the worldely Prynces are cōmaū
                  ded to be hanged on the galowes for the ſynne of theyr people / becauſe the people dyde fornycacyon with the doughters of Moab whiche they called theyr Sacryfyce. As is redde in the ſayde chapitre. Suche thenne be the Prynces & Prelates. As is wryten in Iheremyas the fyue and twenty chapitre. Howle ye herde men & crye ſtrongely / & caſt vpon you aſſhes / for your dayes be complete / to thentent yt ye be ſlayne and caſte in the erthe as precyous veſſels. Beholde thenne theſe prelates of the chirche / & the prynces vnyuerſall of the Erthe. that be conſtytute aboue all other. Loke how they gouerne by example. How they inſtructe by wordes. How they defende by dede the poore people. that arne commytted to theyr gouernaūce. Certeynly the prelates owen to teche theyr people and defende them wyſely from the aſſawtes of Heretykes worſe and more curſed thanne wolues / and from theyr cautellys wylyer thanne foxes. And the temporall Prynces owen to doo Iuſtyce vppon treſpaſſours and defende theyr good

ſubgettes. And kepe wedowes. orphanes. & wretched perſones. And not to gryue ony body by vnrightfull exaccyons / or Iniuſt cauſes They may knowe what is wryten in the booke of Sapyence the .vi. Chapitre. Howe there ſhall be a right harde Iugement to thoos / that ben precellent aboue all other. Certeynly mercy ſhall be graunted vnto the good poore man. but the badde riche man ſhall ſuffre grete tourmē
                  te. O ye prelates of the chirche / and ye prynces of the vnyuerſall worlde theſe wordes ben addreſſed vnto you / to thentent ye ſholde lerne wyſdome and not to fall therfrom and that ye enſtructe gouerne and defende youre ſubgettes ſo well that ye may be ſure atte the laſt daye of the righte harde Iugement. where the greteſt and ſtrongeſt payns ſhall be to thoffenders / that haue ben myghtyeſt here. Fourthly it behoued to yelde Rekenynge of all our wylles & werkes. And Anaſtaſye ſaythe vpon the Symboll. (Quicun

That is hit that is wryten by Thappoſtle in the ſeconde Pyſtle ad Coryncheos the fyfthe chapitre. where he ſayth. It behoueth that we ſhewe vs alle manyfeſtely before the Iudycyall ſete of Iheſu Cryſt to the entente that eueryche reſceyue there good or euyll

accordyng to theyr merytes & deſertes. It is redde in Eccleſiaſtes in the laſt chapitre. Our lorde ſhall bryng vnto the Iugemente all thynges that be done And not oonly the grete & greuous ſynnes / but alſo thoſe yt we thynke belytyll or none The paas of a man ſemeth but a ſmale thynge. Neuertheleſſe it ſhall be Rekened for atte the fynall day of Iugement. Therfore ſay the Iob in his .xiii. chapitre. Syre thou haſt welmarked my wayes & my pathes / & haſte beholden the Traces of my fete. And after he ſeyth in the chapitre folowȳg Thou haſt nombred al my ſteppes. Item alſo it is wryten in Eccleſiaſticus in the ſeuententh chapitre. His eyen beholde Inceſſauntly all the wayes of men. As to ſaye / he wyll Rewarde alle that they done accordyng there after. We rede in Vitis patrū. an example of an angell / that ſomtyme nombred all the paaces of an Heremyte / whiche paas is a leſſe thynge than an ydle worde. Therfore ſeythe Saynte Mathew in his .xii. chapitre. That men ſhall yelde Rekenynge and Reaſon atte the day of dome of euery Idle worde that they haue ſayde. It is wryten in the boke of Sapyence in the fyrſt chapitre He that ſpeketh euyll and peruerſely ſhall not mowe hyde hym atte the daye of Iugement. And correction ſhall not paſſe beſydes hym. Vayne thoughtes ſemeth but a lytyll thynge. Neuertheleſſe it is wryten in the Book of

Sapyence in the fyrſte chapitre How felonous & euyll thoughtes muſt be anſwered vnto. For he wyll ſerche all our thoughtes. It is alſo wryten in Iſaye in the laſt chapitre. I ſhall ſerche theyr werkes & theyr thoughtes. & ſhall come & aſſemble my ſelfe with people That is to ſaye to deme them as I ſhall Iuge them. Therfore ſpeketh Iohell alſo in his thirde chapitre. I ſhall aſſemble all maner of people in the laſt dayes / & ſhall brynge them to the vale of Ioſaphat. And there I ſhal diſpute with them techyng my people / and myn herytage of Iſrahell. Alle our thoughtes / our wordes / and our werkes ſhall be thenne righte ſtraytely Iuged. And as Saynt Gregory ſaythe vpon the Goſpell of Saynt Mathew the thre and twenty chapitre. All the heres of our hedes be nombred. Semblably God conſydereth all our goynges & ſtappes. And wyll that alle our vayne thoughtes & our ydle wordes ſhall not reſt vndyſcuſſed atte the day of Iugement. Certayne alle our werkes ſhall be thenne as manyfeſtely ſhewed vnto all people / as though they were wryten in our forhedes. As it is wryten in Eccleſyaſtyco▪ in the enleuenth chapitre Atte the ende of man / all his werkes and dedes ſhall be vncouered and made open. Fyftely it behoueth to yelde Rekenyng and accomptes not oonly of the ſynnes that we haue done / but alſo of the vertuous and good

dedys that we haue lefte vndone Saynt Mathew ſayth in the fyue & twenty chapitre. Thene ſhall the grete Lrynge ſaye to thoos on his lyfte honde Departe from me ye wycked ſynners and go in to the fyre euerlaſtyng. whiche is made redy for the deuylles and theyr angeles.

How thou haſt dyſpended hit. And therfore ſayth Sapyens in Eccleſiaſtes the fourth chapitre. My dere beloued ſone / kepe and ſpende well thy tyme. The ſixthe and the laſte thynge that behoueth to gyue Rekenyng and accomptes for is all the yeftes that we haue reſceyued of oure lorde God. Suerly our lord hath gyuen vs noo thynge / but that he wyll haue therof bothe Reaſon and Rekenynge / where by hit ſemeth rather that he hath but lente hit vs then gyuen hit vs abſolutely. Certaynly he ſhall calle vs to Rekene. For all his gyftes be they ſpyrytuell as the gyftes of grace to the ſoule / or temporall as ſtrengthe delyueraunce / and beaute of the body / or worldely rycheſſe / power / and worſhyp in this lyfe of alle theſe thynges. It appereth by Example and by a parabole in the Goſpell of ſaynt Mathew in the fyue and twenty Chapitre of the fyue talentes / whiche be peces of money / & of Saynt Luke in the nynetenth chapitre▪ How ye noble man delyuered to his ſeruaūtes certeyn rycheſſe / wherof they were fayne to yelde Reaſon & doo accompte for euery thyng therof pertyculerly

As it is wryten in Iob. the .xix. chapitre. I mowe ye that at Iugement all theſe thynges afore ſayd ſhall be rekened for full ſtraytely / wherfore ſayth Iob in his .ix. chapitre. what ſhall I doo whenne our lorde ſhall ryſe vp to Iuge alle men. And whenne he ſhall queſtyone me / what ſhall I anſwere thenne. O how lyghtely and how ſoone ſhall he come aſkynge a due Rekenynge and accomptes of all our werkes. Oure perdycyon is nyghe / and the tyme haſteth faſte and is alwaye commyng. That is to ſaye / whenne oure lorde ſhall come and Iuge his people. For as ſayth Abdeas in his oonly chapitre. The day of our lord ſhall come in the euenynge atte mydnyght. Atte Cocke crowe / or in the mornyng. As is to ſaye. If he come ſodeynly / yt he ne fynde you ſlepynge This that I ſaye to you I ſaye it in lyke wyſe to all other. Be ye wakyng thenne & ſlepe not. For yf ye watche not. I ſhall come to you as a thef. & ys ſhall not know whenne ne what houre. It is red in Apocalyps in the laſt chapitre. Lo ſee how I come anone & brynge with me rewardes to yelde euery man after theyr deſertes. Now then̄e my right dere frende / ſens yt muſt nedely of ſo many thynges and eueriche of them yelde due rekenyng & accōpte be not vnpurueyed / but make dilygently. examen thyſelfe dilygently / & purge well thy conſcyence to the bothom. to the entent. that when our lorde

ſhall come to Iuge all thynge / as well dede as quyke Thou mayſt couenably & reſonably anſwere / & therby to haue his mercy grace and pardone of al thy ſynnes. And this is that Eccleſiaſticꝰ ammonyſſhed vs in the .xviii. chapitre ſayenge. Examen thyſelfe before the daye of Iugemente. And that ſhall be to thy helpe in the preſence of our lord Iheſu cryſte.
            
            
               
                  ¶ How the horryble abydyng of the laſt day & extreme daye of Iugement is to be doubted.
               
               ¶ The thirde chapytre of the ſeconde parte.
               THe laſt thynge yt rendret the fynal Iugement to be dredefull and doubtable. is the terryble ſentence that thenne ſhall be pronowuced by ye Iugement of god the rightfull Iuge This ſentēce ſhall be terryble & ferefull / & ſpecyaly for .iii. thynges. The fyrſt is the doubte & the Incerteynte of the ſentence / for there is noman ſure whether it ſhall be gyuen with hym or ayenſt hym. And as it is wryten in Eccleſiaſtes the ix chapitre. They be Iuſt & wyſe. & theyr werkes be in ye hondes of god. how be it there is noman here that knowes whether he ſtande in hate or loue / & all thȳges to come. be in none certeyn. To this purpoſe it is redde in Vitis patrū. Howe that an abbot called Agathon / beynge in ye artycle of deth And ſo lyeng by the ſpace of .iii. dayes without meuynge

or openyng of his eyen. His brethern ſeeng hym ſoo lyeng / puſſhed hym / ſayenge vnto hym. Fader abbot / where arte thou. Atte laſt he anſwered. I am in the preſens of alle folkes / wherfore they ſayd vnto hym. then thou dredeſt and art aferde. Vnto whome he anſwered. Though I haue kepte the cōmaundementes of our lord as vtuouſly as to me was poſſyble yet I am a man / & wote not whether my werkes be agreable vnto hȳ for the domes of our lord be all other then the Iugementes of men. & yt is the cauſe of my drede. I haue neyther hope ne wanhope before god. Saynte Auſtyn ſeyth That. that we deme to be Iuſtyce / well examined before the dyuyne Iuſtyce / is often Iniuſtyce. And therfore it is wryten in the Prouerbes of Salomon the xiiii Chapitre. There is one waye / whiche ſemeth Iuſte to a man / but the ende therof ledeth hym to deth And for aſmoche as this holy fader Agathon coūterpoſyng in his hert all theſe thynges a fore ſayd. all be it that he was right dylygent to kepe ye cōmaundementes of our lord. Yet alwaye he drad full ſore the laſte daye of Iugement. It is alſo red in Vitis patrū how ther was ſomtyme an auncyent fader / whiche ſayde. I drede .iii. thynges / that is to ſay. Fyrſt when my ſoule ſhall departe out of my body. Seconde when ſhe ſhall come before our lord. The .iii. when ſhe ſhall abyde & here the fynal ſentence of ye laſt day

of Iugement. Lo ſee how many holy faders haue drad this laſt day of Iugemēt for ye none certeyn of the doubtfull ſentēces yt there ſhalbe gyuē. now certeynly it is a thȳg whiche of reaſon ought tyme rouſly to be drad. It is wryten in the Goſpell of ſaynt Mathew ye .vii. chapitre & by the wordes of our lord Iheſu cryſt. Many men ſhall ſaye to me. Syr ſyr. haue we not ꝓphecied in thy name. & caſte out ye deuels of men & done many v

                  tuoꝰ dedys Then he ſhall ſaye vnto them I know you not nor euer knew you. depart frome. If the ꝓphetes & thoſe yt haue chaſed out deuels. & thoſe yt haue done myracles in the name of our lord be ſo put a backe who ſhal then now be ſure. & who ſhal conne lyue here ſo holyly. but at day of dome he ought to trē
                  ble & fere. Certeynly none / for vpon the erthe is there no body purely clene withoute fylthe not a childe of one day olde for it is bow in origynal ſynne Therfor it is wrytē in I ſaye the lxiiii. chapitre we be all made as a fowle clothe / & we oughte to drede all our werkes whiche ſhalbe ſhewed before vs atte dome. all though we thynke them good v

                  tuoꝰ & Iuſt. Therfor ſay the Iob in his ix. chapitre I haue drad al my werkes Sēvlably ſaynt Poule wiche was a delectable choſyn veſſell. all be it he was then full clene in cō
                  ſcyēce in ſo moche he ſayde in the .xxiii. chapitre of Thactes of Apoſtles. I haue ben conuerſant with oure lorde with all

my myght & in good cō
                  ſcyence to this daye. And yet it is accordyng where to the ſame holy Apoſtle ferefull wrote in his fyrſte Pyſtle ad Coryntheos the faueth chapitre ſayd. I fele not myſelfe gylty in ony thyng / that notwithſtondyng I fere yet by cauſe I am not Iuſtyfyed. Saynte Gregory ſayd. The Iuſt men diede in alle theyr werkes / when they wyſely conſydre how the muſt come a fore the hyghe Iuge. For as Thappoſtle wryteth vnto the Romayns the xiiii. chapitre. we ſhall come all before the trybunall ſete of Iheſu Cryſte Alas thenne I wretched ſynner what ſhall I ſaye or what ſhall I do▪ when I ſhall come before ſoo grete a Iuge without good werkes for my helpe. The ſeconde thyng whiche cauſeth this ſentence to be terryble. Is the harde lamentable and Intollerable vtteraunce of the ſayd ſentence / whenne our lord Iheſu Cryſte ſhall ſaye. Go ye fro me ye curſed peple. To that purpoſe is wryten in the Goſpell of Saynt Mathew in the .xxv. chapitre / whenne the ſone of man ſhal come in his mageſte and all his angelles with hym. Then̄e he ſhall ſytte in the hyghe Iudycyall ſete. & all maner of peple ſhall aſſēble before hym / & ſhall deuyde ye one from ye other as the ſheparde kepeth ye ſhepe from the wolues. Certeynly he ordeyneth & ſetteth ye ſhepe on his right honde / & the wolues on the lyfte honde And then ſhall the kynge of glory

ſaye to thoos that ſhall be an his righte honde. Come ye on with me that be bleſſed of my fader / and poſſeſſe the Royalme of glorye / that is enorned for you from the begynnyng of the worlde. I haue ben hongry. and ye haue fedde me &c. Thenne he ſhall ſaye to thoos on his lyfte honde Departe from me ye yt be curſed / and goo in to eternall fyre / whiche is arredyed for deuylles. And theruppon ſayth a wyſe man. The wordes of the Iuge in ſentence are but ſhort / as come ye & go ye. For he ſhall ſaye to thoſe that be reproued Go on your waye. And to thoſe yt be Iuſt. come ye with me. O how gracioꝰ ſhall yt worde of our lord Iheſus cryſt be / when he ſhal ſaye come ye wt me O how harde bytter & in tollerable ſhall the pronownſyng of yt worde be Departe ye fro me. or go ye frome. Suerly Go ye frome is a full ſharpe worde And come ye with me is a full bleſſed worde. Saynt Bernarde ſayth O how cruell ſhall thoſe wordes be. Go ye frome / to them on the lyfte honde, ſpoken by the kynge of kynges geuer of all lyfe which ſhall ſaye to other. Come ye with me This is yt cuttyng ſwerd wt two edges yſſewed out of ye mouthe of ye ſone of man / as it is wryten in ye fyrſt & xix chapitre of the Apocalyps. Certeynly he ſhall thenne ſmyte the erthe with the Rodde of this mouthe / & ſhall ſlee the felonous ſynner by his werkes. As it is wryten in I ſaye the .xi. chapitre.

O how terryble a thyng ſhalbe to here this voys. Therfore ſaythe Saynt Auſtyn vpon the Goſpell of Saynt Iohan. Thoſe that fyll backewarde by one worde of Iheſu Cryſt / whenne he went towardes his paſſyon / what ſhall they doo / when̄e they here the voyce of the ſante Iheſu cryſt whenne he ſhall Iuge all the worlde. for certeyn he ſhall braye lyke a lyon. As Amos ſayd in his iii. chapitre. when̄e the lyon ſhall braye / who is he yt thenne ſhall not be aferde. I ſaye in his .v. chapitre ſayth. His brayeng ſhall be lyke a lyon. Iheremye alſo ſayth in his xxv. chapitre. Oure lorde ſhall braye from an hyghe / and from his tabernacle ſhall deſcende his voys / wherof the ſowne ſhal extende vnto thextre myte of the erthe. & ſhall make his dome & Iugement vnto ye people. The voys of our lord ſhall be thenne in grete magnifycens. It is the voys of oure lord yt ſhall breke downe the hyghe Cedres of the moūte of Lyban. that is to vnderſtonde. His enmyes proude people enhaunſed And yet all be it they haue ben ſoo rayſed It ſhal thenne fayle and vanyſſhe as ſmoke. And atte that Iugement they ſhall be made humble / and reduced to noo beynge. This voys ſoo comyng from our lorde / ſhall be lyke a thundre betyng the erthe. Therfore ſeyth Iob tremblynge in his fyue and twenty Chapytre. Who ſhall mowe beholde thondre / or ſowne of the magnytude

of oure lorde. And the Pſalter ſayth. Oure lord hath thondred from heuen / and the mooſt hyghe hath vttred his voys. Iob ſayth in his ſeuen and therty Chapytre. Oure lorde ſhall thondre meruelouſly by his voys / and he dooth manye grete thynges / whiche oughte not to be enſerched nor muſed on. And Saynte Ancelme ſaythe in his Medytacyons / wherfore ſlepeſte thou ſlougthefulle ſoule worthy to be caſte oute of alle lyghte / he that waketh not nor dredeth not this grete thondre ſlepeth not / but rather is dede. The worde of our lord ſhall be in maner a right hote lightenyng / wherfore zacharye in his .ix. Chapytre. ſayth. His darte ſhall departe lyke a lyghtenyng And our lord ſhal ſowne the trompe Certeyn as it is wryten in Iſaye in the ſeuen and twenty chapitre. In that laſt day ſhall ſowne the grete trompe. And therfore ſayth Cryſoſtome vpon the Goſpell of Saynt Mathew. the foure and twenty chapitre. The vertues of heuen ſhall be moued. now truly yu ſhall be by a grete voys. whiche is of the terryble trompe / wherunto alle wyndes & elementes obeyen / whiche voys renteth ſtones & openeth helle / and breketh the gates of braſſe and breketh the lygatures of dede bodyes and reſtoreth the ſoules to the bodyes ageyn. & cō
                  ſtrayneth them to come to the grete Iugement. And all theſe thynges be conſumed agayne more

lightly then the flyght of an arow paſſynge in the ayre / wytneſſe of Thappoſtle yt ſayth in his fyrſt pyſtle ad Coryntheos in the xv chapitre. In a moment in the twynkelyng of an eye in the ſownyng of the laſt trompe ſhalbe the Iugement. Of this trompe ſpeketh Saynte Iherome vpon the Goſpell of Saynt Mathew. ſayeng / when & as often as I thynke on the laſte day of Iugement. I tremble for fere / be it when I ete or when I drynke & in ony of my werkes / me thynketh alwayes that terryble trompe ſownes in mynere ſayeng. Aryſe ye aryſe ye dede folkes & come to your Iugement. All men troubled or greued ought by penaūce to thynke oftētymes in this day & it ſhall be a grete wele & eaſe to theyr ſoules. And therfore ſaythe Saynte Gregory in an Omely. My ryghte dere brethern & frendes / lete ye daye of Iugement be alwaye afore your eyen. For what greuous thyng ſoo euer ye here / it is but ſoft in comparyſon of that ſore daye. we ought alſo to fere & drede the ſame day For yt is the grete Iourney the Iourney of wrathe & of bytterneſſe. Sophony as ſayth in his fyrſt chapitre. The waye of oure lordes Iourney ſhall be full bytter. For there ſhal be noman ſo ſtronge. but then he ſhall be troubled that ſhall be the very day of wrath trybulacion an guyſſhe chalange myſerye & derkeneſſe of clowdes & ſtormes of the ſowne of the trompe. Iſaye in his xiii chapitre ſayth

The daye of oure lorde ſhall come / whiche ſhall be full of Indygnacyon 
                     ••
                  ath & of furour. Iohel alſo in his .iii. chapitre ſayth. The ſonne ſhalbe conuerted in to derkenes & the mone in to blood a fore the cōmyng of ye grete & horryble day of our lord. O how drad Saynt Bernard that ſame day when̄e he ſayd / whyles I yt am a mortall man remēbre what I ſhalbe after my deth The fere there of putteth me in terryble doubtes. for I am not verrely aſſured of yt / that I longe after. for the day of fere / of wrath / of Ire / and of furour. the day of waylyng & the vengyng of ſynners / affrayeth me hydeouſly. Of this ſame day ſayth he alſo in one of his ſermons / they ſhal be all bare & naked before the trybunall ſete of Iheſu cryſt to thentent yt they maye here ye

Doo ye penaūce / neuertheleſſe ther be many yt diſymylyngly cloſe theyr eres & wyl not here hit / & thynke it is to harde to doo. O remēbre ye felons becauſe of your obſtynacy / ye ſhall here therfore the harde & lamentable worde pronoū
                  ced vnto you. That is to ſeye. Go ye curſed people in to euerlaſtynge fyre▪ what ſhal then thoſe poore wretched ꝑpetuell dāpned people ſaye. Seenge the holy bleſſyd peple called vp Ioyefully in to the eternall glory and blyſſe of heuen. And they that be dampned in to the Iufynyte

paynes of helle. Certeynly as it is wryten in the boke of Sapyence ye .v. chapitre They ſhall wepyngly ſay in themſelfe for the gret anguyſſhe of theyr ſoules. Let vs do penaūce / for we be thoos yt haue blaſphemed hit / & as foles out of all wytte & reaſon had in deryſion the lyuyng of the penytēt folkes / thynkyng it was no worſhipfull lyfe How be it we ſee them now taken & accepted with the ſone of god / & theyr werkes allowed & cheryſſhed ſo yt they be accompanyed with the happy & bleſſyd ſayntes / & we with ye dampned fendes of helle We haue erred from the way of trouth / the lyght of Iuſtyce hath not ſhyned in vs / nor the ſonne of rightwyſneſſe ryſen in vs. we haue lefte ye wayes of our lord Iheſu cryſt & haue gone daūgeroꝰ & euyll wayes / yt is to ſaye The wayes of Iniquyte & perdycion / what hath our gret pryde proufyted or auayled vs. or what auantage haue we had of all our grete richeſſe / par de all is paſte as a byrde fleyng in the ſkye / or a ſhyppe glydyng thorugh the water. wherof the traces can not be apperſeyued. Now thenne to make confeſſion is ouer late for theyr repentaūce groweth but for the payne yt they ſuffre. And therfore they can obteyne no pardon / alſo they are paſt ye place of mercy & grace. & be in the place of equyte & Iuſtyce. For when̄e the Iuge / whiche oughte ſoo gretely to be doubted hathe pronoūced his Iugement & ſentence / ſayeng.

Go fro me ye wycked. & Come to me ye bleſſyd / theyr Remedye is paſte. To this purpoſe rede we in 
                     •
                  itis patrū. How ther was ſome tyme an holy man / whiche was tempted with the ſpiryt of for nycacyon / & he beſought our lord yt his enemye the fende whiche tēpted him myght appere viſibly vnto him. & ſo he dyd. Thene the ſayd holyman ſeyde vnto the fende / what auayleth the thus for to tempte the people / parde it is a grete foly. for whē
                  ne ye haſt brought ony to ſynne thy treſpas is the gretter / & conſequently ye augmenteſt thyne owne payne To whom the fende anſwered. Certeynly all yt is trewe / but I knowe well the mo folkes yt cauſe to ſynne / the more I deferre the commynge of the day of dome. I drede that daye aboue alle thynges / and the heryng thenne of that harde ſentence. Goo ye wycked and curſed in to eternall fyre / whiche is made redy to the deuyll and his angellys. And therfore I doo my power to prolonge the tyme of comynge of ye ſentence. O good lorde what cauſe of drede haue theſe fendes and theſe vnhappy ſynners thenne. If thou wylt be aſſured in this horryble and dredefull Iourney. Sowe nowe in thy lyfe the werkes of Mercy Pyte and Iuſtyce. O howe bleſſyd and howe happy ſhall he be / that now entendeth to the poore languyſſhyng nedy people. For in yt harde Iourney oure lorde wyll delyuere them therfore from alle

daūgere. It is wryten in the Prouerbys of Salomon in the .xi. chapitre. The mercyfull man dothe grete good vnto his ſoule / and dooth alſo the digne fruytes of penaūce For they yt now ſowe teres & lamentacōns the rewarde therof ſhall come & brynge them in to the lodgyng of Ioye and of gladneſſe. But there be many yt ſowen now preſentely thornes & cokyll / wenynge to repe & Inne good whete / but ywys foles it wyll not be ſoo. For as Thappoſtle ſayth ad Galathas in the .vi. chapytre. Suche as a man hath ſowen here / ſuche ſhal he repe then̄e for hȳ
                  ſelfe. And therfore ſayth our lord by his prophete. Ozee in his .x. chapitre / ye haue ſowen felony & haue reped iniquyte & he that hath ſowen ſynne & euyll werkes / he ſhall be repen & Ioyned in to the paynes of helle. But he yt hath ſowen vertues & the good werkes of penaūce He ſhall repe & gadre the euerlaſtynge glory. And alle that haue done well ſhall reſt in the Ioyes of heuen. And thoſe that haue done ſynne and wyckedneſſe ſhall go and reſte in the paynes of helle. Certaynly theyr werkes folowen them. As it is wryten in the Apocalyps the .xx. Chapytre. After theyr werkes men ſhall be both ſaued and dampned. It is redde in the Goſpell of Saynt Iohan the fyfth Chapytre. An houre ſhall come to the whiche all that be in Monumentes or Tombes ſhall here the voys of our lorde. And they that

haue done well / ſhall go in the Reſurreccion of lyfe. And they that haue done wyckedly / ſhall go vnto the Iugement of dethe. It is wryten in the ſeconde Chapitre of the Apocalyps how the Iuge ſhall ſaye. I am he that enſercheth the hertes of perſones and ſhall gyue to euery of you his Rewarde after his werkes. And as ſayth Abdeas. It ſhall be done vnto the / as thou haſt done To the ſame purpoſe is wryten in Iheremye the .l. chapitre. And theſe be the wordes of the eternal Iuge vnto the euyll angell ſpekyng of the dāpned ſynners / yelde and doo hym after his dedys and werkes. And therfore yf thou wylt haue a good herueſt and habun daunce of fruyte / ſowe good werkes largely in the tyme of this preſente lyfe. For he that ſoweth them now largely / ſhall gadre them then habundantly. And he that now ſoweth them ſparyngly / ſhall then gad them ſcarſely / & he yt ſoweth them with blyſſynges▪ ſhall gadre them with grete Ioye & gladneſſe. As it is wryten in the ſeconde Epyſtle ad Coryntheos in the ix. chapitre For he that ſoweth his ſedys in ſyn̄e & maledyccōns / ſemblably ſhall Inne & gadre them And as it is wryten in a Prouerbe. The ſede that man ſowes in this preſent lyfe / ſhalbe his hous when̄e the Iuge ſhal ſay Come ye & go ye. The thirde thyng. why the dome of the Iuge ſhall be terryble. It is to be remē
                  bre how dampned ſoules

ſhall be by the mornyng ſentence. full of all ſorow eternally ſeparated and departed from god & his ſayntes of paradyſe / and putte on the lyfte honde vnto the tendes of helle. Certeynly Incontynente & without caryeng that this horryble ſentēce ſhal be pronoūced by ye mouth of Iheſu cryſte. The perpetuell deuylles ſhall be there arredyed & redy for to take and rauayne the ſoules of the wretched ſȳ
                  ners / whiche they ſhall lyghtely brynge vnto euerlaſtynge tourmentes and paynes. This maye appere vnto vs by a fygure in the book of Heſter the .vii. Chapitre of the mynyſtres of kynge Aſſuer / whiche were deſyrous and redy to take Amon as it is conteyned in the ſame Chapitre. How the worde was not all out of the mouthe of the ſayd kyng. But that the mynyſtres hadde couered the vyſage of the ſame Amon. In lyke wyſe the deuylles in this hydeous Iourney ſhall be more then redy to reſceyue ye ſoules of theſe wretched ſynners. And this is wryten in the Lamentacions of Iheremye in the fyrſte Chapitre. Alle his perſecutees haue taken hym. Iohan Cryſoſtom ſayth in the book of Repayryng of forfaytours. Remembre theſe cruell and terryble tourmentoures that neuer may ſhew mercy on ony body & ledeth downe the vnhappy ſynners vnto euerlaſtynge tourmentes. And Hugho of Saynte Vyctour. ſayth. That the horryble mynyſtres of helle ſhall

be apparayled and arredyed incontynent as the ſentence is gyuen / to take the condempned vnto tourmentes. And thenne ye wretched vnhappy caytyffes lamentably ſhall ſay. they haue caught me lyke as a deuoryng lyon lurkȳgly hath taken his pray. O what ſorow and payne / wherof maye not be eſtemed in mānes mȳ
                  de nor by tellyng pronoū
                  ced / wherfore ſaynt Bernarde ſayth in his Medytacyons / what thynkeſt thou / what wepynge / what waylynge / and what ſorowe ſhall be whenne the ſynners ſhall be expulſed oute of the companye of Iuſte men / and putte from the ſyght of God and delyuered and caſte vnto the hondes of the deuylles to go with them in to euerlaſtyng fyre / and vtterly banyſſhed from alle the Ioyes of heuen / to abyde in the derkneſſe there ſuffryng payns for theyr demerytes after the quantyte of theyr ſynnes. And then̄e the myſerable ſynners beynge in deſpeyre of the Redempcion ſhall entre into the loweſt partyes of the erthe in the hōdes of our lordes glayue there to remayn with out ſeeng of ony lyghte. Of this payne of ſeparacyon or departyng ſayth alſo Cryſoſtome. Some foles wene and thynke to haue theyr wyſſhynge yf they maye eſcape the gehenne of helle. But as to me I ſaye that there be other tourmentes moche more greuoꝰ. that is to ſaye to be eſtraūged and caſt away from the grace of the ſoueraygne

glory / & I deme that the banyſſhyng ther from is the mooſt egre & greuoꝰ torment. wherupon ſaith ſaynt Gregory He is gretely tormented yt is conſtrayned to be put a part from the preſens of oure lord. And I deme yt it is the mooſt greuous thyng yt may be / & paſſeth all ye gehēnes of helle. The ſame ſaynt Gregory ſaith of this worde of the Goſpell of Saynt Mathew the xvi. chapitre. He ſhall be cutte & ſent in to the eternall fyre. Certeynly ye gehēne of helle is a thynge intollerable and none can cōprehende how intollerable it is. Neuertheleſſe yf there were a .M. gehennes in helle / ther is none ſo lamētable payn as to be exempt from the honour of the bleſſyd glory of heuen. & to be hated of our redemer Iheſu cryſte maker of all thynges For as ſaint Auſtyn ſeith The wycked reproued ſhall leuer ſuſtene all the tormentes of helle / then to beholde the rightfull Iuges face angred with them. Iohell ſayth in his ſeconde chapitre. The erthe hath trembled for his face & moeuynge of his eyen / the ſonne & the mone haue derked / ye ſterres haue withdrawen theyr ſhynyng. the people haue ben tormēted beholdyng his vyſage. Certeynly ſȳ
                  ners ſhall then̄e peryſſhe before his face / thorugh the grete ſorow they ſhal haue of them ſelfe. And when they ſhall ſee hym comyng his vyſage from them▪ it ſhall meue them to myſerably. And then̄e the Iuge egrely ſhall ſay as is wryten in Iheremie

the .xviii. chapitre. In the day of theyr perdycyon I ſhall ſhewe them my backe / and not my face. O what ſhal be ye ſeparacōn O how bytter & ſorowfull ſhall it be to the ſynner to departe fro the face of our lorde / when̄e he ſhall horrybly ſay. I tell you I knowe you not / & therfor ſeyth a wyſe man The departyng of frendis is right ſorowful. but the ſeparacōn of the body & the ſoule from the preſens of the deyte / is the mooſt ſorowfull thynge. For all this thynges a fore ſayd and many other. whiche infynytly myght be reherſed / for breefneſſe of tyme I paſſe them ouer. But yet awake ye awake ye my dere frendis & lyfte vp your hedes. abhortyng & feryng ye tymerous & dredfull day of Iugement. For as Sophonyas in his fyrſt chapitre ſayth. The daye of oure lord approcheth nyghe & ſhall not tary. It is wryten in Iſaye in the .xiii. chapitre. Sorowe ye and crye / for the daye of our lord is nyghe. Slepe not then̄e. For ye knowe not the day ne the hour. as it is wryten in the Goſpell of Saynt Mathewe the xxv. chapitre. It is alſo wryten vnto the Teſſalonyes in the laſt chapitre of ye fyrſt Pyſtle. My brethern ye knew well yt the day of our lord ſhall come by nyght as a thef. and whenne men ſhall thynke themſelfe aſſuredly in peas. He ſhall come ſodeynly and take them in a mortall defaulte / wherfor my brethern Reſte not in the ſyn̄e of wretchedneſſe. Leeſt that day

ſuppryſe you not ſodeynly as a thef. Surely we be al the children of day and the ſones of lyghte. Thenne let vs not ſlepe as other doo. But let vs awake and be ſobre as it is wryten in ye ſame chapitre. It is wryten in the Goſpell of Saynt Luke in the .xxi. chapitre. Gyue attendaunce in youre ſelfe. Leeſt perauenture youre hertes be fulfylled with gloteny and dronkenſhip & in other vayne werkes of this preſent lyfe. And leſt yt the forſayd daungerous day fall not ſodenly vnto you. whiche ſhall fall vnyuerſally to all thoos yt ſhall be vpon the erthe. Be ye then̄e in your prayers. ſo yt at al tymes ye may be the more dygue and able to flee al the daungers that be to come whenne yt ſhall be afore the ſone of man? As it is wryten in the ſame chapitre for a trouth. There ſhall be thenne tremblyng fere and ſorowe intollerable And therfore ſayde Iohell in his ſeconde chapitre Our lordes daye ſhall be grete & right terryble. And who ſhall be he yt ſhall mow ſuſtene or ſuffre it. Iſaye ſayth alſo in his ſeconde chapitre. They ſhall entre in to the cauernes amonges ſtones & hydplaces of the erthe for drede of our lordes face and of the glory of his mageſte whenne he ſhall aryſe to ſmyte & punyſſhe the erthe. And as it is redde in Abacuk in the .iii. chapitre In his 
                     •••
                  ſnes he ſhal trede downe the erthe / & the people ſhall be abaſſhed of his furour. Iſaye in his .x. chapitre ſayth /

On ye right honde ſhall ſyn̄es be accuſyng the wretched ſynner On the lyfte honde infynyte nōbre of deuels. vnd

                  nethe the cōfuſyon of helle / whiche is gretly to be doubted / & ouer this the preſens of the wrothfull Iuge / & withoute all the worlde brēnyng / & within this the conſcience glowyng. This ought to be remēbred. Alas the myſerable ſynners taken in ye trappe. whether ſhal they flee. It ſhall be then̄e Impoſſyble to hyde them. It ſhall be an Intollerable oredefull thyng to appere in that daye. The ſayde ſentence is mure ferefull and daungerous / be cauſe it Iuged not oonly the body / but alſo it condempneth the ſoule. To yt purpoſe is there red an example / how that there was ſomtyme .ii. bretheren / wherof the one was a fole & ignorant / & the other was wyſe / whiche went togydres in a way. & as they walked / they come at laſte to a forked way. whiche ledde to ſondry places / wherof the one was fayre and pleaſaunt. and the other ſharpe & no thyng inhabyted And when̄e the fole ſaw the fayr & delectable way he ſayd. Brother goo we this waye. Thenne the wyſe brother anſwered. I knowe well that this

waye whiche thou wylte lede vs is fayer & delectable. but netheles in the ende it wyll beyng vs to an right euyl lodgyng. And therfore I coūſeyll yt we take the other waye. For all be hit yt it be ſherpe & not inhabited / fynally it wyll bryng vs to right a good & honeſt harberoughe & full of reſte / where vnto the fole anſwered. I wyll rather truſt myneye in yt I ſee / than thyn in that yu ſeeſt not. And ſo ſette hym forthe in the ſofte and delectable way whiche thynge the wyſe brother ſeeng that he coude not make hym relynquyſſhe his purpoſe / folowed hym And whenne they hadde gone togyder a lytyll ſpace / they fortuned anone to be taken with ſoldeyours / whiche dyſceuered them and put them in to dyuerſe pryſones. Now hit happened that the kyng of ye countree commaunded on a daye / that all pryſoners ſholde be broughte afore hym yt he myghte Iuge them accordyng to theyr demerytes. And whenne theſe two brethern came afore hym / & echone knewe other / the wyſe brother ſayd. O ſyr kyng & our Iuge. I complayne me gretly of this mā my brother / for as we wente togydies in a way he beyng reputed a fole and I wyſe. yet neuertheleſſe. he wolde not beleue me no: goo after me the good waye that I taught hym but hath made me to folowe hym in ye euyll way wherin we were taken / and ſo he is gylty of my dethe. And to the corntarye the ignorāt fole ſayd

to the ſame kyng. Syr I haue gretter cauſe & ſtrenger Reaſon to complayne me agaynſt my brother / for where he ought not to haue byleued me nor folowed me lyghtly in ye waye / whiche he knewe well was euyll & daū
                  gerous. for & he wolde not a folowed me. I wold haue retourned ageyn and folowed hym / whereby I ſholde in noo wyſe haue fallen in his daungere / & therfore he is verrey gylty of my deth. when̄e theſe wordes were hadde on eyther partye. The kynge pronownſed & gaue a ſentence ſayeng Thou fole / thou woldeſt not truſt thy wyſe brother / & thou wyſe haſte folowed this fole in his euyll wayes / wherfore ye bothe ſhalbe hanged & cōdempned to dethe. Semblably ſhall it be at the day of Iugement in the conſūmacōn of this worlde. when by ye almyghty power of god the ſoule of euery man & woman ſhall retourne ageyn & be reioyned to the yr owne bodyes apperȳg before the hyghe Iuge to reſceyue dome & Iugemēt of all thynges knowen & forgoten. for ye folyſſhe body becauſe it wold not folowe ye coūſeyll of ye wyſe ſoule / & the wyſe ſpyryte becauſe it wolde not reſyſte but enſue the folyſſhe body. they ſhalbe both dā

Alle thȳgis be opē to his eyen for he loketh into the hertes. As it is red in ye fyrſt book of Lrynges in ye xvi chapitre. Alſo it is red in Eccleſiaſtes the xxiii. chapitre The eyen of our lorde be moche clerer then̄e the ſonne. for they behold all the wayes of man / & the ꝓfoūde depneſſe & the hertes of men / & ſee alle the hydde thynges of the erthe.

Thyn eyen be open vpon all the wayes of the childern of Iſraell & I ſhall yelde to eueryche of theym after his wayes & after the fruyte of his admynyſtracions. Certeynly the Iuge is gretely to be drad. whiche loketh vpon al thynges bothe open & ſhette / & all ſecrete thyngis to him knowen / all derke thynges to hym is clere / all dome thynges anſwere vnto hym / & all thoughtes ſpeke to hym without voys

But oonly ſhal proufyte the werkes of Pyte & of Iuſtyce. It is wryten in Ezechiell in the .vii. chapitre.

How myght one remembre a more cruell thyng then by thoos beeſtes. Our lord ſhall ſay to the felons yt ſhall be condāpned / as is wryten in Ezechiell in the .vii. chapitre.

The name of oure lorde ſhall come from right ferre / his ferſeneſſe ſhall be brennyng and greuous to bere / his lyppes ſhall be fulfylled with Iudygnacyon / and his tonge ſhall be lyke a deuouryng fyre / and his ſpyryte ſhalbe lyke a broke rennyng ouer the brȳ

Certeynly yf one of you hadde to ſaye or allege a cauſe ageyn your enmye and ſholde to morow preſent you to my Iugemēt perauenture ye wyll paſſe all the nyght without grete ſlepe / remembryng your ſelfe in grete payne & thought what thynges myght be alleged ayenſt you / & what ye wolde anſwere to thobieccyons / & ſholde drede gretely leeſt I ſholde be ſharpe vnto you. and wolde fere leſt it ſholde▪ be thought that ye were culpable / & wolde ſerche what I where. and whether I ſholde become Certeynly not longe after I haue be man.

By what entencyon is it to be thoughte that fere muſte be mooſt dredefull / whiche is of the Iugemēt of the mooſt gretteſt and hygheſt mageſte. Alle theſe thynges ſayd ſaynt Gregory in the chapitre aforſayd. Yet is there ſomme thyng more concernyng the ſayd ſentence / that is to wyte / that there is no puyſſaunce can reſyſte it. And as it is wryten in the boke of Sapyence in the .xi. chapitre. who ſhal be he that ſhal reſyſte the vertu of thyne arme. Iſaye alſo ſaid in his xlvii chapitre. I ſhall take vengeaūce on theym. and no man ſhall reſyſte me. Veryly none ſhall mowe reſyſte hit / but edely alle muſte appere there generally yf they wyll or not. they ſhall abyde before the angelles the ſentence of the ſouerayne Iuge / whiche ſpake by Iſaye. hym ſelfe in the ſayd chapitre to the ſynners that are to be condampned. & thus thy ſhame ſhall be knowen and the vylen reproche ſhall be ſeen / wheruppon I wyll take vengeaūce and ſhall noo man mowe reſyſte hit. Iob ſayd in his .ix. chapitre. God is he that in his wrathe no man may reſyſte. And as it is wryten in the book of Heſter the .xiii. chapitre. Fayre lord god kyng omnypotent alle thynges be ſette vnder thy Iuryſdyccyon. and is none that may reſyſte thy wyll. Certeyn yt haſte made the ſkye the erthe and all that is conteyned in the circuyte of

the worlde / thou art lord of all thynges / & is none that may reſyſte thy wyl This is the grete myghty and puyſſaunt lord / of whoſe gretneſſe & myght there is noo nombre nor ende & he ſhall drede none be they neuer ſo myghty. It is wryten in the boke of Sapience in the vi chapitre. Oure lord ſhall drede no body what ſo euer he be / for he hath made both grete & ſmale. It is red in the Apocalyps. in the .vi. chapitre. Our lorde ſhall not drede the greteneſſe of man what ſo euer he be. The kynges of the erthe / the prynces of the worlde / the trybunes. the riche. the ſtronge / & all men aſwell bonde as fre. ſhall hyde them in the caues & emong ſtones of the roches. ſayeng to the mounteynes / falle vpon vs / & hyde vs from the face of hym that ſytteth in the trone / and the wrathe of the lambe / for the grete day of Ire is come. It is redde in the ſame Apocalyps in ye xviii chapitre. The kynges of the erthe ſhall wepe / and they ſhall ſpecyally complayne that haue made fornycacyon with Babylon and haue lyued in delectacyons / when̄e they ſhall ſee the ſmoke of his embraſynges and ſhall wyll them to be ferre for fere of the tourmentes. Certayne as ſaynt Mathewe ſayth in his .xxii. chapitre. There ſhall be then grete trybulacōn / & ſo grete. that ſythens the begynnyng of the world tyll now was there neuer none lyke. Secondly there is another thyng that agrogeth ye ſayd ſentence

That is to ſaye. that there is no place there for ſȳ
                  ners to hyde them in / & as Saynt Ancelme ſayd It ſhall be then a thyng impoſſible one to hide hȳ And therfore he ſayth in his .xxiiii. chapitre. Ther ſhall no tenebres be there nor no ſhadowe of dethe that they may hyde thoſe that haue done iniquyte. Saynt Bernard ſayd in one of his ſermons. That before the Iudicial chere of Iheſu cryſt ſhall they ſtande all naked / yt haue ſtopped theyr eres to the voys of counſeyll / wherfore they ſhall here the voys of the Iugemēt as it is before alledged. My right dere brother & frende drede this daye & doubte cordyally the ſayde Iuge & lord that ſhall deme all thynges / to the entent that yu mayſte the more dylygently eſchewe all ſynnes. And it is red in an other place. That in dredyng oure lorde it withdraweth euery man from euyll doyng. There is yet an other thynge whiche agrogith this ſentence. there is no place to apele to ony other / nor ſpace for to flee To that purpoſe ſeyth the Pſalter whether ſhall I goo bakwarde from thy ſpiryt. & how ſhall I flee bakwarde from thy face / yf I mount vp in to the ſkye / yu arte there. yf I deſcende in to helle yu arte preſent there beſydes me. & therfore ſayth our lord of ſynners by Amos in the xix. chapitre. They ſhall flee and there ſhall be none ſaued of them / yf they deſcende in to helle / my hande ſhal pull them vp from thens / & yf they hyde

them in the moūteyne of Carmele. I ſhall ſeke them tyl I haue put them thens. And yf they hyde them in the botom of the ſee. I ſhal ſende a dragon whiche ſhal deuour them And yf they go in to ſeruage amonges theyr enmyes. I ſhal ſende a ſwerde whiche ſhall ſlee them & ſhall caſt myn eye vpon them in wrath & not in loue. Iob ſayth in his x. chapitre. Our lord oughte to Iuge all thyngis & is none that may eſcape his hondes. Certeyly I ſee clerely the honde of our lorde almyghty wyll fynde vs ouer alle. And therfore ſayth the Auctour of the chare of the ſoule / what wylte thou riche man do / that neuer ſhalt lyue ſurely. whether ſhalte thou retraye the / whether wylt thou torne thy body / for yu arte not ſure here nor ellys where fore and thou ſtye vp in to the ſkye / or deſcende in to helle / he that hath domynacōn is ye cruell & myghty kynge. If thou go in to the ſee / that kynge hath gouernaūce there / thou ſhalt not mowe thenne goo no parte ſurely / for thou ſhalt be foū
                  de euery where. Certeynly yu ſhalt haue noo place to flee to / nother in thy dethe / nor in thy lyfe. O how well comprehended this Elezearus that ſayd I wyll neyther flee quyk nor dede from ye hondes of the almyghty. As it is wryten in ye ſeconde boke of Machabe the .vii. chapitre. Lo by thyſe our lordes ſayenges it appereth in many maners that fynall Iugement is to be redoubted of all / & ſhall be

for thaccuſacōn of dyuerſe thynges / whiche muſt be vyolently ſuffred ſuſtened & born. & for the Iuſt Reaſon that muſt nedes be yelden ſyngulerly & generally of alle thynges. And for ye diffynytyf ſentence that ſhall be then̄e pronoūced right horrybly by the Iuſt Iuge. The remembraūce then of theſe thynges dilygently contynued / that is to ſaye of the fynal Iugement & of the ſentence that ſhall be gyuen there / as it is ſayd ſhall p̄ſerue & defende & not without reaſon euery man from fallyng in to ſynne / & eſchewe to do euyll to the ende. to come fynally to the glory with the happy ſayntes of paradyſe.

               ¶ Here begynneth the prologue of the thyrde parte of the foure laſte thynges to come.
               THe thirde of the four laſte thynges wherof the remembraūce preſerueth from ſyn̄e is helle or the infernall gehenne. And therfore ſayth Anaſtaſye of ſaynt Anthony the heremyte. when̄e the deuyll tempted hym to ony ſynne / he remēbred the paynes of helle due vnto ſynners▪ wiche thought was ſo enprynted in his herte yt fynally he therby vaynquyſſhed the deuyll and was delyuered from his temptacyons and reſted free from all ſynne. It is to be noted howe touchyng this mater preſent thre thynges are pryncypally

to be conſydered. Fyrſt the dyuerſe nomynacyon of the paynfull places of helle. Secondely the many folde afflyccions of thinfernall mynyſtres. Thirdely the ſtrange & dyuerſe maners of the tormentes of helle of the whiche .iii. thynges the remembraūce proufyteth gretely and withdraweth a man from fallynge to ſynne.
            
            
               
                  ¶ Howe helle is named by holy ſcrypture in dyuerſe wyſe.
               
               ¶ The fyrſt chapitre of the thirde part princypal
               
                  IT is now fyrſt to be Declared pryncypally the nomynacyon of the paynefull places of helle / wherfore it is to be knowen that helle is a place full of fyre and is ſoo called de Infero infers. That is to ſaye to bere in / for the ſoules of ſynners be borne in to it for to ſuffre payne there eternally And therfore ſayth Iob in his ſeuenthe chapitre. He that ſhall deſcende in to helle ſhall not come agayne ne euer retourne vnto his houſe. And alſo helle is oftentymes called gehenne of fyre. The forſayd ſaynt Gregory in his fourth booke of his dyalogys ſayde. Certeynly it muſt be byleued that there is oonly but one fyre in the gehenne of helle / but it tormenteth not all ſynners after one maner / for euery mā ſhall haue payne after the quantyte of his gylte

and treſpace. Iſydorꝰ in the booke of ſouerayne goodneſſe ſayth that the fyre of the gehēne of helle ſhall ſhyne & lyght to the dampned folkes in encreaſyng of theyr paynes to thentent that they may ſee theyr owne ſorowes. it ſhal neyther light nor ſhyne to theyr conſolacōn nor gyue them cauſe of ony reioyſyng. The payn of thoos yt be dampned is doubled by ſorow & paynes that tormēteth the ſoule & fyre that brenneth the body. Of this fyre of helle ſpeketh ye Pſalter ſayeng. The coles ſhall falle vpon ſynners whiche ſhall be caſt in to the fyre hauyng no conforte in theyr myſeryes / our lord ſhall tormmente them with his Ire & the fyre ſhall deuour them. wherfore it is wryten in Iſaye in the .ix. chapitre The people ſhall be as mete vnto the fyre / it is alſo ſayd to euery ſynner in Ezechyell in the .xxi. chapitre. Thou ſhalt be fyres mete. In Iheremy the .xv. chapitre ſeyth our lord to the dampned folkes. thenbraſyng fyre inferyour ſhall broyll and brenne vpon you all. this fyre is of that nature yt perpetually it ſhall bren̄e and ſhall neuer haue nede to be renued. It is wryten in Iob the .xx. chapitre. The fyre whiche canne neuer be quenched ſhal vtterly deuour them O howe ſore ſhall oure lorde venge hym thenne vpon the dampned ſynners. As it is ſayd in Eccleſiaſtico in the .vii. chapitre. The fleſſhe of ſynners ſhall haue vengeance by fyre. This fyre of

the gehenne of helle is differente from the materyall fyre pryncypally in iii. thynges Fyrſt in fyrſneſſe & egreneſſe for the power of hit in brennynge is Infynyte / wherfore ſayth ſaynt Sebaſtyane whenne the angell of heuen rowned hym in the ere / he ſayd that our ſenſyble fyre is noo more lyke the fyre of helle / then the fyre peynted vpon a wall is lyke our materiale fyre. Secondely in enduryng. For our materyale fyre may be quenched and ſo may not that. It is wryten in Iſay in the laſt chapitre / that the fyre for ſynners ſhall not be quenched. Thyrdly in waſtyng. for our ſenſyble materyall fyre may conſume and waſt all thynges as ye philoſophre ſeith but ye fyre infernall may not waſt nor cōſume neyther the body nor the ſoules of ſyn̄ers by brennynge. Iob ſayth in his .xx. chapitre of the ſynners beyng in helle. He ſhall bye ful dere now that he hath done & yet he ſhall not be waſted. Iohan cryſoſtom ſeyth alſo that oure materyall fyre conſumeth all thynge that is leyed in hit / but the fyre of helle tourmenteth contynuelly thoos that be therin / & yet it preſerueth them alway in lengthynge theyr paynes. Therfore it is ſayd that it is not to be quenched not oonly becauſe it can not be put out but that it ſhall not ſeaſe to deſtroye them yt ſhall come therin. For ye cauſe ſayth the holy ſcripture that the ſynner ſhal be clothed with corrupcyon not oonly of theyr lyf

but in languyſſhyng and tormentes alway comynge. Certaynly noo voyce coude expowne nor noo worde coude expreſſe the gretenes of the payn. nor the feruentnes of that fyre. Alas what ſhal we do therfor there. & what ſhal we anſwere / for in helle ſhall be but gryndyng of tethe / yowlyng. cryeng. & wepyng in payn / but thē
                  ne penaunce is to late / & from all partes ſhall cō
                  forte and helpe be put awaye / there ſhall be noo thyng but augmencacyons of paynes. as that fyre of helle is not of nature to druoure / no more is it to gyue noo comfortable lyght. It is an obſcure fyre / and the flamme therof tenebrous. Secondely helle is called locus inquietus. that is to ſaye a reſtles place euer enduryng and ſhall neuer haue ende / wherfor it is ſayde in this lyfe that there is one place whiche is alwaye ſtyll / that is to wyte the centre of the ſkye. Other be ſomtyme troubled as mene partes of ye ayer / ſemblably it maye be proued that the loweſt parte is alwayes in trouble without reſt And therfore it is called tartarus. For after Papy tartarus is as mykell to ſaye as troubled and obſcure Certaynly the vnreſt and trybulacōn cometh there ſpecyally of three thynges. Fyrſte the varyaunce of paynes as one ſayth / the weder is troubled / when it is nowe medled with reyn. now wt hayll. now with ſnowe. or ſuche ſtorme whiche as it is ſayd / be of all thoſe maners in helle as wyteneſſen prophetes

ſayeng. It ſhall rayn vpon ſynners bothe fyre & brymſtone. and the ſpyrytes of tempeſt ſhall gyue them parte of theyr tourmentes. Secondly of the mynyſtres infernall. As it is wryten in Iheremye the .xvi. chapitre. Thoſe deuylles that ye haue ſerued / nether nyghte nor day ſhal ſuffre you in reſt. Thirdely thenter chaūged crye. as it is wryten in Iſaye the .lxv. chapitre. ye ſhall wepe for ſorowe & by contrycyon of ſoule howle. In trouthe our lord ſhall anſwere to all thoſe yt ſo ſhall howle and crye. As it is ſayd in Iheremye the .xxx. chapitre. Wherfore cryeſt thou & howleſt thou nowe by contrycyon ſythe thy ſorowe is not to be heled. I haue punyſſhed the thꝰ for thy wycked felonous ſynnes. Thirdely helle is called a place right diſtempred. As Auernus. That is as mykell to ſaye as a thyng withoute a temperaūce of delyte for the paynes be noo thyng moderated there / but contynue in grete exceſſe / of trouth there is therin without meſure exceſſeſyue tenebres / whiche be called exteriores. as ſaynt Mathewe ſayth in his .xxii. Chapitre. we haue example of this in Exodo in the .x. chapitre. By the manyable tenebres that were ſometyme in Egypte. O how mykell ſhall the tenebres of helle be more greuous than thoſe. It is wryten in Iob in the .xx. chapitre. All horryble tenebres ſhall come on hym. Ageyne then ſhall the 
                     •••
                  ners ſaye. As it is ſayde in the

Pſalter. They haue caſt me in to the loweſt lake and in the tenebrous place and in the ſhadowe of dethe / they haue lodged me in the obſcure place as dede fro this worlde / wherfore my ſoule is angry with me. Semblably it is wryten in the Lamē
                  tacyons of Iheremye. They haue lodged me with thoos that be ſempyternally dede / there is therin an exceſſyfe hete. As Iob ſayth in his xiiii. chapitre. The hete is grete therin, and the cauſe is that it breketh not oute but is cloſed in / as the hete in an ouen. The Pſalter ſayth. Whenne thou arte an angred thou ſhalte put the ſynners in an ouen ful of fyre. Alſo our lord ſhall torment them with his wrath / and fyre ſhall deuoure them / there is there alſo a right ſharpe colde. As is wryten in Iob in the ſayde chapitre. It is ſayd the water of ſnowe is colder thenne all other waters / Yet the waters of helle maye not be compared with of chyllyng nor colde. And therfor ſeyth ful gen
                     •
                  yus in his Pyſtles. There is in helle .ii. pryncypall maner of tormentes / that is to wyte by in tollerable colde and by inquencheable hete. It is wryten in the xxiiii chapitre of Saynt Mathew There ſhall be in helle bothe wepyng and colde certeynly the effluccōn of teeris by wepyng cometh of hete / but the inwarde ſorowes is cauſed by colde. To this purpoſe wytneſſeth Iob in the ſayde xxiiii. chapitre. The ſynner ouerpaſſed with the

colde water of ſnow / gothe after in to the grete fyry hetes. It is founde alſo in a lytyll booke of the dedes of Alexander the kyng of Macedone. That when̄e he was for clommed with the Iſſe & with the colde of the ſnowe he wolde goo to the fyre of colys. O how myſerable and paynful ſhal this trouble be to thoos that ſhall not dye nor haue lightnyng in that piyſon of helle / but be tourmented there Infynyt
                     •
                  ly Fourthely helle is called a noyfull waylyng place and therfore after Papie it is named Acheron / yt is as mykell to ſaye as a place without Ioye lackyng all goodneſſe. For this cauſe ſayth the Comentator Aueroys in the iiii. chapitre of Poetrye. That helle hath a contynuell ſorow and wepyng without conſolacyon. In trouth the dampned folkes there beneth haue no comforte in the worlde / for the oryſons & prayers that ben ſayd in the chirche mylytant may proufyte them no thyng / and from aboue cometh there no helpe to them / there falleth on them no myſe rycorde. wherfore they be in dyſpayre of ony grace in tyme comyng & knowe certeynly yt they with out remedy and not to be quyte out of the pryſon / and ſo they reſt ſempiternally in waylynge in ſorowe and in deſolacyon. It is wryten in the boke of Sapyence in the iiii. chapitre. That the dampned ſoules ſhall be vtterly in deſolacyon. Alſo the dampned ſoule ſayth in the fyrſt chapitre

of the Trenys of The remye. I am caſt in deſolacyon & am conuycte in to wepyng. It is wryten in Iſaye in the xxxiiii chapitre. That the wretched ſynner ſhal be in deſolacion duryng the worlde of worldes. Alas alas what payne is yt to be endured. O mooſt cruell payne. O deſolacion full of all tourmentes. & therfore o thou man remembre the & prynte often in thy herte & mynde theſe thynges aboue ſayde to thentent▪ thou may eſche we & withdrawe the from ſynne. & ther by haue the mooſt precyous glorye & felycyte perdurable.
            
            
               
                  ¶ How thoſe that deſcende into helle be cruelly punyſſhed.
               
               ¶ The ſeconde chapitre of the thirde parte payncypall.
               NOwe to procede folowyng by ordre it reſteth to be expowned howe there be many & dyuerſe afflyccyons gyuen by the ſold
                     
                        
                     
                     er
                  
                  yours of helle. Thoſe ſol deyours ben to vnderſton de the deuylles / whiche ben tourmentours & hangemen ful abhomynable to beholde and cruell in theyr dedys / neuer wery to tourmente nor to gyue paynes. I ſaye fyrſt that thoſe deuyles be horryble to beholde. And therfore they be ſo paynted in the chirche with hydeous & horryble fygures / to this purpoſe it is redde that where ſomtyme a relygyous man was leynge in his dortor among his brethern. It happened in a

nyght that he cryed horrybly / where thorugh all the brethern of his couente reſorted vnto hym / & they foūde hym ſtaryng & his eyen fixed vppon a walle fyrmely withoute moeuyng & wolde anſwere to noo queſtyon yt they demaūded hym / he was ſo moeued with a mernelous fere. & in the morow his pryour came vnto hȳ & aſked what hym ayled that nyght / & he anſwered. He hadde ſeen the deuyll. And thenne it was queſtyoned hym / what ſhappe he was of. And he anſwered yt his ſhappe ne myght lyghtly be deſcryued / & ſayd / yf there were here an ouen full of fyre & yonder the deuyll. I had as leef entre in to the ouen / as longe to beholde on his mooſt horryble fygure. and as ſainte Bernarde ſayth in the Pſalme of Qui habitat in adiutorio. O my right dere brethern what thyn he ye / yf it were a thyng ſyttyng / that one of thiſe prynces of tenebres / that be of ſoo many hydeous and merueylous ſhappes ſholde come and appere amongen you with his grete cruelte and vnformed tenebroꝰ body. what temporale or ſpyrytuale wytte myght ſuſteyne to beholde hym. It is redde in the book of Ditis patrū. How there was ſomtyme an auncyent man that ſayd. I trowe there is noo lyuyng creature / but and he ſame the deuyll in the ſame fourme that the dampned ſoules ſee hym / he ſholde no more lyfe after / but ſhortely ſholde dye. Alſo Saynte Gregorye ſayth of

one called Cryſſoryus / whiche beynge full ſeke ſawe beſyde hym a grete multytude of deuylles / wherfore he cryed full hydeouſly after helpe. he torned hym this waye and that waye. to thentent he ſholde not ſee them / but he was ſo feruently troubled with them in fere / that right ſoone he dyed. Certeynly all thoſe that ſee the deuylles be in ſuche gret troubles that all men diede the ſyghte of them / and not withoute Reaſon / for theyr horryble fygure tourmenteth thoſe to deth that beholdeth them. It is wryten in Iob the .xx. chapytre Horryble thynges ſhall go and come vpon them And that Saynte Bernard ſheweth whenne he ſayd. O my ſoule what fere ſhall yu haue / whenne thou ſhalt leue the preſence of all thynges where in thou haſte Ioye / the ſyght of that / that is agreable vnto the and all thy famylyaryte. and ſhalte entre allone ferfully in to the regyon / whiche is to the vnknowen / whenne the righte terryble and horryble monſtres ſhall come in grete companyes agaynſt the. O how grete a deformyte ſhall be in thoos horryble deuylles that ſhall appere in figures of righte cruell beeſtys. And as it is wryten in the .xi. chapitre of Sapyens. Becauſe they permytted errours as done ſerpentes and other ſuperflue beeſtys / thou haſt ſente them a multytude of dome beſtys in vengeaunce to the entente that they maye knowe wherin they haue

ſynned / they to be tourmented by the ſame. Certayne it is not Impoſſyble that the mooſt myghty honde that hath create and made all the vnyuerſall worlde of thynge vnſene. ſhold ſende a multytude of fers beres of hardy lyons and other many furyous beeſtys of dyuerſe ſhappes caſtyng vapures of fyre gyuyng ſtynkyng ſmokes puttynge out of they eyen ſparkes brennyng of fyre. but all theſe thynges ſholde be to the hurte of ſynners and alſo the beholdynge myght ſlee them / as it is wryten in the chapitre a fore ſayde. Iob ſayde in his .xvi. chapitre. Myne enemy hath beholde me with terryble eyen. He alſo ſayth in his .xli. chapitre. His loke and beholdyng is lyke a glyſtryng of fyre out of his mouth ſtremyng as it were brennyng lampes. and popilleth as water boylynge out of a potte. Therfore ſayth a Poete that there be therin ſerpētes vomyſhyng out of theyr mouthes brennyng flammes with the whiche blaſtes the ſoules of the myſerable ſynners ben all peryſſhed Secondly the fendes be cruell by effecte. where as it is wryten in Iob the xvi. chapitre. They are aſſembled ayenſt me. they haue opened theyr mouthes vppon me as a rauyſſyng lyon / they haue tēpted me. they haue mocked me & grennyngly & feloneſly ſhewed me their tethe. Alſo in Eccleſiaſtico in the .xxi. Chapitre. is ſayde. Theyr tethe be lyke the tethe of lyons / whiche deuour the ſoules

To this purpoſe is wryten in the fyrſt Pyſtle of ſaynt Peter the .v. chapitre That how the deuyll is lyke a braynge lyon / whiche gooth ſekyng to deuour ſom ſoule. Certeyne the deuyll ſhall be appoynted at ye laſt day for to deuour ſynners. It is wryten in Iſaye in the lvi. chapitre. O ye all beſtes of the feldes & wyldernes come ye for to deuoure. Iheremye in his .xii. chapitre ſayth. Come ye alle beſtes and aſſemble and make you redy for to deuour. Saynt Gregory in his Dyalogis talketh therof and ſayth. That there was ſomtyme a monke not yet verely monke in dede but ſo named / whiche was called Theodorus. It was righte dyſpleaſant vnto hym / whenne one ſpake to hym for his ſaluacon / he wolde not oonly leue to do good / but it lothed hym to here ſpeke therof / & as Theodorus was at the artycle of dethe. al his brethern of his couent aſſembled aboute hym in prayers & deuout oryſons yt they myght helpe & defende his ſoule at ye departyng from his body. then he began ſodenly to crye & with a grete voyce had them breke of & leue theyr oryſōs & prayers & departe / for he was gyuen vnto an horryble dingon for to be deuoured / whiche he ſayd for theyr praiers might not deuoure hym. & yet he had ſwalowed his hede / & prayed them therfore go thens & pray nomore / but lete hȳ do that. that he purpoſed to do / ſens he was gyuen vnto hym / & the forſayd

Theodorꝰ ſayd / why ſuffre ye me ſoo longe to be in this caſe. Thenne ſayde his brethern vnto him what is it that thou ſeeſt make the fygure of the croſſe vpon the. To who me the ſayd Theodorus anſwered with a lamen table crye. I wolde feyne bleſſe me / but I can not / for I am to hardely prycked and oppreſſed with the vyolence of this dragon. And whenne his brethern herde hym ſaye ſoo. they fyll flatte to the erthe with wepynge teeres / and began agayne theyr prayers and oryſons deuoutly for the helpe and Redempcyon of this Theodorus / whiche ſoone after ſodeynly began to crye with a lowde voyce ſayeng. I yelde louyng thankes and grace to god my creatour / for now that Dragon / whiche ſholde haue deuoured me is dryuen and chaſed away fro me by your gode and deuout prayers and oryſons. Alſo Saynte Gregory telleth an example in the fourthe boke of his Dyalogis that how in the partes of Anchone in a monaſtery called Congolathon be fell ſomtyme that there was therin a monke whiche was taken for a very holy man meruelouſly well dyſpoſed towarde god / But whenne his bretheren went that he had faſted he was accuſtomed ſecretely to ete. And when̄e he was at the batayll of deth / he called generally for all his bretheren. ſayeng vnto them. I am delyuered nowe vnto a dragon to be deuoured / whiche wt his tayll hath

knytte togydre my fete & alſo my knees & putteth his hede in to my mouth & draweth my ſoule oute of my body / and after he had ſayd thoſe wordes he dyed forth withall. It maye ſeme theſe wordes be for the condēpned ſynners whiche be wryten in Iheremy in the .li. chapitre. He hath eten me lyke a dragon. This dragon is hydeous & grete & hath vii. hedes & .x. hornes in the ſame as it is wryten in the Apocalyps in the xii. chapitre. There hath ben a grete batayle in the ſhye ſo yt ſaynt Mychyell & his angell hath fought with ye dragon & his angell whiche myght not reſyſt. & ſyth theyr rowmes in heuen coude not be foū
                  de but were caſt downe & ſo yt dragon aūcyent ſerpēt / whiche is called ye deuyll ſathan enforceth hȳ
                  ſelf to make warre vpon the vnyuerſall worlde here. And for ye cauſe it is red in the ſame chapitre. That harme come to yt erthe & to ye ſee / for the deuyll is deſcended among you with all his grete furyous anger This deuyl hath a merueylous grete hate vnto all good peple whiche diſpoſeth them to take poſſeſſiō in ye towme of heuen / from whens he was put out & chaſed in to theterrnall paynes / & ye more yt the day of dome approcheth the more tēpteth he more curſedly & more forſeth hymſelfe to do euyll in deſtroynge of ſoules. O how grete is ye wyckedneſſe & the malyce of this deuyll of helle. wherof Saynt Bernard talketh in a proſe ſayeng O howe felonous ſhall

then this tormentours be whiche ſhall payne & tormente ſynners. how terryble ſhall theyr vengeaūce be in vengyng vyces wret chednes & ſynnes Certeȳ
                  ly theyr cruell malyce is yet augmēted in dyuerſe maners. Fyrſte becauſe they be ſo innumerable & of ſo dyuerſe ſortes. The Pſalter ſeyth. why be thoſe ſo multyplyed that tormenteth me / & there be many that dreſſe them a yenſt me. and as it is wryten in Iob in the .xix. chapitre They haue aſſeged my tabernacle about me It is wryten in 
                     •
                  itis patrū. That there was a good auncyent man that ſawe the duyll enuyronynge the people & were as thyke as beys that make hony / wherfore it is ſayd alſo in the Pſalter. They haue cōpaſſed me as beys be cauſe they be many & of grete myght▪ as Thapoſtle wytneſſeth in his piſtle ad the Epheſeos in the .vi. chapitre. where he calleth them prynces & poteſtates & gouernours of the world be cauſe they be ſubtyll and myghty to noy ſoules. ye Pſalter ſeyth. The ſtronge haue fought my ſoule This ſtrengthe is vnder ſtonde by the deuylles. It is red alſo of that ſtreng the in Iob the .xli. chapitre. There is noo myght vpon the erthe to be compared with that / yu hath done ſoo yt it dredeth noo man ſaue him that ſeeth all thynge from aboue & is kyng ouer all the childeren of pryde the deuylles ſhall ernſtfully exercyſe theyr myght in pryde to the puniſſion of ſynners & them ſhall cruelly

tourmente. It is wryten in Eccleſiaſtico the xxxix chapitre. There be ſpyrytes that be ordeyned to take vengeaunce & hath confermed the tormentes in theyr furour enduryngly tyll the conſummacōn of the worlde. Iob ſayth in his .xvi. chapitre. He hath compaſſed me with his ſperis & hath not ſpared me. but hath hurt my reynes / he hath caſte my bowell to the erthe / & gyuen me woundes vppon woūde & this come ſholderyng ayenſt me lyke agaynd Thirdely the malyce & cruelte of the deuyl is cōforted & is more greuous be cauſe they are neuer wery of tormentyng As it is wryten in the boke of Danyell in the .iii. chapitre The mynyſtres ſhall not ſeaſe in ſturynge the fyres of the fourneys to the cauſynge of paynes. Therfore ſayd a wyſe man that there be tourmentours. whiche be more to be lothed then ſerpentes / & they be blacke & defourmed & wyll not be beten downe And they be neuer wery to do harme / but newly encreaſen theyr malyce al way redy & boylyng deſyrouſly to put ſoules to payne / and Inceſſantly they excerſyſe theyr cruelte more and more. And it is ſayde to all ſynners in Deutronomye in the .xxviii. chapitre. Thou ſhalt ſerue for thyne enemy whenne oure lorde ſhall ſende the naked vnto hym in honger and thyrſte and in alpouerte. And thenne ſhal thyſore woundes enereace perpetuelly. O howe grete ſhall the paynes be there to dampned folkes

whiche ſhall laſte contynuelly in anguyſſhe and myſerye withoute Intermyſſyon lackynge peas or reſte. It is redde of the ſynners in Ezechyell in the ſeuenth Chapitre. That whenne they ſhall fele this Anguyſſhyous payne / they ſhall deſyre and requyre to haue peas / but thenne they gete none / for they ſall haue conturbacyon and ſorowe vppon ſorowe. It is wryten in Thapocalyps the .xiiii. Chapitre. That thoos that haue ben beeſtly ſhall therfore haue noo reſt by day nor nyght. Then̄e mowe the ſynners well ſaye. as it is wryten in Iſaye in the xxxviii. chapitre. I ſhall not ſee oure lorde god in the lyuyng londe / nor I ſhall noo more beholde ony man / that is inhaby tour of reſte. Semblable as it is wryten in Ihere mye the .xlv. Chapitre. Alas I am vnhappy / for oure lorde hath added in me ſorowe to ſorowe / for I can fynde noo Reſte. Sorowe ſhall be thenne caſte atte his hede / and alle Inyquyte ſhall deſcende vppon hym. Nowe by theſe thynges aboue ſayd it manyfeſtly appereth how ſuche as deſcendet in to helle be punyſſhed with many dyuerſe paynes / and therfore me thynketh dere bretheren how it ſholde be often in your Remembraunce to defende you from fallynge to ſynne / whereby ye ſholde leſe the companye of the happy & blyſſhed ſayntes and the celeſtiall glorye. whiche is perdurable and ſhall dure worlde withouten ende.

Certeyne there be ſondry condicōns yt ſpecyally encreace by occaſyons the paynes of helle. The fyrſte is bytterneſſe wepyng gryndyng of tethe / complaynyng the perpetuell dethe / paynfull languyſſynge in deſpayre / & the wrath & blamyng of the creatour of alle thynges with other many tourmē

                  e & vnderſtonde there by ſyn̄ers / as it appereth in dyuerſe places of holy ſcrypture / & as it is wryten in Thapocalyps in ye .xvi. chapitre. They haue eten theyr conges for grete ſorowe & haue blaſphemed the god of heuen for theyr anguyſſhys & theyr woūdes. ſaynt Gregory ſayth that he yt is cō
                  dempned to the cormentes fyndeth more payne there then̄e can be ſuppoſed or thought. ſayne The rome ſeyth that the force of the ſorow in helle ſhal be ſoo grete yt it can not addreſſe his corage / but as the force of the ſaid ſo rowe wyll cōſtrayne. Certeyn the ſynner ſhall ſay then as is wryten in Iheremye in the .viii. chapitre. My woo encreaſeth

in ſorowe vppon ſorowe. The egreneſſe of the paynes of helle ſhalbe ſo grete that ſynners ſhall hate & dyſprayſe lyfe / whiche vnyuerſally is delyted & with a brennyng deſyre wyſſhe to fynde deth whiche euery man wolde flee. As it is wryten in ye Apocalyps in the .ix. chapitre. A day ſhall come yt men ſhall deſyre & wyſſhe for deth / & ſhall not haue it / they ſhall requyre deth & it ſhall flee away from them. In trouthe our lorde wytneſſeth the egreneſſe of the paynes of helle in Iheremy in the .ix. chapitre / where he ſayth. I ſhall fede my people with abſynth / comonly named worm wode the whiche is a bytter herbe. & I ſhal gyue them to drynke galle / wherby is ſignifyed the bytternes of the tormentes of helle It is red yt this egreneſſe was wel conſydered by a yonge man whiche was delycyouſly nouryſſhed. Neuertheleſſe he entred in to thorder of prechers / and whene he had ben in the ſayde order a whyle / there came a man from his kyneſfolkes to amoniſſhe hȳ to depart thens or he were profeſſed / ſhewyng hȳ howe delyciouſly he had ben brought vp & therfore he myght not ſuſteyne ye dures paynes & troubles perteynyng to the ſayd order. The yonge man anſwered. I haue entred in to this order knowynge well yt I was voluptuouſly nouryſſhed and myght not well ſuffre. But I remēbre well that the troubles paynes of helle ſhall be importable / wherfore I hadde

leuer to ſuſteyne the lityll payne of this ordre / then the paynes whiche ar incōparable. For Iob ſaythe in his .vi. chapitre. the ſnowe ſhall falle vppon them that ſhall drede the lytyll myſt. This conſyderacyon moued an here myte called Pyers to enterpryſe a merueylous penaunce. whiche he accomplyſſhed / as Saynt Gregory ſheweth in the .iiii. boke of his dyalogis this heremyte dyed by a ſekeneſſe / & yet after his deth his ſoule was reſtored agayne to his body. Alſo Saynt Gregory ſayth / that there was ſomtyme a monke horn of Irlond
                     
                        
                     
                     er
                   called Pyers. this monke affermed how he had ſeen the greuous tourmentes of helle. the innumerable paynfull places & flāmes of fyre. and tolde how he hadde ſeen there certeyn mighty men of this worl de hanged vp in the ſayd flāmes. And he ſayd as he was brought for to be caſt in / ſodeynly appered an angell clothed alle in whyte. whiche ſaued him and bad hym goo thens & attentyfly to remēbre how he ſholde lyue from thens forthwarde to kepe him out of the danger of the paynes. After that he had herde that voyce. he reuyued and came to him ſelfe lityll and lityll and ſhewed vnto his brethern there all the thyngis that he had felte and ſeen / and from that day forthwarde he vſed & lyued a bleſſyd lyfe in faſtyng & doyng penaſice. ſo that by his conuerſacion after it myght well ſeme ye paynes of helle ar to be dred The ſecōde cōdicion

encreaſyng the paynes of helle is the multyplyeng of the tourmentes there. In certeyn they be innumerable. And as the pſalter ſayth. The paynes / whiche be without nombre haue enuyroūd & beclypped me. It is wryten in Deutronomy the xxxii chapitre. I ſhall aſſemble many dyuers paynes vpon them. & I ſhal accō
                  plyſhe or ſpende the ſhot of myn arowes in them. & as it is wryten in Iſay the .v. chapitre. His arowes be full ſharpe & alle his bows are bent / oure lorde hath many arowes in his quiuer / whiche he hath not yet ſhot forthe / but after ye Iugement he ſhall ſmyte alle ſynners with them. Theſe arowes are the dyuerſe paynes of helle / where as ſȳ
                  ners ſhall be thenne tour mented in many maners the Pſalter ſayth. The arowes of the myghty. yt is to ſaye of oure lorde be ſharp amonges the coles of deſolacyon. Our lorde ſayth in Deutronomy ye xxii. chapitre. I ſhall 
                     •
                  mbrewe myne arowes in theyr blood / my ſwerde ſhall deuour theyr fleſſhe they ſhall peryſſhe by famyne / & the byrdes ſhall ſtrangle them with a ful bytter morſell. I ſhall ſende avenſt them the tethe of wylde beſtes with the furour of thoſe yt rampe & deuour vpon the erthe. Outwarde ye ſwerd ſhall deſtroye them. & Inwarde fere & drede ſhall waſt them Of this multytude of paynes ſpeketh ſaynt Gregory in the .viii. chapitre of Saynt Mathew ſayeng. They ſhall be caſte out in to thuttermeſte

tenebres / that is to ſaye helle where ſhall be an vnſuffrable colde / an vn quencheable hete / an immortale worme / an intollerable ſtynche / a derkeneſſe manyable / and an hortyble vyſyon of deuel les threſſhyng and betynge a confuſyon of ſyn̄ers a ſeparacyon of all Ioyes And therfore ſayd a wyſe man / yt helle is a mortyfyeng pyt full and accomplyſſhid with all paynes and myſeryes. The Pſalter ſeyth. It ſhall reyne brymſtone vppon ſynners and the ſpyrytes of tempeſtis. whiche be part of the ſorowes and tourmēntes of helle. And that ſayeng is to be noted by cauſe that there be many other partes of tourmentis impoſſyble to be expreſſed. all that euer we haue ſpoken of the paynes of helle is a full lytyll thynge in regarde of the grete infynyte multytude of them / but to thentent yt the multyplycacōn of the 
                     •
                  e paynes may be the more expreſſely declared. It is alſo to be noted howe dampned ſoules ſhall be full of all myſeryes & ſo rowes. for they ſhall euer haue wepyng eyen gryndyng of theyr tethe. ſtynche in theyr noſes wayllyng in theyr voyces. fere in theyr eres / brennynge of fyre in all theyr membres / & therin ſhalbe boū
                  den honde & fote. Lo how the wretched ſyn̄er deſcendyng in to helle ſhall be fulfylled with all tormentes. It is wryten in Iob the .xv. chapitre of ye dāpned man how tribulacōn ſhal holde him. & anguyſ ſhe ſhall enuyron̄e hym. And in the .xiii. chapitre

of Iſaye. How all mennys hertes ſhall be abaſſhed & ferde for the ſorowes & torcyons that ſhal holde hym hauynge the payn that women ſuffre trauelyng of childe / echo ne ſhall ſorowe vpon his neyghbour / & theyr broyled faces ſhall affray eue riche other. Therfor Baruch ſayd in his .vi. chapitre. Theyr faces be blacked with ſmoke / for the faces of all ſynners ſhall be brought to the lykeneſſe of a rounde potte. as it is wryten in Iohell the ſeconde chapitre. Alſo it is ſayde in Eccleſiaſtyco the .xlviii. chapitre. The paynes of a woman trauelynge ſhall come vnto them. The ſame alſo is wryten in Ozee the .xiii. chapitre. Soo as it appereth there be many ſcorges & fleyles in helle for to bete ſynners therwith. Certeynly the dampned ſoule ſhall mowe ſaye with the Pſalter. The ſorowes of deth haue compaſſed me / & the paynes of helle haue foūden me. It ſayth. It hath compaſſed me for this cauſe. For it is to hym a veſtyment or coueryng of maledyccion. whiche ſhal be both within hym & withoute hym. O what veſtyment ſhall this be that ſhal be women with ſoo paynfull thredes / & thoſe without nombre / whiche can neuer be vndone nor taken away. for with an inmortale ſtryng it ſhall be inſeparably bounden vnto the ſynner. This ſhall be a ſore and a bytynge veſtyment to be ſuffred. This is the veſtymente that is wryten of in Iſaye in the .xiii. chapitre

ſayeng. Thy veſtyment ſhall be wormes. The cō
                  ſyderacōn of theſe many folde paynes reuoked & called Dauyd from ſyn̄e & cauſed hym to doo penaūce. & therfore he ſayd to our lorde. How many ſorecribulacōns haſt yt ſhe wed me. & yt cōuerted haſt reuyned me. The conſyderacōns alſo of thiſe for ſaid paynes moeued ſomtyme an heremyte for to take-vppon hym a right ſharpe paynfull lyf. whiche he ledde in his heremitage. as it is red in Vitis patrū. It was axed of hȳ why he wolde ſo ſlee him ſelfe. And he anſwered. All the labour of my lyf is not ſuffycyent to be cō
                  pared to one of the dayes of tourmentes that be or deyned & reſerued for ſynners in tyme to come Beda ſheweth vs in his wrytyng of Englond. how yt in ye tyme of yonge Conſtātyne ther dyed a knyghte about the yeres of our lord .viii. C. and .vi. whiche knyght reuyued. & after for the paynes yt he had ſeen / he fledde in to an heremytage / as it is red in Vitis patrū / & he made hȳ a lityll hous by a Ryuyer ſyde. In the whiche ryuyer he wolde renne oftentymes all clothed in the wynter tyme. & wold ſuffre his clothes to freſe vnto his fleſhe / & thenne after he wolde lepe in to a bayn as hote as hit was poſſyble to hȳ to ſuffre. And this lyf he ledde vnto his deth. And when̄e folkes ſawe hym do ſoo / they blamed hym therfor. & he ſayd to them Yf ye had ſeen that I haue ſeen / ye wolde do as I do. & rather more Saynt

Gregory ſayth. The vyſyon of the paynes of helle is the mooſt excellente moeuyng that can be to penaunce and contricion The thyrde condycyon encreaſyng the paynes of helle is the euerlaſtyngneſſe therof. It is wryten in the boke of Sapyence the .iiii. chapitre. Oure lorde ſhall mocke them. That is to vnderſtonde ſynners after they ſhall fall from theyr worſhyp among them that be ſempyternally dede. Saynte Mathew ſayth the .xxv. chapitre. They be thoſe / that ſhall goo in to tourmentes. In Iudyth the xvi. chapitre is red / that our lord ſhall ſende wormes of fyre ayenſt theyr fleſhe / that they may brē
                  ne and yet lyue and fele the paynes for euer. To that purpoſe ſpeketh Iſaye in his laſt Chapitre thꝰ. Theyr wormes ſhal not dye / nother theyr fyre quenche. And therfore ſayth our lord in Deutronomye in the .xxxii. chapitre. The fyre is kyndeled with my furour and ſhall brenne in to the loweſt parte of helle / and that ſhall be perpetuelly and endeleſly. Iſaye in his .xxxiii. chapitre ſayth. O whiche of vs ſhal mowe ſuffre and endure the deuourynge fyre / who ſhall mowe be amonge thoſe that ſhall be brente ſempyternally. In the xxxiii. chapitre of the ſame Iſaye is ſayde. The groūde where they dwelle ſhall be conuerted into brennynge pytche nyght and daye / and ſhall not quenche / and the ſmoke ſhall be from generacōn to generacōn vpon them

duryng the world of worldes. It is wryten in the Apocalyps in the .xx. chapitre. The deuyll ſhalbe ſente in to the lake of fyre and ſulpher and brymſtone. where the euyll beſte and the falſe prophete ſhall be tormented nyghte and day in the worlde of worldes. And he that ſhal not be fonden in the book of lyfe / ſhall be ſente in to the lake of fyre there for to dwelle in the ſhadowe of dethe / where is none ordre / but ſempyternall horrour and ſorowe. It is wryten in Iob the .x. chapitre / and alſo Saynt Gregory ſeyth in his Moralles a right horryble worde. That is to wyte. Thenne ſhall the myſerable ſynners ſuffre a grete payne with a grete fere / a grete flamme with a derkeneſſe / and deth without deth / an ende without fynyſſhyng / for that dethe ſhall euer lyue / and that ende ſhall begynne alwaye ageyne. and that faute ſhall neuer fayle And a poete ſheweth howe that myſerable dethe can not dye nor fynyſſhe / but ſemeth alle waye that it begynneth and reneweth wepynges and languyſſhynges. Peter de bloys ſayd in a pyſtle. There ſhall be none order of ony maner of tormentes nother ſparynge / but endeleſly the paynes ſhall renue & begynne ageyn / dethe can not dye there / for it ſhall be alway ꝑmanent and neuer ceſſyng to thentent yt ye condāpned ſoules may myſerably alway encreace in theyr paynes and ſorowes and be nouryſſhed in eternall dethe. The

Pſalter ſayth. They be caſten in to helle as ſhepe and dethe fedeth them. Mowe thenne this ſynners haue theyr fedynge of deth. what ſhalbe their drynke. Herkene what is wryten in Deutronomye in the .xxxii. chapitre. the burgynge of the grape & the vyne that they ſhall haue / ſhall be ayſell and galle of Dragons / and the venym of the Adder called aſpe. whiche is incurable. O wherewith ſhall the ſynners be nouryſſhed / ſeeſt yt not howe they be perpetually tourmented with the mooſte cruell deth / they ſhall lyue then in dyeng / & ſhall be dede lyuyng. Saynte Bernard ſeyth in a boke that he ſente vnto Pope Eugeny. The bytynge worme & the lyuyng dethe. I grouge and ſecre gretely. I drede to falle in to the handes of the dethe that euer lyueth / and of the lyfe that neuer dyeth. Saynte Gregory ſayth. That the felon ſynners ſhall dye of inmortall deth. O good lord eternall why haſt yu ſuffred me doo contrarye thy wyll & werke myne owne ſorow / why helpeſt thou not me out of ſyn̄e. wherby I myght eſcape this ꝑpetuel deth. O how happy. o how bliſſed ſhal he be yt ſhal not be fouled nor ſmonged with the fylthes of ſynne / & yt hath not reioyſſhed him in the ſenſuale voluptacyons of this tranſytorye worlde / nor in tēporall vanytees. Certeyn I am ferde yt we myſerable ſynners haue erred from the waye of lyfe / & that the lyght of Iuſtyce hath not ſhyned

vpon vs / we haue not folowed the wayes of oure lorde / but haue taken the vnhappy wayes of Iniquyte & perdycion. It is wryten in Iſaye the .xlix. chapitre / we haue laboured in vayn & for nought we haue waſted all oure ſtrengthe. what hath our pryde auayled vs / what hath profyted our pompe & the vanyte of the richeſſes of this worlde / what be we amended by oure Iewelles. or precyous garnementes. by our delicioꝰ metes and drynkes / oure glotonyes / our laughynges & ydle diſportes. now what auantageth vs all thynges. wherin we haue vaynely vnproufytably / & dampnably ſpent oure tyme. Alas alas / we haue loſt & paſſed our dayes without fruyte. and may be lykened to werſe then a dounghyll / and all thoſe thynges be paſte / but oure wretchedneſſe ſhall remayne to oure eternall tourmentes. Oure lorde ſhall ſaye to euery dampned ſoule. as is wryten in Iob in the .xx. chapitre. He ſhall ſuffre tourmentes & paynes after ye multytude of his wycked operacyons. and in the xviii. chapitre of thapocalyps is wrytē. As moche as he hath gloryfyed hym ſelfe in delytes & pleaſes / as moche tourment & payne ſhalbe yeuen him therfore to remayne therin eternally. Now is it not a grete folye for the riche or vayne pleaſyr of this world or ony other myſerable thyng a man to ſubmytte hym to perpetuall tormēt both of his body & of his ſoule. Iohan cryſoſtom ſayth in his book

tytled of the reparacyon of defaultes / what contynuaūce of lecherye & ſpace of delectacyons wylt yu compare to the ſempyternall paynes. Now take yt thou lyue. C. yere in delectacynns / ſette therto an other. C. & yet. C. & after that .x. hondred yf yu wylt yet what comparyſon is this to theternyte. Maye not all the tyme of oure bodely lyfe. though we entended neuer ſo voluptuouſly be reſembled vnto a dreme of the nyght in regarde of the ſempyternall lyfe. Is ther ony perſone yt ought wyl to haue one pleaſant & delectable nyght in diemes / & therfore to fynde the ſempyternall paynes / & ſo chaū
                  ge for a pleaſant dreme ſo lytyll enduryng / to haue ye paynes of helle. whiche be ꝑpetuel. what ſhal we ſpeke of this pleaſyr / or of thoſe paynes. The pleaſyrs paſſe lyghtly awaye / & the paynes muſt remayne euerlaſtyngly. Now take it. that the tyme & the ſpace of the pleaſyrs & of the paynes were egale. Is there ony that ought to be ſo mad or ſoo folyſſhe / as to cheſe for to haue for one day of pleaſyr here a day of dampnacyon in helle. Remembre how that one houre of bodely ſekeneſſe in this worlde putteth awaye alle pleaſyr for the ſeaſon. Right ſo Remembraunce how the perpetuell paynes ought to reſyſt ayenſt all ſynnes. O how grete tourment and payne ſhall be to the dāpned ſoules / theyr euerlaſtynge dampnacyon and perpetuell deth is ſo harde & ſo ſore / that I wote

not how / that I coude expreſſe hit greuouſely Inowe. for certeynly it can not ſuffycyentely be ſpoken. conceyued in mynde nor comprehended in herte. Nowe take we that there were a pece of metalle as grete as myghte be comprehended within the concauyte of the .viii. ſpere. and euery .M. yere there ſholde be taken frō hit a lytyll pece lyke a grayn / and ſo conſequentely tyll it were all broughte to no thyng / ſholde not the eternyte be fynyſſhed by that tyme / & the dampned ſoules delyuered out of theyr paynes. I anſwere and ſaye you nay / for the perpetuyte ſhall be thenne but atte the begynnyng. there can be no ꝓporcion in a thynge Infynyte / as Aryſtotyle the phyloſophre ſayth in his .viii. booke of his phyſykes. Certaynly yf dampned ſoules myghten knowe & vnderſtande that they ſholde be delyuered out of thyntollerable paynes of helle as ſoone as the ſayd pece of metalle were ſoo waſted & gone / as is aboue ſayd yet they myght haue hope of theyr Redempcyon ayenſt that ſeaſon / and haue ſome maner of confort. knowyng that theyr tourmentes ſholde ſome tyme taken ende / yet the yeres wolde be incomprehenſyble and innumerable. Nowe ſurely one of the gretteſt paynes is the deſolacyon and defaulte of hope euer to be redemed and delyuered oute of theternall tourmentis For as it is wryten in Iſay the .xxxiiii. chapitre. The ſynner ſhall be

in deſolacyon tyme and worlde withouten ende. It is wryten in the booke of Trenys the thirde chapitre. Myn ende and myne hope in god is peryſſhed. Iheremye in his xv. chapitre aſketh / why is my ſorowe made imꝑpetuell and my woundes in deſperacōn / wherunto is anſwered in the .x. chapitre of the Prouerbys. That whenne the felon ſynner is ones dede. there is thenne none hope to be had. Entende & remē
                  bre this all ye that be for geters of oure lorde / leeſt that this mooſt cruell & ſorowfull place of helle ſwalowe you / frō whens ye maye neuer be pulde oute. Loo nowe ye maye ſee clerely / how the wretched ſynner can not be redemed oute of helle. wherfore my ryghte dere frendes I amoneſte & requyre you / bere that remembraūce well in youre myndes / and conceyue well the Example of the pece of metalle aboue ſpecyfyed. And now telle me what thou feleſt. and what thyn owne hert demeth and Iugeth in this mater. I wene certaynly thy dyſcrecyon wyll gyue therunto credence / for trewe it is / & to trouth by Reaſon yt muſt nedes applye. Alſo bethynke the of the dyuerſe prouynces of londes & ymagine euery Regyon of them. Conſyder the ſees the ryueres & the poondes. Encloſe in thy mynde the circuyte of the worlde / & goo euery where therof. Flee vp in to the ayer / and thenne deſcende in to the loweſt parte of therthe / & of all this thynke in thy

mynde / thou haſt made an hole ſubſtance & ymagyne & extende how gret a thynge this ſhold be / & yf hit myght not be conſumed by tracte of tyme / & thenne tell me what yu thynkeſt of thynfynyte paynes of ſynners. whether ſholde be longe endurynge the conſumyng of the ſame ſubſtance. or the releſſyng of the perdurable paynes. I 
                     ••
                  owe thou wylt agre. yt there can no thynge be compared to a perpetuyte / wherfore we ought all in our corages tymerouſely to tremble & fere it. Now who is he yt dredeth hit not. who is he yt abaſſheth not therof. who is he yt had not leuer abyde the conſumyng of ye forſayd ſubſtance. than the tyme of eternyte. Lete this ſayde ſubſtance and this tyme of eternyte be couched vpon thyn herte and thou ſhalt fynde it a proufytable thyng & gretely to thyne auantage. For yf thou wylt not correcte and reuoke thy ſelfe from thy ſynnes by the loue yt thou oweſt to bere vnto god. yet the myrour & Remembraunce of the Intollerable & Infynyte paynes ſholde reuoque / ſequeſtre and withdrawe the from ſynnes. O lorde god that this perdurable payne is to be eſchewed & drad. And wepynly we ought to Remembre our ſynnes by grete contryon / that we myght there by come to the euerlaſtyng ſaluacyon. Loo here afore hath be ſhewed the encreaſyng of thynfernale paynes / and how they may neuer ceſſe nor finyſſhe. whiche was well conſydered by one ſomtyme

called Fulſon of Mercelles / whiche was in his dayes an excellent Iouge lyre all abandouned and gyuen to the vanytees of the worlde. In a daye he bethought hȳ of the paynes of helle & of the eternyte theeof / & Remēbred in his herte. If he were compelled to lye in a fayre and a ſofte bed well hanged and pleaſantely dreſſed & for no neceſſyte myght departe out of it. yet all were it neuer ſo delycyous / it coude not lye in his power contynually to endure hit. And there vppon Remembred hym how he ſhold then mowe ſuſteyne thintollerable ꝑ petuell paynes of helle / whiche are languerouſe & from thens none may departe. This forſayde Fulſon conſyderyng that lefte all his vayne worldely delytes and made hym ſelfe a monke / and lychen was archybyſſhop of Tholouſe / where he lyued and guyded hym right holyly in the ſeruyce of our lord. The conſyderacōn of the perpetuell paynes of helle ſholde endure & comforte euery gode ſoule to fyght & reſyſt myghtly ayenſt his ghoſtely enemy / for yf the fende vaynquyſſhe & ouercome hym / he may be ſure to lye therfore withoute grete repentaūce & grace in the ſempyternale paynes of helle. And therfore for Iheſus ſake with alle your myght fyght & reſyſte vygorouſly ayenſte the cruell enemye of all mankynde / whiche dooth noughte but lyeth in a wayte for to brynge vs alle to dampnacyon. Egeſyppus ſayth in his

book of the deſtruccyon of Iewes. How that one of the grete Capytaynes of kynge Alexander beynge chyef of an Hooſt / ſawe on a tyme an Innumerable armee comyng ayenſt him to fyght with hym. And whenne his people ſawe them come / they dyſpoſed them to ete and to drynke for to make them of the more bodely myght and putte therin theyr truſte. This good Capytayne ſeeng that they gaue more hope to theyr bodely ſtrengthes than to the power of hym. whome all other myghtes can not reſyſte. ſayd in this wyſe. O ye noble and worthy men / lete vs dyne nowe togyder / for we be lyke to ſouppe this nyght in helle alle in a companye. This people heryng theſe wordes to eſchewe that heuy ſoupper / put theyr affyaunce in our lorde & ſette on / and fought ſoo vyguorouſly / that they with Tryumphe and honour ouercome theyr enemyes. Conſyderyng that Remembraunce of the paynes of Helie ſholde withdrawe vs from worldely delytes. Hit is redde in Vitis Patrum. Howe there was an Auncyent man that ſayde / whenne a woman wyl weene her childe and make it to lothe the ſweteneſſe of hyr mylke / ſhe wyll put vpon her pappes hede a lytyll muſtarde or ſome other bytter thyng / when̄e the childe feleth that / it withdraweth & putteth a waye his appetyte from the ſwete mylke. So ſemblably the ſoure Remembraunce of the perpetuell

tourmentes & paynes of helle ought to reuoque a man from all the vayne delectacyons of this wretched worlde. Iob ſayth in his .vi. chapitre. May not a man caſt of a thynge / whiche ſholde cauſe hym the right bytter dethe. That is to ſaye / the paynes perpetuell. Proſper ſeyth. In this preſente lyfe the temporall delytes be full pleaſant / & the trybulacions full bytter. But who is he that ſholde not gladly ſuffre trybulacyons in this lyfe for fere of the ſempyternall paynes of helle And who is he that ought not to dyſpyſe the delycyouſe pleaſyrs of this worlde forto haue the mooſt happy Ioye of euerlaſtynge blyſſe. It is ſayd alſo in the Legende of Saynte Iohan the Euangelyſt. That riche and myghty folkes were conuerted by his predycacyon / and relynquyſſhed alle theyr worldely rycheſſes.

And yf a man refrayne hymſelfe from mourder of from ony crymynale cauſe for fece of loſynge of his honour or temporale goodes. how moche more ought he refreyne / drede & eſchewe all ſynfull operacōns. wherby he myghte leſe the mooſt blyſfull ſempyternall Ioyes. ſaynte Auſtyn ſayth in a boke of his confeſſyons. There is a Ioye / whiche is not to be gyuen to the felon ſynners / but to thoſe that of theyr free wyll loue and worſhyppe the lorde god / and thou thy ſelfe arte that Ioye. For this cauſe it is wryten in the fyrſte Pyſtle ad Coryntheos the .vi. chapitre The felon ſynners ſhall not poſſeſſe the kyngdome of heuen / but ſhall confuſedly be put therfrō as the vyle glotons and dyſhoneſt folkes be chaſed out of thēperour his courte / and not ſuffre to ſytte among kynges and prynces at theyr excellente and ſolempne tables.

                  FIrſt the kyngdome of heuen is to be recommended for the ſouerayn beaute & clereneſſe therof as it is wryten in the boke of Sapience the .v. chapitre wherin it is called the Royalme of beaute. The Pſalter ſayth. Lord I haue loued the beaute of thyn hous. It is alſo wryten in Thoby the. xiii chapitre. I ſhal be happy yf the Relyques of my ſedes may ſee the derneſſe of Iheruſalem / wherof the gates be made of Saphyres & emerawdes & other precyoꝰ ſtones. The cyrcuyte of the walles wt fayre bryght ſtones. & all the places paued with fyne golde. It is wryten in Thapocalips the xxi chapitre That cyte was made of fyne golde pure & clene as glaſſe. The fondement of walles enourned with all precyous ſtones. The twelue gates ſhall haue twelue Margarytes. And the ſtretes of the cyte ſhall be of fyne golde ſhynyng as bryghte as glaſſe. The temple is not yet ſpoken of▪ Certeynly almyghty god is the temple therof / and the Lambe is the lyght. The forſavd Cyte hath noo nede of the Sonne / nor of the Mone to lyght hit with all. For the clereneſſe of oure Lorde ſhall

Illumyne hit / and the Lambe ſhall be the lanterne / and the peple ſhall mowe walke by that clereneſſe. It is alſo redde in the .xxii. Chapitre of Thapocalyps. It ſhall neuer be nyghte there / wherfore there nedeth no candell nor lanterne / nor lyght of the ſonne. For the bryghtneſſe of our lorde ſhall lyght and Illumyne them enduryngly worlde withouten ende / whiche ſayeng may well accorde with that / that is wryten in Iſaye the .lx. chapitre. Thou ſhalt haue thenne noo nede of the ſhynyng of the ſonne nor Reſplendyſſhyng of the mone. For oure lorde ſhall lyghte & Illumyne the ſempyternally. In trouth he is a glas without ony ſpot & a light Illumynyng euerlaſtyngly As it is wryten in the boke of Sapyence the .vii. chapitre. Alſo oure lorde ſhall be the Reſplendyſſhynge of glorye. As is wryten to the Hebreos in the firſt chapytre. whiche reſplendyſſhyng ſhall be an hole lyght. Abacuk in his .iii. chapitre ſayth of this reſplendyſſhyng all the ſayntes ſhall take in the Royame of heuen clereneſſe and ſempyternall lyght. wherwith all they ſhall reioyſe them inceſſantely in grete felycyte. It is alſo wryten in the book of Iugys the .v. chapitre. Thoſe that loue the / ſhall ſhyne and reſplende as the ſonne doth in his ryſyng. Alſo is writen in the book of Sapyence the .iii. Chapitre. How thoſe that be Iuſte ſhall ſhyne in theyr faders Royalme lyke the

ſonne. O lorde ſempyternall groūde of all vertu. how good and how gloryous is the Royalme / and how ought thy tabernacles to be beloued. how grete is thy beaute / how habundante is thy Reſplendyſſhyng in thy cyte. how merueylous is the bryght clereneſſe therof / and how ſouerayn is the ſwetneſſe of thy celeſtyal cōtree. For this cauſe ſeythe Saynt Auſtyn in his book of free arbytremen te. Soo grete is the beaute of Iuſtyce / ſoo grete is the ſweteneſſe of thyn eternall lyght. That yf it were not expedyent to de lyte therin but one houre of the daye for to haue that Ioye oonly. The in numerable dayes of this preſent lyfe full habundante of alle temporall goodes ought therfore reſonable to be myſpreyſed & forborne. Now certeynly it is not vnreſonably ſpoken / nor withoute a grete groūde / that better is to be one daye in that courte than a thouſande in this world. O celeſtyal Iheruſalem. O ſhynyng hous full of al bryghtneſſe I wyſſhe my pilgrymage to reche vnto the / and to be poſſeſſed in the by hym that made both the & me. And therfore ſeyth Saynt Bernarde in his thyrde book vppon the Goſpell Miſſus eſt angelus Gabriel. O how gloryous is the Royalme of heuen The kynges haue aſſēbled them in a mont that is to vnderſtonde. to loue prayſe and gloryfye hym that is kynge aboue alle kynges and lorde ouer all lordes. In the reſplendyſſhynge contemplacion

of whom the Iuſte people ſhall ſhyne as the ſonne in the Royame of theyr fader. To this purpoſe ſeyth the Pſalter thou ſhalt repleniſſhe me with gladnes in thy face Iob ſeyth alſo in ye xxxiii chapitre. His face ſhalbe ſeen in gret Ioyeful gladnes. All thoſe ſhall beholde & haue ſyghte of that mooſt ſwete Vyſage / yt haue trewely ſerued our lorde & ſauyour Iheſu cryſt in humylyte of herte / in good labours & vertuous werkes. Iſaye ſayth in his .xxxiii. chapitre They ſhall ſee the kyng of kynges in his grete beaute. O how blyſfull. O how aggreable. O how ſwete & how happy ſhall be the beholdyng of our ſauyoure Iheſu cryſte to thoſe yt haue ꝑfyghtly loued him Certeynly they ſhal mowe Ioyefully ſaye as is wryten in Abacuk the iii chapitre. I ſhall reioyſe me in our lord & diſporte me in Iheſu criſt my god O how gretly ſhal thoſe reioyſe them yt ſhalbe fulfylled with the celeſtyall Ioyes / & what gladneſſe ſhall they haue yt ſhall be Illumyned with the vyſyon of the reſplendyſſhynge face of our lorde god. The whiche Ioye & gladneſſe ſhall be permanent & abydyng worlde without ende.

               ¶ The ſeconde chapytre of the fourth parte & the laſt pryncypall.
               THe Royalme of heuen is ſecondly recō
                  mended for thabondante

goodneſſe therof. Saynt Auſtyn ſayth in his book de Ciuitate dei. That. yt god hathe ordeyned for thoſe yt he loueth / maye not be oonly atteyned by hope without it be cōpryſeo with charyte & ſoo it may will be atteyned. the Rewardes of the happy ſayntes can not be nombred nor eſtymed / thabū
                  daūce therof is withoute ende. & is ſo precyous yt it can not be ſuffycyentely preyſed. Of the ſuꝑhabū
                  dante ryche goodneſſe of this celeſtyal Royalme is wryten in Deutronomi in the .viii. chapitre thus Our lorde god ſhall lede the in a good cōtree / whiche is Indewed with waters. with fontayns. with ſprȳgis. with feldes. with montayns Out of ye whiche ſhall come floodes & ryueres. He ſhall lede the alſo in to a londe / where groweth whete / barly / & vynes / & where growe fygues & apples / grayns & olyfs / oyle & hony / & there without ony neceſſyte thou ſhalte ete thy brede with habundance of all good is Now certayn this is a right comodyous cō
                  tree fulfylled with ſweteneſſe / this is the contree / to the whiche were ſente the ſones of Adam As is writen in the book of Iugys the .xviii. chapitre / whiche ſayd at theyr Retourne. we haue ſeen a comodyous plentyfull contree right riche / wyll ye not myſpreyſe it nor ceſſe we not / but lete vs go take poſſeſſyon therof. For there is no labour / & our lorde ſhall gyue vs a roome therin / wherby we ſhall haue none neceſſyte nor lacke. For there is no

thyng that enoyeth / and all good delectacyons be there Saynt Auſtyn ſaythe that the eternall beatytude & wele be ſpecyally in two thynges. That is to wyte. In the abſence of all euyll / and in the preſence of all wele. Now yf yt wylt axe me / what thynges be in heuen. I can anſwere the none otherwyſe / but all thynge that is good is there. and all thyng that is nought canne neuer come there. And therfore ſayth ſaynt Gregory. There is noo good thynge deſyred nor lacked there / nother there is ony thynge within hit yt hurteth or enoyeth. It is wryten in the laſte chapitre of thapocalyps They ſhall noo more haue honger nor thyrſt / nor the ſonne nor the hetes ſhall no more hurt them for the lambe of god / whiche ſytteth in ye myddle of the crone ſhall gouerne and bryng them to the fontayne of the water of lyfe. And more is folowynge in the ſame chapitre he ſeyth. Shewe me the flode the ryuere of the water of lyfe. who hath thyrſte / come and drynke / who wyll haue of that water of lyfe come and take it. And he that hath of that water / ſhall neuer be thyrſty / as it is wryten in the goſpel of ſaynt Iohan in the. iii chapitre. O how happy and how bleſſyd is that contree / where god ſhall be all thyng in all thyng and where is no pouerte. nor lacke of ony thynge that is good. This contree is the celeſtyall paſture / wherin ſhall nede nothyng to be wyſſhed. For

in this paſture ſhall oure lorde beayte and fede his trewe louers whome he wyll beclyppe perpetually. Therfore ſayth oure lorde in Ezechyell the xxxiiii. chapitre. I ſhall put them in theyr cōtrees & fede them in the montayns of Iſrahell. Now certeynly the happy ſayntes of heuen be wel fedde with knowleche of the ſouerayne trouthe / whiche is to them a ful fructnouſe paſture. be it when they entre in contemplacōn of the dyuynyte / or in conſyderynge the grace of the humanyte. And in bothe theſe they ſhal fynde cauſe to be ſacyate and fed with delectacyons. And they ſhall fele the fruyte of ſouerayn ſweteneſſe / & as the Pſalter ſayth. He hath gyuen the thy fyll of the fyne fatneſſe of the floure of the whete. The fatneſſe of the floure of the whete is delectacion of ſweteneſſe cauſed by the loue of god. Of the whiche flour of whete by the ſame loue mote my ſoule be fulfylled / and thenne I ſhall reſte in the eternall Ioyouſe ſurete alwayes wexynge grene and neuer to drye. Here is now ſhewed how good is this contree where in the happy men ſhal be fed / whiche is ſo fruyt full and plenteuous. Certaynly this is the contree of lyfe. In the whiche we muſt hope to ſee ye goodneſſe of our lord. the Pſalter ſayth / we ſhall all be fulfylled with the goodes of thyn hous. Now what be the goodes / that ſayntes ſhalle be fulfylled with. but oonly the grace of the Incomprehenſyble

glorye. Saynt Bernard ſayth in a ſermon of the Dedycacyon. The reſonable ſoule made after the ymage of God may well be occupyed with al other thyngis. but it may not be all fulfylled. Certeynly ſhe cōprehendyng god may not be fulfylled with leſſe thynge than god. we ſhal not oonly be fulfylled with this vnrecytable glory. but alſo we ſhall be dronken & aſſotted theron. It is redde in Iheremye the .xxxi. chapitre. I ſhall make dronke the ſoules of the preeſtes of grace / that ſhalbe at the grete ſoupper whiche is ordeyned for good folkes. He ſhall ſette and admynyſtre them mete of glorye. and gyue them drynk of merueyloꝰ Ioye & ſwetenes Then it ſhal be ſayd to thoſe that ſhal ete there. As is wryten in the Cantycles the .v. chapitre. My right dere frendes. Ete and drynke and make you dronken. In Iſaye the .xxix. chapitre alſo it wryten Make you dronken / but not with wyne / & wher with then̄e ſhall they make them dronken / with Ioye and with gladneſſe and with felycyte / and with many maners of the celeſtyall glorye. O good lord god eternall. how ſwetly ſhal thy good and newe ſeruauntes be dronken with the plenteuouſnes of thyne houſe / & with the voluptuouſneſſe of the. For in the is the fontayne of lyfe / the fontayne of beatytude and of glorye permanent and neuer fayllyng. Certeynly all ſweteneſſe belongeth to thyne houſe. It is the houſe of

our lord / the cyte of god / whiche is full of all rycheſſes / & reſplendyſſhed with all goodes. Therfore ſeyth Iſay in his xxiii chapitre. Thyn eyn ſhal ſee Iheruſalem full habundant of alle goodes. The grete multytude of the copyous habundance of the thynges before ſayde of this cyte ſholde not holy ſatyſfye to calle vs thyder / but alſo right ſpecyally the reſtfull multytude of this peas. wherin thoſe yt be happy / ſhall delyte them enherytyng ye contree aboue ſpecifyed The ſame Iſaye ſayth in his lv chapitre. ye ſhal paſſe out in Ioye / & ſhall be brought in to peas. O how grete ſhall the habū
                  dance of this peas be in Iheruſalem / wherin it ſhall remayne perpetuelly without ony waire. Iſay yet ſayth in the .ix. & .xxxii. chapitres. My peple ſhall be in the beaute of peas / & in the tabernacles of confydence / & in the riche habundance of reſte. Alſo Thobye ſayth in ye .xiii. chapitre. O Iheruſalem cyte of god. happely blyſſed be thoſo yt loue the / and reioyſe them in thy peas. It is in Ezechyell the .xiii. chapitre.

Of the whiche inmeſurable felycyte and glory of that noble Cyte ſpeketh Saynt Auſtyn in his boke of the cyte of our lorde ſayeng. O how grete ſhall the felicite be there. where ſhal be nother payne / nor harme / nor wele / nor good thyng hydde / but entendynge hooly vnto the louynges and prayſynges of our lord.

O how gloryous is the Royame / where in the blyſſed ſayntes reioy ſe them with Iheſu Cryſte / and they cladde as in whyte aulbes folowe alwayes the lambe Now of this worlde to come ſpeketh ſaynt Auſtyn in his boke of the debate by twix vertues & vyces ſayeng The loue of this prelence worlde is departed from me / for there is no creature / but he muſt nedys fynyſſhe & dye here. Hit all other wyſe of the loue of the worlde / that is to come. In the whiche all be ſoo vyuyfyed / that they can neuer dye after therin. And therin is none aduerſyte / noo trouble / none anguyſſhe no payne / no dyſeaſe ennoyng. nor weryneſſe. but therin reygnen ſempyter nall Ioyes. The Pſalter ſayth. The Iuſte folkes eten and drynken / and reioyſen them in the

preſens of our lord delycynge them in gladneſſe. And alle ſorowe & waylynges fleeth from them It is wryten in Thapocalyps the .xxi. chapitre. Our lorde ſhall drye the teeres of theyr eyen. Moreouer / there ſhal be then no wepyng. ſayeng. ſorowe. nor dethe. for all that ſhall be paſſed before. Iſaye ſayth in his .xxv. chapitre. Our lorde ſhall take awaye the teeres of euery face / & ſhall take away the repreuys of his people in euery londe / & then the folkes ſhall ſaye Here is oure lorde god / whome we haue abyden whiche ſhall ſaue vs / we haue ſuſteyned and ſuffred for hym. And therfore we reioyſe vs with and by hym in ſaluacyon. O how grete ſhall be that Ioyeful gladneſſe to thoſe that ſhall be gloryfyed not oonly in loule / but alſo in body It is writen in Iſaye the .lxi. chapitre. They ſhall be double poſſeſſed in theyr londe. And in the Prouerbis the laſte chapitre is wryten. Alle his famylyare huſholde ſeruaūtes ſhall be cladde double. That is to wyte with two aulbes yt one is the body. whiche they now poſſede. tho ther the ſoule. & they ſhal not oonly haue Ioye of theyr owne proper good werkis. but alſo ſyngulerly of the merytes of the happy ſayntes. Our lord ſayth in Iheremye the xxxiii. chapitre. I ſhall enhabyte them aſſuredly / & they ſhall be my people. I ſhall be theyr god. and ſhall gyne them an herte and a ſoule▪ not oonly by the vnyte of ſubſtance / 

but by the boſide of charyce. Beholde me righte dere frendes / yf the ſoule of a martyr / of a confeſſour / of a virgyn & youres be allones Conſequē
                  tly it ſemeth that ye ſhal reioyſe you in their Ioyes & that your ſoules ſhall be ſemblable vnto the apoſtles or ony other ſayntes. Saynt Gregory ſaythe how charyte ſhall be ſo plenteuouſly there that that wyll. whiche he hath not for hym ſelfe. he ſhal reioyſe in ſeeng an other to haue it. Certeynly thoſe merueylous and manyfolde Ioyes can neuer entre mannes herte here and there euery hert ſhal be replenyſſhed and fulfylled with them. For wt

In the outward parte by the gloryfyeng of theyr bodyes. In the lower parte by the renouelyng beautees of the heuens and of the creatures there. In the hygheſt parte by the clere and vyſyble ſyghte of our lorde god. And in alle other partes by the Ioyefull & delectable cō
                  panye of all the ſayntes of heuen. Now trewely there is no man that can ymagyne or thynke the greteneſſe of the Ioyes yt be there. I ne can telle the reioyſyng of the Inhabytātes in henen reygnynge there amonge the angelles of our lord god perpetuelly. It is writen in the Goſpell of Sayn te Mathewe in the .xxv. chapitre. Entre thou in

to the Ioye of thy lorde / entre thy ſelfe in to that Ioye / and with all thyne herte entre therin Of thoſe Inmeſurable quantytees of the celeſtial Ioyes ſpeketh Saynt Bernarde in his book of Medytacyons. Theyr gladnes hath all thyng in poſſeſſyon / therin all feſtynges be poſſeſſyd. and the men accompanyed with angelles ſhall remayne there perpetuelly withoute hauyng ony maner fleſhly Infyrmyte. There is infynyte Ioyouſnes / ther is ſempyternall beatytude / & after ye one is there to receyue it / he ſhall remayne therin ꝑdurably / there is reſte without labour / peas and frenſhyp without enuye. quietenes & ſurete without dangere & the mooſt pleaſant ſwe teneſſe in the vyſyon of our lord god. Saynt Bernarde ſayth.

Now what ſhall I more ſay of this contree & holy Cyte

It is red alſo in Iſay the .li. chapitre. xlll Ioye & gladnes ſhall be founden in ye contree with accyons of graces & voyces of louynges & all ſhall ſaye in his Temple / louyng honour and glorye be to the lorde. And therfore the voys of gladnes and helthe ſhal ſowne in the tabernacles of Iuſte folkes. In the Cyte of our lorde ſowne contynuelly thorgons of the ſayntes / whiche haue vtterly forgeten the trybulacōns paynes / labours / & wretchedneſſes of this worlde vſynge in enioyeng the celeſtyall blyſſe. O how ſwetely / how pleaſantly. and howe clerely ſynge thoſe in delaſol that before haue wepte in gammoth & in are. Of this Cyte ſpeketh Saynt Auſtyne in his book of medytacyons ſayeng.

There is peas / pyte / bounte / clerenes / lyght / vertu / honeſte / glorye / reſte / louynge / loue / good concorde / Ioye / ſwetences / blys / and perdurable lyfe. Of all thoſe and the perdurable lyfe ſhal

the happy ſoules be certayne and ſure withoute ony leſyng therof. Iſaye ſayth in his .xxxii. chapitre. There ſhall be ſurete for euer. Ezechyell ſayth in his .xxxviii. chapitre. They ſhall inhabyte fermely in eternyte withoute ony maner of fere. It is redde in the Prouerbes of Salomon in the fyrſte Chapitre. He that hath well herkened / ſhall reſte without fere and enioye in habundance. Saynte Auſtyn ſayth. That the eternall ſurete enourneth and fulfylleth the beatytudes of alle the celeſtyall goodneſſes. where yf that ſempyternyte ſholde faylle / alle the other celeſtyall goodneſſes be they neuer ſoo ſwete / ſholde be the leſſe to be prayſed. Saynte Iohan ſayth in his xviii. chapitre. In aſſurynge vs / there is noo man that ſhalle bereue you your Ioye. O hous of our lorde. Cyte of the grete kynge / how Innumerable and how grete be thyne eternall Ioyes with the manyfold gladneſſes of thoſe happy ſoules yt be enhabyted with the.

Ozee ſayth in his .xiiii. chapitre. His glorye ſhall be lyke an olyfe tree. whiche is & contynueth grene wynter and ſomer. Of this eternall glorye ſayth alſo Iohan Cryſoſtom in his boke of the Reparacion of the falle of man.

For one reioyſeth hym not oonly of that wele and pleaſer that he vſeth and hath preſently in oeure / but moche more by cauſe he maye be ſure. Thoſe Ioyes pleaſers and blys ſhall neuer admynyſhe nor ende. Loo who is he that ſhall be partyner to that Ioye / whiche is endeles.

Thou ſhalt be habundant thenne in the delectacyon of the mooſt myghty lorde / and ſhalt lyfte vp thyn eyen towarde god / and the lyghte ſhall ſhyne in thy wayes Of this lyght is wryten in Eccleſyaſtyco the .xi. chapitre. It is a delectable lyght to ſee the ſonne That is to vnderſtonde Iheſu Cryſte. whiche to knowe and beholde perdurably paſſeth and ſurmoūteth all the Ioyes of this worlde / & is no meruayll. for that knowleche and vyſyon is the fode glorye and lyfe ſempyter nall of the happy ſayntes. Saynt Iohan ſayth in his .xviii. chapitre. the eternall lyfe is this / to know the ſool veray god and Iheſu Cryſte / whome thou ſendeſt downe in to this erthe for oure redempcyon. Now thenne he that maye obteyne and come to that blyſfull knowleche after dyuyne lecture & to ſee god face to face / that ſhall be the mooſt excellente Ioye and a ſpryngyng of all Ioyefull gladneſſes. ſaynte Bernard ſayth in his ſermon. Verayly that is a trewe and a ſouerayne Ioye / whiche is cōceyued and had not oonly by one creature / but alſo by the creatour and maker of all creatures / whiche Ioye yu ſhalte haue when he ſhall ſhewe the his face. wherfor the ꝓphete de ſyryngly ſayd. Lorde I requyre the / lete me ſee thy gracyous face full of all Ioye and gladneſſe Alas my delectacyon is prolon

ged from me tyll I may haue that grete wele. and tyll I maye be drawen vnto god my ſauyour / I ſhall ſhede teeres nyghte and daye. Certaynly the vyſyon by the whiche our lorde is ſeen face to face is in the thyrde heuen / and yf it myght be ſayd / it is the paradyſe of thouſande heuens / wherin the fontayne of clere water is ſeen by the happy lyfe. Iſaye ſayth in his .lx. chapitre Thou ſhalt ſee then the face of our lorde / and ſhalte be habundant in delectacyons and Ioyes ſempyternally. O how good arte thou lorde of Iſraell to them that haue rightfull hertes / whiche wyll gyue them ſoo grete ſoo ryche and ſoo pleaſante Ioyes. My right dere brethern ye here gladly ſpeke of theſe delectacyons and Ioyes. and take pleaſer therin. Neuertheleſſe ye ought not to be Ignorant to vnderſtonde that the bleſſyd ſayntes come neuer to theſe Ioyes / but by grete paynes and labours. Saynt Gregory ſeyth in his Omely The greteneſſe of the rewardes gyueth me corage / and my labours oughte not to fere me / for one maye neuer atteyne to the grete rewardes but by grete labours. That noble prechour Saynte Poull in the ſeconde Pyſtle to Tymothe the ſeconde Chapitre ſayth. How that there ſhall be none crowned / but ſuche as haue manfully foughted. Verely euery man ſhall receyue his Rewardes / whiche ſhall be after his labours. There

be dyuerſe that wyll not lyue well / and yet they deſyre to dye well. They maye knowe the dethe of ſayntes is full precyous in the preſens of our lorde / they maye knowe alſo when our lord hath gyuen reſte to his ſoules they ſhall dwelle in his herytage permanentely by cauſe they haue be thoſe that alwayes haue folowed hym in reſyſtynge temptacyons. Many of you wolde regne with Iheſu Cryſte / but ye wyll ſuffre noo thynge for his ſake. Balaam ariolus was ſuche one / for in conſyderynge the caſtell of the childern of Iſrahell he entended the hauyng of the eternall beatytude / and ſayde in hymſelfe. Dye my ſoule as Iuſte folkes dye / and be my laſte thynges ſemblable vnto theyrs / he delyted gretely theyr gloryous ende / but he grouged to take theyr labours and paynes where by they hadde deſerued the glorye eternall. O god lorde Iheſu we wolde gladdely regne with the. Neuertheles we wyll not labour nor be partycypable to thy ſuffrances Thou chaſeſte myſerye and pouerte / and we haue taken vs vnto voluptuouſneſſes and delectacyons. Thou haſt taken vpon the and ſuffred bytterneſſes and ſharpeneſſes to thy body / and we haue choſen and folowed oure ſenſuale pleaſyrs. Saynte Bernarde ſayde. The ſone of god is borne / to whoos wyll was graunted alle that myght pleaſe hym. He choſe to be borne in the

mooſt greuous tyme / & the bleſſyd lityll babe borne of a poore moder vnnethe hauynge clothes to wrappe and couer it in the crybbe. Certeinly Iheſu Cryſte / whiche neuer is deceyued chace that / ye mooſt moleſted & greued his fleſhe. Loo thenne it is beſt ſwetteſt and moſte profytable to cheſe the bardeſte payne in this worlde. And who ſoo euer amoneſteth or techeth otherwyſe one ought to beware of hym and gyue hym lityll credence. It was ones promyſed by Iſaye a lityll childe / that coude repreue the euyll and cheſe the good. The euyl was the voluptuous pleaſer of the body & the good was the payne and afflyccion therof. A trouthe this childe is the ſone of god / whiche choſe thaffliccōns and repreued & forſoke the voluptuoꝰ pleaſers. As ſainte Bernard ſayd. O righte dere childe / thou haſte choſen from thy begynnyng here corporal affliccions / & in ſuffrance haſt entred into thy glory whiche was properly thyne owen / and we lyuyng in delectacions wolde entre in to that glorie / wherin we be but ſtrangers and not dygne to come thyder / but by thy grace. There agaynſt ſpeketh Saynte Auſtyn ſayeng. If it haue behoued Iheſu criſte lorde and kynge whoſe name is aboue all names to haue ſuffred & therby hath entred in to his eternall glorie / what hope or truſt ſhall we haue to come thyder without ſuffrance / ſyther we be ſtrangers / and can ha

ue none entre there but by hym. O how folyſhe and how hard herted we be truſte in reioyſyng vs in this worlde and after to regne with Iheſu criſt in heuen / he entred there in all naked / yet was he therin lorde / and we wolde entre therin that be alcharged with ſuperfluoꝰ garnementis with richeſſe of golde and ſyluer & precyoꝰ ſtones. He entred therin chaſt and faſtyng & thou wylt entre therin full of glotonye and lecherye. He dyed vpon the croſſe for to redeme the / yt delycyouſly ſlepeſte in thy bed. Sholde then the ſeruaūt haue yt the mayſter had not and wyll not bye it as he dede Certeynly nay / and me thynketh it were a thyng to vnreſonable. Herken now what a Poete ſayth. The lord hath ſwet vpon the croſſe ſhall not the ſeruaunt do the ſame. Now bere your croſſe for he hath borne his / taſte of the vynegre as he dede. The reuerence nor the eaſe of the ſeruaunt ſholde not be more than that of the lorde. If yu wylt folowe him yu muſt enſue his tourmentes / and holde for certayne / thou canſt not come in heuen by delytes and pleaſyers. And therfore whenne thou ſhalt paye onto oure lorde thy de

man to vſe and haue the welthe and pleaſyer of this worlde pure / and alſo of that to come. and that the fyllynge of his bely here ſholde fede his ſoule / and that he ſholde from delytes and pleaſers here / goo to delytes and pleaſers there / and that he ſholde appere gloryfyed in bothe worldes. He ſeyth alſo in an other place / that it is Impoſſyble a man to be habundant in worldely richeſſes / and enſue Iheſu cryſte. For nature wyll not that twoo contraryes be medled togyder. Certaynely we maye not bothe be ſeruauntes vnto god and to the deuyll. Other I am deceyued / or in the ende they ſhall be begyled that byleueth it not. Thynke how the richeſſes of this worlde tourne to neceſſytees in thother worlde / the dampned Diues ete and dranke and lyued delycyouſly werynge precyous garnementes here / but when he was dede / becauſe he wolde not byleue Moyſes / he apperce

Thou haſt had many gret welthes in thy lyf & ye lepre hath ſuffred many paynes▪ but now he is in Ioye & conſolacōn. & yu arte in payne & torment euerlaſtynge / what ſhall we more ſaye. After that we ende ſoo muſt we be Iuged / wepynge is thextremyte of Ioye & ye may

not haue Ioye in this worlde by aduerſyte / but by aduerſyte here ye may haue theuerlaſtyng Ioye Certayne it is manyfeſte. that this worldly goodes be not veray goodes nother they be trewe that ſoo accepte them. The ſentence of Salomon is Iuſt. His ſentence is that it is better to be in the hous of lamentacyon / than in the hous of worldely felycyte. For thoſe that in theyr lyfe here haue receyued worldly proſperytees ſhall after therfore be tourmented / and for reioyſynge in theyr conſolacyons here / is ordeyned them a ſempyter nall payne / what maye be the ende of thoſe that haue here ſoo grete multytude of ſolaces & pleaſers. Doubteles no thynge but afflyccyons and ſorowes. Conſequentely thoos that reteyne the pleaſyrs and ſolaces of this world. that not with ſtondyng the vnyuerſall tourmentes and ſorowes remaynen vnto them. They haue taken vnto them the coragis of wretches / and all ſuche as theyr corages be ledde by theyr good angelles / deſpyſe and refuſe the goodes of this preſent lyfe / and choſe to ſuffre penaunce therin / wherby they atteyne the goodes of our lorde with all ſolace. Saynte Bernarde ſeyth Lete thy ſoule thenne renounce to be in conſolacion here in this valleye of teres myſeres and ſorowes for tourmentes and paynes ſhall come vnto thoſe that receyue here theyr Ioyes and ſolaces. Now thenne dyſprayſe

and deſpyſe ſhoos tranſytory vanytees. and flee the worldely delectacyons and Ioyes / and beware that thou gloryfye not thy ſelfe but in the croſſe of our lorde Iheſu Cryſte. Petre de bloys wroot vnto a kynge of Englonde vppon the boke of Iob / weneſt thou that one may haue Ioye in this preſente lyfe / and alſo in that / that is to come.

Thou arte deceyued to preſume to haue perfayte Ioye bothe here and there to vſe this worlde and take the delytes therof / and neuertheleſſe to obteyne the richeſſe of the glorye celeſtyall / and to Ioye with Iheſu Cryſte. Herkene more what is ſayd in the Goſpel by the riche man whiche was tourmented in the fyre of helle that deſyred a drope of water for the refreſſhyng of his tonge. It was anſwered hym. Thou haſte receyued ye welthe of the worlde / and Lazar the payne therfore he hath now delectacyon and Ioye / and thou arte in the payne & torment. The ſayd Peter de bloys ſayd / we myght well repute and calle foles the holy kynges and prophetes / thapoſtles. the martyrs / the confeſſours and the delycate and tender virgynes whiche all haue myſprayſed & fled from the worldly richeſſes / and haue offred and taken them to the trybulacōns and ſhamous dethes for the loue of Iheſu cryſte.

How our entre in to heuen muſte be by many trybulacyons. O how well was it vnderſtonde by Saynt Auſtyn That one maye not entre the blyſſe of heuen but by trybulacyon and payne in this worlde. For he ſayd. A my ſoule yf we ſholde alwayes ſupporte and ſuſteyne tourmentes and paynes here. and alſo ſuffre by a longe ſpace the gehenne of helle / to thende that we myght there by ſurely ſee our lorde Iheſu Cryſte in his glorye and be accompanyed with his ſayntes. Now were it not an excellente dygne thynge to haue ſoo grete a wele / as to be partyners to ſoo parfayte a glorye. Petrede bloys ſayde. My membres faylle me by age / and be enfebled by faſtynges / and broken with labours / and I melte wt teeres of myn eyen. But yf all my brayn and the mary of my boones were conuerted in to teeres / yet were it not ſuffyſant paſſyon in this preſent tyme in comparyſon to atteyne therby the glorye to come / whiche ſhall be ſhewed vnto vs. If a man knewe what thynge he is / and what it is of hym and of god / he wolde thynke that ſuffryng of thouſand dethes for his ſake were but as noo thynge.

It is writen in the boke of Sapyence the .iii. chapitre. yt that be wery of a lytyll / yet dyſpoſe you well and your Remuneracion & rewarde ſhall be right grete. Saynte Effram ſayd. My right dere and beloued brethern / the labour of our inſtytucyon is but lytyll / and the reſt is grete / our afflyccyon dureth not longe. but oure Retrybucyon / that is to wyte / the delytes of paradyſe. The Ioye and gladneſſe there ſhall endure

worlde withouten ende. The wyſe man ſayde in Eccleſyaſtes the laſte Chapitre. Beholde howe lytyll I haue laboured / and I haue founde for me grete Reſte. By the Reaſons aboue wryten it appereth manyfeſtely / that though our labours here be but lytyll and good / our Rewardes in heuen maye be grete and many / for the Ioyes there are Impoſſyble to be comprehended or declared by vs / for there was neuer erthely herte that coude ymagine the pleaſers therof / nor to ony comparyſon eye coude ſee / nor ere here the delectacyons melodyes and ſwetneſſes that be there / and the goodneſſes Iwys can not here dyrectely be ſauoured nor felte / but it may well be ſurely thought / that all that euer is felte delectable or good in this preſent worlde is but as the reſplendyſſhynge and a ſhadowe of the goodneſſe of heuen / whiche we ought to take as an allec tyfe deſyryng to come to the orygynall & rote ther of / and to haue parte of that mooſt precyous blyſſe / whiche is our enherytance. Now in concludynge fynally it may appere by grete euydence and Inuynſyble reaſons. that the four laſt thynges aboue alledged / whiche is to wyte / the bodely dethe / ye day of Iugement / the gehenne of helle / & the glorye of peradyſe defenden and withdrawen from ſynne in many maners / ſuche as haue the ſame four laſt thynges withouten oblyuyon in a contynuale

Remembraunce. Where by they acceyne and edytye theyr ſoules to remayne eternally in the mooſt gloryous blys of heuen. And whenne ony falle to ſynne / it is by cauſe they haue not the ſayde four thynges cordyally emprynted in theyr myndes. And alas nor the ſuffrance of our lorde. There be to fewe that conſyder and poyſe the ſayde four laſte thynges. Many there be that thynke to lyue longe / and to repente them in theyr age / and there by appeyſe the Iuge and flee the danger of helle And in that hope lyue in delectacyons and ydleneſſe. And yet after they thynke ſo poſſede heuen eternally. O what preſumptuous folye is hit to beleue and truſt therto. That argumēt cōcludeth not / but mocketh and deceyueth all ſuche / as haue hope or confydence therin. Therfore doo penaunce to youre ſaluacyon / or ye ſhall peryſhe and dye in youre ſynnes to your dampnacyon. It is wryten in Eccleſyaſtes in the ſeconde chapitre. If we doo noo penaunce / we ſhall falle in the hondes of onre lorde. and not in to the hōdes of man. Alas now who is he that ſuffyſantely bewayleth his ſynnes / that hath good pacyence with his enmye / yt hath compaſſyon vpon the poore people / & relyeueth them in theyr neceſſytees / that duely mynyſtred Iuſtyce / and that for noo vayne glorye ne lucie of the worlde wyll offende his cōſcience Our

generacyon is ſoo wretchyd and ſoo frayle that our hertes can not addreſſe to the wele / but rather to the harme / we fauoure and delyte worldely thynges / and ſeke not after Iheſu Cryſte / we loue vyces / we flee vertues / and lye and reſte in our owen ſynnes as beeſtes doo in theyr owen dounge / and therin rote myſerably. Our lorde lokoth vppon the ſone of man / and beholdeth yf there be ony axinge grace or in good dyſpoſycyon / but well away he ſeeth to fewe Inclyned therto / and many dyſpoſed to the contrarye in all ſynne and wretchedneſſe / where by is to be drad / that the myſerable tyme of this worlde is nyghe comen / whiche Mycheas prophecyed of in his .vii. Chapitre ſayeng. Holyneſſe is peryſſhed in the erthe / and amonge the men is there none that is ryght wyſe. O Remembre well how euery man almooſt now a dayes ſeketh for his owen particuler cauſe and lucre / the ſhedyng of blode and the wrongynge of other / what ſhall I more ſaye / fewe there be that wyll entende to ony good perfeccyon / nor open theyr eyen for theyr ſaluacōn / ſo be they blynded in theyr malycyous folye. O curſed malyce & vnhappy folye. wherby the lyfe is voluntarely loſte. and the dethe wonne. the wele deſpyſed. and the harme accepted / our lorde dyſpleaſed / and the fende obeyed. Now thenne my right dere brethern and frendes ſtryke

not of your hedes with your owne ſwerdes / as to ſaye / lete not your owen dedes be your deſtruccion perpetuall. Ryſe out of ſynne. loke vp and remembre you what oyfference is betwix eternale dampnacyon and perpetuale Ioye and blyſſe. Forſake & renounce your ſynnes / and defende you from the fendes power / whiche ye may ſurely do with contrycyon / and in axinge helpe and grace of our lorde. Iwys it is meruayll that man / whiche aboue all erthly thynge is a creature reſonable enſueth not the verayorygynall of reaſon / but dyſprayſeth & forſaketh that / that is mooſt proufytable & eternally good for that / that is mortale and mooſt harmefull. O good lorde what vnhap cauſeth it / and werfore ſholde we by oure folye loſe tho ſoules that thou haſt bought ſo dere with thy mooſt precyous bloode. Certaynely the cauſe is lacke of prudence / good counſeyll / grace / and cordyall Remembraunce of the ſayde four laſte thynges. O our Redemptour almyghty and mercyfull Iheſu / graunte vs ſoo thy grace / that we may yet ſurely purueye for our laſt thynges / and ſoo cordyally frequente the Remembraunce of thy godhede that it cauſe vs here after to repelle and reuoque oure ſynnes. Reſyſte our gooſtely enemye / and conforme vs in alle good werkes vnto thy bleſſyd wyll / to the obteynynge fynally with the happy ſayntes of thyne eternall glorye.

To whiche bryng vs the fader / and the ſone / and the holy gooſt reygnyng in vnyte ſempyternally worlde withouten ende.
            
            AMEN

In the yere of oure lorde a. M. .CCCC. and .lxxviii. for to be enprynted / and ſoo multyplyed to goo abrood amonge the people / that therby more ſurely myght be Remembred the four laſte thynges vndoubtably comynge. And it is to be uoted that ſythen the tyme of the grete tribulacōn and aduerſyte of my ſayde lorde / he hath ben full vertuouſly occupyed / as in gōynge of pylgremages to Saynt Iames in in Galyce / to Rome / to Saynte Barthylme we / to Saynte Andrewe / to Saynt Mathewe / in the Royalme of Naples. and to Saynte Nycholas de Bar in Puyle. and other

dyuerſe holy places. Alſo he hath procured and goten of our holy fader the Pope a grete and a large Indulgence and grace vnto the chapell of oure lady of the Pyewe by Saynte Stephens atte Weſtmeſtre for the relyef and helpe of cryſten ſoules paſſed out of this trā

And not withſton dyng the grete labours and chargis that he hath hadde in the ſeruyce of the kynge and of my ſayde lorde prynce / as well in wales as in England whiche hath be to hym noo lytyll thought and beſynes bothe in ſpyryte and in body / as the fruyt therof experymently ſheweth. yet ouer that tenriche his vertuous dyſpoſycyon / he hath pnt hym in deuoyr atte all tymes when̄e he myght haue a leyſer / whiche was but ſtarmele to tranſlate dyuerſe bookes out of frenſhe in to englyſhe. Amonge other paſſyd thorugh myn honde the booke of the wyſe ſayenges or dyſtes of phyloſophers / and the wyſe and holſom prouerbys of xpryſtene the pyſe ſette in metre.

Whiche Tranſlatynge in my Iugemente is a noble and a merytoryous dede / wherfore he is worthy to be gretely commended / and alſo ſyngulerly Remembred with our good prayers. For certaynely as well the reders as the herers well conceyuyng in theyr hertes the forſayde foure laſte thynges maye there by gretly be prouoqued and called from ſynne to the grete and plenteuous mercy of our blyſſed ſauyour / whiche mercy is aboue alle his werkes.
