of martial actes, and the prudent persuasions and counsels, both of the
Grecians, and of the Troians therin
contayned: I was so in loue therwith,

that histories do indifferentlye
auayle al men, yet most specially noble
and learned men, because that the
knowledge of them is most profitable
and necessary to all those, whiche
haue the gouernaunce of commonne
weales, By these the mindes of such

noble and learned men may be sturred
to the study of true nobilitie, and
vertue. By these the begynnynge of
empyres is knowen, and why there
hath chaunsed in them so greate and
so straunge alterations and greuous
commotions. In these are conteyned
the preceptes of offices and vertues,
whereby the common weale maye
most prosperously be preserued, continued,
and auaunced. Histories do
teache men what best besemeth them
to do, what may auaunce them, what
maye hurte and hynder them, what
maketh thē welthy and ryche, what
maketh them poore and nedye, what
maketh them to floryshe, what maketh

            The hystorye of Dares
Phrigius, of the ruyne and destruction
of Troye.
            PElias reignynge in Peloponesa, had
a brother named
Asō. Of
this man is issued
Iason, &
very excellent
man in vertu:
the whiche for because he hadde ben
good to his subiectes, intreatynge
them humaynlye and gentlye, was
muche set by, and beloued of all men.
Kynge Pelias perceauyng that Iason
was in suche reputation and auctoritie
with all the people, feared
greatly least he shoulde do hym some

wronge, depryuing hym of his kingdome.
But to auoyde the effecte of
suche a doubtefull and peryllous suspition,
Pelias fained that there was
in the Ile of Colchos a golden flese
of a shepe, a ryche thyng, and worthy
of Iasons puissance and strengthe,
perswadynge hym through promis
of great recompence, to conquere and
to brynge it awaye perforce. Wherevnto
Iason, as one of hygh
                  •
                courage
and muche desyrous to se manye and
dyuers countreys, thynking by such
meanes greately to auaunce, and to
augmente his honoure, consented
vnto the enterpryse, so that Pelias
woulde so furnyshe hym with men
and other necessary thinges, that he
shoulde want or lacke nothynge.
            Then Pelias by and by commaunded
his chiefest carpenter named Argus,
to make and prepare suche fayre

and goodly shyppes, that they myght
please and content Iason. As sone as
ye br
                  •
               te was spred thorow al Grece,
as well of the foresayde shyppes, as
of the totall and whole enterpryse of
Iason into Colchos, his frendes &
familiares presented and offred theyr
seruyce and company vnto hym. After
that Iason had geuen them thankes,
he prayde them to be ready, and
wayte for the oportune, and conueniente
time of his departure. They
came at the selfe same tyme wel minded
and appoynted vnto the place signified
and assigned vnto them by
Iasons letters, that is to wyt, wher
the shippe was, called Argo. Pelias
with all diligence caused the nauye
to be furnyshed with all thinges necessary,
and exhorted Iason and his
companye, coragiously to accomplish
the thynge whiche was begonne, &

so doynge that not they onelye, but also
all Grece shoulde obtayne greate
honour and glory. But to declare by
name all those that accompanyed Iason,
I thinke it not mete nor to anye
purpose, let them therefore which be
curyouse to knowe these thynges,
reade suche authors, as haue specially
wrytten of the Argonantes. Iasō
then ariuinge & comynge into Phrigia,
came and broughte his shyppes
vnto the hauen of the riuer Simois,
and there all his souldiers landed.
            But when kynge Laomedon was
aduertised therof, he was greatelye
moued, as well for the greate number
of shyppes, whiche were aryued and
rested there, as for the multitude of
the yonge mē of Grece, which were
commynge thether: consydering also
to be very daungerous vnto his people
in tyme to come, yf the Grekes

accustomed them selues so to aryue &
to campe in his dominions and countreys.
Therfore Laomedon admonished
them by Ambassadoures to retyre
and departe out of his countrey,
or els that he was mynded rughelye
& rudely to repulse them. The which
thinge was very straunge to Iason
and his companye, and not easelye to
be suffred, so vngentlye to be entreated
of hym, whome they neuer offended.
Neuerthelesse, they fearing that
through the ire and anger of ye kyng,
they might be destroyed and spoyled
by the multitude of the barbarous
people, if contrarye to the will and
commaundement of Laomedon, they
shulde make resistaunce, seinge they
had no preparation to warre, departed
vnto theyr shyppes, and finallye
came to Colchos, where they incontinent
obtayned the golden flese, and

returned vnto theyr owne countrey.
A while after Hercules hauynge in
remembraunce the euill receite and
intreatinge of Laomedon towardes
Iason, went vnto Sparta, to desyre
Castor and Postur, in Salamina,
Che
                  •
               amō, in Thessalia Peleus, in
Pile Nestor, to fauour and ayd him
to reuenge the iniurie, that the Grekes
had receaued of ye king of Troy:
the whiche thinge was willinglye
promysed him, and he declaringe his
minde vnto Nestor, sayd he was sorye
to be constrayned to make warre
against the Troians, whom Nestor
dyd well alowe. Hercules perceyuinge
the good wyll of them all, caused.
xv. shippes to be made, and suche
men as were mete for the warre to
be gathered. Whan the time of his departure
was come, and that he had
assembled by his letters, & otherwise

those whiche he had desired and prayed,
and had prepared all thinges in a
good order: they fayled vntill they
came by nighte into Phrigia, vnto ye
porte and hauen of Sige, wher that
Hercules Thelamon, and Peleus
did most dyligently cause their hoost
to be set a land, making Castor, Pollux,
and Nestor the cheife rulers to
defende the shippes
                  •
                Laomedon perceauinge
the Grekes armye to be pitched,
& in campe at the port of Sige,
by and by went thether with a great
companie, and began to fight valiaūtly.
In the meane season Hercules cō
               passed
about, and besieged the towne
Ilium, so that he mo
                  •
               ested the citisins
very sore, hauinge no word therof,
and vndefended. Then Laomedō
goyng thether to succour and to ayd
them, was slayne of Hercules, with
all his children, Priamus excepted

whiche at that time (by his fathers
commaundement) had the leadynge
of an Army in Phrigia. The Troians
army beynge thus destroyde, the
towne battarde, taken, spoyled, and
ouerthrowen, the Grekes (after thei
had fylled theyr shyppes and vessels
with the pillage and spoyle) purposed
to retourne home agayn. Among
other thinges Thelamon for his boty
toke with hym Hesiona kyng Laomidons
daughter, whom Hercules
for the vertue and excellencye that
was in him, and because he was the
fyrste that boldely approched vnto ye
breche, and entred the towne, gaue
for a rewarde. Priamus therfore perceauinge
that his father was deade,
his 
                  •
               itisens of Ilium subdued, & his
sister Hesiona to be genen for a pray,
was very sory thus to se the state of
the common welth of Troye, entre
                  •
               
               ted

of ye Grekes. Wherefore he returned,
accompanied with his wife Hecuba,
and his children, that is, Hector
Alexander, Deiphobus, Helenus,
Troilus, Andromacha, Cassandra,
and Po
                  •
               exena, to go into Ilium. He
had also other chyldren oute of wedlocke,
but yet men estemed them not,
nor called none the kynges chyldren,
but suche as were lawfully begottē.
Assone as Priamus was come agayne
to Troye, he edified his town
agayne, he fortified it with much greter
and stronger walles, repaired it
with all kyndes of munitions and
fortresses, and with a great number
of men of armes, fearynge leaste he
shoulde be destroyed, and sodenlye
brought to ruyne as his father Laomedon
was. Besydes all this, he
buylded a palace royall, where he cō
               secrated
a temple and an ymage vnto

Iupiter. The names of the gates of
the foresayde towne are these, Antenorida,
Dardamda, Ilia, Scea, Catumbria,
Troiana. But after that he
sawe his towne, and other thynges
aparteyninge thervnto sufficientlye
prepared, he loked for a conueniente
tyme, to reuenge the wronge that
was done vnto hym in his goodes,
and in the person of his father. And
therefore he purposed to sende one of
his an Ambassador into Grece, named
Antenor, with a certayne complaynt
to demaunde amense, aswell
for the death of his father, and taking
awaye of his goodes, as for the rauyshement
of his syster Hesiona: promisinge
neuerthelesse willinglye to
indure and suffer, and to take all thinges
in good parte, so that his syster
were restored hym agayne. Antenor
obeyinge the kynges commaundement,

take shyppyng, and wandered
so longe vppon the sea, that he came
vnto a place in Grece named Manesia:
where Pelius receaued him, and
feasted for the space of thre dayes. At
the fourth daye he requyred hym to
declare the cause of his legation: the
whiche aunswered that it was onelye
to admonishe the Grekes, to restore
Hesiona. Peleus vnderstandynge
that, and that the matter some
what touched hym, toke it vnpaciently,
and therfore he commaunded him
incontinent to retyre from thense vnto
some other place. Ante nor not beynge
therwith content, sayled vnto
Salamina, to perswade and induce
Thelamon to restore Hesiona kynge
Priamus sister, declarynge not to be
ryghte nor reasonable, to kepe the
doughter of a kynge in suche bondage.
Whervnto Thelamon annswered,

that he hadde not offended Priamus,
and that he was not mynded to
restore the thynge, whiche was geuen
him for his vertu and valiauntnes,
and therefore that he shulde do
his diligence to departe. Then Antenor
toke shyppynge as before, & wēt
to Achaia, and there solicited Castor
and Pollux to content Priamus, aswell
for the rauysshinge of Hesiona,
as for other thinges, the whiche denied
with great boldnesse, that in
no wise they had offended Priamus,
but contrarywyse that they and the
other Grecians were fyrst prouoked
and offended by Laomedon, therfore
they commaunded him to departe.
            Furthermore Antenor the Ambassador
wente to Pile vnto Nestor for
the self same thing, the which threatenynge
dyd saye, that he marueyled
that Antenor a Troian was so bold

and hardy to come into Grece, considerynge
that the anset of malice was
fyrst geuen by the Troians. Whan
Antenor perceaued his labor loste, &
also had heard the proude and bolde
aunswers of al the princes of Grece,
he returned home, makynge a rekenynge
vnto Priamns of his iourny,
and dyd him to vnderstande and perceaue
the threatnynge aunswers of
the Grecianes, and therwithall prouoked
him to make warre agaynste
them. Priamus at the same selfe instant,
called all his chyldren, his frendes,
princes, and lordes, as Anchises
Eneas, Ucalegon, Talantus, Amphotes,
Panthus, and also his chyldren
begotten of his concubines, and
recited vnto them the whole order of
the legation and message made vnto
the Grekes by Antenor in his name
that is to wyt, of the death of his father,

of the ruyn
                  •
                & destructiō of 
                  〈◊〉
               ,
& of the rape of Hesiona, whose
restoryng he promised to be a full satisfaction
of all wronges, and therewith
the aunswer of them, the euyll
and vnkynd intreatinge shewed vnto
his Ambassador. And therfore seynge
he coulde haue no parte of his
mynde, he purposed to prepare an
hoost, to thintent that the Grecians
so punyshed, shulde not at anye tyme
haue the barbarous Troianes in de
               
                  •
               ision.
Fyrst of al he admonished his
chyldren to take the principal charge
of this thinge, and speciallye Hector
his eldest sonne, the whiche promysed
to fulfyll the wyll and commaundement
of his father, and also that he
woulde not onely reuenge the death
of his graundefather, but also all the
iniuries and offenses committed agaynste
his elders, to the intente the

misdedes of the Grekes shoulde not
remayne vnpunyshed: but yet he doubted
muche of the ende of his enterpryse,
because that ye Grecians shuld
and myghte haue great succoure and
ayde of diuers nations. Also because
that in Europe were verye stronge
men, and apte vnto warre, and in Asia
men were delicatelye nourysshed
in reste and ydlenes, and therfore
destitute of a nauy mete for such
a purpose. This notwithstandynge
Alexader exhorted that a nauy shuld
be prepared for this iorney vnto Grece,
offerynge him selfe to be the cheife
and principal conductor of the army,
yf it so pleased the kynge his father,
such confidence he had in the Gods,
adn trusted to return vnto his house
victorious and triumphing ouer his
enemyes. For he sayde as he went a
huntynge in the forest named Ida

he fell a s
                  •
               epe, vnto whome Mercur
                  •
               
               us
came, sayinge he had chosen hym

                  •
               udge as concernynge the beautie of
thre goddesses there present. Iuno,
Minerua, and Uenus, and that Uenus
had promised hym the fayrest lady
of all Grece, if amonge those thre,
he would iudge and esteme hyr to be
the fayrest: and that for this reason
and cause, Priamus shulde haue the
better hope, inasmuch as Uenus did
fauer Alexander.
            This opinion dyd maruelouselye
well please Deiphobus, whereby he
trusted to haue righte, and satisfaction
of the Greekes, yf the
thynge whyche was enterprised,
were folowed. Helenus cleane contrarye,
as a true Prophete, foretolde the commynge of the Grekes,
the Destruction that they

shoulde do in the countreye & towne
of Troye, the ruyne of his father and
brethren, yf his brother Alexander
broughte awaye perforce a woman
out of the countrey of Grece. Troilus
the yōgest sonne, but yet no lesse
coragio
                  •
               s and valiaunt then Hector,
counseled, and perswaded a nauye to
be prouided, and with al diligence to
set forwarde vnto Grece: and that
men shulde not feare, nor haue no regarde
vnto his brothers wordes.
            Whose counsell was greatly alowed
and approued of all men. This done,
Priamus sent Deiphobus and Alexander
into Licaonia, to chose oute, &
to gather together men, mete for the
warre, and to assemble the people to
the counsell. After that Priamus
had purposed to shewe these thinges
vnto his chyldren, he, to the entente
that the inferiors shulde be obedient

vnto theyr elders and superiours, declared
vnto them the iniuries and
wronges that they had suffred of the
Grekes. And that he had sente Antenor
into Grece, to the intente he
myghte be reasonably aunswered for
hys syster, and other thynges, and
that Antenor was ignominiouslye
receaued and entreated, nor coulde
not accomplyshe, nor obtayne anye
thynge of his businesse, as concernynge
his legation: and therefore it
was very expediente that Paris (as
it was purposed) shulde reuenge the
death of his graundfather, and other
greuous and great iniuries committed
vnto the Troianes. He also commaunded
Antenor to shewe his
minde, whiche encouraged the Troianes
to make warre vpon the Grekes,
shewynge them in few wordes
what he had done, in Grece. Priamus

or euer he went anye further in
this matter, dyd openlye yet once agayn
aske them, whether there were
any of his, that agreed not vnto this
warre, to thende he shoulde tell hym
in open fielde. Wherevnto Panthus
in the presence of Priamus & other,
aunswered and spake the thynge, the
whiche as he sayde, he had learne
                  •
               
of his father Enphorbius, that yf Alexander
brought a woman oute of
Grece, it shoulde be the ruyne and extreme
misfortune of the Troianes:
and that it were muche more honest
and better to lyue in tranquillitye,
then thoroughe warres, and other
troubles to lese theyr auncient libertie,
and so lyghtelye to put them selues
in hasarde and icopardye.
            The people dispraysed the counsell
and auctoritie of Panthus, and
submitted theym selues vnto the

kynges wyll, as readye and disposed
to do that shoulde please hym to commaūd.
And after that Priamus had
promysed to prepare shyppes, and other
thynges to go into Grece, and
that in suche sorte, that nothynge
shoulde be lackynge, they all with
one boyce promised him their whole
obedience. Priamus then thanked
them, and so the counsell cesed and
brake vp. Therfore wt al spede, Priamus
did send labourers into ye forest
Ida, to hewe tymber to make shyppes.
And in the meane season, he sent
Hector into the hye partes of Phrigia
to assēble an Army. Canssandra
now vnderstanding and perceauing
this enterprise, foretolde the thynge
that shoulde chaunce vnto the Troianes,
yf her father would perseuere
and go on to moleste the Grecians
with warre.
            
               But the tyme beyng now come, and
the shyppes furnished, and the souldiers
of Licaonia brought thether by
Alexander and Deiphobus, there lacked
nothinge but theyr departure.
            Priamus hauynge thus all thynges
in a readines made Alexander the
generall captayne of his armye, and
with hym as guydes, Deiphobus,
Eneas, and Polidamus: commaundynge
Alexander fyrste to go vnto
Sparta to Castor and Pollux to cō
               mun
with them for the restoryng of
Hesiona, and that perfourmed, the
people of Troye woulde be ryghte
well satisfied and contente: and y
                  •
               
they denied him any thinge, that he
shulde be aduersited therof, to the intent
he myght sende hym freshe ayde
and succour. Then Alexander with
his, and Antenors the Ambassadors
companye, sayled into Grece. But

yet or euer they came to the yle Eitherea,
they recountred and mette
Menelaus in the mid waye, going
vnto the pyle, merueylynge and
doubtynge to what parte or coste
this great armie went.
            And so they met bothe together,
and although they saw
                  •
                and beheld
one another, yet they were ignoraunte
nor kn
                  •
               we not whither the
one and the other went. Euen vpō
the selfe same daye Castor and Pollux
were gone with their gales toward
Clitemnestra, & had brought
thet
                  •
               er Hermiona Helena her doughter.
The daye when Alexander
came to Citherea, was dedicated
and holye in the honour of Iuno,
in the whiche place he vnderstode,
that there was a temple of Diana
and Uenus, The Citherians demaundynge

throughe great admiration
what he was, and frome
whence this great and triumphant
companye was come, had thys answere:
that it was Alexander kyng
Priamus ambassadour to Castor
and Pollux. Helene Menelaus
wyfe knowynge that Alexander
was in Citharea so nobly and royally
appoynted, desyred greatlye to
see hym, and wente to a towne nye
vnto the sea (called by her name Helena)
where she purposed within
the temple to doe sacrifice vnto Appollo
and Diana. Alexander being
verye ioyfull of the approchement
and commyng of Helena, mindyng
and remembrynge her greate bwetye,
beganne throughe a greate desyre
and affection to see her and to
goe and mete her.
            
               Helena perceyuynge that Alexander
was come to her towne, no
lesse desirous on her parte to see Alexander,
mete hym by the waye,
where the one seynge and beholdynge
the other, were euen forthwith
taken with suche loue, that
they appoynted the tyme and conuenient
houre to speake and commen
together.
            Therfore Alexander commaunded
all hys men to be in a readines
in their shyppes, purposynge in the
night folowing to take Helena and
a certayne numbre of her damse
                  •
               s
as she was doynge sacrifice in the
temple. The whiche thynge was
fulfilled & done. The citesyns perceyuynge
that, sought verye longe
agaynst hym, but yet they fayled so
muche to recouer their Helen, that

they themselues through the multitude
and great company of Alexander,
were ouercome, the temple
and the towne spoyled, manye prysoners
caryed away: thys done, incontinent
they loused & hoysed vp
their sayles purposynge to returne
from thence, he came to an hauen
named Tenedon, where after he
had conforted Helen beynge verye
heauye, he certified hys father Priamus
by letters of all thynges that
was done. Menelaus beynge in
Pylas was certtfied of this deede
whiche wente with all spede vnto
Sparta with Nestor frō whēce he
sent Argos desyrynge his brother
Agamēnon to come thither to him
            In the meane tyme Alexander
came home to his owne house with
his praye, recited the order and disscourse

of all his doynges, wherof
Priamus was verye ioyfull trustynge
that at the lest his sister Hesiona
throughe the recouerynge of
Helen shoulde be restored with other
recompence and satisfaction of
all that here to fore the Grekes had
destroyed, pylde, and caryed oute
of the countreie, & from the people
of Troye. And after he had with
fayre wordes cōforted the desolate
Helen, he maryed her to his sonne
Alexander. Assoone as Canssandra
behelde her she beganne to prophesye
euen as before. And therfore by
the commaundement of Priamus
she was taken and closed vp.
            After that Agamemnon was
come into Sparta, and hadde comforted
hys brother, they purposed
to sende into al Grece to complaine

them of thys open iniurie, and that
to reuenge the same, it was necessarye
to proclayme war against the
Troyans. Where Achiles, Patroclus,
& Diomedes went purposely
into Sparta to Agamemnō ready
wt armes to reueng ye iniurius ded
of the Troyans, appointing Agamēnon
to be chiefe of al the armie.
After this they signified throughe
out all Grece their interprince, to
the intent that euerye man shoulde
be readie in armes at the assemble
in the porte of Athens, to defende
their ryght and honoure, and to reuenge
the rauishement of Helen.
            Amonge whome Castor and Pollux
folowed the companye with
shyppes vnto the porte Lesbe, because
of the wronge committed in
the persone of their sister Helen,

but yet throughe a certay
                  •
               e rage
that chaunsed there euen sondenly,
they left of to sayle and to folowe,
and vanished awaye as it had bene
the ayre, in so muche that in no part
they were euer seene after.
            Therfore men estemed them to
be transported into heauen, and set
in the range and number of the
Goddes immortall. And notwithstandynge
that the inhabiters of
Lesbia soughte and persued theym
by the sea with shyppes and galles
euen vnto Troye: Yet there is
no mencion that euer they were

the captaynes of Grece do mounte
vnto thre score and nyne, the which
broughte to the warre aboute a leuen
hundred and fourty shippes.
            After that they were all come to
Athenes, Agamemnon called his
captaynes to counsel, praysed them
and exhorted theym to mayntayne
theyr ryght and quarel, promysyng
to content theim at their pleasure.
            Furthermore, they thought it very
good, or euer they departed to take
counsel of Appollo, where vnto euery
man accorded. And to do thys
thing, Achilles was sent with Patroclus
vnto Delphos. In ye mene
while Priamus being well aduertised
of ye wyll & preparation of his
enemies gathered mē thorowout al
his coūtreies exhorting euery man
couragiously to defend his contrei.

When Achilles and Delphos had
vnderstanded by the oracle, that the
Greekes shoulde beare awaye the
victorye, and Troy at the tenth yeres
ende shoulde be taken and destroyed
by theym, he dyd sacrifice
vnto God Appollo, as it was commaunded.
At the selfe same tyme
likwise Calchas was sent to Delphos
to gratifie Apollo with gyftes
and ryche Iewels, for the Troianes,
& to counsel with him of the
state of hys realme & other goodes,
vnto who it was answered by the
oracle, and counseled, that he should
confederate him self with thee Grekes
agaynst the Troyanes, & that
he shoulde beare theym asmuche fauour
as he might possible in disclosynge
the thynge that he might per

               de of the affayres

of Troye, to thys entent, that
the Grekes should not leaue of nor
departe vntyll Troye were taken
and destroyed. Achilles & Calchas
met together within the temple, &
after they had confederate their answeres
of the oracle together, the
which were lyke and agreable, thei
reioysed & confirmed their aliance
and amitie. So they came together
to Athenes, where Calchas was
gentelye receyued of all the Grecianes.
Their shyppes beynge nowe
prepared to sayle, they were sodenly
taken, and troubled with an horrible
& a merueilous tempest: therfore
Calchas as a prophete counseled
them to tourne their sayles to
some other parte, and go towardes
the porte named Aulis, vnto the
whiche they came at the last. Af

                  •
               
               
that Agamemnon had with sacrifice
apaysed and satisfied Diana, he
cansed to hoyse vp their sayles, and
to go on vnto Troy, and to do this
more easly
                  •
                Philocte was vnto thē
as a guyde, the whiche before tyme
had bene wt the Argonantes in the
lād of Troy. By the wai thei came
vnto a towne appertaynynge to
Priamus, whiche after they had
taken and sacked, they wente to
Tenedon, killynge man, woman
and child, the whiche they tooke in
like maner. But Agamemnon deuided
the spoiye amonge his souldiers.
This done, he called a
counsel wherin it was concluded,
that Diomedes and Ulixes shulde
goe vnto Priamus, requirynge
hym to restore Helen with other
thynges rauished and taken awaye

by Alexander. Durynge
the tyme that these men communed
with Priamus, Achilles & Thelephus
were sent to take Misia for
a praye, where kyng Teuthras raigned.
Where when they came,
they spoyled al the countrye.
            And Achilles so wounded the
kynge commynge in armes in the
defence of hys countreye, that he
fell to the grounde, whome
Telephus couered wyth hys
shylde, that Achylles slewe hym
not oute of hande, and that
because in tymes paste Teuthras
hadde lyberallye receyued
Telephus Hercules sonne
into hys house, beynge yet
but verye younge.
            
               Some other do saye, that euen then
Hercules hadde slayne Diomedes
with hys pusiant and wylde horses,
and delyuered all hys kyngedome
into the handes of Teuthras
and that Telephus therfore had succurred
hym. But Teuthras perceyuynge
that throughe that stroke he
coulde not escape deathe, he beynge
yet alyue delyuered hys kyngdome
of Misia vnto Telephus, and instituted
hym kyng as his heire and
successur, whome after that he was
deed Telephus dyd burye most honourably.
Finallye, Achilles shewed
Telephus that the beste conseruation
of his kyngedome and to
the intent that in his necessitie, he
mighte be succuered and holpen of
the Grekes: was to furnishe and
yerelye to prepare a certayne quantitie

of corne oute of hys realme,
for the Grekes campe, whereby he
him selfe with his hooste shoulde
not go agaynst ye Troianes: but remayne
at home for the more surer
conseruatiō of his newe kingdome.
This ended, Achilles returned
with a great praye and botye from
Misia to Tenedon: recitinge at
length to Agamemnon and his companions,
what he had done, of whome
he was greatlye praysed, for hys
industry & viligence. In the meane
whyle the Ambassadours of Grece
recited and declared vnto Priamus
the causes of their legation, and the
wyll of Agamemnon, that is: to
know yf the Troianes woulde restore
Helen with the other botye,
and that the Grekes beynge satisfied
and contented for those thinges,

would pesably returne agayne. For
an aunswere Priamus recited the
iniurye of the Argona
                  •
               tes, the destruction
and sacking of Ilium, the
death of his father, the violent rape
and iniust seruitute, in the whyche
his sister Hesiona was deteyned by
the Grekes, the euyll and vngentle
intreatyng of Antenor his Ambassadour
in Grece: therfore he denyed
the peace, denunced warre, and commaunded
them to returne, and depart
out of his countreye. The Ambassadours
beyng returned, and the
aunswere of Priamus declared to
the Grekes, the matter was reuoked
into the counsell. Nowe we thinke
it good to recite the names
and prouinces of the Lordes and
princes, whiche came with them
hoostes, to succoure Priamus agaynste

the Grekes. First from C

and hostes, Priamus appoynted
Hector for chiefe and principall
Captayne, nexte after Deiphobus,
consequently Alexander, Troilus,
Eneas, & Memnon. And as Agamemnon
on the other part toke deliberation,
and made prouision for
the enterprise
                  •
                came Palamedes the
sonne of Nauplius from Corma
with thirtye shippes, and excused
him selfe, that he came not to the assemble
at Athens, withholden and
let by sycknes, but that he came incontinent,
and assone as it was possible
for him to come, and as the oportunitie
of time would serue. The
whiche excuse was taken of all other
in good parte, gaue him thankes,
and prayde him to assiste them,
as one of the counsell. And forasmuche
as the Grecians doubted of

theyr settynge forwarde to Troye,
they would know Palamedes coū
               sell,
whether they shoulde geue the
assaulte to Troy by day or by night.
He aunswered, that he founde
none occasion, why they shoulde
geue the assaulte by night, but in
the middes of the dai, as he thought
it most expedient, wherevnto they
all consented and agreed, and choyse
Agamemnon captaine of al ye army.
The whiche sent forthwith Hesiodus
Demorātes & Anius into Misia
& other places for sufficiēt furniture
of vitelles & other munitions:
whiche donne he called for his men
of warre, and praysed, admonished,
and exhorted them to be dilgente,
faythfull, and to their superiours
obedient. And after the signe was
geued, they sayled, and finally came

with all their shippes vnto Troye.
The Troyanes beynge aduertised
thereof, defended theyr borders and
limites māfully. Protesilaus made
excurtions and rodes by lande, beate
downe and chased al before him, vntyll
that Hector mete him, whome
he slewe, chased the other, and put
them out of order. But where Hector
was not, there, the Troyanes
were chased & ouerthrowen. And
after great occision and murther on
all partes, at lengthe commeth to
the felde Achilles, constraynynge
the Troyanes to fle, and chased thē
into Troye. And so long continued
the skyrmysh, that the nyght seperated
the battel. Agamemnon set
the rest of hys hooste vpon the land
and campt all his men together.
            Hector the nexte daye folowynge

broughte his men out of the citye,
and afterwardes cāpt, and set them
al in good order. Agamemnon on
the other side, wente with a greate
brute to mete him, wherof ensued
a verye sharpe and furius battell,
wherin was none so valiant nor so
strong, that fel not to the grounde.
Hector euen at the first slewe Patroclus,
spoylde and cast him out of
the army. Furthermore he pursued
Merion, the which he slew in like
maner. And as he was occupied &
busy about ye spoyle, Mnesteus gaue
him a strock wt his swerd in the
thighe. But notwithstandynge he
was so wounded, he ceased not to
laye on and strike vntyl he had smitten
downe a greate numbre of hys
enemies, & manfully pursuyng the
other, he caused thē to forsak ye filde

If Aiax Thelamonius had not sodenlye
come thither, with whome
Hector incountrynge knewe that
he was of his bloude, that is sonne
of Hesiona his father Priamus sister.
Therefore at hys request he
caused the fier to cease and to be remoued
from the Grecians shippes
and all his armie to retire. After
that the one had gratified the other
with gyftes, they departed good
frendes. The nexte daye folowyng
the Grekes obtayned a truce. Agamemnon
to the honor of Protesilaus
made noble funeralles, and caused
al other to be buryed. Achilles
mourned, and celebrated funerall
playes for his frende Patroclus.
            Whilest the truce continued, Palamedes
continually moued sedition,
sayinge that Agamemnon was vnworthie

to be principal of the army
and therfore in the presence of al the
men of warre he shewed him selfe,
and his willyng studye & diligence
to the thinges pertayning to ye war
he returned out of the campe to set
an order in the munitions, & in the
disposition of the watche, to know
and vnderstand the vsual signes of
warre, to see equitie of measures &
waightes, & to be shorte, for the instruction
of al the whole campe.
            After this dede he sayd that it was
not reasonable, that Agamemnon
which was chosen of a smal numbre
of men to this dignitie, shoulde
commaunde, and be superior of all
those, the whiche were to come to
the warre, consideryng that all inferiours
and subiectes do looke and
hope for some vertue in their captaynes

In the meane season that the Grekes
quarelled and discorded thus amonge
them selues for the superioritie,
and that two yeares were expired,
the warre was renued and
set vp agayne. Wherein of the Grecianes
part were chiefe doers Agamemnon,
Achilles and Deomedes
and Menclaus.
            Of the other parte: Hector,
Troylus, and Eneas. And when
they recountred and mette one
with another, ther was great murder,
and the moste valiantes of both
partes were slayne.
            Hector amonge all the other slew
Boetes, Archilocus, and Protenor.
But yet the nyght departed
the battell.
            Then after that Agamemnon

hadde called hys Captaynes to
counsayle, he boldelye admonyshed
theym to prepare theym selues
to fyghte, and pryncypallye
agaynste Hector, the whiche
hadde all readye slayne the mooste
Ualyaunte Captaynes amounge
theym.
            The nexte daye folowynge in
the mornynge, the Armye of
the Troyannes was leadde and
guydyd by Hector, Eneas, and
Alexander.
            Agaynste whome the force and
the wholle Nobilite of the Grecianes
so sette theym selues, that
of bothe sydes in thys furious
imbekerynge a greate numbre of
menne were slayne.
            
               There Meuelaus & Aiax instantly
pursued Alexander which thing
he perceyuyng, with a fliyng darte
smote Menclaus through ye thighe
with whiche strocke notwithstandynge
he was moued with greate
payne, yet ceased not with Aiax the
kynge of Locrus to pursue hym.
But Hector perceyuyng hys brother
in this daunger came accompanied
with Eneas in his defence,
whome Eneas brought out of the
myddes of the armye into the city,
but the nyght ended the battell.
            The next day folowyng, Achilles
and Diomedes guyded the armye:
and of the other side Hector and Eneas,
There was great murder.
            Hector kylled Orchomemes, Oramenes,
Palamon, Epistrophus,
Schedius, Delpenor, Dorius, and

Polixemus al captaynes. Eneas
slew Amphimacus, and Nerius.
Achilles on the contrary part slew
Euphenius, Hipocrates, and Ascerius.
Diomedes, zantippus and
Mestes. Agamemnon consideryng
that his moste strongest and moste
valiaunt men were slayne, retired,
wherof the Troyanes beynge verye
ioyfull, returned to ther campe.
Agamemnon helde a counsel, styrde
vp hys captaynes, and other to sustayne
and manlye to fyght for that
that was to come, and by no meanes
to leaue of: and in asmuche as
a great parte of his armye was already
distroyed, he trusted daye by
daye that a freshe company of souldiers
shoulde come from Misya to
ayde aud succour them. The nexte
day folowing, he constrained at his

and contrary wise the Troians
were brought to the filde vnder the
conduct of Hector: where the smote
so rudely on the one part and on the
other, that there fell manye thousandes,
bothe Greekes and Troyanes.
And thus they continued
manfully fightynge for the space of
foure score dayes. Agamemnon perceiuing
that his men decayed more
and more, & in so great a numbre, &
that he was so greatlye letted that
he could not as yet intend to bury,
his deade corpses: he demaunded of
Priamus by embassadors truce for

time to bury ye dead, aswel of

These thre yeares beynge now expired
and ended, and that the tyme
of warre was come: The Troyanes
came firste into the felde vnder
the conduct of Hector & Troylus.
And the Grekes vnder Agamemnon,
Menelaus, and Diomedes.
They made greate occision.
Hector in the verye poynte of the
armye slewe Phidippus, and zantippus
captaynes. Achilles Liconius,
and Enphorbius Troyanes
And of one part and an other there
died a greate number of souldiers
and foote men: yet that notwithstā
               dynge
they ceased not to fight sharpelye
the space of thirty dayes continuallye.
Priamus perceyuynge
that he had lost the greatest parte of
his host, sent ambassadors vnto Agamemnon
to demaunde truce for

sixe monethes: The whiche thynge
by the deliberation of the counsell,
was graunted hym. The tyme of
truce beynge expired, they fonghte
verye manfullye together by the
space of twelfe dayes, where that
on bothe sydes manye stoute warryers
were smytten downe, manye
wounded, and afterwardes died.
            Agamemnon demaunded a truce of
Priamus for thirtye dayes, to bury
hys men the whiche wer slayne,
whiche thinge Priamus throughe
good counsel dyd graunt him. The
time of the warre beinge come, the
truce ended: Andromacha Hectors
wife had knowledge by her dreame
which she recited vnto Hector, that
as that daye he shoulde not enter
into the battell, the whiche thinge
Hector mispraised and tooke it for a

fable and for a womans dreame.
            Andromacha beynge full of heauinesse,
praied Priamus to let Hector

that reproued greatly Andromacha

Andromacha (the whiche had moued
all the citie wt her complayntes

Priamus recytynge vnto hym the

            Achilles seyng diuers of his moste

valiannt menne caste downe by the
hande of Hector, prepared him selfe
agaynste hym, and inforsed hym to
meete hym face to face, thynkyngeful
wel that if he ouercame him not
that he woulde destroye, and beate
many of hys men: but in the meane
season the battell was verye soore.
Hector in this conflicte and battell
slewe Polibetes a verye excellent
captayne, and as he enforsed hym
selfe to spoyle hym, Achilles came,
so that the fighte was augmented,
and a great brute moued thoroweout
all the campe and citie, whome
Hector finallye wounded in the
thighe. Therefore Achilles moore
cherelye pursued hym, and lefte not
of his enterprise, vntyl he had smitten
hym to deathe, put al the Troyanes
to flyghte & chased them with

the Dente of the swearde vnto
their towne gates, whome Memon
resisted manfullye, foughte
with hym vntyll the nyghte seperated
theym bothe soore wounded.
And amonge all other Achilles beynge
wounded departed frome the
armye. All that nyght the Troyanes
cessed not to lament the deathe
and the absence of valiaunt Hector.
            The nexte daye folowynge the
Troyanes entred agayne into battel,
vnder the conducte of Memon.
Agamemnon counsayled and perswaded
hys men to require a truce
for two mouthes, that men myghte
burye theym whiche were slayne
in battell. Therfore they sent vnto
Priamus, of whome they es
                  •
               lye
obtayned theyr demaunde.
            Then caused Priamus his son

Hector to be buryed before ye gates
Troye, and magnificent pompes
and funerall playes to be celebrated.
Whyle the tyme of the foresayed
truce endured, Palamedes ceassed
not to complayne of the impire
and principallitie of Agamemnon.
            Therefore Agamemnon without
anye contradiction there vnto,
sayde that he woulde remitte the
matter to the descretion and wyll
of the people. The nexte daye
folowing, he assembled all the people,
where he purged hym selfe,
and shewed that he neuer coueted
suche aucthoritye, consideryng that
he was kynge and lorde of Mycenes,
the whiche sufficed hym: but
alonely the vtter destruction of
Troy, & that he woulde be well agreable
to all that the people wolde

define, and vnto hym that should be
set and appoynted vnto hys estate.
            Then in presence of theym all, he
demaunded of euerye man his deuyse.
There Palamedes presented
hym selfe, willynge to cause men to
perceyue and vnderstande his good
spirite, iudgement and counsayl, in
the feates of warre. Of whiche occasion,
the Grekes appoynted him
their graunde captayne, whiche after
he had geuen theym thankes, began
to exercyse ye right of that, that
not longe before he had enterprised.
            Achilles neuer approued but vtterlye
blamed this alteration, yet
that notwithstandynge (the truce
beynge ended) Palamedes appoynted
his hoste in good order, and incouraged
them to fyght manfully.
Deiphobus on the other parte dyd

asmuche for the Troyanes, the
whiche at the sighte triumphed to
fighte, amonge whome Serpedon
with his men dyd so muche purswed
the Greekes, that he kylde
and smote downe a great numbre.
In this fyghte Tlepolemus Rhodius
met with hym, the whiche aswel
in the battel as otherwise was
finallye ouercommed. Secondelye,
in hys stede and place, Perses
the sonne of Adneste fortified and
renued the conflicte, the which likwyse
commynge to the battell was
slayne of Serpedon almoste hande
to hand. But yet Serpedon being
soore wounded was compelled to
withdraw him selfe from the filde.
Thus for a certayne dayes the skir
mished and foughte, and diuers
knyghtes on bothe partes were destroyed

and slayne, but yet of Priamus
his bounde the greater number.
The Troyanes ambassadours
obtayned a truce, and for the tyme
that it endured, they on bothe partes
buryed the deade, prouyded to
heale theyr woūded. And when on
both partes they had taken & geuē
good assuraunce and promis, they
Grekes wēt vnto Troye for theyr
pastime, and ye Troyanes vnto the
Greekes campe. In ye meane season
Palamedes sente Agamemnon
Athamātes & Demophon together
vnto Thesida to prepare muntitiōs,
and principallye to take vp corne

were come to that place, the Ambassadours
recited vnto Telephus

the sedicion of Palamedes, wherwith
he was greatlye miscontent.
Agamemnon perceyuyng this, desired
Telephus not to be displeased,
seynge that the thynge was
done by hys wyll and consent.
            When their shyppes were charged,
they retourned. Palamedes in

               aue)

his yeare mynde, whither there
came Achilles, and beholdyng Polixena
kynge Priamus doughter,
was by and by greatly taken wt her
loue. Then as an impacient louer,
he lyued for a tyme in all solicitude
and anguyshe, partly because Agamemnon
was deposed from the impier,
and that he was subiect to Palamedes.
Then he sente a faythfull
seru
                  •
               unte of hys a Troyane, vnto
Hecuba to demaunde Polixena to
be hys wyfe, and so doynge heard
hys Myrnidons woulde departe,
and by that meanes the reste of the
Greekes. The seruaunte beynge
nowe come to Hecuba, shewed the
content of his legation & message.
Whereunto the foresayed Hecuba
answered, yt she was wel contente,
yf it so pleased Priamus her husbande.

In the meane whyle that
she declared the matter to Priamus,
and that by her commaundement
the seruaunte was departed:
Agamemnon wente with a greate
companye vnto hys campe. Then
Priamus to that that Hecuba had
propounded vnto him, aunswered,
that it was a thinge impossible, not
because he estemed Achilles to be
insufficient, or otherwyse vnworthy
of hys aliaunce, but ye the Grekes
(although he gaue him Polixena,
& that he & his bond departed)
would neuer the soonerdeparte.
            Furthermore, that it were not reasonable
to ioyne and mary his doughter
to dys enemye, And therfore
he estemed good, yf Achilles wolde
ensue and folowe hys interpryse,
that they shoulde first and aboue al

thinges, make a perpetuall peace
betwene theym, and that the Grekes
hooste shoulde returne and departe,
so that their aliaunces and agrementes
mighte be well assured
and confirmed, and that thynge beynge
once ended, he woulde wyllynglye
geue hym his doughter.
            Achilles euen as it was appointed
sent his seruaunt agayne vnto Hecuba,
for to knowe the wyl and deliberation
of Priamus, the whiche
beinge knowen, the seruaunte by
and by brought it vnto his maister.
Therfore Achilles beganne in presence
of theym all, greatly and by al
meanes to complayne hym, declaring
it to be vnlawful, that for one
Helen all Europe and Grece shuld
be destroyed, and that by so longe
warre, so great a number of menne

shoulde be loste, the libertie of the
countrei to be brought vnto bondage
and caste vnder foote: therfore it
wer good and necessary for them to
make peace, and to go their wayes.
Thus thei consumed a whole yere.
After al this Palamedes repayred
and set vp his army. And on the other
part Deiphobus. Achilles being
not therwith content, was not
at the skirmish. Palamedes moued
by a certaine occasion, 
                  〈◊〉
                prepared
him selfe against Deiphobus, that
he slew him: the warre on the one
part & on ye other was sharply stird
vp & foughten, in yt which manye a
man did perish. Palamedes in this
conflicte held the point, and the voward,
that the more frely he might

                  •
               olden & stirre vp his men to fight,
& euen so as thei met, he slew Serpedon

the Troiane. And thinking
to glorifie & to reioyce him selfe in
this dede, Alexander shot him thorow
the bodie with an arrow. The
other Troyanes seing that, ceassed
not to cast dartes, as though Palamedes
had not bene dead, for whose
death the Grekes wer disconfited,
and wente backe vnto their campe,
and the Troyanes persuing them,
brake in, putte their campe oute of

                  •••
               er, & burnt their ships. Achilles
aduertised of this, dissembled ye matter,
but Aiax Thelamonius valiantly
sustained ye thinge vntill the
night departed ye battel. The Greks
al ye night lōg bewailed most heuily
Palamedes, because of his knoledge,
equitie, vertue & clemencie: ye
Troians likwise most rufully the
death of Serpedon & Deiphobus.

The auncient Nestor al that night
called the captaynes to counsell for
to elect and choyse a head captayne
to the armye, and if it semed expedient
vnto theym, to chose withoute
anye further controuersye Agamemnon
agayne. He asked, and
styrde euerye one to saie his aduice
and minde, he shewed theym also,
how that in times paste al thinges
succeded prosperouslye, & that the
whole hooste lyued fortunatly vnder
the conducte of Agamemnon.
            Wherupō Agamemno was chosen
superiour by the whole consente of
theym all. The next daye folowing
the Troyanes went forth boldely
to the batell, and so dyd Agamemnon,
vntil that on bothe partes thei
were chased one from the other.
            But after the daye was well spent
            
               Troylus retourneth with the
firste into the filde, and foughte
strongly, killyng and destroyinge,
insomuche that he chased the Grekes
into their tentes.
            And agayne, the nexte daye folowynge,
the Troyanes set theym
selues firste in the filde. And Agamēnon
agaynst thē: ther was a sore
conflicte seuen dayes continuallye,
in so much that the Troyanes slew
diuers lordes and captaynes of the
Greks. And Agamēnon obtayned
a truce for two monethes, caused
Palamedes and other Lordes of
Grece honourablye to be buryed.
            Durynge the tyme of thys truce,
Agamemnon sente vnto Achilles,
Nestor, Ulixes and Diomedes,
prayinge and desyryng him to take
deliberation, and to go to warre.
            
               Achilles being heuy and sore troubled
purposed not to geue one strok
agaynst ye Troyanes, as he had promised
Hecuba, for the great & singuler
loue yt he bare to Polixena,
nor receyued not the foresaied embassadors
with good coūtenaunce.
But aunswered theym that he (all
warre set a parr) desired peace.
            Agamemnon perceiuing that, calde
his lordes and captaynes, and also
the better part of his men of warre
to counsel, and to take deliberation
what were beste to b
                  •
                done in this
matter, & of this he asked eueri mās

                  •
               duice. Menelaus began first to animate
Agamemnon hys brother to
warre, and that for one Achilles he
shuld not leaue of the interprise, she
wyng them that the strength of the
Troyans was greatly broken and

demished throughe the absence of
Hector, consederynge that thei in al
their bandes hadde none lyke vnto
hym. Contrarye wyse Diomedes
and Ulixes dyd stifelye affirme
that Troylus was euen as wyse,
and as valiaunt as euer was Hector.
Agaynst whome Menelaus
resistynge, ceased not as before to
persuade the warre.
            And to this purpose Calchas
(taughte by the oracle) perswaded
the warre, and in the same he promysed
the Greekes to be victorious.
The tyme of truce being expired,
the Greekes went to the filde,
vnder the conduct of Agamemnon,
Mekelans, Diomedes and Aiax,
where thei fought very strongelye
to the great occision of the one part
and of the other.
            
               Troylus wounded Menelaus verye
greuouslye, and slewe manye,
the other he chased at the poynte of
hys swearde, so that the nighte seperated
theym. The nexte daye all
the Greekes foughte strongelye agaynste
the Troyanes, prepared to
fight by Troylus and Alexander,
Troylus hurte Diomedes, and did
asmuche pursuynge Agamemnon,
and afterwardes manye other.
            Thus thei continued sharply fightyng
for certayne dayes, and a great
numbre of men were smitten down
on euerye parte. Agamemnon considerynge
that daye by daye he loste
a great number of his men, & that he
could no longer bere such losses, demaūded
a truce for vi. monethes, yt
whiche thinge Priamus recited vnto
the counsell, where that amonge

all the assembles, some with all
their power withstode it, because
of the longe truce whiche they demannded:
but rather they required
to sacke the Grecianes, to pille and
to spoyle theym of all their goodes,
and to sette their shyppes a fyre.
            Yet notwithstandynge after that
euerye man had sayde hys mynde,
the truce by the consente of theym
all, was graunted. Durynge the
tyme of the truce, Agamemnon dyd
royallye burye his people, and caused
Diomedes and Menelaus the
whiche were hurte, to be moste diligentlye
intreated, and asmuch did
the Troyanes on their part.
            Thys done, Agamemnon (the
tyme of truce continuynge) wente
hym selfe by the deliberation of the
counsell, to Achilles to perswade

hym to the warre. Achilles troubled
as before, withstode it, & wold
be no traytour, but sayd that it wer
better to demaunde peace: But because
that in this cace with honesty
he coulde denie Agamemnon nothyng,
he promysed hym that in the
tyme of warre he woulde sende his
men to ayde him, praying him yt for
the rest he might be excused. Then
Agamemnon heartly thanked him.
The time of the war comming on,
the Grekes & the Troyans prepared
thēselues one against another.
Achilles first sent his Myrmidons
prepared & apointed in good & sufficient
order, the whiche caused the
war to be a great deale ye stronger &
greater: this not wtstanding Troylus
at the firste shocke wan, chased
the Myrmidons, made rodes and

skyrmyges euen vnto the Grekes
campe, and kild manye here & there
aswel of the Grekes as of the Myrmidons,
other he maymed verye
greatlye, and for all the risistaunce
that Aiax Thelamonius thoughte
to do ye Troyanes returned to their
citie with at honour and victorie.
            The nexte daye Agamemnon with
the Greekes and the Myrmidons
came firste into the filde, agaynste
whom Troylus (after longe & terrible
war vnto the death of many a
man) had so strōgly sustained & persued
ye Myrmidons, yt some he chased,
& the other he slew on ye gorund
For this cause, & to bnrye his men,
Agamemnon demaūded a trace for
xxx. dayes, the whiche Priamus
graunted hym, to do the lyke thynges
on hys parte.
            
               After the truce, the Troyanes and
the Grekes as before, beganne the
war agayne, and foughte sharplye.
Troylus the moste part of the daye
was ye first in the battel, he fought
merueylously, and smote manye to
the grounde. Then the Greekes w
                  •
               
a great clamor & crie fled their waies.
But when Achilles vnderstod
that Troylus did so furiously spoil
the Grekes, & therewith without
ceasinge smote downe the Mirmidons,
he came to ye battel, w
                  •
                whom
Troylus valiantly incoūtred, that
he wounded him very sore, wherof
he was constrayned, euen beynge
hurt to depart frome the battell.
            Thus thei continued the space of
sixe daies. The seuenth daye bothe
the hoostes chased eche other, & wer
constrayned mutually to retyre. Achilles

beyng absent for a while because
of his woundes & paynes, set
in a raie, encouraged & commaūded
his Myrmidons wt strengthe & fiersnes
to set vpon Troylus person.
The same day about the end therof,
Troylus entred a horse backe very
ioyful into the battell, whereof the
Grekes beyng aduertised, cried out
mainlye, so that the Myrmidons
comminge to there ayde made theyr
whole force and battel according to
Achilles commaundement agaynst
Troylus, by whome a great number
of theym were slayne. In this
cruell and stronge battell Troylus
horse was wounded and fel downe
betwixt his legges, so that Troylus
being let through the fal fo hys
horse, & the straytnes of his harnes,
was constrained to fall, whereof

Achilles being aduertised, came w
                  •
               
al spede, slew him, and would haue
drawen him a syde and caried hym
away, but that he was let by Memnon,
the whiche came sodenly vpon
hym. This Memnon after he had
taken away and deliuered the body
of Troylus frō the enemies, wounded
Achilles, by meanes wherof he
departed from the battel, the which
Memnon perceyuing, with a company
of Troyanes perswed him, of
whom Achilles hauing knoledge,
and his woundes beinge somwhat
amended, fought in such sorte for a
tyme, that through many & violent
woundes he kilde him, & so wounded
departed. After that ye kynge of
Perses was slayne, the rest fled to
the towne, so that the night did seuer
and depart them. And therfore

the next dai (the gates being spard)
Priamus sent vnto Agamemnon,
demaundynge a truce for twentye
day
                  •
               s, the whiche was graunted
him. Priamus caused Troilus and
Memnon to be buried with greate
pompe and triumph, and aswell the
Greks as ye Troyanes caus
                  •
               d their
dead corpses to be buryed. Hecuba
with all he
                  •
               nes & desolation lamented
that Achilles had so cruellye
destroyed her two sonnes Hector
& Troilus so strong & valiant &
in her f
                  •
               minine coūsell, she thought
& purposed to reuenge such iniurie.
Therfore she 
                  〈◊〉
               , monished, and
persuaded her son Alexander to reuenge
ye iniurye done to him & hys
brethren: that is secretlye, and by
spies to take Achilles vnprouided,
and to kyll hym.
            
               The whiche thinge thei might easely
do, in asmuche as Achilles had
through a singuler desire demaunded
Polixena in mariage, and that
she, after the will and aunswere of
Priamus hadde promysed her vnto
him, that there mighte be betwene
theym a constante and a perpetuall
peace. Then was it purposed to lai
an embushemente of men wtin the
temple of Apollo Thymbreus next
vnto the gate of Troye, whither
Achilles should come and entreate
of thys mariage, and this done, Hecuba
woulde throughlye holde her
content and satisfied, so that Achilles
were slayne. The which thinge
Alexander promysed to doe.
            Therfore in the nyght a certain
of the moste strongest of al the hoste
were chosen, and layed with the

watche worde in the foresaied temple.
Hecuba euen as she promised,
sent vnto Achilles. Then he being
in great loue with Polixena, purposed
not to be faultye in his parte.
The next daye folowing when Achilles
(hauing in his company Antiochus
Nestors sonne) was come
to the place appointed, by and by, euen
at his entring in, Paris stirde
vp his souldiers & spies, the which
incontinent began to smite. Achilles
& Antiochus perceiuinge thys,
euen forth with cast their clokes about
their lefte armes, drewe oute
their swerdes and slew many. Aleander
killed firste Antiochus, and
wounded Achilles with many strokes.
Aud thus died Achilles, whiche
coulde not resist that, that was
so secretlye prepared agaynste hym.
Whose body Alexander commaunded

as a pray to be cast to the foules
of the ayre. But Helenus be sought
him not to do so, but to deliuer it vnto
the Greekes. And so thei bare it
out with Antiochus vnto ye Grekes
campe, wher Agamemnon caused
theym to be buried with greate
magnificence & honour. And to the
ende he might the more commodiously
buylde for Achilles a proper
sepulchre, he obtayned a truce of
Priamus. After this his great lordes
& familiers amssēbled vnto the
consel, to this end, that the charges
and affayres of Achilles mighte be
committed to Aiax his neyghbour
Where vnto Aiax answered, that
Achilles had yet one sonne lefte alyne,
named Neoptolemus, vnto
whome the charges of hys father
Achilles were moore due and conuenient,
then to any other, and therfore

it were mete to call hym to the
war, & to restore vnto him ye thing
which pertayned vnto his father.
Whervpon Menelaus was chosen
to go into Scyria, to bryng Neoptolemus
oute of the handes of hys
graundfather Lycomedes: to the
which thyng the foresayd Lycomedes
consented very wyllyngiye.
            Then after that the time of truce
was finished: Agamemnon prepared
& led forth his host. And on the
other side the Troyans issuing out
of their citie, they met together, and

                  •
               ought strongly one agaynst the other.
Aiax being bare & wtout armer
at ye clamor & brute that was made,
set him self in ye point of the battel,
wher ther sell many aswel of ye one
part as of ye other. Alexander w
                  •

amōg whō he persed the bare side of

the whiche beinge soore wounded;
turned him selfe, and persued Alexander,
nor ceased not vntyll he had
slayne hym. Aiax beinge thus
brooken, and not able to doe anye
more because of his wound which
he had receiued, was borne into his
tent, and after the dart was drawen
out of his bodie, deceased. Alexanders
body was brought into the citie.
Diomedes fought couragiouslye
againste his enemies. But the
Troyanes beynge very werye fled
vnto their citie, whome Diomedes
chased vnto the walles. Then Agamemnon
with his men of warre,
came nere, and campt al the night about
the walles of the citie, nor thei
ceased not to watche and spie ye one
after the other. The next daye folowyng,
Priamus caused the body of
his sonne Alexander to be buryed

with great pompe, whose deth Helen
for the greate and mutuall loue
that was betwene theym lamented
most sorofully. And againe because
that Paris hadde receyued her into
his countrey most honourably, and
humanely had intreated her, Priamus
and Hecuba seing her in suche
heuinesse, exhorted her not to forsak
the Troyanes, nor yet desire againe
the company of the Grecianes.
            The nexte daye Agamemnon approched
nie vnto the gate with hys
armye, besiged the towne, and prouoked
the Troyanes to war. Priamus

if Diomedes (although wt great dificulte)
had not resisted, the noble
Penthesilea had burnt the Greks

battell ended, Agamēnon retired &
continued in his cāpe. But Pēthesileacesed
not from day to day furiouslye
to scermishe, spoile, & to prouoke
the Grekes to fight. A gamē

Menelaus was returned, Wherfore
Menelaus beīg now returned

prepared him selfe, and inlik mane

Agamēnon, so yt thei two went together.
Neoptolemus made great
murder, against whō Penthesilea
resisted, & valiantly defended, & for
certen days they fought so vehemētlye
yt of one and other ther were many
slayne. But at ye length Pēthesilea
hurt Neoptolemus, ye whiche
being mained through great paine
and anger, slew Penthesilea ye princes
of the Amozones, & by this menes,
the rest of the Troyans fled to
the citie. Sodenly the Grekes compassed
so the town, the wals, & fortes
of the Troians, that it was impossible
for theym to essue oute of
the towne anye moore.
            
               Antenor, Polidamas and Eneas
considerynge and wayinge well
this thing, went vnto Priamus solicityng
him to see, and by counsell
to take aduisement, what wer good
to be done, aswell for their goodes,
as for them selues. The counsel beinge
assembled, Priamus admonished
euerye man to saye his minde.
Unto whom Antenor shewed that
the most valiauntest princes & protectors
of the Troyanes common
weale and libertie, the kinges children,
and like wise the princes and
captaynes straungers were consumed:
and that on the contrarye syde
the moste strongest and viliauntest
of Grece were yet liuynge, that is,
Agamemnon, Menelaus, Neoptolemus,
no lesse excellent then his father
Achilles, beside these, Diomedes,
Aiax Locrus, and manye other

stronge, craftie, and experte men, as
Nestor & Ulixes, & that the Troyanes
wer inclosed on all sides, beseged,
and almost broken and distroyed.
He coūseled therfore to be much
better to restore Helen, and all that
Alexander and his had taken & caried
awaye, and that so the peace
should be made: After that they had
sufficiently spoken of this purpose
and matter, the pusante Amphimachus
Priamus sonne stode vp, and
accused the dedes and the sayinges
of these, whiche fauoured the counsel
and wil of Antenor, and shewed
that thei shoulde rather take vppon
them to send their hoost to the feld,
and assayle their enemies in their
campe, so that they myghte other
bryng the victory with them, or els
ouercommed, die manfully for their
countreye. Thys done Eneas by

swete & loueli words spake against
Amphimacus persuadīg peace. It
the last Priamus stode vp couragiously,
embrading & laying many euill
dedes vnto Antenor & Eneas,
as to thē that wer the first authors
of the war, & that embessadors wer
sent into Grece. Also that the selfe
same Antenor beinge ambassador, &
returning from Grece, complained
him that he was con
                  •
               umeliouslye
entreated, & that he therfore with al
his pouer persuaded war. Further
more, he cast this in Eneas tethe, yt
he wt Alexāder had rauished Helen,
and brought awai a great bouty out
of Grece. Therfore Priamus was
well assured yt peace ought not, nor
culd not be made betwene thē. The
Priamus cōmiunded thē to be redy
& diligently (after ye signe were geuen)
to issue out of ye 
               
                  •
               ates, other to

winne triumphantlye, or to die valiantly.
After yt Priamus had thus
spoken, he dimissed the counsel, & accompanied
wt Amphimacus went
his wates, saiyng vnto him that he
was in great doubt yt he, his coūtre
and his goodes shuld be betrayed, &
deliuered by thē that had demaūded
peace, into ye handes of his enemies
Also he perceiued, that the
                  •
                mights
haue ayde & fauour of the best parts
of all the cōmon people, & therefore
he was minded to put thē to death,
and if ye thing wer wisely handled,
he trusted not onelye to defende his
countrey, but also to ouercome hys
enemies. Folowyng this purpose,
he prayed and induced Amphimacus
to be faithfull and fauourable
vnto him, & daily to be redy & prepared
to accomplish his interprise the
better and withoute suspicion.
            
               And to bring this to passe, Amphimachus
counseled him to cal thē to
supper, and to fayne some sacrifice,
and sodenly so to take thē. Amphimachus
promysed to doe it, and afterwardes
departed frō Priamus.
The self same dai Antenor, Polidamas,
Ucaligon, Amphidamas, and
Dolon beinge assembled together,
merueyled greatly at the pertinacite
of the king, and founde it to strāg
a thinge that he loued rather to suffer
his countreye, his princes, and
lordes perishe, then to make anye
peace. Wherunto Antenor answered
that he had found a mete remedye
for them al, so that al they wold
be faythful. Ther bounde them selues
with one mynde vnto it. After
that he saw the thyng to be so agreed
vnto, he sent vnto Eneas, signifiyng
vnto him that the laud muste

be betraied, and he to saue himselfe
and his it was nedful, to send someone
to Agamemnō to declare with
dfligence and withoute suspition
their wil and minde, in asmuche as
thei had sene Priamus, when anye
man spake vnto him of peace depart
from the counsel very angrye, fearyng
lest he should excogitate & inuent
some new interprise. Thei all
promisynge this with one accorde,
sent secretly Polidamas the which
was lest suspected amonge them, to
Agamemnon. Now when he was
come to the Grecianes campe, hede
clared vnto Agamemnon the mind
and wil of his companions. Wherfore
Agamemnon al that night did
secretly assemble his counsell, & declared
what he had perceiued of the
Troynes, and hervpon he demaunded
euerye mans aduice. It semed

gaue the watche worde, wherby he
knewe of Eneas and Antenor the

selues to be the signe and tooken of

the Grekes seing it shuld not dout
to approche and entre, and that ther
were men ready ther to bring them

After that the compacte and agremente
was thus accorded, Polidamas
returned into the cite, declared
what was done, aduertised Antenor,
Eneas and other of this conspiracie,
to bringe al theyr men by
night to the gate of Scea, ye which
thei should open lifting vp the forsaied
flame into the ayre, and so to
let in the Grecianes. Antenor and
Eneas were readye by night at the
foresayde gate, where thei receyued
Neoptolemus, vnto whome & his
men of armes, thei liftynge vp the
flame, opened the gates. And doing

this, thei thought vpon their owne
departure, as a souerayne remedy of
their prodition and treason, wherevnto
Neoptolemus dyd succoure &
ayde theym. Neoptolemus entred
in, & sette an order and a garrison in
the towne: and by Antenor was
conueyed and brought into the kinges
palace, wher was the garrison,
and the soueraigne defence of al the
Troianes, and from thence he pursued
and chast Priamus vntyll he
came before the temple of Iupiter
Herceus, where he at the last kilde
hym. Hecuba also fliyng with Polixena
met Eneas, & delyuered her
vnto his kepinge, whome he set in
his father Anchises house. Andromacha
and Cassandra hid them selues
within Minerues temple, the
Grekes reased not al that night lōg
to pylle, destroy, spoyle and cary away,

when it was daye, Agamemnon
caused all his to be called into
the castel, and ther he gaue thankes
vnto the gods maysed his host very
greatly, commaunded the bouty
to be brought in, which he equallye
deuided to euery one of them. This
done, he asked counsell and euerye
mans aduise, whether it wer mete
to obserue & kepe their faith promised
to Eneas and Antenor the betraiers
of their countrey. Wherunto
euery man with one voyce aunswered
to be lawfull. Then they
called for them to deliuer them such
thynges as pertayned vnto theym.
Then Antenor demaunded licence
to speake, the whiche thinge Agamemnon
graunted him. Antenor
at ye beginnyng of his oration gaue
thankes vnto the lordes of Grece.
Furthermore, he declared howe yt
               
Helenus & Cassandra at all times
had desired & counselled their father
to peace, and that Achilles at
the persuation of the foresaid Helenus
was buried. Therefore Agamemnon
by the minde of his counsell,
set Helenus and Cassandra at
liberty. Helenus praied Agamemnon
for Hecuba & Andromacha, geuing
him to vnderstande, that they
alwaies bare him good will, vnto
whō also libertie, by the sentence &
mind of his counsel was graunted
In the meane time, he deuided the
bouty againe, praised a gaue thankes
vnto ye gods, offered sacrifices,
& purposed to returne & depart the
fifte day: vpon the which day, there
sodenly arose greate and horrible
tempestes, so that they were for

               Calchas answered them, that they
had not done their duetye to ye gods
infernall. Neoptolemus remēbred
that Polixena for whom his father
Achilles perished was not founde
in the kinges castel. Then Agamē
               non
caused Antenor to be called, &
commaunded him to finde out Polixena
with al diligence, and to present
her vnto hym. Then went Antenor
to seeke for Polixena whiche
was hidden in Eneas house, and
brought her to Agamēnon, & deliuered
her to Neoptolemas, ye whiche
nye vnto his fathers tombe put her
to death most cruelly. Agamemnon
prouoked against Eneas for the cō

            Menelaus oration vnto the
Troyanes for the repetion
of Helen.
            
               YF Paris wold haue
kepte anye sparke of
reason, or of honestie
(O ye people of
Troye) truelye we
shulde now nede nothinge
wether it were of counsels,
or of armes, or of legation: but clene
contrary we should liue in our houses
at reste and without detriment
or losse: your goodes also and youre
persons shuld be in greater & mor
                  •
               
sure tranquilitie. But the thynge
which Paris hath chosen, settyng
                  •
               
voluptuousnes in the place of vertue
(O ye people of Troy) hath inuited
and prouoked vs to come hyther,
not for to molest any man vniustly,
but for to repete if it be lawful
for vs, the thing yt is our owne.
Therfore ye se from youe walles &
hie pynnacles the men of warre of

Grece nie vnto you in as greate &
numbre, as in triumphant preparation
and order. But yet we haue
wel forsene and considered hetherto
to be discrete, & to do no maner of
thing against reason and iustice: for
notwithstandinge we haue our armes
in our handes disploied, yet it
is so, that we had rather vse swete
wordes, to the end that we hauing
recouered by words only the thing
that pertayneth vnto vs, maye incontinent
retier: yf not to finish the
thing that we haue already begun.
And as our purpose is not lightly
to set our handes to our wepons: so
it is not for vs to abstaine if ye wil
annihilate & lytle esteme our ligation
and request. It is now in you
to chose, whether it be more dearer
vnto you to prefer the pleasure of
Paris aboue youre owne wealthe

and libertie, or els with Helen to
be exempte from al warre. Certen
it is, that continually vnto this dai
we haue reiected all the faulte in
Paris only nor would not, yf anye
wronge wer done vnto you, attribute
the same to ye cōmon people of
Troy: althoughe that the yssue and
the deliberation of thys assemble,
shall other confirme oure opinion,
or certenly declare openly the dede
to pertaine onely to Paris, but the
enterprise vnto all. And yf in tellyng
youre aduice and minde in the
coūsel, ye fauor Paris any thing at
al, ye shall declare your selues to be
ye principal of these dedes: but cōtrary
wyse, yf beyonde the iudgement
and wyll of him ye do after right 
                  •
               
equite, al the crime shall finally redoune
vnto hym. But my custome
is not to make so longe a rehersall

of suche thynges, and it
semeth to stan de with good reason.
Be ye wel assured I pray you,
that for one vniust cause I woulde
not once open my mouth to speake,
and for a good and iuste cause I
esteme that with fewe wordes I
maye greatlye satisfie and content
you. Therfore I thoughte in thys
case (althoughe I haue bene customed
to vse a certayne prolixite)
to be verye mete and conuenient to
speake succinctlye and brefelye.
            This thynge in verye trueth is
suche, that it requireth no laborius
nor no difficulte meanes, considerynge
that there resteth nothynge,
but with one simple and easy oration
to ouercume his aduersarye.
            Now Paris tell me, by the greate
God Iupiter, hast thou not rauished
the thing yt was none of thine?

Make restitution then, Haste thou
not taken it without any right and
by violence? Then thou oughtest
to be punished. Thou must knowe
of two thinges one, other that thou
shew that thou hast taken nothyng
or yf thou confesse it, that a
                  •
                the le
                  •
               t
thou do cesse in wyl vniustly to defend
it. I thinke thou dost not votsafe
to denye that thou hast spoyled
me of my goodes to me most derest,
and most precious, for I know that
thou dost desier to be praysed of thy
euel dede. And therfore it wer more
than reason yt thou shouldest beare
thy selfe of such an enterprise vpon
vs. And although that we haue receyued
thee vnto vs as a straunger,
yet thou hast recompensyd vs more
cruellye then an enemye. Esteme it
not at all that he, by an honest and
an open interprise might doe vs so

great an iniurie, nor repute him not
so braue a manne, and vs so weake
to suffer suche iniurie, yf he had geuen
vs knowledge of that that he
enterprised. But I praye you to
here how the thyng was done. Paris
as it is to be presumed ha
                  •
               h recited
the facte vnto you, not as it is,
but all to his owne aduantage, wyl
lynge with his 
                  〈◊◊〉
                to couer a
leasynge. Of al men the which offende
there is scarcelye one that wil
know and confesse his faulte, but
with all their power goe aboute
to disguyse the trueth: to this ende,
that partly they maye receyue great
emolument and profite, and partlye
be taken for men of honestye. The
thing purposely entēded was thus
done. Paris on a certayne daye aswell
accompanied with manye as
rychely appoynted, came into Laconia

to make muster of hys owne
persō, & after yt he had ben in Sparta,
amōg al other thiges he vsed vnto
euery mā (fayning a certen goodnes
& modeste) great humanite and
swetenes, & that because he desired
to obtain som noble & honest loges
When I preceiued yt, I estemed nothing
more honorable & worthy of
nobilite, thē to minister vnto him ye
thing yt was necessary for a strāger:
therefore I opened my gate vnto
him, & volūtariously comunicated
al yt I had & estemed most dere & pr
                  •
               
               ciꝰ,
sauīge my wife, & my doughter,
not thinking any thing (O ye people
of Troye) of al this yt chaunsed
afterwards. I thought verely that
Iupiter was ī a maner ye chife & prī
               cipal
cōductor of this his cōminge,
also I was persuaded yt he was as
egal & in like cōdition wt the gods yt
               
receiueth another mā, as he which
is so humainly & gentlye receiued:
but this man to be much more boū
               den,
in asmuch as he hathe receiued
more goodnes & profite, then he of
whō he receiued it. wt what greate
good wil thinke ye, shall we nowe
honor & obserue ye noble & excellent
mā Antenor, we wish him al goodnes
& honour more & more, & desire
nothing lesse, thē yt any such misfortune
shuld come or chaūce vnto his
familie. And of my part I vsed towards
my gest all swetnes & benignite.
Let Paris come now into the
pliane & say if any necessary thīg required,
was denied him? Or yf he
know yt we haue endured his long
tariynge wyth anye heuynesse or
tediousnes? Hath he not cotinually
receyued were it muche or lyttle
the thynge that pleased hym?
            
               Hath he by any meanes soner knowen
then reprehended our auarice
and mecanicall scarcenes? Hathe
he perceyued that anye man hathe
done hym wronge? If he accuse vs
of anye of these foresayde thynges,
let him shewe it, and I shall frelye
confesse that he receyued not the
thousande part of that, that he hath
deserued. But for asmuche as in
thys matter he can say nothyng, so
lyke wyse it behoueth no man to
speake of it. But so it is that the
faythful opinion which we conceiued
of hym, was the cause, that we
suffered hym to dwell amonge vs
with great assuraunce and liberty,
and without any suspicion no more
then of a familier frende, the which
thynge maye accustomably chaunce
to all men: and al those thynges the
which be ryght and reason oughte

to be holye and inuio
                  •
               able (O ye
people of Troye) He ha
                  •
               h intierly
turned vp syde dow̄ne. Furthermore,
euell for good, maleuolence
for hospitalite, rapine for lodgyng,
iniurye for honour, for good say the
he hath rememberd al crueltie. He
had no feare of the goddes, nor no
reuerence to his benefactors, nor to
you, & much lesse to his father Priamus,
the which we learned to be
a great obseruer of the gods and of
religion, and very careful that his
son shoulde not commit anye suche
acte or misdede. But Paris
nothing regarding all these thinges
hath rauished my wife, and stolen
my treasure & ryches, besides that
he hath taken away my seruantes,
and dyuers other thynges. But
what nede is it of so longe a tale,
principally vnto those to whō the
thinge is notorius: The thinges

which he hath brought hither doe
sufficiently shewe howe greatly he
hath spoyled me. Certes he is now
riche to my greate losse and hinderaunce.
And to know more largely
the vnworthynes of the fact, it nedeth
not to send any man, but to go
into Paris house, and to question
with him vnder this maner. How
is this woman thine, whiche thou
possessist? Kepest thou Helen in
thy house spoused by the righte of
mariage, as Priamus holdeth thy
mother? Then other as shamfast of
the cace he shall falselye denie it, or
els yf he wil tell the trueth, he shall
openly confesse his euel dede. Nor
none of you in ye meane space ought
to thinke me importune, if I in my
oration do speake frely: for at ye first
we can not obtayne the thyng that
is ours. And of your selues ye can
not cōprehend the veri
                  •
               e of ye dede,

yf it were not largely declared vnto
you. By this meanes it shall be
easie to iudge what an vnworthye
and how vnfortunate this dede is.
And if one mā do recite openly the
thyng wherwith he was offended,
he is greuous vnto those that haue
committed or done suche like thinges: how
is it reasonable that they
shoulde scandalise and shame themselues,
which are wounded & hurt
with the selfe same dede? Furthermoore
it is not possible to make a
mans quarel apeare iuste, yf he first
declare not the authour of ye crime
to be culpable. Thou seest thē how
euident and how iust our cause is.
Uerelye there are but two pointes
that maye iustifie him that is accused,
yt is to wete, that other he hath
committed the crime, or els yf it so
be, that with good righte he hathe
cōmitted it. Yf Paris then can not

denye suche rape not proue it iuste,
that which resteth is of it selfe euident
ynough. What honest reason
shall he allege? I haue taken her,
saieth he, I holde her, in no wyse
be not tedius. To haue taken her,
to holde her, is not ynough Paris.
He might haue caused some one to
take that awai, the which he ought
not to take, & althoughe he possesse
the thing that is none of his, yet for
al that it is not to be sayed, that incontinent
he hathe gotten the iuste
possessiō of ye thing so rauished: but
so if ther be no vnrighteousnes nor
wronge: nor we ought not to haue
respect to the thing which we haue
rauished, but muche more be what
reason, the which thing we ought
much more in suche a case to consider.
Thou seest that sacriligious
persons remaine not vnpunished
when thei take or steale the thynge

consecrated vnto the goddes. Furthermore,
yf the possession of the
thyng wer ynough to defend hym,
whosoeuer should haue possession,
should also be sone iustified. Now
(as me thinketh) men shuld thinke
that to be a vitious thing that anye
man shoulde holde and possesse the
thinge whiche of right pertayneth
not vnto him. It is not sufficiēt for
a man to lai his hand vpon a thing,
but he muste of necessite haue some
right vnto it. Yf Paris after he had
chased away his father, and before
vsurped the kyngdō, wold be lorde
ouer you and your goodes, shoulde
he be estemed to tak vpon him thinges
honest & reasonable. But contrarywise,
his father being so secretly
prouoked coulde not indure
it, nor you nother being aduertised
of the thing, but should rather esteme
him worthye as a misdoer to be

punished. Therfore thou shouldest
not excuse thy self to haue taken the
thing, but to shew in taking therof
not to haue don amis: for ye right is
on my side, yf Priamus be an equal
iudge. But he saieth, we that dwel
in this part of the erth, & ye that do
inhabite the other, are perpetual enemies.
There is some right & reason
to take, pyll
                  •
               , & beare away the
goodes of our enemies, so there be
no other fault. Truth it is Paris: but
is it reasonable to lodge with a
mans enemie, to receiue giftes, & other
honest thinges? And as touching
thy selfe, thou hast receiued yt
thou most desirest. Alas, yu shouldest
not euē at the beginning of thy cō
               ming
(O noble Paris) approched
so, but rather auoyded the loges of
thyne enemie: thou shouldest not
haue receiued any benefit, nor haue
bene so familier with those, whose

perpetual enemy thou reputest thy
selfe before. And yf for a certayne
tyme thou vsedest theym as good
frendes, how happened it, that afterwardes
thou vsedest them as enemies?
And ma
                  •
                this forsaid time
there was not in me, wher wt thou
mightest haue bene offended, & therfore
thou hast none occasion of any
quarel. Yf thē at ye beginning thou
heldest vs for enemyes, why didest
thou dissemble it: Why saidest thou
other wise then thou thoughtest in
thy heart? And if afterwardes thy
wyl & mind being chaunged, thou
wouldest offend vs, answere vs by
the goddes, for what demerite of
ours. Certes yu canst bring no reason
at al, but that afterwards thou
cōceiuedest in thy braine a very 
                  ••
               
               tius
dede, to enter into my house as
a geste, and to depart as an enemye.
Furthermore, to cloke thine astute

and craftines with faire wordes,
thou tho
                  •
               ghtest to disguyse & deface
thy misdede. But yet thou cāst
not persuade ye dede to any man liuyng
otherwise then it is, because
thy wordes are repugnant to nature.
For the thing yt we commonlye
do speake, ought to haue som agrement
wt nature Yf Paris had gone
into Lacedemonia with a nauie of
ships, or wt a great host of men wel
appointed, yf he had openly declared
his enmite, if wt the swerde in
hand, or wt shakinge of his spere he
had done some force, it had ben reason
he should haue caried away the
victorye, other through fortune, or
els by vertu & strength: be it so that
he had taken the towne, & the men,
then Helen shoulde haue chaunsed
vnto him as a part of his bouty, let
him hold her, let her serue him. But
we abuse our selues, taking vice for

the wages that men ought to receiue
of war. And although thou diddest
shew in al thinges, as in ships,
countenaunce, wordes, in maner of
lyuynge, & con
                  •
               ersation sygnes of
peace, yet the end was far contrary
to ye beginninge. Let it be knowen
that victory doeth farre differ from
thefte, & soden takinge wittely adorned
with warly vertue. For victory
doth declare the nobilite of the
man, & pusillanimite of such as accomplishe
by treason, that they can
not by the honestie of vertue. It is
not peraduenture to much vnreasonable
(so that the lawes of warre
permit & suffer it) that greate men
father them selues with goodes of
their inferiours. Yea, but of his
frewyl to attempt vnto the goodes
of ye more vertues, or whō mē durst
neuer declare them selues enemies,
is truly a dede of extortion, & worthye

to be punished. And because
we haue endured and suffred great
iniury & wronge, we haue brought
our army into y
                  •
               ur countre & possessions,
not as authors of wronge
and euil doinges, but as reuengers
of iniurye. As touchyng the rest, I
persuade my selfe yt it is well knowen
and perceiued by diuers pointes,
that there remayneth nothyng
in Paris but v
                  •
               shamfastnes. Neuertheles
our wil & mind hath ben
rather to vse words then wepons,
and that for many reasons. First because
it is a very worthy act for an
honest man, not lightlye to laye his
his hand vpon his wepon, but rather
attempt, if it be possible otherwise
to recouer the thing pretēded.
Furthermore, leste it should seeme
iuste vnto vs for the misdede of one
alone, to make a vniuersal punishement,
the which thinge in war necessarely

doeth chaunce. Ther men
can not pardon nor spare the innocentes,
for whosoeuer falleth must
nedes remayne. Fearyng then lest
such cases should chaunce, or yt any
of you should fal into such affaires
wherwith ye would not be molested,
we refuse not that the controuersy
be ended by legatiōs & suffrages,
for we beleue the diuine fauour
is most commonly conuersant
in marcial affaires, yt which we do
see euery day in a maner to fauoure
not those that interprise moste, but
those that haue moste iuste cause.
            Wherfore this cause abatynge our
courage, haue first of al vsed legations,
to thentent if that alone might
suffice to the decision of our act, we
shuld nede none other thing: otherwise
we trusting to ye deuine helpe
                  •
               
and fauour because of the equitie &
truth of our cause, we come finally

to the second effort & helpe. Therefore
consider the one and the other,
and compare the fact & dede of war,
with verbal disceptation, wepons
with words: lykewise considering
the present felicite, and the misfortunes
yt may chance to suche thinges,
chuse of two wayes the better. It
is very necessarye (O ye people of
Troye) in such matters to vse ripe
and diligent counsel: for ye knowe
right wel, that an errour cōmitted,
can not afterwardes be restored to
his perfectnes againe. But before
the war beginneth, al his entire and
whole: and easye it is not to fall into
smche inconuenience, but to flie
and by mature deliberatiō to auoyd
it. For when the hand is lift vp to
the battell, the euels & misfortunes
encrease wtout ende, vnto ye whiche
victory alone, & no other condition
be it neuer so modest, can geue anye

final end. Take hede therfore, yt ye
chuse not war in the place of peace,
lest that after ye haue felt the incō
               modities
of the war, ye repent you
when the occasion shalbe voyd and
gone. Furthermore, yf nother war
nor no other daunger shuld ensue &
folow, yet it were necessarye euermore
to chuse the thyng yt wer iust
and reasonable. For this is verye
certaine yt suche men haue the accō
               plishement
of their desiers. Nowe
if ye will afterwardes examine the
thinge, ye shall haue no leasure, although
ye haue a contrary wyll, to
do otherwyse. Se ye not the cōpanies
of the Grecians spred about al
your countrey in so great a numbre
that it being so litle and so narowe
can scarcely receiue thē? The whiche
not withstanding they be thus
gathered oute of diuers places, yet
they haue al one wyl to reuenge euen

vnto the end al those, that haue
receyued iniurie. And in very dede
thei are so ready & so purposed to do
their best, that it is no nede to bynd
them by an othe, for they them selues
haue so bounde them selues wt
so religious and so strayte an othe,
they yf they would refuse it, menne
might most easely cōstrayne them.
Now what man is so vnprouided
of good wit, that wil not render vp
the thing, the which finally he may
leese wt greate detriment and losse?
Shal he delai it at al (O Iupiter)
because of the vncertayne yssue and
end of the warre? No by the gods,
the end is not vncertayne, nor it is
not to be doubted but that equ
                  •
               tie
shal receyue her rewarde before vnrighteousnes:
and that the iust shal
receyue another maner of retribution,
then the fauters of iniquitie,
yf we nede not to doubte nother of

the one nor of the other, certaynely
it is then vndoubtful, yt thei which
haue the iuster cause shalbe victoriers
and superiors in the war. And
as concerning those which ye hope
to haue to succur & ayde you: I am
sure that many of our men wyl regarde
them no more, then if ye wer
sure to haue a greater nūbre. And
I say thys, yt if the rest of ye men of
warre woulde stande styl without
smityng of any stroke, that Ulixes
alone is sufficient to annihilate all
youre alies & confederates, and by
wisedome and a fortunable spirite
to destroye the whole multitude.
This that I do saye, is not that I
refuse or auoyde the warre, or that
I am otherwyse desirous of newe
affayres. Certes it is very easy for
me to speake many other thynges,
but it is not nedeful. For if ye take
not pleasure in the thynges afore

spoken, we shoulde but in vayne
goe any further. Nowe I doe call
the great Iupiter hospital, and all
the other goddes and spirites the
rulers of this prouince to witnes,
that we beyng fyrst styrde and prouoked,
are come in armes agaynste
Troye, and yet at thys present doe
desyre to ende thys matter by wordes
onelye: and that we begynne
not, nor by anye meanes doe styrre
vp warre, but as constrayned by
oure enemyes.
