                  AMonge the nomber and those great vices with raygne among men that lyue discorderly & are not guyded with the rule of Honestie, I dare well saye there is no one that bréedeth so muche hurt as this: That we knowe not dewly how to bestow vppon others, nor to receyue at others handes, suche benefites and plesures as eyther we doo our selues, or els by others are done to vs. By meane wherof, it foloweth that benefittes euilly bestowed, are in lyke maner euilly repaied and of such ouer late we complain when we find thē not as we would wish them recompensed. For those benefits accōpt

I as loste, whiche are so bestowed without dew regard. And certes it is no whit to be merueiled at, though amonge all the faultes of men which in déed are excedinge great and welnigh innumerable, there is not to be founde any one ryfer and more in vse then vnthankfulnes:Ingratitude the m

                     mon vice & the cause why. whiche vndowtedly I sée doth happen through diuers causes. The first and chefest is, for that wee haue no respect on whom we bestow our benefites. But if we wer to lend money to any one, doutles we would enquere diligently before hand, what maner of man he were, of what credyt & habilitie. Neyther is any plowmā so vnwise we se to sow his corn on ground which he knoweth to be barren. But our benefites which far excell any other thynge that we can geue, we bestow héere and there without any consideracion before had, whether they are dewly employed, and vpon suche as deserued thesame or not. And verely I can not say whether is more discortesie to be

thought in him that is to be plesured if he refuse a benefit when it is profered, or in him that doth the pleasour to requier recompense for that which he hath done. But if we mynd to benefitte any man, we ought before hād to cōceiue this good opiniō of him, that with hys good wil we shall at his handes receiue asmuch commodity again if we néede, as we presently doo vnto him. Whych hope conceiued though we hap to faile to find it satisfied yet is it a most dishonest and vyle part to make complaint therof. For why, in him that is to discharge suche credit conceyued, it is not welthe ne substaunce that are to be required, but onely a mindful and thankfull hart. For he hath sufficiently requited the benefitte which he hath receiued at an others handes, who willingly doth acknowledge himself his debtour. But lyke as ther resteth a fault in those whyche shew themselues to be both in word and déed vnthankfull,Uery vnthankfulnes, in worde & dede and the causes. forgetting vtterly and refusyng to requite

the plesures that haue bene shewed thē, so riseth there oftentymes on our parts no small cause of this their Ingratitude. For as wée finde diuers that are of their owne natures vnthankfull, so doo wee our selues make many Ingrat whyche otherwise parhaps would not haue bene so. For sometime we cast in their tethe and vpbraid vnto them what wee haue done for them: and otherwhile we exact importunatly at theyr handes, recompense for suche benefites as wee before haue done vnto thē. Otherwhiles again we shew our selues to be so inconstant of minde that forthwith it repenteth vs of the plesure that we erst dyd. And thus complaininge our case and chaungyng our mindes in the torning of a hand, we doo not onely disgrace the pleasour wee before shewed, and loose the thankes which otherwyse should haue bene dew for the same, but also we agreue gretly the party to whom we dyd the same. For who is he almost that will shew himself

easy to be entreated, or that woulde doo any plesour to speake of, with only ones beyng desired?The true descripsion of him that dothe no pleasour but by importunat request. Who is 
                     •
                  e that vnderstandyng that his Frind being in néede wold request any thing of him, but either he bended the browes at it, or turned his face asyde, or feigned to haue a thousande lettes and a thousande businesses otherwayes? Or who is he that by longe proces and manifest feigned excuse, hath not sought busyly to shift of the occasion of dealynge for hys frinde whereby he thought he should be troubled, or hathe not deuised a nomber of delayes to dispatche himself of suche matters as haue bene vrged vpon hym? To be short, who is he that beyng very ernestly requested by his frinde to doo him a plesure, hath not long tracted the time before he wold assume it on him, or ells plainlye made de
                     •
                  yall to doo it. Or if haples hys promys scaped him with muche a doo and after longe entreatye weryed, hath not yet done thesame with such doutes casting

and ceremonyes vsing that far better it wer to be quyte deuoid of his suche pleasour, then with such a doo to haue it? Nowe is there any man (iudge you) that hath cause to thincke himself beholdyng to such one at whose handes with hart-grutching he hath bene plesured, or that hath benefited him to this end only that he may brag therof, or for that he woulde be ridd from being any longar disturbed with suche importunat suet? If there be any that thinketh he shoulde account himself his dettour whom he hath deluded with delayes, annoyed with attendance and weryed with scornefull talke before he would plesour hym, he is much deceiued. For plesures ought to be requited with lyke minde and will as they are done
                     •
                   and for this cause, is it requisite that they be not done negligently. For eche one ought to rendre both that whyche he receiued, and in suche order as he receiued it. Whereupon, who that hath shewed plesour after long entreaty, or by constraint (as it were) is worthy

after the same sort to be rewarded. Wherfore the benefitte or plesour that is done, shold not be done slowly or with ouer great deliberacion. For as of eche thing that is done, the mind of him that doth it declareth the order how it is done so the benefitt that is done slowly and with muche requesting,Benefits ought not to be done slowly & vpō request. argueth that he who dyd it in suche sort, refused long to doo the same. Neyther ought plesures to be done iniuriousely and with reproche. For as by naturall reason those thinges persist longest and are of longest continuaūce which ar engrauen déeper in respect of them which haue but a very light imprint, so likewise iniuries who naturally haue a déepar séet then benefits, parsist also longar and rifar in mynde. What reward or guerdon may he iustly claym, that wold séeme to plesour a man, and yet in verie déed worketh him greuaunce and displesour? He doeth sufficiently acknowledge the plesour and good that hath bene shewed him, who confesseth

the same. And albeit that the nomber of vnthankful people be in dede very great,The multitude of ingrate pleople shold not make vs y• slower to doo good

                   ought we not (this not withstanding) to become any whit the slower or lesse willing to doo good. For first as I haue saide, we augment and encrease thereby the nomber of thē. Moreouer w

                  tendeth his goodnes stil indifferētly to those that are suche offendours aswel as to thē that offended not. For as his nature is to doo good to all men, (I should say to all thinges,) so with them y• be good, socoureth he also thē which shew themselues far vnworthy therof. Let vs therfore followe him as our guide, so farre as our fraile and weke nature will parmit. Let vs doo good & succour others, & that without desiring vsury therfore. He is wourthy

to faile of his purpose who doth a benefit for this cause onely, yt he may repe the like again. But som one perhaps wil say that I am much deceiued herein. To whom I aunswere thus. That albeit yt our wyues & childrē do often hap to frustrat & decei

Againe if it be so y• we arme our selues to endure the thorough tryall of worldly affaires, & that for no maner losse in battail, or wreck on sea, we faint to attempt thesame again,That we shold persist on in weldoīg. of more strōg reason thē is it fitting & fit for vs, to persist & cōtinew on in our weldoings. Frō whiche if a man cesse ones for y• he was not rewarded for ye lyke he hath done toforetime, it is to be presupposed y• that which he then did, he did it to no other end, but for that he hoped by doing therof, to reap the lyke again. Whereby right well he excuseth thunthākfull man, who for this

cause only is accused, that he doth not requite the plesour that others haue shewed him. Sée we not how many there are in the world vnworthy to behold the brightnes of the Sōne, and yet he casteth his beames aswell vppon them, as vpon the good menne. How many are there I praye you that exclaim againste nature, cursing her that euer she suffred them to be borne into the worlde, and yet geueth shée of

It is the propertie of a stowt and princely courage, and of a worthie man not to pursew and follow after the frute & reward which follow benefites & plesure shewed, but to regard the worthines on

                  ly or the same good déedes themselues, so that though he happen to light vppon some vnthankfull persons, yet he dismayeth nowhit thereat, but séeketh to bestow the residew of his benefites vppon suche as wil more thankfully accept

the same. For in all this world who is he that benefiteth a multitude, and among them all, findeth not some that will frustrate his expectacion? But vppon this point dependeth the force and efficacie of a benefitte,Wheri

Of which benefit in suche sort bestowed, a noble hart hath therby alredy reapt sufficient recōpence. Undoutedly it is so farre vnséemely that the want of findyng plesour for the lyke shewed should dismay vs from perseuering in so honest a thing, that out of question if I wer exempt from all hope that I should euer finde any one that would beare in mind and acknowledge the plesour whiche I should doo to hym, I would yet rather wishe to find no one of my plesures requited, then for anye ingratitude that I might haue shewed me, I woulde su
                     •
                  cesse frō doing good wherein I might. For who that will not applie himself to benefit others, is farre worse to be iudged

of, then any vnthankful person. And to conclude, this is my opinion. He that neyther will acknowledge nor render the benefites whiche he hath receyued, is no more to be blamed then he that being requested refuseth in dew time and season to plesour him that standeth in necessitie.

                  Immesurable geuinge is commēdable in no thynge.
                  IN the first line immoderat and bestowing of plesours without dew regard before had vpon whō they are imploied, is reprehended. For indéed we shuld geue nothing after such a careles sort. But of our benefites especialy, we should not be so lauash: for yf

they happen at anye time to be geuen vnaduisedly, and without dew consideracion, forthwith thereby they lose the name of benefites by dew right, & wolde rather be termed by some other name. The second line is straung, as that whiche with the wel bestowing of one only benefit and good déed, recomforteth the grief which might haply grow by ye losse of a nomber. Marke wel I pray thée and tell me if it be not mete & agreable with the worthines of him that may doo good, that we exhort and moue him thoroughly to perseuer in weldoing and plesouring of all men, notwithstanding that it be not his chaunce to employ any of his benefites so, that he may think them wel bestowed. For verely I suppose that that is not to be much acompted of whiche is in thend of the secōd verse (to wit) That he shal lose a nomber of his benefites. For why no benefit is lost. For he who is to doo anye benefitte, muste beforehand when he mindeth to bestowe

any suche benefit, make this accomp

                  , that he looketh not to receiue any thyng again for that whiche he is to doo. The reason whiche moueth men to plesour one an other is plaine and single. Grutche not to bestow thie benefites. If he that doth receiue them yeld thée the like, take it for aduauntage. If th

                  u hap not to find the like, but contrarywise Ingratitude for thie benefites, yet art thou nowhit dānified hereby. For thou must thus thinke with thyself. That whych I gaue, I dyd it as fully resolued and determined before hand to geue it, and to that end that I might accompt it geuen, without looking to receiue anye the lyke againe. None shoulde note in his booke of Remēbraunces the plesours and benefites which he doth to others.Benefit

For if he shoulde otherwise doo, and requyer recompense (as I saide) for them, then might they not iustly be said to be geuen, but lent as it were for a season onely. And questionles there can be none so foule and dishonest vsury of anye thing, as to loke for recompense for that plesour that ones hath passed thée.

Ceasse not therfore to benefit still. Strayn thine abilitie: playe the part of a good manne.

that the continuall doing and renewing of them, maketh the very brute bests deuoyd of all Reason and vnderstandyng, kepe them rife in memorye. The lyke effect whereof they shall also woorke assuredly in thunthankfull man. Who though perhaps he forgat one good torne done to him, he will not so neglect the second: or if he shew himselfe to haue sklenderly remembred those two, yet dowtles the third shall enforce hym too call to mind the former twayn which he had erst forgotten. He may well be sayd to haue loste the benefit whyche he dyd, that forthwith thinketh it lost so sone as he hath done it.

Which benefites of what force and effect they are to make good nature in any man, I shall herafter declare, so sone as I haue shewed my fātasy in one point or two, somewhat different frō our matter in hand. That is to wit, For what cause it is said that ther are thre Graces,Thre graces. wherfore thy are called sisters, why they go linked hād in hand, what is the cause why they are allwayes smylinge and of mery countenaunce, what is the Reason why they are euer yong.

Of these thrée Ladyes, called Graces, thopinion of some is, that the first of them bestoweth benefites: the seconde receyueth the same, and then third confesseth the recept, and requiteth them. Others some there are that by these thrée Graces, would signifie thrée kind of benefytes. Namely the benefites whych are geuen: the benefites whiche are receiued, and the benefits which are receiued and repayed, togethers. But whether of these two opinions is worthiest to be allowed, it is not muche materiall to examin, and for that I will leue it at large vndiscust. Let vs then sée why these thrée Ladyes whom I called Graces, do still beholde thone the other, and make a ring as it wer eche holding other by the hand.Why ye .iii Graces holde one thother by ye hand Uerely it is for thys cause. The gyft that passeth from the geuer, yf it keepe dew order from the one to the other, it retorneth againe from hym that receiued it vnto the geuer by dew ordely course. Which order if

it be broken or anye whit discontinued, forthwith thereby shoulde it lose all the worthy commendacion whiche the said benefit should requier: like as wee sée yf any of these Ladyes should louse hands, the facion of the King were broken, and streight shoulde lose that name. They are alwayes smyling and merye countenaunced,Whi thei laughe. for that they should represent to vs thereby, that those that are of good natures ought when they bestow benefytes whyche maye sound to the furtheraunce of others, no lesse to reioyce, and shew themselues wellapaid therat, then they should doo who are by them in such sort pleasured.Whi thei are yōg & Uirgins They are alwayes yong, for this that the remembraunce of benefites ought in no wyse to waxe olde or fade forth of fresh memorye. Uirgins they are, for this that benefites ought to be pure, incorrupted, not stayned, and to be done without constraint or enforcement. They were their garments louse, whyche are so clere and thin that a man

may sée through,why thei are so aparelled. to declare that benefites would be also séen and not hidden. With those Ladyes Mercury is also by some associated as companion: not for that eloquence is anye whyt requisyt to commend the benefyt that is done, or the order of doing thesame, but only for that it so lyked the paynter to deuise thesame Chrisippus to whom for his great subtilitie of wit diuers attribute no small praise for that he so exquisitely accustometh to sift out the truth of thinges, applieng al his whole talke to the matter he treateth of, and that with no longer proces of wordes then is requisite for ye thoroughvnderstandyng therof, hath yet stuffed his whole booke full of these and suche lyke table: so that he speketh hymsel

elles but of suche trifles. For besides that whych he wryteth of Hecates, he reporteth also that these thrée Graces wer Iupiters daughters begotten vpon Eurinome: in youth, comelines of countenaunce, and beawty most excellent, and for this cause were they all thrée apointed to haue the keping of Heauen gates, and to be attendant on the Lady Uenus. Moreouer. Chrisippus in his sayde booke noteth also that not without good cause their mother whome I shewed you of, was called Eurinome, whō for that thinterpretacion of her name sheweth her to be riche & of great habilitie, he feigneth therfore to distribute benefits and frēdly plesures. As though the mother of force muste be named after the qualities and condicions of her daughters, or ells what name soeuer the Poetes plesed to attribute to any thyng, was the very name of the thyng indéed.

Wée are I saye to prescribe rules and preceptes for menne to frame their lyues by, least that vnder collour of courtesye some fall into excessiue prodigalitie: and least that others some by ouernere scauuing and héed takynge in bestowinge of benefites,The law of lyfe

Whyche as indéed it ought not to excéed, so neyther should it be ouermuch skanted, but to obserue a iust, dew, and lawdable meane. Touching which matter, these are thinstructiōs that we geue.

That men accept thankfully such benefites as are done vnto them,The cōtē
                     cion of honesty resteth in geuīg, takīg & rendrīg benefites and that gladlye in lykemaner they requite the same. We are moreouer to propose vnto them a great contencion which ought to be betwen the geuer and the receiuer of benefites. Whiche is, that we should not content our selues to render the lyke only of that which we haue receiued at the handes of those that haue pleasured vs, but that we should stryue to excell them farre in well meaning and minde to plesour them againe. And impossible it is that any man can requite a good tourne, except before hand he haue found it. For which cause they that do any plesures or employ any benefites, are to be aduertised that they make none account of their benefit after they haue ones bestowed it, and they that haue receiued thesame, to thinke themselues somuch the more endetted to them for so doing. Of whyche honest and commendable cōtention this is the whole and thonly end:The right vse of this cōtēcion. to stryue

ernestly to ouer matche and excell them at whose handes we haue founde plesures, by doinge gretter good to them theu we before receiued. To whiche contending to matche or rather excel our benefactours, Chrisippus in like maner exhorteth vs. Sayeng that forasmuch as these Ladyes Charites or Graces (of whom I told you before) are Iupiters dawghters, we ought to accompt it no small offence if we should cōmit any thing that might séeme repugnant to the natures of those fayer damoyselles. But here would I gladly O Chrisippus that thou hadst shewed me the meane and waye howe I might haue become more liberal by shewing fréendship and plesours, and more gratefull to them that for their goodnes and benefites haue well deserued at my handes. How the mindes of the plesurers and those that are plesured ought to contend. Again how they that haue benefited others shoulde tread the remembraunce of those their benefytes vnder

fote, without thīking on them any more, And those who haue receiued the sayde benefites, how they shoulde frame their memory to be allwayes thinking on thē without forgetting. But as for those folish and fantastycall fables which Chrisippus reporteth in his boke so commonly, let vs leaue them to Poetes whose whole drift and meaning is geuen only to please and delight mens eares,Poetes common lyers and flaterers. and to deuise pleasaūt tales. But they that purpose to cure euill disposed mindes, and to conserue faithfulnes & honesty amonge men, and cause them to call to remembrance without forgetting such benefits and plesours as are done vnto them, had néed to order their wordes with good aduisement, to talk ernes

                  NOw therfore likewise as I passed ouer the thinges that were superfluouse, & concerned not our purpose, right so it is requisite & very necessary that I shew the way how wee shall learn to acknowledge the good and plesour that we haue receiued of others. For som one yt hath at time of his néede receiued money at an others hād thīketh that he oweth that or somuch money as he receiued. one other being p
                     •
                  eferred to ye dignitie of a Consull iudgeth he dothe owe ye enioyeng of his Cōsulship to him

by whose meanes he was so preferd. Som other being rewarded with a spiritual promociō supposeth he is to rēdre the same. Other like wyse that by the procurement of some or other haue attayned the rule and gouernement of a Prouince, adscribe the same as dew to that person at whose handes he receiued his saide office. Indéed truthe it is that eche of these who hath receiued any such or lyke thing at an other bodyes hand, is to thinke himself of dewtye bounde, and endetted for the same to them at whose handes or by whose meane they had or receiued any suche benefits or plesours. Howbeit if we will néerely examine the nature of benefites, and lyst to sée what a benefit is, we shall then find that anye those thynges aboue named or anye the lyke of them are not to be called benefites, but onely the signes and shewes of benefits.Wher is the very seate and pla
                        •
                     e of benefits. For no benefyt may be handled with the hand, but hath his seat and abiding place in the minde alone. And there

is great diuersitie betwene the benefyt it self, and the matter or substaunce by which the benefit is represented. Whervpon we must know yt neither siluer, nor gold, nor lād, nor offices, nor fées, nor any thing ells what soeuer our dearest frindes bestow vppon vs ought to haue the names of benefites, sith as I sayde they consist onely and wholly in the minde of the bestower of them. Neuertheles the rude and ignorant people suppose that thinge onely that is séene with the eyes, geuen with the hand, subiect to our senses, and in our possession, to be the benefyt
                     •
                   And asfor the fréendly minde which indéed ought chefely to be had in pryce and regarded, that weigh they nothyng at all. Wherein howmuche they are deceyued, eche one may wel and easyly discerne. For why, those thinges whyche we possesse, whiche we sée, and whi
                     •
                  hewe so gredely hunt after, are very vncertein and transitory. The mutabilitie of fortune, the daunger of the time, the violence

and force of enemyes may quickly bereft and depriue vs of all these things. But the trew benefit still persisteth, and decayeth not,Benefits neuer decay. no though all that perrish and be lost quite that was geuen vs. That onely shoulde be called a benefyt, which no violence, no force, no misfortune is able to vndoe, plucke from vs, or make frustrate. As by way of example. I reskewed a frind of mine from Pyrates and robbers on sea: and when I had deliuered him on this sort and was gone other enemyes toke him and caste him. In prison. In this case, they that so toke him depriued him not of the benefit whiche I did to him, but the vse therof only, Again. I deliuered a nomber of men frō drowning or burning. Of which cōpany sith that time, certain of thē dyed by sicknes, certein of them by other mysfortunes ended their liues. I say yet notwithstandyng the benefit I did to them remaineth stil and decaieth not, no though the parties be dead themselues to whom

it was done. Then appereth it that all those things which falsly abuse thapellacion or name of benefites, ought rather to be called frēdly tournes, or such thinges by which the fréendly mind doth declare it self. The like wherof is to be gathered in other matters, wheras otherwhiles a word is vsed only significatiuely to represēt as it wer ye truth of things, by significatiō or colour of sence, & otherwhiles is vsurped for the thing it self. As you may sée here. The Chefetain of the bād rewardeth such as he hath approued valiāt after the feat wherin he hath experimented his said valiauntnes sōtime with a Chain or collar of gold, otherwhiles with a garland properly appointed for suche as geue the onset at skalynge the walls at any séege,
                     Corona muralis.
                   & otherwhiles wt a garland assigned to him that saueth a Citisens life in warres. Whiche eyther Chain or garland if a wan will consider apart by it self,
                     Corona Ciuita.
                   and not hauynge anye relacion to anye farther thinge, what

great excelēcie or preciousenes cōsisteth in them? What great magnificence or worshyp resteth there I praye you in the Senatours gowne trayling on ye groūd, purfled and embrowdred round about, if we consider it onely in that it is a gown or hath this or that facion? There is no one of these that is the honour it selfe, but the onely signes and shewes of honour. In lyke maner none of those can be sayde a benefit that is discerned with the eye, but are onely mere tokens of benefites.

                  THen mayst thou well demaunde of me what it is that I call a benefit. The trew descripsion whereof admit this to be.The discripsion of a benefyt. A benefyt is a courteouse and frendly deed whyche beyng done geueth cause of reioycing to others, and conceiueth plesure it self in doing the same thing, redy of it self without

constraint to doo that whiche it doth: So that it appereth it maketh no matter what the thing is that is geuen or done: For that (as it is sayd.) The benefit consisteth not in the thyng that is geuen or done, but onely in the minde of the geuer. And that there is a great diuersitie betwene these twayne, thou mayst easely know hereby. The benefyt allwayes is simply and of his owne nature good.The hart al one cō
                     mendeth al things But the thing that is geuen or done, is of it self commonly neyther good nor euill. It is the minde that extolleth and commendeth thynges of small valour, and of no regard, and disgrateth & quyte debaseth other some thinges of estimacion and great price. The thyngs which we séeke and pursew after so ernestlye, are of themselues neyther good nor euill. The diuersitie of their qualities ryseth onely vpon the mindes of them that haue the rule and disposynge of the same: by whyche disposing, they purchace eyther their commendacion or the contrarye.

Then maye we thus conclude. That a benefit is not that thing whiche is geuē with the hand. Lyke as thinges offred vp in sacrifice be thesame neuer so fatte and fayre, or richely adourned with gold and ryche iewelles, yet the diuine honour dothe not rest nor consiteth in anye of the same oblacions, but onely in the well meaninge and disposed myndes of the sacrificers. For the immolations and offringes of godly, deuout, and weldisposed persons God accepteth wel and in good part be the gift neuer so simple. Yea though it were but a courtsye of Corne and that in an earthen vessell, whereas wycked men shall not escape the punyshement of their impiety and the reuenge thereof, no though they offer vp neuer so plentiful and the same riche sacrifices.

                     chyng. and not in the mind of him who geueth the same, then should it also follow, that lok how much greatter in valewe the thynge is that is geuen, so muche gretter shoulde the benefit be to be accompted of. But that is vntrew. For somewhiles wée are more beholdyng, and to thinke our selues depelyer bounde to hym that geueth vs thynges but of small valew, whose goodwill notwithstandynge ought to be more deere to vs and hygher in estimacion then any the greate abundance and ryches of Princes. For admitte that his gift was but simple, his hart yet was magnificent and liberall, in that he regarded not hys owne pouertie, he was so glad he had to serue my greate want presentlye. Wherein he declared

himself not onely to meane well to mewarde, but also to haue an earnest zele and desier in himself to declare & accō
                  plish the same In which his weldoing, he séemeth to take delight, bestowing those his benefits as one not loking or hoping after anye Recompence, more then if he had geuen me no whyt at all. But of his owne accord séeketh to find and take occasion to proffit and plesour me. On thother syde (as I haue sayde before) these thinges are neyther plesant nor acceptable whiche though of themselues they séeme to be of great valew and pryce, yet they are not without great entreaty, and importunate seute and request obtained at the hands of the graūters, or els whiche by chaunce and vnaduisedlye escape them. But farre more thankefully is the litle simple gift to be receiued, geuen with assured goodwill and franckly, then is plenty and affluēce geuen with grutching and repining. For why, in suche case thus may I saye. Truthe it is: that

whiche this man hath geuen me is but a small thing, but wayeng his abilitie, he is muche to be commended, for he gaue it me with a very good wil: and besides, his welthe coulde not extend to geue me any thing of gretter valew. Againe, the present of that other. I confesse was very muche and of great pryce, but with what distrust did he it and longe delaye, and how muche did he repent him after that he had done it? He dyd it for vaine glory onely, and to thend he might triū
                  phe ouer me, and reporte to others howe much he had plesoured me, and in what necessity I stode of his help. So that good cause I haue to perswade myself that he dyd it not for good will, and earnest loue, or affection he bare to me, but to blase abrode his own name and take occasion so to doo at my necessitie. Who that to this end bestoweth his benefytes, I saye he doth not onely deserue notes to be accompted liberall, but rather an euill natured niggard.

                  ANd for profe that smal giftes geuen franckely and of a méere good will deserue gretter commendacion far, then richer and costlier giftes whiche are bestowed with difficulty and euil will, this notable example may make profe abundantlye. Socrates that worthie and famous Philosopher being accustomed to réede publiquely and geue preceptes of good gouernement, had repayring to his sayde Lectour a great and populouse audience. Among whom there were both ryche and poore. It fortuned that his scollers with a common concent on a time concluded among thē
                  selues that eche of them after their habilitie in token of their goodwills towardes their sayde maister, shoulde present him with litle or much, whych they did. Eschines one of the companye in welth farre vnequall to the residew as he that had vtterlye nothynge, and yet in good

wil to gratifye his maister not inferiour to anye the best, when he sawe euerye one of hys companions to geue vnto Socrates their mayster presentes of great Price, came with a mery chere also to Socrates, and sayde. Syr in all thys woorlde haue I nothyng that I may present thee withall. Whereby I acknowledge easely my great pouertie. Howbeit in all this hard extremity, that onely one gift whiche I haue to geue, I make present with. Namely mine owne person. Which simple present I beseche thee accept in so good parte as I nowe wilingly offre thesame to thee, perswading thyself that though my companiōs here haue indéed richely presented thee with giftes, yet hath eche of them left himself farre more in store then he hath here departed withall. Whereas I haue geuen thee all without reseruynge to myself anye whytte at all. To whome Socrates as thankefully aunswerynge sayd. And why? Thinkest thou not that

thou haste also geuen to me a great present? Unlesse thou makest none accōp
                     •
                   of thyself being in state as thou now art, wherfore assure thyself that I will restore thée to thyself farre bettered then I now receiued thée. Loe by this gift allmoste of no vallew, did Eschines farre surmount the bountifull hart of Alcibiades who was no lesse gentle and courteouse then welthye. And in Socrates iudgement passed the largesse and munificence of all his yong companions.

                  HEreby may you well sée that a noble minde is able to find out matter whereby he may declare his liberalitie, euen in the extremitie and narowest straytes of al his pouertie. In which case Aeschines (me semeth) might wel haue sayd thus. A hard and cruell Fortune. Yet hast thou gained nothing herby that thou haste made me thus poore.

For though I haue nothynge of thyne wherwith I may worthely or at all present my maister, I will not yet let to doo my dewty, but I will now doo it of mine own. And yet should noman thinke that he accompted nothing of himself for that he presented so himself (as is sayd,) For hereby the wytty yong man found occasion to bind Socrates to him after a sort. So that (to retourne againe to our purpose) it appereth that it is not the excellencie or valew of the gyft whyche is to be regarded, but the hart with whyche it is geuen and the order of the doing therof. The hawty and curious Courtiars who are in office,

And yet of a far worse

nature iudge I him to be, that with opprobriouse and crewell woordes, with a churlish and frowninge countenaunce vttred after a dispytefull sorte, displayeth what he hath done for this man or that. For therehens commeth it that although we see the poore outwardely make a face and shewe of goodwill towarde the Riche, yet inwardly they hat

                   them in theyr hartes to the death. And that altogether for their fortune. And yet diuers there are of them that hate one an other for doynge some thynges whyche they that reprehende them perhaps woulde doo, if they were in lyke power and authoritie. Few there are but emproue their Landes to thuttermost to maigntaine their owne auarice. They regard nothing but despice othermennes pouertie, and séeke to the vttermost all ye meanes they can how to shonne it themselues, fearryng nothyng ells but fallyng into penurye. For redresse and preuenting wherof, they cesse not to

molest their vnderlings and inferiours, oppressynge theyr poore tenauntes, allwayes vexing them that are not able to make resistaunce, and kepynge them downe still with might and mayn. And yet what can a man well saye agaynste some such pilling of prouinces and makynge the vttermost of suche offyces as thou hast thyself payed derelye for, seyng that the Cōmon Law among men whiche proce

And now are these thinges rooted so, and settled as it were in this state, that lykely they are so to continew and hold on stil, onely now and then perhaps they may chaunce to be tossed to and fro a lytle, lyke the waues of the sea: which when they haue for a season, bene still and quyet with in the shore, if there happen to ryse a sodaine flaw or a sharp pyrry of winde, streight way they woorke aloft and tosse vp and downe for the time. So may it chaūce to fare with these euill condicions of men.

For as the times doo alter and channge, right so follow they. Somewhile shal ye sée Daliaunce and bodily plesure beare chefest sway: eftsones againe vnmeasurable festing, ryotous banqueting, and superfluous féeding shall playe his part. Sone after shall all they be exiled forth of place, & then none shal rule but sumptuous apparelling and trimming the bodie with costly arraye. And more then effeminat painting and prankyng the visage, the most certaine argument of the fowlenes & deformity of the minde with wastful profusion and spending of large patrimonyes and ample enheritaunces. Again before a man would almost think it coulde be so, all these vices are quyte shut vp as if they had not bene, and Tiranny onely taketh place, then fall they to Ciuill warres, whereby all holy thinges are prophaned, Lawes and good order quite extinguished, goodnes and god lines wholly abolished. Dronkēnes for a time beareth the bel. And it shalbe déemed

a vertew in him that shall beare most drinke. So that a man may sée, that vices neyther continew allwayes in one staye: but as they are altogether deuoyd of stedfastnes, and at variaunce amonge themselues, so they force one to geue an other place. So that wée maye well pronounce of our selues to our g

For why, there shall not fayle to be among vs from time to time, manquellars, tyrantes, theues, adulterers, encrochers of other mens goodes, committers of sacriledge, & traytours aswel hereafter, as heretofore, and at this present. And yet Ingratitude ought no lesse to be detested then any the vyces that I haue named before:Ingratitude the ro

Wherfore, eche one shunne & flee it as ye horriblest vice that may happen to anye man. And yet if it be thy fortune to byt vpon any that sheweth the Ingratitude:Ingratitude the greattest vyce that may be done, and ye lightest that may be suffered. forgett and forgeue it stil, as the lightest fault that thou mayst finde among all others.

And yet he to whom thou didest it, can not accuse thée that thou pleasouredst him not, which is the commendablest thing that maye be, and deserueth most prayse. For as we should diligently in plesouring of al men, especially haue regard to doo it to them that we iudge will proue thankfull and acknowledge it wilinglye again, so ought we not to make restraint of benefitinge those whom alredy we knowe precisely they wil proue vnthankfull: and that by profe had of them in times past.

And asfor him that I know worthie to he plesoured by me, I may in no case refuse or lingar to do it, were it so that I should spend my bloude and aduenture my lyfe for him. And asfore him that I know assuredly vnworthy to whō I shoulde doo any plesour, yet if I saw him in daunger of théeues,The perfit trial of a liberall hart. and that by my outcrye I might saue him & deliuer him from them, I may not stick to crye as lowed as possiblye I can for his suche safegarde.

                  The maner how mē shold do their benefites
                  NOw followeth it that wee shew what those benefites be that we should doo the one to the other, and howe we should doo thē. First of all the thinges which we ought to geue, should be suche as be necessary to him to

whome we geue them. Secondly they should be profitable, Thirdly acceptable and suche chieflye as are of longest continuaunce. It behoueth then that wee begine with those thinges that are necessarye. Whiche are deuided into two sortes, vnder thone of which, are conteined those thinges whiche conserue mās lyfe. Under thother, are included those thinges whiche doo well gouerne thesame and cause it to be of long durance. For among men ye shall finde some that will wake but small accompt of the recept of suche benefits as are transitorye and of no continuaunce,One as euil as an ingrate person. and others some shall ye finde whiche disdaine to receiue any benefitte at an other bodyes hande: sayeng.

Farther it is to be vnderstode that emonge the necessarye plesours whyche men maye do the one to the other, there be certaine degrees, of whyche some are principall as those without whyche we can not liue: some next them and second as it wer, as those without whiche we can not lyue well: and other some thirde, as those without whiche we wil not liue. Of the first sort are these. To be deliuered from the handes of our enemyes, frō the fierce crueltye of Tirantes, to be saued from exile, and sentence of losse of goodes and Landes,Causes why benefyts seme the gretter. and other such lyke daungers, whiche as they are indeed verye great, so is our lyfe on eche syde assaulted with thesame.

thei are so dispatched from thesame. For why, the great feare whyche they were in, shall make the benefytte when they fynde it, séeme to them muche the gretter. In whyche behalfe, we may if the cause will conuenientlye beare it without damage or detriment to be susteined by the partye so endaungered, some what delay the spéedy doing of the plesour to thend thapparant shew of the daunger, maye cause hym bothe to accompt better, and beare in mynde the longar, the benefyt when it is shewed. The benefits which occupie the second place and degrée, are those without whiche we maye after a sort liue, but yet so, that we were better dead then lyuinge in suche maner. As to be barred of liberty, to be depriued of good name and fame, to lose a mans sences & wittes, and others suche lyke. In whiche degre may be nōbred also al such thyngs as by affinity of bloud, by vse or lōg custome do becom dere to vs, as our frīdes, our wiues, our

To thys ende that by the continuaunce of the thynge geuen, the memorye of the geuer maye also remayne so ryfe, that wée shall not néede our selues to vpbrayde them therewith again, to who
                     •
                   we haue done any suche benefites: For better it were that the gyft it selfe should reuiue the remembraunce thereof, when haplye it doith decay, then the geuer by reportynge it hymselfe, shoulde disgrace hys sayde gyft. And asfor me yf I were to geue goodes, rather woulde I chose to geue it Bullion or plate, then Coyne. Soner woulde I geue costely Images and Pictures of woode or stone, then a gowne or other

garment of smal continuaunce & lasting, whiche quickly fadeth with the time. For there are a nomber of people who remember the gyft of any thing no longar while, then the vse and occupacion of the same endureth. For whyche cause I would not if I might chose, geue suche a thynge that should passe ouer so lyghtly and come to nothyng, but would doo it by suche thynges as by the same still remayning before their eyes the remembraunce of the plesour they founde by my meanes, they might continew fixed and rooted (as it were) in the hart of them to whom I dyd suche plesour. For as there is noman I gesse so voyd of vnderstandyng, and depriued of his sences, that would geue light and thin sommer gownes in cold wynter, or thicke furred gownes for sommer, So doth it behoue in employeng of benefites and fréendly plesours to way diligētly both the time, the place, the nature and qualities of the person. For certaine it is that there are

some times, yea and some minutes and instantes of time, in which some things are plesaunt and acceptable, which selfe same thynges at some other season, are asmuche displeasaunt and vncommendable. Who séeth not what great diuersitie there is betwene these twain. To geue the thing that no man ells hath at that time, and to geue that wherof then presentlye eche man hath abundauntly. Againe to geue that whiche a man hath long sought after and could not fynd,
                     Thyngs rare most acceptable.

Thus maye you sée he was alltogether addicted to pursew honour whereof notwithstanding he knew neyther the trew waye nor meane to attaine there to, but followed thexample of Bacchus, whose minde was so houen vp with pride, that he was some way matcht with Hercules, that forthwith he thought he should reche the heauens and there ioyne with Hercules also, as he did at Corinth.Uery mā

plesour then he would do to his enemye or the most dishonest parsō of the world. For to what ende dyd he shewe me the frendlines whiche he dyd, but onely to serue his owne turne? That thing therfore whiche thou geuest, and wouldest haue takē in good part and well thought of, let it in no wise be such as thou doest commonlye and to many. And yet would I not that anye man shoulde thinke I spéeke these thynges as though I would make anye restraint of liberalitie. But yet must it be so done, that it may séeme to keepe the ryght waye, and that it purchace not reproche to the geuer. It is lawfull to geue euery where. And yet who that receyueth a benefitte in the open face and presence of a multitude, ought not therefore to déeme lesse well of the gift as though the presens of the others were any whyt a disgracinge to it. Agayne, it doth behoue eche manne to haue a good perswasion with himselfe,

and to thinke that although others be benefited aswell as he, and that at hys handes who benefited hym, yet that he dyd it with a better will to hym then to the reste. As thus I confesse I haue receyued but the lyke benefytte or plesour that thys other hath done, howbeit it came to hys owne mocion that whiche he dyd to me and without anye request of myne. He shewed suche one the lyke plesour as he dyd to me, but yet he dyd it quickely to me and without delaye, whereas that other had it not with out desert, and that of longe time to. Manye bestow sondry thynges to seueral parsons, and yet not to eche man after one sort Fort to some it is done vpon lyght request, and to

might bestow their plesours, easely perswaded them to doo it there where they did. But who that would haue his benefites and the plesures whyche he is to doo to diuers, acceptable and wel accōpted of by eche of thē, must fynd the meanes how to deserue a lyke well of them all, and to cause that eche of them in his owne perswasion maye thynke himself preferd and estéemed aboue the residew. I would be loth to seme to hinder the benefites and plesures that anye man is minded to doo what soeuer they are. But this wote you wel that how much greatter and magnificent the benefites are, so muche the greatter honour and commendacion shall they purchace to them that doo thesame. And yet must a man vse discrecion in geuing. For benefites whych are done rashly and without consideracion,Regarde to be had in bene

yf any one there be that for that thinketh that I prescribe boundes and limites to Liberalitie and restraine the same, & not to augment and, encrese it rather, verelye he dothe not vnderstande these my preceptes aryght. For what vertew I besech you should we haue in gretter price then this? Or to what vertew should we parswade people vnto, rather then vnto this, whiche continueth and lynketh together the society of mankynde?

But in myne opinion a manne should not make anye greate accompte of the benefitte that suche one dothe to hym, whose iudgement is but of small regarde. Why then maye you saye Shoulde not a manne accepte the benefitte that Claudius geueth? Yes verelye that shall he doo. But yet he shall waye of it as of a thynge commynge by chaunce onelye, which a thou wottest well is lyghtlye variable frome good to euill. What meaneth it then that wée ioyne these thynges in suche order that the one of them maye not séeme to be parfit without that other? It is assuredlye for this cause. There canne not be any thynge ryghtlye sayde to bée a benefitte, that wanteth the better parte whyche yt shoulde haue. (That is to saye) iudgegemente and discrecion.
               
                  And therof it foloweth that if anye man haue geuen thee a great somme of money and hath not done it with good will and as a benefyt should be done, it is nomore to be accounted for a benefit, then if by chaunce or good fortune of thine, thou shouldst happen to finde anye treasure. So that it appereth that we must yet receiue some thynges when they are proffred vs, for whiche not withstanding we are not any whit to thinke our selues to rest endetted.

No neuer adeale.

For painful is the lōg wayting euen for good thinges. And forasmuch as by sondry benefits & plesours are holpen and redressed sondrye grefes and harmes, He that causeth any man to be long vexed and greued whom he may ease quicklye, or hindreth his attayning to a benefit whom it lyeth in him to farther, séemeth in that, to lay violent handes on him and for that time to conspire his death (as it were) Take this for certeintie.Courtesy seketh quickly to plesour. Courtesie alwaye hasteth to doo that whiche it can doo: and it is the property

of him that willingly doth any plesour, to doo it without delaye. Who so shewed plesour and stayed but one daye to do it, dowtles neuer did it willingly, if he might aswell haue done it afore. Whereby he lost two woorthie and precious thinges. The time, and the showe of frindly good will.

Of which kynd are those rewardes that are geuen for feates acheued by Cheualrye, & suche like dignities & promociōs, which are bewtified & more commended when a multitude knoweth of thē. And these thinges wherin consisteth neyther renowme nor estimacion, but be onelye easers of néede and pouertie, and sauers of honestie, those I say are to be geuē secretely, that they may be knowen onely to those to whom they are avayleable. And yet in some cases we should beguiel him whō we helpe, that though he haue that that doth serue hys néede, yet he should not know at whose bandes he receiued the same at that present, nor yet from whens it came.

                  nce. But when I haue thus benefited him priuilie, I will not there cesse, I will doo him sondrie other plesures besides. I will doo manye moe thinges for him whereby he may gather that it was I that did him that other plesour also tofore. And yet though perhaps he neuer know that he had that benefit through me, I shall notwithstandyng be sewer myself that I gaue it. But thou mayst say perhaps. That is but a simple reward. Truthe it is if thou didest it to haue gaine therby, and to reape recompense. But if thou hast as thou shouldest haue, respect to this point onelye, that

that which thou geuest may plesour him to whom thou geuest it, thou geue it frée lie without any suche regard takynge. Let it suffice thee, that thy self art preuy to the gift, for els thou shouldest not séeme to take delight in weldoing, but that thy desier were to be seene to doo well. Thou art not yet satisfied perhaps, but wilt stil saye I will néedes haue hym know it. Then tell me this. Whether thou wouldest he should thinke himself beholding to thée or no? Still thou sayes

What if it be more profitable, if it be more honest, if it be more acceptable for him that is pleasoured, not to haue it knowen? Wilt thou not then chaunge thie minde? But all this notwithstanding thou wilt say he shall néedes know that he had the pleasour at thy handes. I sée wel then thou wilt not suffer hym to continew in ignoraunce and darknes. In verye deed I graunt that so often as

the matter shall permit, the geuer maye if he plese take plesour of the acknowledging receiuer. Howbeit if it lie hym vppon that we helpe him, and agayne that it will turue him to reproche if our plesouring him shold be knowen abrod, in this case I would not that that benefit should be Chronicled. Thou wilt yet perhaps say. And wherfore should I not doo him to vnderstand that it was I that plesoured him? What though thys be one of the most principal preceptes to be obserued in bestowing of benefites that I shoulde not vpbrayde the same and cast hym in the tethe with it to whome I dyd it, maye I not for that shewe hym that it was I that plesoured him?

When wilt thou suffer me to forget my miserie and state vnfortunat? It might haue sufficed thée, and ouer much had it bene, to haue led me about the Citie onely ones in a triumphe on thys wyse, to shew what thou hadst done for me. Hereby it appereth that we shoulde

For who that reciteth to him whom he hath plesoured what plesour he hath done for him, in that self same act séemeth to demaunde his plesour againe. We ought not by any talke séeme to put him in minde of our passed benefits done but if perhaps we thinke that obliuion hath crope in his minde, let vs doo him an other plesour. That by the recept therof, he may call to memorye the former also. But in anye wyse we must be ware that we make no report to others, of that that we haue done. He that doth any plesour to any other, let hīself kéepe scilēce, and referre it wholly to the reporting of him that receiued it. To him that reporteth what he hath done for this man and that, it were well aunswered as it was to one that had neuer done with publisshing the plesour whyche he had shewed here and there. Wherupon one demaū
                  ded the cause whye he had not made an end of reportinge his benefites syth he

had bene so sufficiently recompenced for the same. When he denyed that euer he had anye recompense for anye of them and demaunded the place where. Mary quod that other in euerye suche place where thou madest anye report of them by thine owne talke. So that you may sée a manne ought not to reporte hys owne good desertes and vsurpe the office of an other. Anye other with more honestie may playe that part, whose report shall purchace thée commendaciō wheras thiue owne mouthe shall procure thée sklaunder and rebuke. In hearyng report made what henefites thou haste bestowed, thou must be so chary for incurrynge the daunger of vaine glorie, that were it so that others shoulde recite to thée, what benefites thou hast bestowed, thou muste aunswere that he whome th

                  w haste so benefyted, in thye iudgement was woorthye of more ample benefites then thy power accordyng to thy will and his desertes would permit thée

to matche. Neyther muste thys refusall of prayse be done colourablie, and after a dissemblynge sorte, as some doo who woulde séeme to refuse thankes when indéed they moste desier them. Moreouer those whome thou doist benefitte, thou must vse courteouselie, with vnfained fréendlines. The husbandemanne vndowtedly were in daunger to lose bothe his séede and labour if he shoulde geue ouer paines takyng so sone as he hathe made an ende of sowing. A great deale more diligence is requyred before it com to be ripe Corne after that the séede is cast into the grounde: So that if he hope to haue the frute of his traueile and labour, he must with equall diligent paine passe eche point from the firste vnto the last. Ryght so muste we deale with our benefits. Can there be any getter benefites think you thē those that ye parents can afforde to bestow vpō their Childrē? And yet shold they quit lose the thanks &

prayse precedent, if streight way in their infancie they should neglect and forsake their sayd Children, and not nourish thē vp accordinglye. So is it with all other benefits. Whiche except thou persist to maintain and make perfit thou losest al. It is but a verye small matter to haue plesoured any one, except thou continew on still in that minde. If thou desier that they whom thou plesourest should think themselues bounde to thée, vse them so that they maye thynke thou louest them still. And especiallye beware vsing anye taunting or checkyng talk that may greue them to here.

deserueth of it self sufficientlye to haue commendacion? The matters themselues shall declare our actes abundantly, yea though we say neuer a woorde: It is not only a thankles benefit, but to be abhorred also, which is skornefully geuen.

He made but small accompt of this, that so noble and aunciēt a man hauing borne so high dignity and office in ye weale publique, debased himself so much as to humble himself to him vpon the ground in the presence of suche an assemblie of so many great personages and men of honor, in such sorte that vāquished enemies to get grace at their Conquerous handes could not doo more. What séemed he to doo hereby, but to tread as it were dispitefully ye weale publique vnder his féet? But some will say that the kyssing of his left foot could auaile but litle to the vndoyng the state of the weale publique. Uery truth but he

shrewdly shewed his welmening mind. Ouermuche had it bene reproche to him to haue delt with so worthye a man as Pompée was in geuing sentence in such sort as he did vpō him, though after such skornefull wise he had not forced him to kysse his foot.

But so sone as that heat beginneth to slake, when that burnynge desier whiche erst vanquished discrecion is some what quaild, we our selues then dislike and detest the counsailours and fortherers of those euilles. For as wée should not geue colde water to him that is in the fyt of a shakyng agewe, nor we: pon to hym that is besides his wittes, no more ought we to graunt the request of euerye one by and by that humblie, ernestly, with compassion and pytye desireth some thinges of vs? For Reason would that we shold take as good regard to thend as to the beginninges of suche plesours as we are to doo: and that wée should geue such thinges wherby a man may take plesour not onely when he receiueth them, but afterwarde also. But some one will saye to himself perhapes,

well. I know that that whiche suche one desireth of me shall not aduauntage nor plesour him, but hurte and hindar him & yet what should I doo? He requesteth it of me so earnestly that I maye not saye him nay. Let him sée to his owne safegarde, he shall not haue cause to blame me. This opinion is verye fals, yes marye shall he haue cause to blame thee, and that woorthelie. For when he shall be better aduised on the matter, and that the hoat fit of his shalbe qualified, whye shoulde he not hate hym that in his time of follye forthred him to catche his bane? To geue the assent to harme one, is crewell pytye. And as it is a verye charitable acte to saue them that through follies rage woulde without naye mischeue and destroye and vndoe themselues, so is it to graunt hurtful thyngs to eche manne for the askynge, as sygne apparaunt of pitiefull crueltie. Let vs endeuoure to geue suche thynges that the longar they are enioyed and kepte

the more plesaunt and profitable they maye appere to be, and neuer fayle of their goodnes. My money will I not geue to an adulterer, for that I woulde not séeme to be a fortherer of his wickednes. But if I know preciselye suche follye to haue place in him, I will what I maye disswade him from it. Neither woulde I geue it to a common quarreller nor one that hath no staye nor gouernement of himself, for feare that an other daye he saye Suche one by louing me ouermuch and to tenderlye vndid me.

                   Suche shifting of men is verie dishonest For by this meanes he ridde hymselfe from geuing any thing at all. In the asking of a penye he regarded the honour of his owne astate, in the demaundynge of a Talent he respected the simple condicion and degrée of Diogenes: though he myght wellenough for hys habilitie haue geuen both the peny as a méet gift agreable with the pouerty of Diogenes and the Talent also as a gyft age fittinge with the magnificence of a kynge to geue. And though that one sounded somewhat more in valew thē that Diogenes symple astate myghte well demaund, that other notwithstandyng that it was verie small yet was it séemelye

enough in dew place, and time for hym to geue. If any one therebe now will say that indéed Diogenes ought not to demaunde so great a somme, I wil also assent thereunto. For to saye the truthe it is not méete that any suche one shoulde request money whiche is himself an open despiser of the same. And if he professe that he quite contemneth money, it shall behoue him altogether to declare hymself to perseuer in that minde, and to playe the part of Cinicus thoroughlye, and not to haue a desyer to be riche and yet to colour it vnder a cloke of voluntarye pouertye. But retourne we to our present matter in hand. Who that is to geue any gyft, ought to take as good regard to his own person, as to his to whō he geueth it, and both alyke.

so to doo through the defaulte of thone of the players. But then the bal kéepeth his corse trimliest, when with lyke indifferēcie of both Partes it is cast and tossed from that one 
                     •
                  o that other, and is not suffred to fall to the grounde. In whyche behalf, the conninge player will take good regard not to cast it at all times a like, with the lyke strength, but will be sewer to moderate or encrease the same according to the nigh standing or farre of beyng of his companion. The whiche consideracion is to be had in bestowing of benefites. For vnlesse they be fytlye applied to the persons both of the geuer & Receyuer, questionles they shal neyther depart from the geuer, nor come to him whom they are ment vnto, dewly and as they ought to doo. And yet farther respect is also to be had herein. For lyke as if we are to playe with one well practised at Tennys, howsoeuer we hap to strike allmost, yet he for hys execcise and practise, if any fault happen in our

playe, with his quiuernes and redines can well hide it and saue it from beinge openly espied by them that stande by. But if we haue to deale therin with one that is mere vnskilful and voyd of knowledge, then behoueth it vs to be the more circumspect, and with our playe whyche must be vsed with great obseruaunce & moderacion, direct and gouerne his play, and (as it were) take on vs both the part of the stryker fourth and sender backe againe. If he stand far of, to playe euen in his bosome, and if he strike short, to pain our selues to runne and méete it as it commeth. And so must we doo in bestowing of benefits. At first we must instruct and teache them how they must doo, and thinke it enough if we perceaue that thei will endeuour, applie, and declare themselues willing to doo as we teache thē. But indéed to saie the truthe we our selues for the most part that doo plesours,Ingratitude oft growth by vs. are the causers that there be so many ingrate and vnthankefull people as there

are, and cause them so to continew. For when we haue ones done suche a pleasour as is indéed of great valewe, and more a great deale then he to whom it is done is able to make recompence for, or to rendre the lyke, we should deale as do these crafty gamesters that gladly wold get and traine into playe some symple bodye to cosin him (as they say). Whych deuise of theirs that they may the easelier bring to passe, they affirme constātlie that they are as vnskillfull in playe as possible is for anye to be. And when they haue ones by litle and litle trayned him in, to make and as the prouerbe is, then to encourage him to playe frankelie, they lette him at the first draw good handes on them to geue him a stomacke to holde on, whiche dowtles the simple manne coulde neuer doo if they shoulde playe their best, neyther woulde that sellye soule except he were verye singlie soulde, venter his money emong them were it not that they with their owne

losses for the time tolle him forward vntill he haue with exercise and through practise got him a bold stomacke. But there are a nomber nowe a dayes that when they haue ones done a plesour to a manne, they had rather lose altogether and cause him whome they haue benefited to become m

To whyche question to aunswere brieflye, know you that we shoulde chiefely wish to receiue them at their handes, to whō we to fore haue done the lyke.

And againe it is a ioyful thing and right plesaunt to receiue plesour at his handes whō thou nowe louest, although he haue harmed thée sometime before. Again there is no one thing so displeasaunt or that greueth an honest nature somuche, as of force to be compelled to loue or owe dewtye to him whome by no meanes he can abyde. Howbeit I muste still put you in minde that I speake not these thinges ne geue these preceptes to sober wise men who delyght in nothyng but that whyche is reasonable,To whō these precepts are geuen. and brydell their affections with the raynes of equitie prescribyng to themselues Lawes and good orders, and follow them when they haue so done, but I geue these precept

And to be plaine with far more diligence and héed takyng should we séeke out him by whom we woulde be plesoured, then we would do any one to borow money of. For to him tha

Which whē I haue deliuered & paid I am for that discharged, and on clere bourd with him. But to him at whose handes I haue receiued a benefit, I can not be so excused. I owe to him far more then I receiued. For when I haue repaied that or asmuche as he gaue to me,

yet are we bound to be Frindes assured the one to the other, and so to continew. And when I haue rendred, to him asmuche as I haue receiued, then muste I streight waye begine afresh againe. To whiche coniunction the Lawe of trewe fréendship and amitie would not that we should admit any one that is vnworthie. Suche I saye and so strayt is the sacred Lawe of benefites, from whense, and by whose meanes procedeth loue betwene man and man, and is thereby establisht and confirmed. I may not yet allwayes (will some chaunce to saye) refuse a plesour that is offred. For somewhiles I maye be constrayned to accept it whether I will or not. As admitte that a crewe

stil perseuereth in his Piracie or robbery will offer to doo me any passynge great pleasure, what will you aduise me to doo in thys case? wel I knowe that none of all these is suche that I maye well thinke myself bounde to anye of them for anye plesour they shall happe to shewe me.

That maketh no matter. For it recketh not what ye thyng be that is geuen, except it be done by one that is minded to doo it, and that to him that is minded to receiue it. Though suche one hap to saue a mans lyfe, he deserueth not therefore to be called a preseruer of lyfe. The strongest poyson that is somewhile serueth in better steade then the holesomest medicine that is, & yet is it not nombred amōg the holsome thinges that are commenly to be eaten. Wherby it appereth that diuers things there be that be good and profitable to be receiued at some time, and yet he that receiueth them hath not to thinke himself any whyt bound for the recept therof.

Nowe it chaunced so that the blow did light vpō a great swelling whiche the sayd Tiraunt had vpon his bodye, whiche was growen so perillouse that al the expertest Phisicians he had, durste not vndertake to cure it and warrant his lyfe. And yet by the chaunce that he was cut so in that place, the corruption that there was longe gathered and festred purged so, that in short while he recouered his parfytte helthe of that place by meane of that blow, whom all hys most practysed Phisicians had before geuen vp, as past al recure. And yet dyd not the Tirant yéeld him any thankes for that by his cuttinge him he was restored to his helthe, neyther dyd he deserue

any. So you may perceiue hereby that a man may somtimes doo that acte to an other that maye be great proffet to him and turne to his great good, and yet not allwayes to be accompted of, as of a benefit. Except it doo procéed of a méere good will from the very first beginning, it is not to be called a benefit. For plesour that proueth so but by happe hazard and chaunce medely, is rather to be déemed an iniurye well prouing, then a benefit well mente. There was on a time (as the vsage was oft in Rome) in the Theatre (a place apointed for people to stande vppon and beholde the spectacles and shewes,) diuers men that had sentence of death past on them put, and cert
                     •

condemned men there was one brought who before time had the keping of a certeine great Lyon, whiche beast also as it fortuned was brought in place and put in among the other beastes vnto the cō
                  demned men standing at their defence. And when the Lyon had a while romed him about the place in his stately pace vewing and notyng eche one that stode in his daunger, forthermore he remēbred him that sōmetime had bene his keper and maister: and therwithall soudainlye caste himself betwene him and thother crewell bestes and defended him against all their assaultes. And what thynke you of this helpyng? Was not this suppose you woorthy to be called a benefit? No verelye. For neyther of these that I haue tolde you of, dyd that whiche they dyd, for thys that they mynded at the fyrst beginninge it should proue so wel, or for that they ment it shoulde woorke anye plesour to them to whom they dyd it. So that in thys respect you may

                  o slea the Tiraunt together. Both he and the Liō were causers of sauing of lyfe, and yet neyther that one nor that other could be sayd to doo any benefyt. A man is not to be sayd to receiue any thyng as a benefit whiche is so forced vpon him that he can not refuse it. Neyther is he to be said to owe plesour to him to whome willingly he would not be beholdynge. If thou minde to plesour me, let me first be at frée libertye to chose whether I will accept or refuse thine offer at my plesure & then if I will accept it, doo thy plesour.

after what order it was handled, I will not here reporte. Trulye in myne opinion although he were in all other thynges a verye notable man and great praise worthie, yet in this point he ouershotte himselfe muche, and no whyt folowed the doctrine and precepts of the Stoiques iu that he séemed to dislyke & sought to destroy the name and a s

But sée how muche he forgat bothe the natural course of things, and the fortune of his owne cōtrey also: persuading himself that if it were so that Cesar wer ones dispacht out of the waye, who gaue this firste attempt to reduce the weale publique of Rome to be a Monarche, the matter had bene safe enowgh for euer after any other assayeng it againe. And yet knewe he well enowgh that before time after that a nomber of the Romaine kynges had bene slaine some by sworde, some by thonder and lightninge downe from heauen, there succeded yet after them, Tarquinius one farre woorse then anye of them that were gone. But to

come againe to our matter in hande. Whether Brutus was woorthie of his life or not. Uerely I iudge he was woorthy to haue his lyfe pardoned him at Cesars hande, but yet that Cesar had not to accompt of him ne to call him Father as the guyse was there to name the Senatours.

intent is. For how muche a benefitte or plesure done by any one doth more plese and content the fantasie of him to whom it is done, so muche the more ought he who receiueth the same, to publyshe and spred the respect therof abrode, to the cō

Some there are that be content to render thanks for the plesour that hath bene shewed them, by stelthe as it were, and in a corner priuely. But indéed that procedeth not of bashfulnes, but is rather to be iudged a flat denyall of that they haue receiued. He is well worthie to be déemed an vnthankfull man that acknowledgeth the benefitte he hath receiued and rendreth thankes for the same then onely when no man is present. Some in no wise wil haue anye witnesses present when they are to be plesoured that myght testifye the geuing and recept therof, nor will

geue any writing of their hand to record it. Whereby they declare their desier plainly to be, that the benefit or plesour that is done to them, may be kept as secret as may be. They would not haue it publisht openly, to thend they may vaūt that they got suche office, dignitie, preferment, or welthe, rather by their owne wyt and pollicie, then by the meane and liberalitie of any other man. And commonlye suche menne as these, shew thē
                  selues most slacke and negligent of all others in acknowledging and requiting the dewty whiche of ryght maye be demaunded well at their handes by them to whom they owe both that good a state of their life, and their attainement to honour. And thus while they refuse to acknowledge that whiche they haue receiued, and render that dewtie which is incident thereto, they throwe themselues hedlong into a merueilous daūger. Namelie to deserue the name of Ingratitude and vnthankfulnes.

Some againe for anye benefit done vnto them will scantlie or but a litle moue their lyppes to ye geuer: whiche is yet far worse and sauoreth muche more of Ingratitude, then if they had altogether held their peace and sayd neuer a worde.

                      to vs. and to perswade our selues that none standeth so highly in the fauour or grace of him that hath plesoured vs as we our selues? As to saye: vndowtedly I had had a far gretter benefit at his handes then this, sauing that in verie déed he might not thē commodiously doo it, for he had more to plesour after the same maner besids me. Well this was the first and it is a good beginning. Let me take this in good part, it shall encourage him to doo the better

by me an other time, when he seeth me take so simple a thinge so gratefullye. Thoughe it be but litle he dyd nowe, well he will doo it the ofterner. What though he pleasoured suche one before me, dyd he not preferre me also before a nomber of others? I graunt that neyther hee, nor he, were to be compared with me in no degree, and yet why shold not he vse his benefits as was his owne plesour? What though my parentage be better then anye of theirs that were preferd before me, yet muste I néedes graunt in that he shewed me any pleasonr at al, he did more then he owed me. He extended hys liberalitie more largelye vppon varlettes then he dyd vppon me, and what maketh that anye matter? you may sée how like herself vncerteinly and vnequallye fortune doth sometime deale. Doo you not se how naughty people are aduaūced to honors & wallow in welth, and far honester then they are do wāt? To trew it is, & yet not to be stuck at.

Doo wée not also sée that goodmens corne is striken with blightes and blasting, & yet euill mens corne scapeth cléere? As eche man hath his seuerall hap and fortune in other worldly matters, so hath he also in finding frendshyp. But to conclude, there is no benefitte done so thoroughlie nor effectuallie, but the naughtie and peruerse natures of men can quarell against it. And againe there is no plesure so small or simple, but an honest naturd receiuer therof, cā enlarge it and make it séeme great & ample. There shal neuer doutles want cause of complaint, so long as a man wil misconster the maner of doing of benefites, and interprete them to the woorst.

And though some of these qualities are not possible by course of nature to agrée in anye one bodye together, as consistyng in maner of contrarieties, yet blush not they to say

that it is a great iniurye done to mans nature, that he being superiour to al thinges created, should want the exact perfection of diuers suche qualities whereby his inferiours excel him. Affirming moreouer that manne was muche wronged that he had not in his birth and with his first being parfit helth, inuincible strēgth and fore knowledge of thinges to come graunted, Yea they haue caught the byt of Reason so fast betwene their tethe of follie, and waxe so hedstrong that they runne gadding so far, that vnneth they can be stayed from enuienge that their nature is suche as it is, and not equall with God himself. But if we weighed and considered thynges aright, howe muche more méete were it for vs and agreable with our estate, to direct the sight of our mind to behold and dewlye consider the miraculous forme and order of those thynges? to rendre thankes for so many & sondrie benefits bestowed vpon vs, for that we haue our being here

                  SOme wil perhap saye that whosoeuer receiueth a benefit,That it behoueth to requite a benefit that is done. though he receyue it neuer so thākfully, yet hath he not done somuch as is to be required at his handes, for that he is yet to make recompence for the same besyde. For lyke as in tossing of the ball, it is somewhat prayse woorthie to receyue the ball skillfully and conningly when it is tost to him: but yet he is not to be called an expert and parfect player except he stryke the ball backe againe as finely and redely. This example is somewhat vnlike to our nowe proposed talke, although before it serued our propose fitlye enowgh when we talked of benefits generallie but nowe we haue strayted that kynde of talkyng of that generalitie

and are come néerer home, to consider how they doo consist in the minde. The commendacion of this plaie consisteth in the nimble and quicke mouing of the bodye and not at all in the mind. And there all muste néedes be exponed and layd to the vewe wher the eyes are to geue iudgement, whyche can geue sentence no farther then they are led by seinge. And yet (to aunswere this obiected argumēt.) Nothynge letteth but that a man maye haue skill enowgh for owght wee sée as yet in his playe although he cast not the ball backe againe whych his fellow tost to hym before. For it may be that the fault is not in him whye he doth not so. Yet if he will obiect againe, that admitting he hath parfitte skill, and that as he receyued the ball conninglye, so he canne smyte it backe as Artificialiye, yet is not hys playe parfecte, so longe as he doyth but onely receyue. Whereas the perfection of it consysteth as well in that one poynt as in that

other. I mean in obseruing and kepyng his tourne as duly to tosse backe to hys fellow, as to receiue the ball when it is to
                     •
                  t to him from his fellow. But I will staye no longar vpon refelling these argumentes. Let vs admit it to be so that there is indéed some defect in the playe but no want of skill in the player. And so is it in the matter we talke of. There wanteth indéed somewhat to the perfection of the thinge that is to be geuen againe, but there is no want in the minde from whense the said gift should procéed.

                  SUche one hath done me a plesour wel: I receiue it as thākfully as he ment it to me frēdlye. In this very one thing he hath ye thing that he onely desired: that was that I should be thankfull. When he hath fownd this, yet resteth ther that he should vse me besides, and wherein I am able that I should do him the like

plesour: which is the certeine signe of a thankfull hart. And yet ought not this to be called the other part of a dewtie yet vnparfyt, but rather the waye and mean to attaine to the perfection therof. As for example. Phydias the painter made a picture.An example of a cōmynge painter. The fruit of his art is one, and the frute of his artificiallnes and connynge is an other, and eche far different frome other. The frute of his art was to make that whyche he would. The frute of his artificiallnes and conning, was to make it so that it might yéeld him some profit and gaine. He may haue the fruite of his art, and yet want it of his artificiallnes. For that he may haue finisht his worke, and yet not sold it, Again the fruit of his whole workmanship consisteth in thrée pointes. The firste is his owne fansie whiche is satisfied when he hath accomplished his worke in dew order and decentlie. The second is report and fame whiche others geue vnto him for his cō
                  ningly handling it. The thirde is the

proffit whiche he getteth eyther by sale of the sayd picture or otherwyse. Let vs appoint a benefit also to haue thrée lyke

                     s. The first wherof let be in ye mind or fancie of the geuer: wherein he is satisfied fullie, so sone as he séeth he hath benefited him whom he would, in suche wise as he would. The second is ye report and fame he getteth thereby. The thirde consisteth in such plesures as mutuallye the one may do to thother. Whervpon I conclude thus: that whē a benefit is thākfully receiued, he who gaue it, reaped alreadie thereby thankes at the handes of him to whom he gaue it, (whyche is the principal point to be regarded:) although he haue not yet receiued the like reward again. It appereth then that that which I owe for any benefit receiued is no part of the benefit it self, namelie the recompensinge of a benefit. And as for the acknowledging therof, I haue repayd that sufficiently in that I receiued it thankfullye.

                  BUt howe can this stande with Reason will som haply saye? It is impossible that any one may be sayde to requite ye plesour I haue done to him at whose handes I neuer syth receued sute or seruyce. I saye doutles he hath done verye muche that hath receiued thy benefitte thankefullie. For first he hath therein declared to thée hys good hart. Secondlye he hath shewed himself willinglye to owe lyke goodwill to thée as he founde at thye handes: whiche is an euident tooken of a fréendly and honest hart. Benefites & the thinges that are lent and borowed, are not lyke, nor a lyke to be recompensed and repaid. If thou ha

                  t benefited any man, looke not for any recompense by hande. For the requitall thereof resteth chefelye in the mind and hart of the man. It

shall not proue in thend very straunge to thée that whyche I say, though it séeme at the firste shew somewhat to impugne & contrarie thine opinion) if thou wilt geue me the hearing a litle, and vnderstand by the way that there is more plenty of thinges in the world, then wée haue coppie and chaunge of woordes to terme eche of them seuerallie by seueral names. By mean wherof we are enforced to shift aswell as we cā with such words as we haue, though they be some what improper & not full méete for that that they are applied vnto. As for profe, we call ye foot of our owne body, the foot of a bed, and the foot of a verse, by the name of a foot indifferentlye. Againe a dog hound, a dog fish, and a dog starre, by the name of a dogg alike. And this confusiō by equiuocacion doth happen bycause we are not able for want and penurie of seuerall woordes to terme eche of them diuersely: and therfore are we driuen to vse suche woordes as we haue to serue

the 
                     •
                  orne as it wilbe in this extremitie. Stowtnes we saye is a vertew that despiseth and setteth light by daungers and perrils, without being moued or disquieted by them. Or ells it is a knowledge shewing vs how we should with stande endeuer, or auoyd all daungers. So doo wee call Fence players and desperate knaues whiche careles and without any regard put their liues in aduēture, stowt men. We doo in lyke maner define or describe Niggishnes to be a knowledge how to auoyd excessiue charges: or ells an vnderstanding how to spend our substaunce moderatelye and yet wee call a Misar, him that hungar drops out of his nose (as we say) one that is so néere himself that he is not woorthie to beare the name of a man, him call we a nigga
                     •
                  d also. Thus wee sée and can discerne a great diuersitie to be betwene méesure and extremitie: And that these thynges differ muche in nature the one from the other. Howbeit the penurie of apt and

proper woordes, causeth vs to call bothe the one and the other a Niggard. Again, him stowt that with Reason endewreth al daungers, & that other stowt also who though he cast himself hed long into thē yet suffreth he the same stowtlye, without séeming to be moued or anye whyt dismayed thereby. After the same maner, we call by the name of a benefitte both the accion and doyng of the benefit, and the substaunce of the matter and thinge whyche is geuen or done, as money, houses, Landes, or apparell. One onely name is attributed to them bothe indifferently, and yet the force, nature & qualytie of them is farre diuerse.

Touching somuche of any benefit as the acciō and doing therof doth accomplish,The poī
                     tes wher vpō benefits cōsist if we receiue the doing therof thankfullye, we haue so farre euen now requited the same. But as touching the substaūce of it, that is to saye the thing geuen, we haue not asyet thereby made recompense for that, but that is referred to our owne will. For that good will whyche hath relacion to the doing of the benefit, we haue aunswered with lyke goodwill by thankfullye accepting of it. Notwithstanding we muste thinke we owe yet more: namely one benefitte for an other, one materiall thing for an other. And although I say he hath rendred thā
                  kes yt hath declared himself to haue accepted a benefit thankfully, yet would I him to repaye some thing or other besides, lyke to y• which he receiued, yt maye also deserue to haue ye name of a benefit as that did which he had. Some of these thynges that I saye séeme somewhat to varye frome the Common Phrase of

spekyng some one waye: and yet some other way to agre wel enough therwith. We saye commonly that wyse men can by no meanes beare wrong. And yet if a wise man hap to haue a blow thynk you not that he hath wrong? So saye we in common speache, what should Fooles do with goodes? And for all that, if any man should steale any thing from a foole and were appeched & attached, thinke you he were not lyke to be condemned of theft? In talke we call suche and suche mad. And yet we sée the same whiche in some respect wee called mad men to haue the electing of Magistrates, the deputing of offices, the gouernement of prouinces, and rule of Cities. So though I say 
                     •
                  hat he that hath receiued thankfully the plesour that is done to him, hath in hys so doing rendred the lyke, yet do I notwithstanding averre that he is yet still in the others det for all that, and that he muste make father recompēse though he haue alredy done some point of his dutie: not

thoroughly acquiting him of all that he ought to doo. So that this saieng of mine weihged aryght, is an aduertisemēt and admonicion to men to requite suche benefits as they haue receiued, and no discharge therof. But in any case let vs beware that through the hugenes of the burthen we faint not, and dispairing by meane of our sklender abilitie we geue not ouer in the plaine.The sayeng of the thankfull man. As if we woulde consider and weigh (as Reason an
                     •
                   honestie would we should) the whole matter with our selues, and say. Certes such one hath done me merueilous great plesour, he saued and clered my good name whiche was half in daunger to be disfamed. He deliuered me from great pouertie into which I was fallen, I had douhtles lost my life if he had not bene. By his only meane haue I my libertie whiche I hold derer then my lyfe. And howe or when shall I be able to deserue his so great benefits? Whiche way is it possible that my goodwill can by any meanes

seme to requite the very least of al these? Uerely I say who that hath this kind of thought and minde with him hath euen thereby shewed sufficiently his thankful acknowledging of the good and plesour that he hath receiued. Therefore if thou haue a plesour shewed thée, receiue it, embrase it, be gladde therewith, and reioyce at it. Not for that thou receiuedst it, but because thou hast therby occasion to doo the lyke againe, whiche of deuty thou must, and not fayle to doo it. And so shalt thou be well assured not to incurre the daunger to be called vnthākfull. I will not here prescribe thée anye hard preceptes that thou shouldst obserue in requiting of benefits, to thend thou shouldst not dispayre, and that the difficultie of them should not quaile thy courage.

of their natures. And to others some for that they suffer time to eat out of memorie the plesours which we haue done to them. Which kind of men some woulde not iudge worthie to be called vnthankfull, but séeme to geue them (as they gesse) a more manerlye name, and terme them forgetfull.Forgetfulnes of a benefit, y• ch

                     •
                  oot therof. For how is it possible that that shoulde by anye meanes séeme to excuse a man from being counted vnthankfull, that is founde in none els but in them that are vnthankfull. Howbeit there are sondry sortes of vnthankfull men lyke as there are of theues or murtherers. Whose factes notwithstanding all agrée in one kinde: for eche theft is theft, eche murder murder, and eche vnthankfullnes is vnthanfullnes. But some yet are more heynous then other some are, and differre in the quantitie or qualitie of the fact, or both.

He is vnthankfull that denyeth the recept of the benefit whiche he had. He is again vnthankfull that dissembleth and will not voluntarilie confesse and acknowledge it. He is also vnthankfull that requiteth not the benefit whyche he receiued. But he is most vnthankfull of all the rest, that forgetteth it quite. The residew yet though they requite it not, yet they reste dettours for it, and there appereth yet in them some signe and shew that benefites were by them receiued, though they be reposed and coucht in an euill conscience. And yet these persons vppon some one cause or other, maye happe to be moued at one time or other, to render thankes. Perhaps shame will woorke remembraunce of their duties, or the lyke néed at an other time thone of these otherwyle taketh place in verye naughty natures. But he that hath quite forgot that he had suche plesour shewed hym, séemeth to be past all hope that he euer will shewe himself to be thankfull.

And to saye the truth if it shoulde be put to your owne iudgement, whych of these would you déeme most ingratefull?Who is to be sayd most Ingrate. him that refuseth and neglecteth to rendre thankes for the plesour whiche was shewed him, or ells that other that forgetteth it quite, and remembreth it nowhit at all? Indéed those are euill eyes that can not endewer the brightnes of the light, but they are plaine blind eyes that sée no whyt. Assuredlye it is a wicked part if any one should hate and not loue his parentes. But to refuse and denye, and not acknowledge them, is a manifest signe of madnes. Who is so vnthākfull as he that hath clene reiected careleslyke, that whyche he should haue allw

And he that will not doo that that requireth neyther labour, riches nor great good Fortune, is worthie to haue but litle alledged for him by waye of excuse. Dowtles he neuer mente to shew himselfe thankfull that cast benefits done to him, so farre out of his sight that he did not somuche as thinke vppon them anye more. For as that whiche is daylie at hande to vs, and in continuall vse mouldeth not ne waxeth hoare, and again those thinges which are laid aside out of sight and forgotten gather soyle of their owne accord by onely lieng stil,

So what is in the dayly exercise and occupieng of the mind, is neuer forgotten: as that whiche loseth nothing, except it be that that is cast aside (as it were) neuer to be occupyed, or thought vpon anye more.

For that as we are altogether led with new desires, so we regard neuer what we alredye haue had, but consider whollye what we woulde haue, not casting any eye or regarding that whych is in possession, but respecting that onelye whiche we make pursute after. The passing gréedie and couetous desier wee haue, causeth vs to set but light by anye thing that we haue alredy, and to weigh

him but litle at whose handes we receiued it. But him we loue, to him we doo all maner of obseruaunce, we affirme that all the stay of our welldoing dependeth on him, so long as we lyste to lyke of the thinges we receiue at his handes. But so sone as we begin to take a smatche of other greter plesours, and that we féele any lyfe (as they say) in it, that it is coming & maye be got, (as the guise of men is nowadayes after they haue obtained great thynges to hunt still after greatter,) then farewell that we before had in so great price, & after the other wc might & mayne. Then weigh we no lō
                  gar the things which erst haue preferred vs, but fixe our eyes wholly to consider how yt which we shote at hath aduaūced to fortime those yt had the same. And how can a man be both enuyous of an other mans state, and thankfull for his owne? It is impossible: For Enuye is allwayes accōpanied with sadnes & sorow: & thākfulnes is associated with glad

Farthermore forasmuche as we regard nor weigh the passing time anye longar while, then that it is in passyng, seldom when we call to minde the thynges that passed in that tyme. Whereuppon it followeth, that Scolemasters we sée so vsually lost their benefites whiche they bestow vppon vs in our youth. For which notwithstanding that they demeryte in

                  éed worthely great thankes, yet for all that, they finde them not repayde, for that we to whom they were done, do neuer cal to mind, nor weigh duly what thynges hapned within that age. Neythere of the time it self when it is ones past, no man maketh more accompt then as if it were lost. And as thynges done in that time, passe also with the tyme, doutfull it séemeth, lest when they are ones past, they be also past hope of remē

wée can alledge to proue whye the vnthankefull body with vs shoulde not be sewed. We haue say we, alwayes assented and so vsually practised it to punishe sharply eche haynous offence that hath seemed to vs worthie of punishment, as manslaughter, witchcraft, murder, robbrye, prophaning of sacred institutions and suche lyke. Against all these in some contrey one kinde of punishment, in som other an other kind is assigned. But eueriewhere there is some paine appointed for the trespassours. But as for this vice whiche is so commōly practised and daylie in vre, it is euerywhere reprehended, but no where punished. Neyther yet doo we clerely acquit and discharge it from desert of punishment but for that we can not agrée vppon it to determine punishement certein for it, therfore we adiudge it onely worthie to be hated, and despyted, and refer it ouer wholly to the goddes for reuengement.

in him that repayeth the same not for that he would of his owne accord, good nature, and frée will doo so, but for that he was enforced thereto to auoyde the daunger that might ensew? It shoulde merite no great cōmendacion to be thākfull, e

                  cept without perill and daunger a man might be vnthankfull if he so listed. But this one thing were sufficient to discourage and disswade vs as I gesse from sewing for our benefites. What and if all the places in the whole worlde where Iustice is had and cognisaunce of plea holden shoulde proue not sufficient nor rowme enough for eche party agreued to come in place to make his plaint? Shoulde it come to that passe that we might sew for right in this case, who is he that shoulde not haue cause to playn, or who he that might not be impleaded?

And to say the truthe, it were a verie hard matter and full of difficultie to finde a Iudge able to decide all suche controuersies and dowtes as haply woulde fall out vppon thorough scanning some one of these causes. So that you would wonder to thinke if you déepelye examine and consider the matter, how much he should haue to do that should geue indifferent and vpright sentence vpon one impleaded for this fact. Admyt the case to be this. There was one that gaue his frinde standing in néed a very great some of money without askyng eyther interest for it or his owne money again.

want of the lyke somme of moneye, and pitieng his Frinde asmuche as himself, deliuered him somuch money but it was not his owne of store lieng by him, but for the getting of it redye for his frinde he was fayne

One that had his frinde at suche a strayt that all his goodes were redye to be confiscated and made port sale of, beyng stored so well him self that he had so muche money of his owne spare and doyng him no plesour in his house, lette his Frinde haue it to saue his goodes. An other in lyke maner hauing his frinde at the like extremitie, and not hauyng of hys owne to socour him withall, and yet loth to se his frinde vndone, beyng better able to shift at that pinche then that other who for care and gryef wist not whyther to torne him, went to that manne vppon

his credit, to that other vppon hys bondes and pledges, and in fine gotte together so muche money as should serue his frindes necessitie. Howe saye yo

Again it was very long before he would doo that whiche he did, and vsed many delayes in doing of it, whereby I was more hindred, then if he had quyte denyed me when I requested it firste.
               Nowe if anye of these benefites so done should come in question as I sayd, howe can any Iudge I praye you indiferently and as he should doo weigh these things, when as the benefit appereth to be done

and yet the talke that paste with it, the countenaūce of the geuer, and the doubtes & delayes whiche he made before he would doo it, doo quite destroye and lose the grace of the sayd benefit.

               Chap. 10.
               
                  FArthermore there is greate diuersitie betwene the repayeng of benefits & money loned. For he y• boroweth money, hath his day of repaymēt assigned him, but in benefites requiting, there is no day limited. So y• he y• receiueth a plesour

may wellenowgh requite the same when he shall thynke good or when he shall finde occasion therto.A benefit may be repayed at any time. Tell me then will you say perhaps, within what time maye a man be well cald vnthankfull if he requite not the plesour he hath receiued. Uerely the grettest benefites that are, lye preuelye hid in the consciences and mindes of them that do and receiue the same. And this I saye for that wee should doo our benefites in suche sorte, that they maye be acceptable and well thought of without vsing auy witnesses or record berers. What penalty shal we then assigne for them that are vnthankfull? Assuredly I would assigne but one kinde of punishment to be dew to them all in generall. And for that all kinde of benefits are not of lyke quantitie nor valew, but some gretter som lesser, I wold the sayde penaltye should be also diminished or increased accordyng to the quā
                  titie and qualitie of the benefit so receiued and not requited. Well thē admitte

that there are some kind of benefites of whyche we ought to make as good accompt as of our lyfe. And some againe whiche we haue cause to weigh déerer of, then of our life. If he that hath receiued these shew himself vnthankfull for the same, what paine shal we iudge him worthy of? Ought it to be any lesse then the benefit was whiche he receiued? It were against conscience it should, Shal it be then equall with it and lyke? Alas, what thing were there more miserable and crewel, then that the end of benefits whiche in eche thing ought to be ye best, shoulde be requited and payed with the death and bloud shedyng of those whom they should benefit.

               Againe greate oddes is there betwene the parentes and others in bestowynge of benefites. For Parentes though they haue ones or oftener benefitted their Children, and haue hadde cause to think the same euill bestowed, yet maye not they cesse from benefiting them still, for all that. Moreouer the benefites of all Fathers are lyke, for what is required of anye one in that respect, that same is required of euerye one that beareth the denominacion of a Father, and not of one or other more or lesse.
               But thée Nature of benefites whyche

whiche are done frome one to an other where there is no respect of causes why, is far other. And as those benefites are different among themselues, so can they not be cōprehended vnder any one Rule.

                  Diuersitie of benefites & of the persons to whō they are done.
                  DIuers thynges there are that are very costly & chargeable to the geuers, and other some thynges there are that are as thankfullie accepted, and yet not so painfull for charges to be geuen. Some thinges we geue to our Frindes and familiar acquainted, and some againe to straungers and persons not knowen. Though the giftes which thou geuest to seueral persons be to eche of them acceptable, yet is that most commendable that thou geuest to him whom thou knewest not before, but beginst by that to knowe, in respect of that thou gauest to hym whome thou

knewest before. Some are able to graūt ayd in troubles. Others to confort with counsel in heauines. And others some to geue promocions and sondry prefermentes, whereby the hauers countenaunce is muche amended, and his astate bettered, and as al these diuers sortes of benefits differ one from an other, so shall you see diuers men diuersely desier thesame. Some one you shal finde that shal thinke nothynge so excellent as to haue one that in the depest extremitie of hys miserye, and when he is allmost desperate with sorow, can yet wisely recōfort him with good councell Some other is there that hath more regard far, to worship and preferment attayning, then to liuing in safetie. Again some other ther
                     •
                   is that doth accompt himself more beholding to him that saueth him from perils and daungers, then to him that carefully prouideth for his honestie. So that wee se any of these thinges is so much more or lesse estéemed of, as the partye who is

to geue his sentence vpon the same, doth more or lesse frame hys fansye to lyke thereof. In money matters I chose my Creditour whome I lyst my selfe. But benefits sometime I haue at his handes that willinglye I would not, and otherwhiles I am vnwittingly bounden. And what will you doo in this case? will you call him vnthankfull that dothe not requite the benefit whych he receyued eyther vnwittingly or against his will.

There is moreouer great diuersitie betwene their two liues.

And contrariwise the thankfull bodye is allwayes mery and pleasaunt, allwayes séekyng occasion to requite the benefits which he hath receyued, and is gretlye delighted if he find it: not sekyng howe he may fully digest it, but studieng after what sorte he maye fully and thoroughly aunswere the same, and that not to his parentes alone, but to hys frinde allso and eche simple wyght that hath anye maner of wayes benefyted him. And if his bondman happen to doo him a plesour, streight waye he weigheth not of whome, but what it was that he receyued.

Seruices they call suche as the seruaunt doth to his master,Seruices whō fortune hath placed in suche degrée, that whatsoeuer he do in his maisters behalf,

he moste thynke it all but his dutye. Whosoeuer for all that, doth denye that the seruaunt maye benefyt his mayster, declareth himself not to knowe what is ryght. For onely it is to be regarded of what mind he was that did the benefit, and not of what degrée. Uertew penneth her self vp from no body,The way to vertew opē to euery persō. she sheweth & offreth herself to euery bodye to be had. She admitteth all that wilbe sewters, And those that haply passe by her without regard, she calleth back of her owne accord. Fréeborn, frée made, bondslaues, banished men and Princes, & all a lyke. She choseth neyther the house nor the degrée. She contenteth herself aswell wt the naked man despoiled frō al giftes of fortune, as with him that hath thē all in most abundaunce. For though Fortune beare great sway in ye world, yet vertew triumpheth ouer her. If you will saye that a seruaunt can not doo a benefitte to hys mayster, then will I auerre that it is not possible for a Subiect too doo

it to his king, or a Souldiour to his Capitain. For though there are diuers respectes and sondrye tytles of the king, the Capitaine, and the mayster, yet in thys point they are al one touching ye dewty of them that are vnder them and at theyr commaundement. For as the kyng hath his subiectes, and the captaine his souldiours, so hath the mayster his seruauntes at commaundement. If the basenes of his degrée be an impediment to the seruaunt that he may not attaine to the perfection of his desert, as to call the plesour he hath done, a benefit, the like shal it also worke to the subiect in respect of his Prince, and to the souldiour in regard of his capitaine. Though they varye in names, yet agrée they indifferētly concerning their dewtie. But manifest it is that subiects do benefit their Princes, and souldiours their Capitaines, by the same reason then, why may not the seruaunt also benefit his maister?That a bound mā may benefitte his Maister. The seruaunt may be iust, strong, valyaunt,

and one of noble courage. What then should ayle him but that he may also benefyt his maister, sith that is a vertewe aswell as ye residew? To proue it brieflee this might suffice. There is no dout but that the seruaunt may benefit any
                     •
                   bodye. What then should ayle him why he could not benefyt his maister among the reste?

                  TO proue that the seruant can not benefit his maister thou wilt happlye alledge, that though he lende hys maister money, yet he can not properly be sayd his maisters Creditour. That onely excepted, he doth that dayly that may cause his maister to thīk himself bound to him. For if he ryde or goe, he accompaneth him. If he fal sicke he tendeth him, and doth his diligence about him. Whiche thinges if anye other bodye had done them, they had deserued

the name of benefites: but sith hys seruaunt did them they must be called but seruices onely. A benefit say they is that frendly plesour whiche suche a one doth as may chose to doo it, and againe refuse to doo if him so lyketh at his plesour. But the seruaunt may not saye naye to what he is able to doo. Wherevppon he can not be sayde to doo a benefitte what soeuer he doith, for that he doth but fulfill hys dewtie, whyche he can not chose but doo perforce. Admitte all these thynges to bee so: yet will I beare the bell awaye heere, and will sette the bondman in as good plight, (for of suche a seruaunt vnderstande that I spéeke) as if he were frée. Tell me by the waye if I bée able to shewe you a bounde seruaunt who without all respect of hys owne helthe and safegarde fought in defense of hys mayster stoutely and beinge greuously wounded, and bléedyng, by whole streames, keept hys ennemyes

                  HE is muche deceyued that thinketh ye seruitude hath domination and rule ouer eche parte of a man. The chefest part of him is clere from any bondage. For though the bodyes be bound and at commaundement of their maisters, yet is their minde at frée libertie, and so frée, that neyther that prisō of the body wherin it is shut, can restrain it from sekinge to accomplyshe that that it is enclined vnto, and that tempting somewhiles of worthie enterprises. It is thonly bodye that Fortune hath made subiect, put in thraldome, and assigned to be at the maisters commaundement, plesour, and disposicion. That he byeth, that he selleth again as lyketh him best. And yet for all that we haue not to commaund our seruauntes in eche thing touching their bodies that they can do,The bōdman maye refuse doing the cōmaūdemēt of his maister in som thīgs as if our cōmaundment

sounded to the dammage and preiudice of the weale publique, they maye chose to doo it, or to assist vs to commit any robbery, they may refuse it.

For when all dewtie and seruice is had of a seruaunt whiche is commonly to be required at suche mens handes, yet resteth there in some of them that abilitie to doo farther plesour besides that may well deserue the name of a benefit.Wherein y• boūdmā may benefit his master.

thynges wherein the mayster standeth bounde to hys most abiect seruaunt. As to fynde and allowe him sufficient and honest meant, drinke and cloth, and yet are not these to bee called benefittes though the seruaunt hath them dewlye and well.Wherin the maister may b

For as if our bondmā shold doo lesse thē his dewty you would not blame vs to be angry wt him, but wold adiudge him worthy of punishment, right so if he doo more thē dewtie, should we not seme to offer him wrong if he should not finde at our handes his thankes according?

a man doth that whyche he coulde

These two are contraryes a benefyt and a wrong. And who that maye susteine wrong at hys maisters handes the same partye maye also doo a benefit to his mayster. And to proue that a bondman may be wronged at his maisters handes I néed not seeke any farther testimonie then that there are appointed magistrates and officers by publique consent to be vmpars betwene them, to redresse the wronges offred by any suche maisters, to restraine their crueltye and oultrage in Punisshing, and mesure their niggishenes in geuyng them necessaryes.

And what man is he I praye you so loftie that at some one tyme or other may not haue néed of very meane personages? Well for profe of these thinges whiche I haue sayde, I will recite vnto you a nomber of benefites done by suche men to their maisters. Some that deliuered their maisters frō being slaine: some that otherwise saued their liues. Some that saued their maysters from being cast awaye and if that be not much, that for the sauing of them cast awaye themselues.

                     CLaudius Quadrigarius in hisA notable history of two boūdmen xxii. booke of Chronicles maketh report that at what time the Citie of Drument

was beséeged by the Romaines, and that they that warded within were quite deuoid of hope of being able to defende it any longar against the force and sharpe assaults of their enemys, two bondmen seruauntes in one house priuelye stole forth of the City by some posterne gate, lowpe hole, or other pryuye place, and streight way fled to the campes of their enemyes, making a pitifull complaint of their more then crewell vsage whiche they founde at their maistres handes a sole womā within the Cytie: from whose rigour they wer so escaped, beseching them of grace and socour: who as they were full of compassion easelye admitted and allowed their complaint to bee trew, receyued and entreated them verie well. Sone after, the Cytie was taken, then did the Conquerours busily applye themselues to take the spoyle. But these twaine as they were better acquainted with the Cytie then the Rest, so ran they a nerer waye with all spéede streyght

home to their maistres house, to preuent the other enemies: and taking her forth, draue her tofore them along the Cytie through the myddest of ye enemyes, whiche diuers of them seing, demaunded of them both who she was that thei entreated so crewelly

But now is come the time that we shalbe reuenged on her wellenough shée shall knowe anone what punishement meanes, and whether it be easie to endure or no. Thus when by this meanes they hadde brought her cleane with out the Cytie and daunger of the enemyes, and placed her in asmuche safetye as they coulde deuyse for the tyme, they retourned into the Cytie, and vnder colour of takynge it for themselues, gotte and saued somuche as they coulde of her goodes safe and vnspoyled. Then when thée rage and furye of the

of the enemyes was pacified, and the broyle ceast, the conquerours to declare that they were Romaines, restored of those that remayned eche to his owne againe. And they when they sawe all thinges in saftie brought their maistres also safe home againe. Whervpon, shée forthwith manumitted them both & was not ashamed to acknowledge and confesse that her lyfe was only preserued by them ouer whom she had authoritie both of life and deth. This was not credit me the fact of seruile hartes to assume vpon them the name of manquellars for the time to thēd they might saue their maistres lyfe.

There was presented what talke men had of him as they sat on their alebenche: and scantly could a man haue anye talke familiarlye with his Frinde, but it was blowen to Tiberius eare. There was no astate in safetie, nor any man all most trustye. The least cause that might be was matter sufficient for him to shew his creweltye. If any haply were detected, it néeded not to listen what should become of him: for euen before the time of his attainder it was knowen welenowgh whether he should. The axe and the blocke sate in

iudgement of him. It fortuned Paulus y• Pretor at that time, to suppe abrode frō home, and ware vpon his fingar a King in whiche was engraued the picture of Tiberius. This Paulus after he had dronk hard, had lyst to make water, and chaunced to take the chamber pot in that hand wheron he ware that King, by Reason whereof the King touched the pot also. Whiche thing Maro one that was present in companie, a Sicophant and picke thanke noted full well reioycing mithhimself that he had suche matter to report to Tiberius thinking for his tidinges (as it might haue proued if he could haue brought his deuise about,) to haue had the spoile of Paulus.

And hauinge done firste his obedience, put himself wholly in his grace, and exponing to him all the discourse of the matter and his disloyaltie, with earnest repentaunce for his folly so sowlye ouer shot, wishing it might rather hap on himself and his, besought him humblie of his gracious pardon which. Augustus as he was bountifull and debonayre graunted immediately. But none quod Ruffus will credit that I stande in your fauour except it may appere to thē that you gaue me something, and therevpon besought him that he would graūt him a resonable some of money as he then requested, whyche Augustus gaue charge should be deliuered him. And farther quod Cesar of my more ample grace this I promise thée that on my parte there shalbe no cause geuen why wee twayne will euer hereafter fall out again. Did not Cesar graciously so lightly

to remit the fact? but more worthie of commendacion was it in that he annexed to hys clemencie such liberalitie. Who that shall but heare this Historie reported can not chose but highly commende Augustus, and yet can he not chose but praise this bondman before him. But would you not now loke that I shold tel you that he was manumitted and made Frée for his labour? I thinke you wold, and that woorthely also. He was so and Augustus himself paid the money for his redemption.

geueth such a benefit as may be bettred, therfore it may also be sayde he maye be excelled. To proue he maye be excelled I saye thus, who that receyueth a gretter benefit then he gaue, may welbe sayd to be excelled. I proue that againe thus. The often sauing of a mans life is a gretter benefit, then the only ones geuing of lyfe. But the father maye haue his lyfe often saued by his sonne, which is a gretter benefitte then he gaue therfore. &c. Or thus who of twaine receiueth the benefit he most néedeth of, receyueth the gretter benefit. But the father who is now liuing receiuing lyfe, receiueth the benefit he most néedeth of in respect of the sonnes néede who is not yet liuing and so had lesse néed, therfore the father receiueth the gretter benefit. But some that will be sati

                  fied neyther with Reason nor owght ells, will still exclaime saieng. It is impossible that the benefites of the father maye be excelled by the giftes of the sōne. For except the

father hadde begot him and made him a liuing creature, how coulde he haue gotten any thing to geue? I praye you then what doth the father more herein or deserue better then he in whose hande it lieth to saue the lyfe of the sonne or lette him dye, and yet doth saue his lyfe. Hath not any suche in respect of the life of the sonne merited asmuche as his father? Yet verely. For if any such had dispatcht him before he had attained any of those thinges whiche he gaue to his Father, what could the lyfe he had at his fathers handes aduantage him to the getting of such things? But the benefit of any that geueth me a seconde lyfe as it were by not berefting me the lyfe I now haue in vse alredye, may be by me well enowgh requited, and so maye that also of my fathers which was again more weke and vnperfecter thē yt, that ye other gaue me, as néeding a nomber of other necessarye concurrentes without which it could not be conserued.

What maner contention can yéeld a more commendable victorie, then

that the parent maye haue iust cause to saye, that his sonne hath ouermatcht him farre in requiting his benefites? For if the parentes should shewe themselues after such sort to accompt of their benefites as though they could neuer be sufficientlye requited by their Children, then certeinlye they shoulde make them so slacke, that they woulde neuer vndertake to geue thattempt to it, as perswaded afore hand that if they should, it were but labour lost and not woorthe the whyle: where as they shoulde rather encowrage them forwarde themselues, and saye.

And if it happen anye to waxe dull, herein, let them whet theyr edges agayne and begine afresh. Happy are they that shall get the victorie: and happy they that shalbe vanquished, if it be not a yéelded victorye. What more noble thinge is there then when a man may iustly saye I haue excelled my Father in doing him plesours, yea there is none at whose handes I euer receiued benefitte but I haue passed hym farre in

requiting the same? Who is there that lyueth more fortunat then the olde parentes that maye vppon good proofe reporte that they haue suche a childe that hath with great encrease yeelded them the benefits whyche they bestowed vppon him? Generallye who can be called more happy then he that reportyng the truthe may saye I neuer did plesour nor bestowed benefit that I had cause to repent or thinke lost, but had it as redily repaid and requited as I was willing to do it, and that doubled many folde? And then hauyng brought eche partie to that passe that they may iustly so say and find what thing can there happen more happy and so happly to make an ende?
