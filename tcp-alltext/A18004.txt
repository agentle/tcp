               HE dishonesteth himself, and so much as lyeth in hym diffameth his maister, vvho hath bin prentise seuen yeares, and at the ende of those seuen yeares, neyther vnderstandeth his arte, neyther can shewe any reason therof, neyther is able to profite himselfe or others.
            Are not we al bound, yea do we not al promise in our baptisme, and are commaunded of God, to shew out the glories and vertues of him, that hath brought vs out of darkenes into light? But it is to be feared that a nomber of vs that professe Christ, (thoughe wee haue bin prentice to him seuen yeares, perhappes seuen, seuen, and seuen, neither haue so much knowledge as to instruct our selues, neither to defend our maister Christ against the Turke, Iewe, heretique, and antichrist. VVill the Turke admit any man to his religion, that neither can, nor will defend Mahomet? VVill the Iewe receiue any that is not furnished with the Scriptures falsely interpreted against Christ? VVill Heretiques accept any man that is ignorant in their erronius opinions? VVill Antichrist allowe any man which will not maintaine his Idolatry and superst

               tion? VVe professe Christ in woords, and outward shewes, notwithstanding we are not able too defend him in the middest of his enemyes. Lacke of knowledge causeth many to hold their peace. Ignorance is the root of errour: the contempt of the study of Gods word, is the high way to perdition. VVho can please him whose will he knoweth not? VVho can proceede in his Princes affaires, that knoweth not his comission? How can he execute his commission, if he neyther reade it, nor vnderstand it? Is he a Gramarian that cannot speake congrue Latine? A Logician that cannot reason probably? A naturall Philosopher that knoweth not the generation and causes

of Raine, VVinde, Snowe, and such Meteorologicall things? Is there any Surgen that hath not read Iohannes de Vigo or Alexander benedictus? Or Phisitian that is ignorant in Hippocrates, or Galen, or Celsus? and shall ignorance who is condemned of all artificers commend a Christian? I therfore the least of all the members of Christ, hearing dayly Antichrist and his artificers (I meane the Pope and the Papistes) so cunning in the Cannon lawe, and Popish doctours, that there is nothing in them that they do not both exactely vnderstand, and also vtter, to the maintenance of their head the Pope, thought it necessary somewhat to say and too refel theyr errours. Emong the which this is not the least that the Papistes go about, to proue the Pope to be head of the Church, which vnreasonable errour, being plainely in these twoo little treatises confuted, I haue thought good to dedicate the same vnto your Honour, whose desire (as I am throughly perswaded) is too see the vtter confusion of Antichrist, and the perfect establishement of Christes Religion. And therfore the bolder to set those things forth vnder your Lord shippes protection, which may please Christ, displease Antichrist, be acceptable to all Christians, greuous to all Antechristians, pleasant to all professoures of Christ, bitter to al his aduersaries. And as I truste a plaine ouerthrowe of the Romishe Church.

            A description of the Pope.
            
               THough Poets pen hath fables feignd
            Of monsters maruelous:
            Who diffring far from common kind
            were thought prodigious.
            As Briarchus who had hands
            an hundreth as they tell,
            And spitte forth fire from fiftie mouthes
            like flashing flames of hell:
            Though Ephialtes with Othus
            
            of natures fierce and fell,
            Did striue with stregth of stretcht out arme
            in Ioue his Throne to dwell.
            Who heaped hilles on mountains high
            
               Of
                     •
                  a on Pindus back,
            And placed Pelion on them
            the Starry skie to sack.
            Though these two impes of ougly shape
            whose father Neptune was,
            Growing nine inches euery month,
            in bignesse mounts did passe.
            Though Poliphemus were as huge
            and ougly as the rest,
            Who for his strength and sturdines
            might match him with the best.
            And though Chimera a monster were,
            of thrée conioynd in one:
            The first a Lion, next a Goate,
            and third a fierce dragon.
            Though Minotaurus were as hugh
            and monstrous in effect,
            Whose sundry shape with nature fell
            his Parents did detect.
            Though Cerberus that chorlish Cur
            and thrée hell headded hound,
            A monster rare, with other more
            which are in writers found:
            
               Though these I say, vnséemely shapes
            foule fashioned, out of frame,
            Dame nature made thus monsterous
            as wée haue learned by fame.
            Yit I can shewe more monsterousnes
            comprised here in one,
            Who for his huge prodigiousenesse
            may match them all alone.
            But this is neyther God nor man
            as he himself doth tell,
            He is a meane betwene them both
            yet rules both Heauen and Hell.
            In Purgatory puttes to paine
            in earth he beares great swaie,
            The Heauenly Angels at his call
            are ready to obey.
            Hée can forgiue mens sinnes on earth
            and scite hell houndes by poste,
            And he can lose from lothesome lakes
            damnd soules and griesly ghostes.
            He is a God the Papistes do
            affirme with wonders mo,
            Whose bestely body being blasd,
            iudge you if he be so.
            His head a harmefull helmet is
            of poisen pestilent,
            His eyes are like to flames of fire
            that are from Vulcane sent.
            His eares they trust al tryfling tales
            and credit blasing brute.
            And such againe as will not heare
            the iust and humble sute.
            His nose doth snuf foorth hellish fumes
            his tung e is stinge of Death,
            His face of mischéef mirrour is
            and poisoned is his breath.
            
               His téeth do gnawe the blessed bones
            of such as are elect,
            His mouth doth bable blasphemie
            and Gods word doth reiect.
            His throte an open sepulchre
            doth swallow euery houre,
            The silly shéepo and woolfes doth spare
            the lambes for to deuour.
            Hys brest a chest and cofer is
            of al iniquitie,
            His armes are strong Princes to strike
            if they not Christ deny.
            His filthy fingers nimble are,
            to scratch for nedlesse gaine
            Which wilbe sure to snatch a share
            though other take the paine.
            His legges are swift to shed the blood
            of Innocentes giltlesse,
            His féete are ready Emperours neckes
            to tread down and oppresse.
            His body is Pandoras boxe
            which plageth younge and olde,
            And he prodigeous Antichrist
            whose déedes of Iohn are told.
            Which beast although that he be strong
            yet standes on slppery ground,
            Foq him this booke doth flatly foile
            and vtterly confound.

            THE ARGVMENT.
            FIrst I proue by Scripture that Peter could not be at Rome vntill the .6. or as Hierom and others collect vntil the .8. yere of Claudius. Secondly I proue by the order of time and place that he could not be at Rome vntill the second yeare of Domitian which was after the passion of Christ .52. or 53. yeares which should haue bin after the destruction of Hierusalem which was after Christ .73. yeares, the 8. day of September. In the second discourse I proue that neither Peter nor the Pope, is the head of the Church, confuting such obiections as they alledge to the contrary, wherein yee shall finde their arguments refelled, their Cannon law confuted, the Popes errours in Doctrine detected, their sillogismes answered, and finally certain antitheses betweene Christ and the Pope prouing him Antichrist, with an interpretation vppon the place of Paule. 2.

himself at that Easter whē Herode Agrippa was there, for Herod Agrippa came frō 
                  Cesarea to Hierusalē the feast of Easter, what time he beheaded Iames, & layd Peter in prison as is euidēt in ye 1.2 3.4.

Peter fearing the tyrannie of Herode Agrippa, after that the Aungell had delyuered him out of prison, conueyed himselfe out of the waye, and as the texte sayeth, into an other place, vntill Herode Agrippa should departe from Hierusalem, which was immediatly after Easter,Act. 12. ver. 17. purposing in his mind to make warre with the Tyrians, Sydonians, or as Luke vttereth more effectually tynomachem. And as God would,Act. 12. ver. 17 19, and 20. the sayde Herode Agrippa, a great defendour of the Iewes Lawes and Ordinances, and a persecutour of Christians,From ye death of Christ .13. dyed miserably the

                   Wherefore Herode Agrippa returned after Easter to Cesarea, where he died miserably. After the death of Herode, Peter was out of daunger, for Iudea was ruled by the Lieuetenantes of the Romaynes, as Festus, Lysias, and Felix, which did rather presse the Iewes, than the Christians, as the historie of Iosephus declareth, wherefore those seuen yeares that Paule and Bernabas departed from Antioche of Syria vnto the Gentyles, Peter was in Iudea, yea hée was at Hierusalem the 16. yeare after Christes passion, and the 15. of Paule his conuersion, as is manifest, ‡ for there maketh Peter an Oration to

the brethren, and this was the sixte yeare of Claudius, as is proued by the historie of the Actes written by S. Luke. What authoritie haue the Papistes,Act. 15. ver. 4 6, 7. Galat. 2. ver. 1 Theophilus, lib. 9. in the conuersion of Paul. Be

                     a in Act. Uincent. Galat. 2. ver. 7 8, 9. which affirme and sweare, that Peter went to Rome the second yeare of Claudius? But let vs procéede in the historie: of their errours in this matter, I will discourse a little after. Peter was appointed at that same tyme a teacher of the Iewes, and Paule of the Gentyles. For, sayeth Paule, Barnabas and I, were charged to preache to the Gentyles, and Peter, Iames and Iohn, to the Iewes. Were not the Romaynes Gentyles? Was not Paule and Barnabas charged with them? Notwithstanding, after that Peter and Iohn had sufficiently instructed the Iewes,From ye death of Christ, 16. they also taught the Gentyles. Wherefore vnto the sixt yeare of Claudius, which was the 16. yeare from Christe his passion. And the 15. from Paules conuersion, Peter neuer departed out of Iury, sauing only to Antioche of Syria, as I haue noted before. Nowe I will declare the reste of Peters peregrination, partly by suche testimonies as cannot bée refelled, partely by probable argumentes, necessarie coniectures, and sufficient reasons:Where Peter preached. 1. Peter. 1. ver. 1. Eusebius lib. 3. cap. 1. Lib. 2. cap. 35. As Peter did write to the dispersed Brethren in Pontus, Galatia, Bithinia, Capadocia, and Asia, so did hée preache in them all. * Nicephorus writeth, that Peter preached in Palestina, Syria, Phenice, Pontus Galatia, Capadocia, Bithinia, and to bée bréefe, in all the quarters of Asia and Europe. Wherefore, after this councell which is in the 15. of the Actes, hée went out of Iury,
                  Pontus. The 17. & 18. yeare after Christes ascension. Where Peter preached. into Pontus Galatia, Capadocia, Asia, and Bithinia: Them hée instructed, them hée visited, them hée furnished with the Gospell, them hée exhorted to faith, to good woorkes, to obedience, to temperancie, to doo their deuties, with them hée taried and was conuersant so longe, vntill that they had layde a foundacion, & buylded substantially vpon it. What a long tyme hée taryed in Pontus, and what Cities and Townes hée did instructe, and brought from superstition to Religion, from idolatrie to the Truthe, from errour too the right waye, from crueltie too lenitie, and from all iniquitie, to all patience, iustice, and humanitie: Hée maye easely coniecture who readeth and knoweth the descriptions of Countries.

If any man can refelle any parte of this discourse, wée will geue him thankes, partelie for that hée shall delyuer vs out of errour, and also for that hée shall set foorthe the truthe. If Peter lyued after the death of Nero, as this Historye declareth, howe coulde hée bée put too deathe by Nero? I haue proued before, that hée was at Babylon in Egypte, which is distant from Rome ten or eleuen degrées in latitude, and in longitude .xxx. which must néedes bée a longe and tedious iourney.yee must ascribe some yeares to this long iourney. For Babylon of Egypt standeth in 62.25: 30.0. and Rome 36.40: 41.40. It apereth that Peter was at Corinthe also: for it is written, that some holde of Paule, some of Apollo, and other some of Cephas, which was Peter.1. Corinth 1. ver. 12. If the Corinthians had neuer séene Peter, neuer herd of him, neuer had ben conuersaunte with him, why woold they haue holden of him? It may bée that hée went to Corinth when hée was in lesser Asia, which differeth not from Corinth aboue six or seuen degrées in latitude, and as much in a manner in longitude.

As they doo disagree in Peter, so doo they in the rest of the first Popes. And thinke yee not that they disagrace Peter, in making him of an Apostle a Bishope, of a Disciple of Christ a Pope of Rome? But too our purpose, somme saye that Peter made Linus, Cletus, and Anacletus, Bishoppes of Rome. Somme saye,Euseb. 3. cap. 2. & 4 Lib. 5. ca. 9 that they were his fellowes & cohelpers: their foundacions are weake, they leane too a broken staffe. Somme saye, that Clement succeded Peter with Linus and Cletus,
                  Marianus Scotus. The firste that planted Religion at Rome were neyther Byshops nor Popes. as cohelpers: which as the sayd Scotus writeth in Anacletus lyfe, denieth that they were eyther Bishops or Popes. There is no mention of Cletus in any good Author, neyther can it bée proued sufficiently, whether euer there were any suche, or no. Somme saye, that hée was Pope twelue yeares, other somme, seuen. The olde writers place Anacletus immediatlye after Clement, eyther despising Cletus, or els forgetting him,Ecclesiast histo: Cento. 1. or els being ignorant of any such, omit him. I cease too nomber all the discordes, for Roome it self woolde scarse holde them all.
               Nowe, as wée haue proued by the truthe of the history, that Peter was neyther at Roome. xxv. yeres,Peter was not at Rome neyther dyed there: So let vs proue the same by probable argumentes, that they maye  perceiue their Churche too bée buylded vppon the sande.

               It is euident both by Suetonius Tranquillus and others, and also by S. Luke, that Claudius the Emperour did charge all the Iewes as they loued their lyues, too departe out of Roome: if Peter had bin there than, which was the tenth yeare of Claudius, and the .xx.  after Christes passion, and the .xix. of Paules conuersion, without doubte somme mention woolde haue ben made of his tarying there or of his departure.Rome 16. ver. 3. Paule saluteth Aquila & Priscilla by name, who were at Roome before the commaundment of the Emperour,  & why did hée not aswell salute Peter,Gala. 1. ver. 18 with whome hée taryed .xv. dayes at Hierusalem? If Peter had ben there, & had herd the proclamation of Claudius, which hée must néeds haue heard, if hée had

ben there, hée woulde haue shaken the dust of his féete, following the precept of Christ. And neyther could hée haue taried at Roome, neyther hée woolde: hée could not bycause of Tyranny,Act. 13. ver. 5

But why did they not make Paule the first Pope, séeinge that hée was not only appointed too bée a teacher too the Gentiles, but also Luke affirmeth, that hée was at Roome:Act. 28. ver. 16 Euseb. lib. 3. cap. 21. & cap.

                   and Eusebius maketh him the first Bishop of Rome? They woold rather haue made Paule an Heretique, if they had could, because that hée inueyeth so much ageinst the Antechrist of Roome. There was one brought before a Iustice of the West countrie for religiō, who aunswereth, béeing demaunded of a matter of religion, that Paule sayeth so: Paule? sayeth hée, if Paule were here hée should go the same waye that thou shalt go, & ye were both worthie to bée  burned, & I wolde cary a fagotte to burne you both.Coloss. 4. ver. 12 & 14. Paule béeing at Rome in the tyme of Nero, wrote to the Colossians, saying that Epaphras, Luke, & Demas saluted them. Was Peter inferiour to them? was hée not worthie to bée named? were his salutacions to bée despysed? wherfore if hée had ben at Roome,2. Timothe 4 ver. 10. and 11. hée woolde haue  made mention of Peter, béeing head of the Apostles. And to Timothe hée writeth, that Demas was reuolted, Crescens was gone into Fraunce, Titus into Dalmatia,
                  Epih. & theodoret. desiring him to bring Marke with him, bycause only Luke was with him. If Luke was there only, surely Peter was not there.To Philem

If Peter had ben there béeing an earnest professor of Christ, should not hée haue bē apprehended as sone as Epaphras? should not hée haue ben as good a helper as Demas? as Ari

               Hithertoo I haue obserued as appereth by the texte, too proue euery thing by order of tyme and place,The old Authors discours vppon Peter. and also by other circumstances: now I thinke it good also to recite the order that Hierom & other old writers obserue in this matter, who gather their historie out of Luke and Paule, as wée do: which order though it be not so probable to somme, notwithstanding it maketh better for our

purpose. For after the order which I haue described hitherto, Peter was at Hierusalem the sixt yeare of Claudius the Emperoure, the .xvi. yeare of Christes passion, & the .xv. yeare of the conuersion of sainct Paule. But Hierom and others will haue the Councell, which was holden at Hierusalem in the .xv. of the Actes, to haue bē the .xvii. yeare of Paules conuersion, and in the eightenth yeare from Christes passion, & in the eight yeare of Claudius. And they are persuaded by the first chapter to the Galatians vers. xviii. & by the second chapter vers. j. where Paule expressely maketh mention of .iij. yeares spent at Damascus and in Arabia,The yeare of Christ. Act. 15. ver. 7. and after those .iii. yeares too haue comme too Hierusalem too the Councell, the .viii. yeare of Claudius. With what countenance than can the Roomish catholiques saye, that hée went to Rome the second yeare of the Emperour Claudius? If wée interprete the places of the first and second chapter too the Galatians as Charles Molyneus,Molineus an Aduocate of the highe Senate & Parliament of Paris, dothe, than must wée saye,After Christ ye 18 & 19. yeare Act. 15 that Paule continued at Damascus, in Arabia, and his retourne to Damascus, full fyue yeares: & than .xiiii. yeare after both Paule & Peter too haue ben at the Councell.

And in the .xvii. or .xix. yeare of Paules conuersion, which was ye .xi. yeare of Claudius, Peter departed to Antioche, where hée was thē reprehended of Paule. Then both by Molyneus supputation, and by the other,After Christ ye 23.24. 252· 6▪ 27. which wée haue recited before, Peter coulde not comme too Roome the second yeare of Claudius. And therfore whatsoeuer the Papistes buylde of Peter *, it is soone shaken downe, as grounded vpon the sandes.Ecclesiast. his. Ceut. 1. libr. 2. cap. 10.

                  tory, and by argument, and also by authoritie, that Peter was neuer at Roome. Now let vs confute their presumptions and obiections.

                   I answer, that those olde Authors haue no staffe too stick too, no scripture, no sufficient authoritie, not one woorde, neyther out of the olde Testament, nor of the newe. Let vs confute Egesippus, out of whom they haue all their fables, whereby they woold proue Peter to haue bin at Roome. First this fabulous and lying Egesippus is not hée that Eusebius maketh mention of Lib. fourth. Cap. 8.22. For hée gathered his books out of the Ghospell 
                     
                        •
                     ecundum Hebraeos & Syros, & hée wrote commentaries, wherin hée wrote the doctrine & actes of the preaching of the Apostles in an homely & simple stile inmanner of an history, and did contend erfectually against Heretiques: this fabulous Egesippus wrote in Greke. Secondly, this Author wryteth an highe stile, & affecteth an other kynd of phrase: the other is an homely stile, as Hierō noteth. This suborned Egesippus wryteth fyue bookes of the destruction of Hierusalem, out of Iosephus: the other the actes of the church, frō the passion of Christ to his own tyme, which was after Christes natiuity about .145. yeares. Thirdly, the trew Egesippus wrote the actes of the preaching and doctrine of the Apostles, out of the Ghospell secundum Hebraeos & Syros: this suborned Egesippus gathered his bookes out of Iosephus, neyther doth Hierom nor Eusebius make mention of them.
               
                  Fourthly, this Eusebius that wée haue, maketh mention of Constantinople, vnto the which the citie of Rome was equall in dignitie. This was done in the tyme of the Emperoures Gratian and Theodosius in the yeare of Christ, as Pantaleon noteth, 383. The true Egesippus was about the yeare of Christe, 146. and this Councell spoken of in the latter Egesypus, was about the yere of Christ 383. so that now it is manifest, that this latter Egesippus was 200. yeare and aboue after the former, and therefore such a one as serued to set out fables for the mayntenance of the Pope & his superstition: reade more in Cornelius Gualterus, vpon Egesippus, and in Vilierius. If a man doo well consider those fables, that Egesippus writeth lib. 3. c. 2. how that Peter and Simon Magus dyd contende whyther of them should renine Nero his Cosen that was dead, and how that, if Peter could not doo it, hée should dye for it: and if Simon could not, & that Peter could doo it, then Simon should suffer death. And howe that Peter met Christ at the gates of Rome, and asked of Christ, Domine quo vadis? And how that Christ answered, I come ageyne to bée crucified: and that Peter returned and was crucified with his héeles vpward. It may bée easely cōsidered that hée was one of the Popes friends, &c.
               
                  Ireneus in the first chapter of his third booke writeth, that Matthewe wrote his Gospell what tyme as Peter and Paule preached the gospell at Rome, & founded the hurch there. If Peter was at Rome at that tyme when Mathewe wrote his Gospell, then dyd not hée come to Rome in the second, third, or fourth yeare of Claudius, as the Catholiques reporte. For as yit Caligula was aliue, and in the third yeare of his Empyre and reigne, Matthewe wrote his Gospell. Neyther was Paule at Rome in the tyme of Caligula, in whose third yeare Matthew wrote his Gospell, euen eight yeare after Christes ascension, and 41. years after his natiuitie. For it was 24. years after Christes deathe, before Paule came to Rome. Howe could Paule preache at Rome the eyght yeare after Christes ascen
                     •
                  ion, when as hée came not to Rome vntill the 24. yeare after Christes ascension? Could hée preache at Rome before that hée was there? It was the seconde yeare of Nero, that Paule came to Rome, as shall appeare most manifestly

to them that will conferre the 28. of the Actes of the Apostles, with the order of tyme, with the yeares of the Emperours, and with Eusebius in Chronice, and Hierome in the lyues of Ecclesiasticall writers. Consider whether that Ireneus can make the 3. yeare of Caligula, which was the eight yeare after Christes Ascension, to bée the second yeare of Nero, whiche was the 24. yeare after Christes ascension. Nowe, if Peter came not to Rome tyll Paule was there, or if hée were there with Paule at any tyme, then could not Peter bée there tyll the seconde yeare of Nero, so that hée was neyther at Rome in the tyme of Caligula, who reygned thrée yeare: nor in the tyme of Claudius, who reygned 14. yeare. So that by this order, and playne demonstration, Ireneus woordes are neyther of force, neyther woorthy to bée read, & much lesse, to bée credited. Hierome writeth, that Peter came to Rome the second yeare of Claudius, which is no trewer then this that the same Hierome sayeth that Peter was the prince of the Apostles. Was hée the Prince of the Apostles, when Paule withstoode and reproued to his face? Galat. 2. ver. 11. whom Christ called Satan? who calleth himselfe but an Elder with the reste? 1. Petr. 5. who was sent by the other Apostles, Actes. 8? Could Peter come to Rome the second yeare of Claudius, when as Hierome himselfe in the same place sayeth, that first hée went to Antioche, where hée was Bishop, and from thence hée went and preached to the dispersed Brethren in Ponto Gallatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithinia, and then went to Rome the seconde yeare of Claudius and continewed there 25. yeare. If he came to Rome after that hée had bene at Antioche, and in these other countries, as Hierome reporteth, then came not hée to Rome the seconde yeare of Claudius, as the same Hierome contrudeth. For this yeare was the sixt yeare of Nero, which was after the second yeare of Claudius, 17. yeare, as I proue in this booke, and as it foloweth necessarely by the computation of yeares, and order of the historiographers. As concerning Eusebius, hée was an Arrian, and gathered his historie out of those bookes that were condemned in codice Sancta Romana, 15▪ 
                  dist. 11. And when hée was an Arrian, hée wrote this historie Tripart. lib. 2. cap. 7. Read lib. 2. cap. 11. of the sayd Tripartit. Hée is contrarie to himselfe, for hée sayeth lib. 3. cap. 2. that Peter came

not to Rome tyll the last yeare of Claudius, read Molineus & Rhenanus, & you shal find many mo reasons wherby ye may cōfute Eusebius. If ther bée any other authours in this errour, they may be as easely reiected as these.

This doctrine taught Doctor Smith, I heard him in Whitengton colledge in London, in Quéene Maries dayes. Hée moued manye affections, and tolde the tale on this wyse: Maysters, sayeth hée,Doctor Smithes Sermon. you are in a great errour, as concerning the blessed Sacrament, and all your trust was in Cranmer, Rydley, & Latymer. As for Latymer, hée sayd in open disputation in Oxforde, that hée had no learninge in that matter, but out of Cranmers booke. Besydes this, I disputed with Latymer 20. yeares agone: and then hée hadde no learning. As for Cranmer, hée sayde that his learninge came from Rydley. And as for Rydley,Doctor Smithes Argument. I disputed with him my selfe now at Oxeford the other day, and I proued my Argument thus: Ille, cui Christus obuiauit Romae, fuit Romae: At Christus obuiauit Petro Romae: Ergo, Petrus fuit Romae. Hée whom Christ met at Rome, was at Rome: But Christ met Peter at Rome: Ergo, Peter was at Rome. By this Argument I proue twoo thinges, and singuler mysteries of our fayth. First, that Peter was at Rome, ageynst them that clatter that Peter was neuer at Rome. Secondly, that if Peter met Christ bodely, as Abdias reporteth, and whiche I am sure is true, or else suche an auncient, and holy Father would neuer haue written it. Then consequently hée maye bée aswell bodely in the blessed Sacrament, as hée was met bodely. To this Rydley stoode lyke a block, and féelinge hym selfe conuicted, aunswered nothing. Then sayde I, Cur non respondes haeretice, haereticorum haereticissime. Dyd not I handle hym well? Then denyed hée the minor, which I proued thus: Christ met Peter goeing out of Rome, and sayed, good morrowe Peter, whether goest thou? Peter aunswered, good morrowe good man, whether goest thou? Then sayde Chryste, I goe to Rome too suffer, what? sayeth Peter, I trowe, onlesse I take my markes amisse, you are Ihesus Christe, good Lorde, howe doo you? I am

glad I haue met you here. Then sayd hée to Peter, goe backe and suffer, or else I must et pro te & me. When Rydley had heard this my profe, and Abdias authoritie, a Doctoure auncient and irrefragable, hée aunswered neuer a woorde. And thus I cenfuted Rydley in the audience of a thousand, that hée hadde not one woorde to saye: yet you say
                     •

                So let vs in this seconde Treatise conclude, that neyther hée neyther the Pope, neyther any of his Successoures is the heade of the Churche, neyther the Church or Seate of Rome to bée preferred before others. As out of the head and brayne, which is the seate of the senses whereof ryseth all knowledge (as the Philosophers and Phisitians write) and also as of synowes wherewith the partes of the body are knit and coupled togither, procéedeth the lyfe vitall and all mouinge.Theodoret. vpon ye Colos. cap. 2. ver. 19. Euen so from our head Christ, the fountaynes of grace are deryued, and flowe to water our soules, the synowes and sensible doctrine to instruct the mynde,Christe is the head of the Church. and the spirit of regeneration to renewe the whole man. As the heade and brayne minister too the whole body féeling and moouing: so is Christ the head of distributing to euery man seuerall gyftes of the Spirit.Ephes. 4. ver. 16.

                The Pope cannot forgyue synnes, Ergo hée is not the heade of the church▪ 
               Solus Deus condonat peccata, Onely GOD forgyueth sinne: The Pope is not God, Ergo hée forgyueth no sinne. As the man is the head of the Wooman, so is Christ the heade of the church. This Church are all the faythfull of all ages: the faithfull before the floode: the faythfull after the floode: The Faythefull before Christ, the faythfull after Christ. If a wooman should haue twoo Husbandes to her head, were shée an honest woman? were shée not an Adultres? were shée not to bée diuorced? Ergo, if the Romishe Church
                  •
                haue twoo heades, Chryste and the Pope: Shée is a Strumpette, an Harlotre, a Curtesane,

and the Churche of Satan. Moreouer, Christe is zeleous ouer his congregation, hée will haue no fellowes, hée is sufficient alone, hée néedeth not the Popes ayde. The Popes head may be dronke, Christes is alwayes sobre: his franitique, Christes perfect: his phantasticall, Christes substanciall: his feble, Christes stronge: his mortall, Christes immortall. Hée that maketh him self the head of the Church, hée must make him self her husband: but what an husband is the Pope? Surely an adulterer, if hée presume too take an other mans wyfe. Is not the Church Christes wyfe? Thā is shée not the Popes, because that shée can not haue two husbands at once. If hée bée an adulterous head, ergo hée is Antechrist.
            Howe coulde Peter bée Pope at Roome, when as it was not lawfull, nor permitted to teache, but priuatlie in houses? Where was his authoritie? where were bothe his swoordes, Temporall & Spirituall? Neyther had hée the Temporall to represse Nero his tyrannie, neyther the Spirituall to rule the Clergie. Was not Paule as good as Peter?Gala. 2. ver. 11 Did hée not resist him to his face? Was Paule inferiour to any of the Apostles? Howe chaunceth it, that Peter could not rule them, that put him to deathe? where was the mightie power of M. Pope? Is hée the head of the Church, whom Christ calleth Sathan?Math. 16. ve. 23. Is not that Satanas church, which Satan ruleth? But Peter is called Satan, Ergo that church which Peter ruleth, is the church of Satan. But saye the Papistes: Our Churche is founded vpon Peter.
                  After hee had sayd to Peter and vpon thee I will 
                        •
                     wilde my church, he calleth him Sathan. And Paule reproued him after this.

                Then is the foundation vitious, the buylding odyous, the pillers, which are the colledge of Cardinalles, very rotten and corrupt, and the pallace of Prelates pestilent, and all that they do beastlie, sensuall, carnall & of Antechrist. For Christ sayeth to Peter: Awaye Satan, hence Dyuell: for so signifyeth the Hebrewe woorde: thou offendest mée, thou sauorest of earthly thinges, and not of heauenly. If the head be Dyuelish, what are the members? what is the body? The Romishe churche is the body, is this churche without spotte or wrincle? is this of God? is this the piller of truthe? is this the Kingdome of God? Naye, it is as Petrarche writeth, the sinke of sinne, and pudle of Godes yre: A denne of Wolfes, Lyons, Foxes, Dragons, and Tigres. Peter sauored of earthly thinges, and sought earthly thinges, and so doo the Popes. Did not Peter moue Christ, that

they might make in the mount where Christ was gloriously transformed, thrée tentes? hée sauored of none other thing, then of earth.Ma. 17. ver. 4 And did Pope Leo any other thinge,Leo the 10. Pope. when hée answered Peter Bembus a learned Cardinall, alledging a sentence out of the Ghospell to him, that it was knowen well ynough in all ages,Busgradus. And B. how much that fable of Christ did profit the Popes and their successours and adherentes? And that ye shall vnderstand that the Church is neyther founded vppon Peter, nor of any other man, sainct Paule sayeth, that Christ is only the foundacion. And Christ,1. Cor. 3 ver. 1

                when the Apostles did stryue for superioritie & y• preeminencie, sayd to them, reprouing their ambition, that hée that presumed to be highest, should be lowest, and a minister too the rest.Mat 22. ve. 26 Luk. 22. ve. 16 Which woordes declare, that Christ woulde haue no superioritie amonge his Apostles. Did not Peter deny Christ thrée tymes?Math. 26. ver 34.

For saye they, Christ was poore, Psal. 8. ve. 67 wee bee riche. Christ a begger and had nothing, wee haue the whole worlde. And it is prophecied by Dauid of vs: Mat. 26. ver. 51. 
               Omnes subiecisti sub pedibus eius, oues & boues & pecora campi. To the Pope God hathe layd all thinges vnder his feete, sheepe, oxen, and all cattell. Peter did fyght and cut of Malcus eare, the Popes cut of the Emperours heades, fyght with them, subdue them, and treade vppon them. Theire foundation is the sword, fyre, fagotte, tyrannie, and all iniquitie. This sword Christ bad Peter put vp, they drawe it, and shaketh it ouer all Nations. Where proue they that Peter was the cheifest of the Apostles? where proue they, him too bée the best, or such a one as all the other shoulde obey? was hee the Uicegerat of Christ? can he doo all that Christ can doo? who was reproued of Paule, the least and lowest of all the Apostles?Gal. 2. ver. 11 1. Cor. 15. ver 6. where was his swoord than? where was his courageous stomacke? Did not little Paule dryue great Peter awaye? Wherfore yee see that the Pope founding his authoritie, ambition, vayne glory, Supremacie, dignitie, and superioritie, vppon Peter, must needes fall, it must needes bee grounded vppon errours and iniquitie.
            
               That which hath twoo heades is monstruous, but if Christ bée head, (as hée is the only head) and the Pope also, than is it a monstruous body. But more monstruous is that body, that hath thrée or foure heades:M

                   once, to many to be good. for at once there were thrée or foure Popes together, & euery one called him self head. Which of them was the head? let them answer, if they can: if they can not, let the head fall with the body. If Rome make the Pope holy, if the seate where the Pope is,The place maketh the Pope holy. can not erre, if his church bée catholique and vniuersall, how chaunced it that at one time in the yeare of Christ 1411. Clement was Pope at Auenion in Fraunce, Pope Vrbane at Roome, Benedict the .xiii. succeded Clement at Auenion in Fraunce, Gregorie the .xii. was the Pope at Rome, Iohn Pope at Bononia, and all deposed in the Councell of Constance. One of these reuiled an other, blasphemed an other, cursed, excommunicated, calling one an other Antechrist, Traytor, Murtherer, Sonnes of Beliall, Seruantes of Satan, Heretiques, Scismatiques, and Cruell Tyrauntes. If the presence of Peter make the place too bée the best, and of most authoritie, why was not Hierusalem the chief Cittie, the highe See, and the Metropolitane of the whole worlde? For there Peter preached first, and conuerted many thousandes. And ye can no

Socrates in his historie repeteth seuerall Metropolitanes, which are called Patriarches: for they were booth of one Authoritie.

The Pope had this beginning. After him euery Pope encreased his authoritie with priuiledges, statutes, decrées, and preceptes, tyll that they grewe to such dignitie, that they created Emperoures, who were wont to create them, they deposed them, they fought with them, they trode on their neckes, they rebelled ageynst thē, they cursed them with booke, bell, and candell lighted, they pardoned them all that would fight ageinst the Emperour.

Thou arte Peter, bicause thou beléeuest in Petra,Math. 16. ve. 18. that is in mée the Rocke: vpon the which I will buylde my congregation, whom I will to bée called Peters, as thou arte, deriuing their name of mée the rocke:euery faithfull man is a Peter. bycause who soeuer shal beléeue in mée as thou doest, I will gyue him ye same name that thou hast. Wherefore who so confesseth mée as thou doest, shalbe called Peter of mée Petra: that is, a christian of my name Christ. Hierom vpon the 8. of Mathew affirmeth, that Peter had his name of Petra, which is Christ. All are Peters which beléeue in this Rocke: I will buylde my famelie and congregation vpon it:1. Cor. 10. ve. 4 wherfore al my famelie and people are Peters. Peter in this place is put for all christians:Peter. and is a generall woorde signifying all beléeuers and confessoures of Christe. Therefore Hierome vppon the sixte of Amose, termeth all christes Apostles Peters. And ye Christ founded not his church vpō Peter (as our Romish catholiques cōtend) but vpon this rocke, which was Peters confession, yée shal vnderstand by the text it self. What was his cōfession? that Iesus christ was the sonne of God. Than this fayth of peters is the foundaciō of the church cleauing to Christ: which foundacion Paul defineth to be Christ, 1. Cor. 3. ver. 11. This church & congregation, bycause it confessed the same Christ, that Peter did, is very well termed & described by Paule,The Church. 1. Timothe. 3. ver. 15. to be the establishmēt and piller of truth: and by good reason, considering it is defined to bée Christes body, out of whose head is deriued whatsoeuer nourisheth the body. Who soeuer hath this fayth, and is a member of Christes body, is a Peter. As Christ is called a stone, so are his people and seruauntes named lyuely stones by participacion:1. Peter 2. ve. 5. as they are the light of the world, and salte of the earth: bycause the light and salte that they

haue, is deriued and procéedeth from him, as of Petra, Peters, of Chryst,Matth. 5. ver. 13. christians.
               That this is the true meaning of this place, it is euident hy the 18. chapter of Matthew, ver. 15. where the same doctrine is applied to all Christians,Math. 18. ver. 15. whan hée sayeth: If thy brother trespasse ageynst thée, tell him his faulte betwéene thée and him: If he heare thée, thou hast wonne thy brother. What is it too winne a mans brother, but to loose him from his sinne, wherwith hée was bound?To winne a mans Brother. By the which, if hée will not bée corrected, lette him bée as an Heathen and a Publicane. And thus hée is bound, bycause hée wil not repent. For, sayeth Christ, (speaking to all christians) what soeuer yée binde or loose vpon earth,Ma. 18. ver. 18 shalbée bound and loosed in heauen. Adam and Eue in Paradise were the true church, who when they heard the promise, how that the séede of the wooman, Iesus Christ, should burst the Serpentes head, beléeued it: vpon y• which beléefe Christ buylded his congregation:To bynde and l

They loused themselues in confessing their faulte, obeying chrystes voyce, lamentinge their facte, and beléeuing in him, who should bée borne of the séede of a wooman: their faith & confession of their offence with amendment of lyfe, were the keyes of heauen.The Keyes. By them they repossessed their felicitie, which was lost, and reentred into heauen. Christ graunted to twoo or thrée gathered togyther in his name,Math. 18. ver. 20 their requestes, and hée to bée among them. If this power and prerogatiue bée equall and particularly gyuen to euery christian, and generally to all: than is it not onely proper to the Pope. If all the congregation may binde and loose, then is the Popes authoritie nothing, and hée himselfe to be excluded as a reprobate, abhorred as a dissembler, defaced as an hipocrite, reiected as Psichicus in Tertullian was,Tertullian in his booke de Castitate. (who bragged as the Pope dooth, that he had authoritie to forgyue sinnes) deposed as an vsurper, and condemned as an Antichrist▪ The congregation is buylded vpon the rock. Who is the Rocke?

Heare Origen his interpretation discoursing vpō this place, who was within 235. yeares after Christ. If wée affirme and confesse sayeth Origene,
                  Origins. that Christ is the sonne of the immortall God, as Peter did, then are wée Peters, and shall obteyne the same felicitie that hée hath obteyned, because our confession and his is all one. If wée confesse Christ to bée the sonne of God, the father reuealing it too vs, it shalbée sayd to eche one of vs: Thou art Peter, and vpon thée I will buylde my congregation. Euery man is Petra, a Rocke, and lyuely stone, that is a follower of Christe, of whom they dranke, which dronke of the spirituall Rocke following them. Upon euery such rocke is the congregation of God buylded.1. Cor. 10. ve. 4 If a man ymagine the whole congregation and church to bée buylded vpon Peter only,Marc. 3. ve. 17 what will yée saye of Iames and Iohn, the thundering children, and other of the Apostles? In déed it was spoken to Peter,Math. 16. ver 18. thou art Peter, and vppon this rocke I will buylde my Congregation: Notwithstanding it is spoken in lyke manner to all the Apostles, and to all perfect and faythfull men: because they are all Peters and Rockes, and vppon all them and the prophetes is Christes church buylded:Ephes. 3. ver. 20. And the Gates of Hell shall not preuayle ageynst any of them. These gates of hell, are vyces, sinnes, and other corruption of mans nature, which shall neyther reigne in their mortall bodyes, neyther preuayle.

If these wordes were not common to all men, as they are (I will gyue vntoo thée the Keyes of the kingdome of Heauen) how can all those sayings and thinges which are applyed to Peter before bée commune to all men? For Christ thus spake in commune to them all: whom doo you saye that I am?Math. 16. ver. 13.14.1
                        •
                     . And Peter answered in the name of them all: Doth hée not vtter the same in playner woordes, In the 20. of Iohn, ver. 22.23. saying to all the Apostles, brething vpon them: Receyue the holy ghost: whose sinnes yée forgiue, they shalbée forgyuen, and whose yée retayne, shalbée reteyned. They were all of lyke authoritie with Peter. All they that are imitators of Christ,

are likewyse called Peters, and rockes, as Christ and his faythefull, of whom spirituall men drinke spirituall drinke. Of Christe all his are called Christes or christians, according to the Prophet, who sayeth, hée would saue his Christes. As Christe is called rightuousnes, and wysdome▪ so are wée called rightuous, because Christ is our rightuousnes and wisdome. So are christians named by other properties of God. Thus farre Origen,
                  Psichicus like the Pope Tertul in libr de cast. with much more. Tertullian in his booke of Chastitie, who was but 210. yeare after Christ, writing ageynst Phisicus, the highe Bishop of Bisshoppes, who tooke vppon him to forgiue sinne, adulterie fornication, and other vices, sayeth thus: Shewe mée examples of the Prophetes, and of the Apostles, and I will acknowledge thy holynesse, diuinitie, and godhead. If thou canst doo so, I will graunt thou canst forgiue sinne: If thy office bée onely to teache and mynister, then is it not to forgiue sinne?Ma. 18. ve. 22 How hast thou this authoritie? thou presumest of this place. But Peter was commaunded to forgyue his brother so oft as hée offendeth: which sentence perteyneth to all men. The church is not the nomber and rable of Bishoppes. This authoritie is of the Lord, and not of his seruaunts: of God, not of any priest. Who is without sinne? no man. Than no man can forgyue sinne. Who dare attribute to man that which is proper to God? who can loose an other man from death, saue onely the sonne of God? Hée in his passion delyuered the théefe from death. Wherefore, if thou followest him in forgyuing sinnes, and canst saye, thou hast not offended: I praye thée suffer for mée. If thou bee a sinner, how can thy oyle serue both for thée and mée, for thy lyght and myne? It is in Mat. 9. ver. 2. that Christ had power to forgiue sinnes, and know mens hartes, but thou canst doo neyther. If thou presumest, proue by scriptures, or by miracles, as Christe did. Thus farre Tertullian, with much more.
               
                  Augustine writeth thus vpon this place: Uppon this Rocke, which thou confessed, Peter: vpon this rocke which thou acknowledgest: saying, thou art Christ the sonne of the immortall God. Upon this Rocke I will buylde my Congregation: that is vppon my selfe the sonne of the immortall GOD: vppon mée I will buylde it, and not vppon

                  hée. Men béeing disposed to buylde

vpon men, sayd, I holde of Apollo, an other of Paule, an other of Cephas, which is Peter. The same Augustine vpon the .xxi. of Iohn, sayeth, this congregation can not fall, bycause it is founded vpon the Rocke, of the which Rocke, or Petra, Peter hath his name: for Petra, which is the Rocke, hath not his name of Peter, but Peter of Petra the Rocke. As Christ hath not his name of a Christian, but a Christian of Christ. Thus farre Augustine with many mo reasons. Christ is the end of my fayth, sayeth Ambrose vpon the ninth of Luke, the end of my fayth is the Sonne of God. Wherfore beléeue as Peter did, that thou maist bée blessed. The grace of Christ is great, which hath communicate almost all his names with his Disciples.Iohn 1. ver. 4 8.9. Iohn 8. ve 12 Iohn. 6. ve. 51 1. Cor.

                     0. ve. 4 Ma. 5. ver. 14 Math. 16. ve. 18. Christ is the light of the world, the lyuely bread, and the Rocke, and yet his Disciples are the light of world. Wée are all one bread, 1. Cor. 10. ver. 17. Neyther did Christ deny his Disciple the strenght and sowndnes of this word, bycause hée had the constancy of his fayth of Petra. The Rocke is the fayth in Iesu, and fayth is the foundation of the church. If thou beest a Rocke, thou shalt bée in the church, bycause the church is buylded vpon the Rocke. Thus farre Ambrose. And after this sense doo all the Gréekes and Latines interprete this place.
               Hell gates shall not preuayl against this fayth, this rocke, and against such as confesse Christ,Hierom vpon ye .38. of Esai. Hell. Gates. Gen. .22. ve. 17 Iob. 31. ve. 21 with as good a fayth as Peter did. The Metaphor is taken of the Gates, wherein the Iewes & Gentiles exercised their Iudgementes, as appereth in Moses and Iob. And bycause wicked Iudges did there gyue false sentences, absolued the offenders, and condemned the innocentes, therfore false Iudgement, and Tyrannicall Iudges, and iniurious Magistrats, are called Hell gates, that is, the Gates of death, the Iudgement seates of death. Origen and Ambrose vnderstand by Hell gates all vices. Such a strong rocke, such a valiant membre of Christ, and such a lyuely stone of Christes congregation, was Ieremy, whom God sayd,Ierē. 1. ve. 18 hée woold make a strong defenced Towne, an yron Piller, a Walle of stéele, against the hole land, against the Preistes, Kinges, people, and the mighty Princes of Iuda, and such Tyrauntes Ieremy intreateth of in the end of his fystenth chapter.

Neyther Peter had any other keys than Adam, Seth, Noe, Melchisedeck, Abraam, Iob, Moses, and all the faythfull had from the beginning. The keys of the Kingdome of heauen, are the opening and interpretacion of the Scripture. What keye (sayeth Tertullian in the .iiii. booke against Mar.) had the Doctours of the Lawe,The keys of heauen. saue interpretation? Tertullian inuehing ageinst the Eustix, affirmeth the keys to bée gyuen generally to all, the which euery man whan hée departeth hence, carieth with him. Wherfore, who so euer confesseth his sinnes, repenteth, and beléeueth in Christ, hath these keyes, wherwith hée openeth the locke, and entereth intoo heauenly felicitie. Euery man may bynde and loase him self. Augustinus de doctrina lib. 1. cap. 8. sayeth: Too binde, is too perseuer in errour,

               The second Obiection.
               Hée that giueth authoritie too the Church, is supreme head. But the Pope giueth authoritie to the church, ergo hée is supreme head. I deny your assumption, called otherwyse the Minor. Wée proue it (say they) by S. Augustine, who sayeth: I wold not beléeue the Scriptures, if the catholique church should not moue mée. I answer: This church that Augustine speaketh of, is not the church of Rome: and therfore the Pope giueth no authoritie to the church. If Augustine had meaned the church of Rome, then their argumēt myght haue semed to haue had a good ground. But Augustine meaned the church of Christ, as the Crede it self expoundeth it. What is the Catholique Church?The Catholique church. The Crede answereth and interpreteth in these words: A communion, societie, or companie of all Saincts and Godly men.
               Nowe, if Rome bée all the world and a communion of Saincts

only, then is it the only Church: but it is neyther all the world, neyther a communion of Saincts, therfore it is not the Church. Are shamefull synners Saincts? horrible offenders Holy?
               Augustine meaned by the Catholique Church, Christ and his Disciples, and the consent of all them, which sawe Christ, which heard him and his Disciples: and therfore is it called in the common Crede of Nice, the Apostolique church. If Augustine did imagine that the Scriptures should take authoritie of the church, it had bin an absurditie: considering that there is no congregation so perfect, no company so holy, no men so pure, which do not dayly desire God too forgyue them their offences, as they forgyue them that offend against them. If wée saye, wée sinne not, wée are lyers, and there is no truth in vs.1 Epist. Iohn cap. 1. ver. 8. Let vs proue both by Reason, which is the Lawe of Nature, infixed in man Naturally, and by Scripture, that the Church doth take her authoritie of the Woord, and not the Woord of the Church.

                   as Tullie testifieth, affirme partly by the Naturall motions of their myndes, no doubt moued by inspiration, that there is a GOD: partly by the presciencie and foreknowledge of the thinges to comme, partly by the commodities which proceede of the temperature of the ayer, the plenty & abundance of all thinges necessary for mans vse: partly by tempestes, thunder, inundacions, hayle, lightening, earthquakes, stormes, wonders, miracles, blasing starres, eclipses of Sonne and Moone, of the reuolution of the heauens, of the constant and certein course of the fixed Starres and Planettes.

                   Their sound are gone through all the world. Or as it is in the Hebrew: Their rule & course is knowē through all the world. By a figure the sound & voyce is attributed in the .19. Psal. to the heauens, bycause they declare vntoo vs with their constant course mouing, and other meruelous dispositions, constellations, and influences, that there is a God. And by this meanes Paule

proueth the Gentyles to bée without excuse,Rom. 1. ve. 20 And as the woorked of God are not ye causes why there is a God but as witnesses, so is the Churche a witnes, but no cause. bycause they might haue knowen God by his creatures, and dyd knowe, but dyd not glorifye him as God. By these it is euident, that the heauens and Gods woounderous workes are not the causes why there is a God, but God is the cause of them, and they are as witnesses, and testimonies, that there must néedes bée a God. And bycause al the Scriptures teache nothing else but God to bée the maker, defender, and gouerner of all, wée are assured that they are the true scriptures, bycause they agrée with this lawe of Nature, wyth this Heauenly description, and celestiall disposition, wherby there is vnderstand to bée a God. If Dauid and Paule prooue the diuinitie, power, and prouidence of God by his creatures, so must wée allowe the scriptures by the same meanes, bycause they differ not from the discourse. Wherefore the church taketh no authoritie of it selfe, but of God: nor the scriptures any power of men, whiche are full of erroures.
               Wée knowe, Moses, Danyels, Salomons, Iobs woorkes, and the rest of the scriptures to bée of force, bycause they agrée with the rule of nature. They are witnesses, but no authours. If a Lawyer aunswere by the Lawe, hée dooth his dutie: but if hée aunswere of his own brayne, it is nought, neyther will any man beléeue him. Hée is a wicked Iudge that attributeth more to hys owne witte and will, than to the lawe. This doth the Pope, contrarie to all the auncient Doctours, and vertuous writers, who affirme no man to bée beléeued, onlesse hée alleadge the scriptures. If an Ambassadour goe from one Prince to an other, and be commaunded neyther to adde to his commission, nor diminishe, hée is a traytour if hée doo. How much more the Pope, who by his false embassage, dooth not onely adde and diminishe where hee lusteth, but also chaungeth, peruerteth, correcteth, depraueth, and abolissheth the Scriptures, setting vppe hys owne constitutions and braynelesse Decréees. The Prince to whome this Embassadour is sent, cannot tell whether his commission is true or no, but by conferring of the other Princes letters, out of the which he must haue the truthe: So must wée runne to the scriptures, and trye by them whether the Pope and other impure spirits doo well in vsurping such authoritie. The Church may bée a witnesse,the Churche a witnes.
                  
that these are the Scriptures, as the heauenly bodyes, that there is a God: are the scriptures any better, although they bée as testimonialles? The church may bée witnesse, the faythefull people may testifie that these are the scriptures, and yet the scriptures perfect, constant, and certayne of them selues.

               The third Obiection.
               The Pope is called in the first chapter of the Gospell of Iohn, ver. 42. Cephas, and Cepha in the Gréeke toung is Caput, a head, Ergo the Pope is head of the church.Lira. vpon. ye 1. of Iohn. Cephas. saith Lire 15. Capitan. Ibidem. Anacletus. Your ignorance is intollerable: you despise the tunges, yée will rather cleaue to your olde errours, and gloses, then to séeke for the truthe. You forsake the fountaynes, and digge and drinke of pudles and kennelles: You wrest and turne the scriptures from the meaning of Christe, too satisfie your own opinions. Your reading in the Texte Cephas, which is a Syrian woorde, thought that it had ben Cephale, a gréeke woorde. For, saye you, Cephas is an head in gréeke, and commeth of Cephale,
                  Iohn. i. ve. 42 and therefore you saye that Peter, who was called Cephas, is the head of the church, when as Cepha, the Syrian word, which signifyeth a stone, being turned into Gréeke, soundeth Cephas. Thus yée turned whyte into blacke: y ée choppe, ye chaunge, ye turne, ye peruerte and depraue all for lacke of knowledge. For Christ sayeth,Euthim. vpō this place, that wheras Peter was called before Symon, his name should be chaunged and called Cephas, which is a stone, as Iohn himselfe interpreteth it. Bycause that not onely Peter, but also all they that beléeue in Christ,Iohn 1. ve. 42 are lyuely stones. As out of a stone commeth fyre, so dooth burning charitie out of godly men. As a stone or Rocke is stronge, stedfast and firme, so is euery Peter, I meane euery Christian, ageynst whose fayth no Tyrannie, no Hell gates, no persecution, no affliction, can preuayle. What doo I saye, doo they not preueyle? yea, they preuayle ageynst the bodye, the Soule they cannot kyll.

                   bycause that shée is first named in the text, and Aquila after her. But that cannot bée, for S. Paule sayth that the man is the woomans head. This woord Protos, as Theophilacte interpreteth, hath hys respect onely to his brother Andrewe, who was called before, and Peter after, for they twoo were protokleti. And notwithstanding that Peter is named first in some places, yit is Andrewe named before him, as in the first of Iohn, ver. 44. Philip, sayeth Iohn, was of the same Citie that Andrewe & Peter were of. And in the 24. ver. of the 20. chaptes of Mathew, the other 10. were offended with Iames & Iohn. In ye which text Peter was not named the first but only with the rest. We are forbidden to giue Supremacie too any Bishop. Esoitai oi eschatoi protoi.

               The Popes may lawfully depose Emperoures.The same. wrote Paule the 4 pope of that name in ye yere of Christ 1556. the .4. day of may in his bul which I sawe in prynte. psal. 91. ver. 13. For as the Moone taketh light of the Sunne, so dooth the Emperour of the Pope. And the Pope maye treade vppon the Emperoures necke, as Pope Alexander dyd vppon the necke of Fredericke, the seconde Emperour of that name. And that was prophecied longe before by Dauid, a friend of ours, in these woordes: Super Aspidem & Basyliscum ambulabis, & conculcabis Draconem & Leonem: Thou shalt walke vppon the Adder and Basyliske, and shalt tread vppon the Dragon and Lyon. O you Tyrauntes, O you rebelles. Where is your Truthe, where is your Obedience? Was it not spoken of Christe, and so generally to all good men, ageynst whome the force of the Deuill should not preuayle? Doo you so intreat your Kinge and Prince?
               Howe dare you bée so bolde, as to call your Emperoure Aspis, Basylick, Lyon and Dragon? much lesse ought you to tread vppon them, too putte them too deathe, and too depose them.

They haue authoritie by Gods woord too rule ouer you,Theodoret & Chrisostome vpon the .13. to the Rom. too haue you in subiection, and not you them. You alledge Scripture as though the Dyuell did too Christ: and the next verse, too that which the Dyuell alledged: as though the Dyuell and the Pope were saying Matynes toogether.
            
            
               The sixth Obiection.
               Well say what ye will, our holy Father may do what hée list. What, if hee should sell the whole world, perhaps ye will say that it were Symonie: but I will sweare vppon a booke, that it were no Symonie, though hée solde the whole world, bycause that hée selleth but his owne: for so our olde freind Dauid prophecied vppon him:Psal. 8. ve. 6.7 
                  Omnia subiecisti sub pedibus eius, oues & boues & pecora campi. Thou hast put all thinges vnder his féete, all shéepe and oxen, yea all the beastes of the field.
               O heauen, O earth, the Dyuell alledged Scripture more probably. Surely Dauid speaketh of man, too whom God hath giuen all thinges for his vse & commoditie: and Allegorically too Christ, whom hée hath made Lorde and King ouer all.

               I answer, that the sayd Panormitane made an Oration too that

effect, and made the Pope Lorde ouer the Church: notwithstanding the Bishoppe of Argens, Iohn Segouius, and Fraunces de Funx, Diuines, confuted that errour in the said Councell, & proued Pope Eugenius the fourth of that name to bée a relapse, and an heretique: bycause yt hée tooke vpon him too dissolue, transporte, & prorogue that Councell.

               I deny the proposition, which you call the Maior, for Christ prayeth for all men, as well as for Peter,Iohn 17. ve. 9 Luc. 23. ve. 34 and also for them that persecute him: ergo by your argument, all men should bée head of the Church, yea euen they that persecute Christ, as the Pope doth. Augustine wryteth, that Peter figureth all Christians,Augustine vppon ye psalmes & the vniuersall Church: ergo when Christ prayed for Peter, yt hée should not erre, hée prayed also for all Christians, and for the vniuersall church, that it should not erre. And that this is Christes meaning,Mat. 26. ver. 75. Galat. 2. verse 11.14. ye shall vnderstand by the often fall of Peter after this prayer of Christ: for hée denyed Christ thrise, & was also reproued of Paule after this prayer.

               Moreouer, Paule exhorteth the elders of Ephesus too féede the flock and church of God committed too their charge:Act. 20. ver. 28 wherfore too féede Christes shéepe, is as well proper too all men that haue the gift, as too Peter.

               I answer, that you call the church of Rome the Pope & his Cardinalles,Matt. 18. ver. 19. but Christ calleth his church generall, and not speciall, a communion of Saincts, and not a rable of Bishoppes, as Tertullian writeth, Catholique and not Priuate. For Christ sayeth, wheres
                     •
                  euer there be two or thrée gathered together in his name, there is hée among them,Matt. 18. ver. 19. yea though they bée Laye men, as Tertullian noteth. Is the Pope the churches sonne? or is hée her father? If her sonne, what a sonne is hée, that vsurpeth and preferreth him self before his mother? Therfore sayeth Augustine: God will not acknowledge him self to be his father, that will not confesse the church to be his mother. If her father, ergo not her child.
               You say, the Pope is the head. I answer, that when the Pope is cut of by death, where is your head? is it not dead? where is the body? is it not dead? But the body that is the Church, lyueth alwayes, eyther Militant, or Triumphant, or rather both: Ergo wée must looke for an other head, that can not dye, euen Christ aboue.

                  Act. 1. ver 4I answer to this obiection on this wyse: Wée reade that Christ called the first councell, willing the Apostles not too departe out of Hierusalem but to looke for the promise of the Father. In

the election of the seuent deacons (which was the second councel) Peter did not call the councell, but .12.Act. 6. ve. 5. Apostles called the multitude. The thyrd councel was called in the .15. of the Actes.Act. 15. ve. 18 Where it apereth that Iames was the chéefe and not Peter. Was the Pope called to any of these councels? Nay surely, they neuer knew him.

               We haue a place out of Dauid Psal. 19. ver. 4.Fundamenta. de elect. in sexto. say the Papistes which no heretique can deny. Their sound is gone thorowgh the whole world. In omnem terram exiuit sonus eorum. The sound of our holy father and of his successours is gone through the world, his pardones, his legates, his belles, his bulles, his commissions, his grace, his power, his prerogatiue, his athoritie, is in euery corner of the earth. I answere that this place of Dauid proueth that the merueylous workes of God, as the Starres, the Moone, the Sun and the descryption of the heauenly bodies, declare that ther is a God, and bycause that Dauid expresseth the matter more effectually in his naturall toung, thus he sayeth.
               
                  Hashamaim, mesapperim Cheuod el, oumaguas hiadeue, magid harachiang, tom leiom iabbiang omer, velaiel lelaiela iecaue daguath. En omer, veen debarim beli nishmaug colam.

Ve hu Cerhathā iotse mecuppatho, iashis che gibbor larats orac. mictse hashamaim motsao ou to couphato gual chet sotham, ve en iustar me canematho. Hitherto I haue repeted & confuted (althogh they nede no confutation, they were so falsely alleged) some obiections although not al which they collect out of the Scriptures, or out of other probable authors. Now I will note certein such absurdities, as they bring out of their lawes, decrées, decretals, & out of such as haue for lucre, promotiō, & for flatterie bestowed their time in vttering absurdities, and such absurdities, as do more effectually ouerthrowe & deface their dooings, then any of our answers or confutations can.

These I thought good to signifie, least that any man should thinke that the tyme is euyll bestowed in writing them, worse in reading: and worst of all, in printing. Ye shall therefore vnderstand, that there is nothing so abhominable, nothing so absurde, so vnreasonable and contrarie to all sense, whiche they dare not bothe speake, write, printe, aduouche, and also defend. As for example:
               What say they, though Iulius the second Pope dyd throwe Peters keyes into Tyber,
                     Iulius 2. and swore an horribe othe, that séeing they would profite nothing, hée would trye what Paules swoord could doo.
                     Iulius 3. And what, though Iulius the thirde blasphemed for his hoggos fleshe, saying: putano de Dio, dispetto de Dio, bring mée my hogges fleshe. And likewyse for his Peacock, when one asked, why hys holynesse was so mooued, hée aunswered: If God caste Adam out of Paradise for eating of an Aple, what would you haue mée too doo for my Peacock? Is not my peacock better then an Aple? And thus they aunswer such blasphemies: that, in that the Pope was a man, hée offended, but in that hée was Christes Uicegerent, hée could not sinne: For, saye they, though hee were a desperate man, yet the seate and place, maketh him holye.
            
            
               Now I come to their Obiections which they alleage out of their Canons and Doctours.
               The first Obiection.
               
                  HE is, saye they, the head of the Church that ruleth the whole world. But the Pope ruleth the whole world▪ Ergo hée is the head of the Church.
               I denye the Minor. They proue it by Thomas, the irrefragable Doctour, in these woordes: The Pope (sayeth hée) is chiefe Bishoppe. For as a King ruleth his realme, so doth hée the whole world: and Bishoppes, for his helpe and ease, are ioyned in euery citie, as Iudges, Thom. secund. secund.
                  
4.98. art. 9. & 4.20. art. 4. What an argument is this of Thomas of Aquine? Is it a good comparison to compare a subiect with a King? or rather preferre him before the kinge of the Romanes?
               
                  1 Where was his authoritie, when Nero persecuted (as they saye) Peter?
                  2 Was not Linus (as they reporte) the second Pope at Rome,Many of the first learned men whom they call Popes, put to death. in the yeare of Christ 82? Where was his vniuersall power? where was his might, when hée was put to death of Saturninus, the Consul of Rome, who was inferiour to Vespasian, being Emperour at that tyme?
                  3 Did not Domitian kill Anacletus? an. 84.

                  27. So Melchiades, an. 314.
               
               The Papistes say, that all these were Popes. I praye you, how ruled they all the world, as Thomas sayeth, the Popes doo? where was their auctoritie aboue all Kinges, Princes, Emperours, and Monarches? If of God, or of Peter, or of them selues, why did they not resist? why were they put too death? If they had none, as none they had in deede, than of whom had the Popes following their power & tyrannie, to kill innocentes, to depose Emperours, to disgrade Bishoppes, to rule in hell, heauen, earth, and purgatorie, to absolue à poena & culpa, to do what they lust, to oppresse, banish, and murther?
            
            
               The second Obiection.
               Well say what you will, the Pope is meruelous, for hée hath his name of merueling. And hée is to be wondered at, bycause hée is Peters vycegerent in the earth,

                   for hee hath his name of Papae, an Interiection of merueling. And without doubt, hée occupieth not the place of a pure man, but of the true God. Textus est in Codice int. corpor. de transl. Episcopi. I answer: You say that hée hath his name of Papae, an Interiection of merueiling, & in deede the Reuelation and Paule sayeth, that Antechrist, when hée shall come,Apoc. cap. 17. ver. 3.4.5. 2. Thes. 2. ve. 4. which is the Pope, shall woorke meruailes, and do false myracles by Necromancie and iniquitie.
            
            
               The third Obiection.

               The fifth Obiection.
               Doo you not knowe that the Popes name is chaunged in hys Creation, Consecration, and enstalling, that by the chaunging of the name the man may likewise bee chaunged.

                   For where hée was a pure man before, now is hée become the Uicegerent of the true God: as in example: Who was a cruell tyraunt before, is nowe chaunged and called Clemens. Hée that was hurtfull, is now Innocent: Hée that was a maleface, Boniface: and so foorth of the rest.
               Hath not the Pope both the swoordes? Is not hée an heretique that breaketh the constitution of the Pope, or that holdeth, that the Pope is not able to make a constitution? hée is a paynim that wil not obey the Pope. The Pope may depose the Emperoure without a Councell, yea with a cause or without a cause: Stat pro ratione voluntas.
               
               These Obiections are thus to bée aunswered, that, as none of these are conteyned in the scriptures, no more are they to bée credited than fables of Homer, or Ouide. In chaunging their names, they detect their hypocrisie: who will beléeue that the chaunginge of a mans name will make an euill man, a good man: of a dishonest, an honest? Besydes this, is not the Pope a man still, though hée bée anoynted consecrated, enstalled, and entromyzed? Is not an Axe, an Axe, though hée haue a Childes coat vppon his backe? ought hée to rule the Empernur? Is not hée bounde too gyue too Caesar, that which is Caesars?
                  Luc. 20. ve. 25. Iames de terra. Notwithstanding one cursed Iames de Terano, Chamberlayne to Vrbane the sixt Pope of that name in the yeare of Christ 1385. interpreteth this place of Luke, of the Emperours before Christes passion, but after that Chryste was ascendeth into heauen as victor and conquerour, hée writeth thus: When I shalbée lifted vp from the ground, I will drawe all too my selfe,Iohn. 1

Paule to the Romanes, prouing that all Bishopes & such as wée call Spirituall men,Rom. 13. must needes bée vnder the Iurisdiction of Ciuill Magistrates, obey them, and paye them Tribute. Besides this, this Iames proueth, as Augustinus de Ancona did .lxxx. yeares before him, that the Pope had not only authoritie ouer all Kinges and Emperours that were Christend,The Popes power. but also ouer Turkes & Paymins, bycause that Christ gaue his full authoritie too the Pope when hée ascended, & that Iuditiary power (for these are his termes) ouer euery creature, because that hée left the Pope both the keyes, Temporall and Spirituall.
            
            
               The sixth Obiection.

And hée hath thrée Crownes, bycause that hée is a Kinge, a Cesar, and a Bishoppe: or rather, bycause bée hath authoritie in Heauen, Hell, and Purgatorie: or els, as Gregorius Doctor Hispanus did preache in Cambredge, hée sayd, that the Pope was counted in Spayne, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, & that was signified by his thrée crownes.

I graunte that the flattering Glosers of the Canon lawe wryte such thinges, but they are too foolish too bée credited, too false and absurd too bée approued, too ridiculous too bée aduouched, and to detestable to bée admitted.

And on an other feast day hée came out in the apparel of the Emperour with great pompe and glorie, with a naked swoord, shaking it, and saying: This is my swoord to correct the Temporall withall: yea euen Kinges, Princes, and the Emperour. I aunswere, that this hée dooth by this rule: Sic volo, sic iubio, stat pro ratione voluntas. For that hée dyd without reason or authoritie.

                  But wée credit not these sayinges, bycause they are made by Popes without authoritie, eyther of Gods woorde, or of olde Doctors. Wherefore this is that Antichrist, that is described in the Reuelation, cap. 13. cap. 17. cap. 18.

                  Peter ye head of the church.Hée that hath the same authoritie that Peter had, is the heade of the church. But the Pope hath the same authoritie that Peter had. Ergo the Pope is the head of the church.
               I denie the Maior, for Peter was not the head of the church, nor any better then the other of the Apostles. Moreouer, Peter was a meere man, and a meere man was not the head of a spirituall church.

                  Remundus rufus, a noble defendor of the holy Sea of Rome,Rufus reasoneth thus, the Pope is the cheife because he is the first in tyme, reuerence and power. In time, for Peter was at Rome the fyrste Pope: in reuerence for who is too be reuerenced more then he? in power, what Bishop, what Prelate, what Monarche is to be compared to him? I answere to the firste, that Peter was neuer at Rome, and therefore was neither firste Pope nor last at Rome: moreouer Paule was at Rome before him, by ye testimoni of their owne wryters.
               And Peter was no bishop, ergo no bishop of Rome: Peter was an Apostle and no bishop. A bishop kept in a certain place:Peter no vis. an Apostle went aboue euery where. As for his reuerence, what reuerence should the Pope haue aboue others?Math. 20. ve. 26. if he wilbe first hée must be last, as Christ writeth. As concerning his power, what is it? Who gaue it to him? He is or ought to be a seruaunt, no lorde: a minister, no maister, a member of the body and not the head.
               What if Rome were vtterly destroyed by the Turke (as it may be) and the Popes name, glory, dignitie, and memory, cleane extinguished, where should the Romish church be? where should bée all hir decrées? should not all bée vtterly abolished?2. Thess. 2. ve. 8. shall not Christ destroy him with the sprite of his mouth?

                     The Pope is God.
                   that no christian magistrats should haue any power aboue the Pope, bicause that hée is called god, as Antonius writeth. tit. 16. If no magistrate haue iurisdiction ouer him, if no man, may appeach him, if he be god, is he not worthy to be the head of the Church? I graunt that he taketh vpon him all these tytles, and so the deuel would haue done, who moued Christ to sitte downe and worship him, and hée

would gyue to him the whole world.

What if I should denye the Maior, ye could not proue it: but I will deny the Maior: hée that can make him that is better then the virgin Marye, is better then the virgin Marye: But the Pope can make a priest, which is better then the virgin Mary: Ergo the Pope is better then the Uirgin Marye. A priest is better then the virgin Mary in this poynt,Bullengerus, in Apocalips. that she bare Christ but once, but the priest euery daye. I could answer this by the like absurditie of yours after this sorte. You say that a priest can make god: But hée that can make god, is better then god: Ergo the priest is better then god.A Priest maketh God. But the Pope can make a priest, if the priest who is an inferiour can make god, what can the Pope make who is superiour to a priest? Surely a thing aboue god: doth not the Pope in making of god, exalt him selfe aboue god. Therfore he is that man of sinne and child of perdition that is spoken of in the second to the Thessalonians. cap. 2. ver. 3. and .4.

To bée brief, hée gaue this tytle to the Frenche King to bée Christianissimus, most Christian King, and to the King of England to bée Defensor fidei, Defendour of the fayth.

               If there were nothing to proue the Pope to be head of the churche sauing his apparell and ornamentes, yet surely they might perswade any man too beleue, to maintaine, and to glorifie, our holie father the Pope,The speciall power of the Pope. dothe not Buechingerus and Inocentius Libro. 3 de Altaris mysterio ca. 1. et. 10. affirme that there are .9. special ornamentes: his hose, his shoes, or sandalles, his succynctory or girdell, his Tunicle, his Dalmatica or longe sleued Gowne, his Metre, his Gloues, his Ring, and Staffe. In these consisteth the speciall power of the Pope, euen to geue orders, to blesse Maides, to consecrate Bishopes, to laye on handes, to make grese or Chrisma, to consecrate clothes and vessales, to call Sinodes, to dedicate Temples, and to depose them that are disgraded, and do many other merytorious workes.
               What shall I speake of his two horned mitre? of the hemmes of his garment? of his crosse and staffe? of his chimer? and other vestements. His shoes pardoned venyall sinnes, his staffe hathe many vertues, the crooked horne, fetcheth in them that go astray, the ende knocketh the obstinate, refourmeth the disobedient. What shall I speak of his breches, and handkirchef. Of his kniues and twoedged Swerds? of his goulden hamer I haue spoken before.
               I answer that theise more comend the Pope and set forth his prayse, then his vertues do: He glorieth in his apparell, Paule in Christ his crosse, he in outward things, Paule in inward, he in pompe, Paule in pouertie, he in vayne glory of the world, Paule in the ioyes of Heauen. Is not all this apparell corruptible? will it not consume? will not his crowne in tyme weare away and decay?

I denie the Minor, wée proue it, Let vs sée if you find any day in the yeare dedicated to any Saincte, which the Pope did not dedicate, and consecrate. Hée made the Apostles dayes: the foure Ladye dayes, made Corpus Christi a Sainct, S. Peters cheynes, S. Graue or S. Sepulchre, S. seuen Sléepers, s. Sonday, s. Grimbold, S. Chrisogon. s. Gorgon, s. Rooke, s. Dunstone, s. Thomas Becket, whom King Henry dyd vnsainte, and disgrade: holy Iohn Shorne, holy King Henry: many a Prelate, Bishop and Pope, and in fine, al his benefactours, for whom he commaundeth euery Priest to pray for in his Canon of the blessed masse, which we trust he will make a Sainct, one day, for surely she is our good Mistres, she prospereth Prelats, exalteth Hermits, aydeth Hunters, purgeth Pigs, helpeth Hogs, causeth raine, and faire weather, deliuereth out of Purgatorie, and directeth generall councelles. Finally she were as worthy to be a Sainct as any of them all.
               
                  I aunswere, that the Pope taketh vpon him to doo and saye so. But thinke you that hée can doo so? Surely hée hath made some saincts that are deuilles, and some that there were neuer none such. What manner of Sainct is sainct Sondaye? or Rymon, or s. Gyners, or s. Redygons, or s. Apellinare for tootheache: Ualentine for Louers: Loe for Smithes, Crispine, Martine and Chrispinian for Shoemakers, Nicolas, and Cletus for Clarkes, and yit many write ther was neuer none such as Cletus:Euseb.

If hée haue neyther charitie nor learning, hée is an Image or Idoll, no more able to aunswere, then a stone. Though ignorance were tollerable in other Bishoppes, yet it is vntollerable in the Pope. Why should not hée that is Superiour in place, and inferiour in knowledge, bée contented to bée iudged by him that is inferiour in place and superiour in knowledge? Thus much writeth Arnulphus, with much more: reprouing superioritie, condemning ostentation, and repressing the intollerable arrogancie of the Pope.

               Christ forbiddeth to breake any of the ten commaundements.
               The Pope sayeth, that hée maye breake the first and seconde, bycause that onely God is not too bée prayed vnto, but also saincts: and that the Images maye bée woorshipped, and the crucifix wyth the adoration of Latreia, aswell as the blessed Sacramentes.

               Christ is the true Image of his Father.
               The Pope is an Idoll, which hath eyes and sée not, eares and heare not, as Robertus Gallus writeth in the yeare of Christ, 1290.
               Christ had no earthly possession. The Pope possesseth all, which possession to bée gyuen by Constantine: Marsilius Patauinus, denieth: Valla confuteth it, and Cusanus, and Cattalanus reproue it, in the yeare of chryst, 1496.

               The Pope calleth himselfe the chiefe of all. Here I subscribe the woordes of Marsilius Patauinus, who was in the yeare of Christ, 1324.
               All Bishoppes should bée of equall authoritie, neyther should the Pope haue any superioritie aboue other Bishoppes,Marcili

The clergie and the Pope to bée subiectes to the Emperoure. The church to bée the congregation of the faythfull. Chryst to bée the head of the church. Neyther dyd appointe any other Uicare or pope: Bishoppes too bée elect of the church or clergie: priestes to haue wyues: that Peter was neuer at Rome. The popes Synagoge to bée a Denne of Robbers: the popes doctrine to carry men to eternal damnation. Thus much Patauinus
               
               Christ sayeth, that the Kinges rule the Gentyles: But it shall not bée so emong you.Luc. 22. ve. 25. The pope sayeth, that neyther Kinge nor Emperour hath any power, authoritie, or iurisdiction, but of the pope, neyther can bée of any force, tyll they be annoynted, consecrated, and crowned by the Pope, who hath full power, aswell in

thinges temporall as spirituall. Thus writeth Ludouicus the 4. Emperoure of that name confuting the sayd presumptuous arrogancy of the Pope. Iohn the 22. of that name.Ludouicus.
               
               Christ sayeth that the sentence and iudgement of Chaiphas and Pilate was vniust.
               The Pope sayth that his sentence, whither it be iust or vniust must be obserued, reuerenced, accepted, defenced, and feared. This errour the sayd Emperour refelleth with many reasons and authorities.

               I do not bring these Arguments collected out of the popish lawes and wryters, for that they néede any confutacion, but that men may learne with what stuffe and Trumperie they confirme their errours.

                  No man sinneth that is borne of God:
                  The Pope is borne of God:
                  Ergo the Pope sinneth not
                  The fiist proposition is proued out of the firste of Iohn verse .9.
                  The second I will proue by a Sillogisme in Barbara.
                  
                  Euery one that is holy is borne of God:
                  Phe Pope is not only holy, but also most holy.
                  Ergo euery Pope is borne of God.
                  The first proposition is euident.
                  The second is proued by the Popes bulles which are more to bée credited then the Gospell, for the Pope may interpret the Gospell

how he will, but no man may Interprete the Popes Bulles.
               
               
                  I aunswer.

                  The Pope is a man.
                  Ergo the Pope sinneth.
                  The first proposition is proued by the .14. Psalme of Dauid. ver. 3.Ro. 3. ver. 10.11.12.
                  
                  There is none that doth good, no not one.
                  I wyll proue by a Sillogisme in Barbara, the second proposition.
                  Euery creature reasonable and mortall is a man:
                  Euery Pope is a reasonable and mortall creature.
                  Ergo euery Pope is a man.
                  The first proposition is proued by the deffinition of a man.
                  The second proposition is proued by Athanasius Creede, where he sayeth that Christ consisteth of a reasonable soule, and a humane flesh. And by the first to the Cor. 15. chap. ver. 22.54. Rom. 6. ver. the last. And Hebrues the .9. ver. 27. whereby euery man is proued too be mortall.

                  He that can make God, is better then God:
                  The Pope can make God:
                  Ergo the Pope is better then God.
                  The Maior is proued by this principle of Lodgike:
                  The cause efficient is better then the effect.
                  The second proposition is proued by this Silogisme:
                  
                  That which a priest can do, the Pope can do:
                  The priest can make God:
                  Ergo the Pope can make God.
                  The Maior of this Argument is proued by the same principle of Lodgike that the other former Argument was.
                  The second proposition is proued by this Argument:
                  He that can make the Sacrament of the Alter can make God:
                  
                     The Priest can make the Sacrament of the Aulter.
                  Ergo a Priest can make God.
                  The Maior proposition is proued by this place. Hoc est corpus meum,
                     1 Cor. 11. ver. 24. 
                     quoties cunque feceritis. &c.
                  
                  The second proposition is proued by daily massing & by the words and déedes of many a priest, who will not stick to saye that they haue made him an hundreth tymes and no lesse.

                  That consequentlie it followeth by these Arguments of the Papists, that the Pope is better then God, and also elder then either God or the world.
               
               
                  Obiection.
                  He that can remitte sinnes is God:
                  The Pope can remitte sinnes:

                  The Maior is in Luke the .5. verse .21.
                  The Minor is proued by this Argument.
                  He that can giue the holy Ghost can remitte sinnes:
                  The Pope can giue the holy Ghost:
                  Ergo the Pope can remitte sinnes.
                  The Maior is in the .1. Thessalo. 4. ver. 8. in the which place it is said, that God giueth the holy Ghost, and as God can giue the holy Ghost so can he remitte sinnes by these words. Luc. 5. verse .21. Solus deus condonat peccata.

                  He that cannot giue the holy Ghost is not God:
                  The Pope cannot giue the holy Ghost:
                  Ergo the Pope is not God.
                  The Maior is proued by an Argument Ex repugnantibus.
                  
                  The Minor I proue thus. Rom. 3. ver. 23.
                  No sinner can giue the holy Ghost:
                  The Pope is a sinner.
                  Ergo the Pope cannot giue the holy Ghost.
                  The Maior is proued thus.
                  He that is not of God cannot giue the holy Ghost:
                  
                     No sinner is of God:
                  Ergo no sinner can giue the holy ghost.
                  The minor is proued thus.
                  Hée that is not of God is of the Deuill. hée that is of the Deuill, cannot giue the holy ghost.
                  Ergo hée that is not of God cannot giue the holy ghost.

                  Ergo the Pope may abolishe Christes doctrine.

                  The first proposition is proued by the degrées of bothe his doctorshippes.
                  The second is proued by the aucthoritie of Baldus in Codice. Who sayeth that he is doctor of both Lawes in authoritie though not in knowledge.
               
               
                  I aunswer.
                  Some man that is doctor of neither Law is better then the Pope that is doctor of both Lawes:
                  But Christ was some man and doctor of neither Law.
                  Ergo Christ doctor of neither Lawe, is better than the Pope that is doctor of both Lawes.
                  I proue the Maior by this Argument.
                  He that is lesser then Christe in knowledge, is not so good as Christ.
                  But the Pope though doctor of both Lawes is lesser then Christ in knowledge.
                  Ergo the Pope is not so good as Christ.

                  That Christ knoweth all I proue by this argument.
                  He that is God knoweth all things.
                  Christ is God:
                  Ergo he knoweth all things.

                     THEODORET calleth this departing Antechrist, who shall seduce the world and drawe men from the trueth: Who is the man of sinne which vsurpeth all the aucthoritie of the diuel, and the operation of whom is the childe of perdition bicause hée destroyeth himselfe and others. He shall sitte in the Temple of God, which is mens myndes, and shall sitte the highest in all assembles, councells, and places, and shew himselfe as a God, and shall call him the God. Moasim, a strong, stoute, and mightie God, some vnderstand this departing too bée when the Romaine Empyre béegan too decaye, in the tyme of the Emperour Heraclius, when the Turkes and Saracenes departed from the Romaine Empyre vnto Mahuemite, and folowed the superstition, vaneties, and subtyle sect of the great Turke. Augustinus confesseth his ignoraunce in the vnderstanding of this place, Notwithstanding saieth hée, some meane by Antechrist, the whole bodye of sinne, the whole malygnant Churche, with theyr Captayne Antechrist and so sitte in the Church, as though he were the onely Church, and now ye know, what withholdeth and what is the cause of his delaye, and why that this pestilent membre of Satan doth not apeare, euen the Romain Gmpire letteth, for tyll it béegin to deminishe,Lact. 7. c. 25. he shall not vtter himselfe by the misterie of iniquitie, some vnderstande Nero, some Heresies, by him that witholdeth, some vnderstand the Romaine Empire, as Ambrose
                  
and others as I sayd before: some the grace of God, and the might of his spirit, some gods appointment and decrée, who assigned Antechrists tyme, but Theodoret vnderstandeth it of the Gospell, which must be preached ouer all the world, Christs Religion published euery where, adolatrie vanquished, false doctrine detected, superstition abolished, and then shall Antechrist appeare. Christ shall subdue this Tyraunt with the rodde and teath of his mouth: Esai. 11. verse .4. euen by his woorde and by godly men expert in his Lawe.

Antechrists kingdome cōsisteth in ambition, domination, arrogancie, false doctrine, fables, visions, reuelations, pardones, and such other abhominations. The abhomination of desolotion is knowen,Mat. 24. v. 24 Mar. 13. ve. 6 by notes of Antechrist, false doctrine, in this host, and that host, and in euery Alter with his naturall bodye: He is knowen by Tyrannye, by all manner of myscheife, he is the man of sinne, for he doth not only sinne himselfe, but also causeth other to sinne. For the Pope sayeth that if he sel the whole world, he selleth but his owne, or if he cary innumerable sorte of soules to hell with him, there may no man aske him why he doth so. He is the childe of perdition, and man of sinne, bicause that he is a man in déede, and in mans nature, and taketh vppon him the operation of the deuill: for God elected Christ who in his humain nature should redeme vs, and bring vs to saluation, euen so doth the deuel choose a very man, who should supplant, seduce, peruert, and destroy, calling himselfe Christ and God, and aduouching thē to be false gods, whome before he reuerenced as true gods. The Temple of GOD he calleth Christs Church, and congregation, where he will vsurpe the highest seate and place, boasting himselfe for God.
               Antechrist shall neither be deuell, nor féende, but a very man, in whome shall dwell whoie Satan bodely.Hierō in Daniel. He sitteth in the Church of God, as God, he shall persecute the godly, chaunge the Lawes of God, and eealt himselfe aboue GOD, and compell all men, all Lawes, all Regions to be subiect to his authoritie. He shal feigne chastetie,Hierō in Daniel. and contynencie, to deceiue men withall.

               After that Iohn in his Reuelation had described the firste beaste,Reue. 13. v 11. whiche was the Romaine Empire, to bée a defacer of Christe, and a persecuter of the Christians: hée inferreth the second beast too come out of the earth, souoring of earthly things: and hauing two hornes as the Lambe of Christ had: the one horne is the worldly kingdome of the Pope, which consisteth in vsurping. For he called himselfe a king, and not only a king, but also created kings & Emperours and deposed them. The other horne is the priesthode of the Pope. For he hath authoritie in heauen and earth, and therfore hath two keys, the one for Heauen gates, the other for hell gates. Two swordes, the one to subdue the Emperours withall, the other to rule the Clergie. He and his giue the holy Ghost, and grace, and therefore in auriculer confession, in his pardones, in making of priests. He speaketh like a Dragon,Reu. 13. ve. 11. euen like the deuell, who seduced Adam and made him offend against all the commaundements. He doth graunt miracles, hée maketh fire too discend from Heauen.

By Fyer, may be vnderstand his thundering boult of Cursing and Excommunication, whereby he did strike the Monarches, Princes, and Kings of the earth.

               I will so plainly declare the nature of Antichrist and in such sorte that you shall vnderstande that the Pope muste néedes bée Antichrist. There were onely six Monarchies from the deluge to the ende of the Worlde. The first the Assirians: the second, the Babylonians or the Chaldes:

                  Daniel doth not touch the Empire of the Assirians, for it was past before his tyme, and this Image was séene at Babilone. What néeded any Prophecie of a thinge that is past. Neither is there any Prophesie of a thing that is past, but of a thinge too come. And therefore sayeth Daniel: God shall shevv to the King things to come. The head of this Image signifyeth the Monarchy of the Chaldes and Babylonians:
                  The head of the Image. The siluer breast and armes the Medes or Persians: The Belly and Thighes of brasse the Gresians, or Macedonians: The Legges of Yron were the Romans, who subdued al the world: The foote of Yron signifieth the Pope, who breketh the power of the Emperour as yron doth ye clay, for the Pope had all Europe, at his commaundement, hée crouned Emperoures, and hee deposed them, he warred against them and subdued them: hée possessed Italy, and thrust the Emperour into Germany. Let vs declare how the Pope, who is signified by the féete of yron, did subdue the Emperour, who was named by the foote of claye.

Wherin Gregorie offended duble, first in misunderstanding, or rather peruerting ye place and wordes of Christ, meaning by ye rocke Peter:Math. 16. when as Christ is the rocke, and Peter but a member deriued from the rocke, as of Christ Christians: secondly that hée gaue occasion to his successoures to chalenge and aspire to that superioritie and dignitie.

For the Pope had the marow & the Emperour the bones, the Pope the corn, the Emperour the chaff: the Pope was the Sun, the Emperor the Moone, who taketh his light & might of the Pope. The Pope had Italy, Sardinia, Sicilia, Naples, & in a maner al. The Emperour Germany, but alwais subiect to the Pope.

                     utles in Paul is to shew him befor king & Emperoure & Christ. and the Popes Empire, as I said before, which rose out of the Romain empire, & began then to be reuiled & made manifest when he toke vppon him to make Emperours & depose them at his pleasure. Notwithstanding he wrought secretly before in al the Popes in a maner. And that the Pope is Antechrist Paul proueth,To swordes bycause he sitteth in the Temple of God, & taketh vpon him to serch mens consiencis & for ye purpose he made auriculer cōfession,Crant. 3.8. c. 36.

And therfore Boniface brought out two swods, on a solemne feast day in the yere of Christ .1030. wherby it is manifest that ye pope is head both of ye spiritual & tēporal sword, & dominion. The temple wherin this knaue ye pope sitteth & reigneth,To sitt. is ye hole mēber of thē yt beare ye name of christiās though they be ye church of Anti. whō he gouerneth, & ruleth for to sit in this place, is to rule.

Wherefore here you sée that the Pope doth inuade the kingdome of Christe, as Christe prophecied. They sayeth hée, meaning the Popes, shall come in my name, and saye, I am Christ. That is, I am king and head of the Church. How can Paul call the Church of Christ, the church of Antichrist? How can the Temple of God be called the Temple of Antichrist: If the Pope had called this Temple, the Temple of Antichrist: all men would haue abhorred him. But Paule calleth it, as the Pope doth, the Temple of God, declaring that the Pope would call his Sinogoge and malignant church by a glorius name, to delude ye people, as he calleth his doctrine Euāgeliū Sempiternum et Euangelius speritus sancti. And the Sadduces cal thē selues rightuous men,Sadduces. notwithstāding they were most vnrightuous. And the Popes so altre theyr names to deceue the people,Polyd. for if he were Impius, they called him Pius: If nocent, Innocentius: If a malefactor, Boniface: If vnmercifull, Clement: and thus they called vice vertue, and twined blacke into whyte. In like maner now the Ievves call themselues the people of God, who are not his people. The Pope vsurpeth that name, as he doth in calling himselfe Christes vice gerate, and that his priestes in confession sit in gods sceate. It may be obiected that Mahumet is Antechrist,Obiect. Mahumet. whose story and lyfe I haue noted vpon Daniel. I answer that he sitteth in that Temple that calleth it the Temple of God, but denieth Christe, neither doth hée secretly or openly call Christ his God, but onely a prophet: Neither commeth he out of the Romain Empire,Pope. but rose onely of himselfe: neither sitteth he at Rome. Neither taketh he vppon him to forgiue sinne. But the Pope seacretly calleth himselfe, in that he presumeth to forgiue sinne, ergo the Pope. No man can forgiue sinne but God only: the Pope presumeth to forguiue sinne,Math. 34. a false Christ. ergo the Pope is he that sitteth in the Temple of God, boasting himselfe, and triumphe aboue all that is God, The Turke began in Arabia: the Pope at Rome. The Pope is a false Christ, that is such one as that bosteth himselfe to haue the same authoritie that Christ had when he was in earth, that faineth himselfe to do all that Christe can do, and more, as to make of iniury, iustice, of nothing, something, to restore a defamed man to his name agayne, and such other thinges like vntoo these. Neither is euery euill Christian Antechrist, but hée onely

is Antichrist that fayneth himself to do all that christ can doo, to bée his vicegerent in earth, to sit in his place. As of late ther was one that fayned himself king Edward & said that he was so, who was a false knaue. Neither is the Turk that Antichrist that vsurpeth all that is God: but worshipped of the Turkes as a Sainte: as of late men did worship the Uirgin Mary and other Saintes. Neycan the Iewes or Turkes be false christes or Antichristes when they doo not feigne them selues to worship Christ as the sonne of God, he that refuseth Christ, cannot, nor wil not receiue a feinned Christ. Neither is he Antichrist, or a false christ that is an enimy of christ. But he that vsurpeth the power of christ, that maketh himselfe equal with christ, or aboue him in some points, and notwithstanding would seme to be a christian in words, though he deny him in déedes.
