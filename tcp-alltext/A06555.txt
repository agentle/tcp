            THE PREFACE TO the Catholikes of England.
            
               GOD saue you Right HONOVRABLE, and most worthy Champions. Giue me leaue awhile to interrupt your patience. And if it be not troublesome vnto you, heare me a word or two. I will not hould you long. Two yeares agoe I wrote two little bookes, concerning the Kings Primacy: the one against the Apology, and Preface Monitory of the High and Mighty Prince, Iames King of Great-Brittaine: the other against the Torture of Tortus, or the Kings Chaplayne. This thing your Academickes

tooke heauily, and presētly waged warre against me in their Kings quarrell; especially M. VVilliam Tooker, M. Richard Tompson, M. Robert Burhill, and M. Henry Salclebridge. Yet for all this I do not fly or feare. Nay there be many reasons which make me more couragious. First the equity of the Cause. Then your Faith and Constancy. And lastly the Iarres and deadly Discords of my Aduersaryes one against another.
            Concerning the right of the Cause, which I am to defend, what need I say any thing? I am to fight for the Church of Christ, for the honour and Obedience of Prelates, and for the example and custome of my Forefathers. And heerin, shall I feare any man? Hath not your faith and constancy which is testified to the whole world, by your daily imprisonments, fetters, punishmēts, yea death it self suffered for Christ, already shakē off my drowsinesse? Whome would it not animate and spurre forwards: seing that in this case, I may with good reasō apply that saying of

the Apostle vnto you, Spectaculum facti estis Deo, Angelis, & Hominibus: you are made a spectacle to God, Angels, and Men? To God, who behouldeth your Combats, giueth you strengh to get the victory, and prepareth a Crowne for your Triumph. To Angells, who admire, that, liuing in this frayle flesh, you do not feare the mighty powers of Hell; and withall reioyce, that so valiant Champions are cō
               mitted to their charge. You are made a spectacle to men, who throughout the whole world are wonderfully incensed and styrred vp by your example, vertue, and patience, to vndergoe the like combats and conflicts for Christ.
            Besides this, the disagreements and iarrings of my Aduersaries amongst thē
               selues are so many, and their forces so scattered & disordered, that I do not esteeme them to be greatly feared. If perhaps you know not these their discords; heere I offer and dedicate this little Booke vnto you, wherin it is particulerly shewed in what points they disagree. If your leasure

serue you, read it, and hope well of the issue. In the meane while, I will prepare my selfe to the Combat, and when it is tyme, I shall intreat you to be the Spectators. Fare ye well, and take in good part, I beseech you, this m

            THE ENGLISH IARRE, CONCERNING the Kings Supremacy.
            
               THE Kinges Supremacy in the Church of England is a new thing. It began vnder King Henry the 8. continued vnder King Edward the 6. and Queene Elizabeth: and now vnder King Iames, the same is rent and torne in peeces, with so many domesticall iarres and diuisions, that long it cannot stand. So as Christ in the Ghospell said full well, Omne regnum in se diuisum desolabitur: Euery Kingdome deuided in it selfe, shal be destroyed. But what, and how great these discords be, I will shew in these few questions following:

                  I. VVhether the King of England haue any Primacy in the Church, or no?
                  
                  
                     II. VVhether the Primacy of the King, be Ecclesiasticall and spirituall?
                  
                  III. VVhether the King by this Primacy, may be called the Primate of the Church?
                  
                  IIII. VVhether by vertue of the same Primacy, the K. may be called Supreme Head of the Church?
                  
                  V. VVhether this Primacy consist in any Power, or Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall?
                  
                  VI. VVhether the King, by reason of his Primacy, can assemble or call togeather Councels, and sit as President therin?
                  
                  VII. VVhether he can make Ecclesiasticall Lawes?
                  
                  VIII. VVhether he can dispose of Ecclesiasticall liuings, or Benefices?
                  
                  IX. VVhether he can create, and depose Bishops?
                  
                  X. VVhether he can excommunicate the obstinate?
                  
                  XI. VVhether he can be Iudge, and determine of Controuersies?
                  
                  XII. From whence hath the King this his Primacy?
                  
                  XIII. VVhether he can force his Subiects

to take the Oath of Supremacy?
                  
               
            
            In these Questiōs do our Aduersaries extremely differ and dis
                  •
               gree, but especially these, M. Doctor Andrewes, in his Tortura Torti; M. William Tooker Deane of Lichefield, in his Combat, or single Fight with Martin Becanus; M. Richard Tompson, in his Reproofe of the Refutation of Tortura Torti; M. Robert Burhill, in his Defence of Tortura Torti; and M. Henry Salclebridge, in his Refutation of Becanus his examen. Besides these (as opposite vnto them) I will also cite Doctor Sanders, in his booke of the Schisme of Englād; Genebard in his Chronology; Polydor Virgil in his History of England; Iacobus Thuanus of Aust, in the History of his tyme; Iohn Caluin in his Commentary vpon the Prophet Amos, and others.
            
               The I. Question. vvhether the King of England haue any Primacy in the Church?
               1 THE first Iarre or contention then is, concerning the Name of Primacy. Many of our Aduersaries admit this Name: but M. Richard Tompson had rather haue it called Supremacy then Primacy. His reason is, because Primacy doth signify a power of the same Order. Now, the King hath not power in the Church of England of the same Order with Bishops and Ministers, but a power of higher and different Order from them.

                  Ergo he hath not the Primacy, but the Supremacy. The words of M. Tompson pag. 33. of his booke are these: Nos in Anglico nostro idiomate belliores longè sumus, quàm per inopiam Latini sermonis, nobis Latinè esse licuit. Non enim dicimus, The Kings Primacy, Regis Primatum, sed The Kings Supremacy, Regis Suprematum: Quo vocabulo nos quoque deinceps vtemur. Multùm enim disserunt Primatus & Suprematus. Illud enim Potestatem eiusdem Ordinis videtur significare, hoc non item. We in our English tongue, do speake much more properly, then we can do in the Latin speach, through the penury therof. For we do not say The Kings Primacy, but The Kings Supremacy: which word we will heerafter vse. For that Primacy and Supremacy do greatly differ: Primacy seeming to signify a power of the same Order; but Supremacy not so.
               2. Out of which words, we gather two things. The one, that all Englishmen, who vse the Name of Primacy, do eyther erre or speake improperly, if we belieue M. Tompson. For if they speake properly, seing that the word Primacy doth properly signify a Power of the same Order; they do plainely vnderstand, that the King hath Power of the same order with the Bishops and Ministers of his Church. But this now according to M. Tompsons opinion, is an error: wherefore eyther they doe erre, or speake improperly.
               3. The other is, that a Coniecture may be made of the thing signified, from the word signifying. The word Supremacy is a new and lately inuented word, vnknown to the Ancient Fathers, not vsed

in Scriptures, vnheard of in the Christian world. Moreouer, what doth it signify? The Supreme power (forsooth) of the King in the Church? Wherefore this is new also. Surely if the ancient Fathers, eyther Latin or Greeke, had knowne this power, they would haue found out at least some word, wherby to haue expressed the same properly. But this it seemes none of them did.
            
            
               II. Question. vvhether that this Primacy, which the King hath in the Church, be Ecclesiasticall or Spirituall?
               1 THIS is now another Iarre. Vnder King Henry the 8. and King Edward, this Primacy was alwaies called Ecclesiasticall and Spirituall, as it appeareth out of Doctor Sanders, whose words are these: Caluinus Henrici Primatum Ecclesiasticum oppugnauit. Caluin did oppugne King Henryes Ecclesiasticall Primacy. Againe: Episcopus Roffensis, quòd Henrici Primatum Ecclesiasticum nollet confiteri, ad mortem producitur. The Bishop of Rochester, because he denyed King Henryes Ecclesiasticall Primacy, was brought forth to dye &c. And againe: Multi in custodijs propter negatum Ecclesiasticum Regis Primatum detenti. Many were kept in prison, for denying the Kings Ecclesiastical Primacy. In like manner: Henricus mandauit vt filius in fide Catholica

               2. Vnder Queene Mary that succeeded to her brother King Edward in the Crowne, this Title of Primacy was taken away in a Parliament held at London, as witnesseth Iacobus Thuanus in the 9. booke of the History of his tyme, in these words: Antiquatus ijsdem Comitijs Primatus Eccl

               3. But now in these our dayes vnder King Iames this matter is called into question: Some not daring to call it Primacy Ecclesiasticall and spirituall, but only Primacy belonging to Ecclesiasticall and Spirituall matt

                     erior hic Pontifici nullo iure debetur. Neyther do we attribute one Primacy, concerning spirituall matters vnto the King, nor do we take from the Pope any other Primacy, concerning temporall matters, then we ought to do. The first is due vnto Kings by all right; the later no way pertayneth to the Pope &c. I, when I first read these wordes in the Chaplaynes booke, did thinke that he had taken these two, to wit, Primacy spirituall, & belonging to spirituall; as also these other, Primacy temporall, & belonging to temporall, for one and the same thing. But now it seemes that the Defenders & Interpreters of the Chaplaine, to wit M. Tompson, and M. Burhill, do take it otherwise. For so writeth M. Burhill pag. 55. of his Booke, concerning this point: Non dicit, Primatum spiritual

                  . of his Booke also saith: Non dixit, Primatum Ecclesiasticum, aut Spiritualem,

quasi formaliter intelligat; sed quoad Spiritualia, id est, obiectiuè & materialiter. The Chaplaine said not, the Primacy Ecclesiasticall or Spirituall, as though he vnderstood it formally, but for so much as it belongeth to Spirituall, that is to say, obiectiuely and materially &c. In which sense the same Author pag. 95. saith. Dicimus Regem gubernare quidem Ecclesiastica, sed non Ecclesiasticè: We say indeed, that the King gouerneth Ecclesiasticall things, but not Ecclesiastically.
               4. So as if you aske in England, whether the King hath Primacy Ecclesiasticall or no? It wilbe answered you thus: King Henry, K. Edward, and Q. Elizabeth had Ecclesiasticall Primacy: K. Iames hath not Primacy Ecclesiasticall, but only so far forth, as it belongeth to Ecclesiasticall things. Hath then his Maiesty that now is lesse, then they had? So it seemes. Is then the Kings Primacy in England so nipped and pared in so short a space? So they say. Is it then almost decayed, and at an end? I doubt not but it is. What is the cause? Hearken to the cōmon saying: Whats quickly got, is quickly lost: as also to that of the holy Scripture: Si est ex hominibus consilium hoc, aut opus, dissoluetur. Act. 5.38. If this deuise, or worke be of men, it will be dissolued.
            
            
               
               III. Question VVhether the King, by vertue of this Primacy may be called Primate of the Church?
               MAISTER Henry Salclebridge doth absolutely affirme it. For thus he writeth pag. 140. Dico, Regem Angliae Ecclesiae Anglicanae Primatem esse. I say, that the King of England is Primate of the Church of England. Nay, he will haue this point to be so certayne, and out of all doubt, that he thinketh, whosoeuer should deny it, to offend against the publike Profession of England. For so he saith pag. 177. Angliae Regem Anglicanae Ecclesiae Primatem esse, in professione publica Anglicana Veritatis sa
                        •
                     ris litteris nixae, ponitur. That the King of England is Primate of the Church of England, is founded in the publicke English Profession of Truth, grounded vpon the Sacred Letter.
               2. M. Tooker, and M. Burhill do absolutely deny it. For thus wryteth M. Took

Primate &c.
               3. 
                     •
                  eere hence do I frame a twofold Argument. One out of M. Tookers words in this manner: He that a
                     ••
                  irmeth the King to be Primate of the Church, is a sausy and malicious fellow. But M. Salcl
                        •
                     bridge affirmeth the King to be Primate of the Church. Ergo, he is a sausy and malicious fellow. The other argument I frame out of M. Salclebridges words thus: He that denyeth the King to be Primate of the Church, doth offend against the publicke Profession of the Truth receyued in England. But M. Tooker denyeth the King to be Primate of the Church of England. Ergo, he offendeth against the publicke profession of the Truth receyued in England. So (I w
                     •
                  s) one Mule claweth another.
               4. But now it may be demaunded, whether of them doth iudg more rightly in this case, M. Salclebridge, who affirmeth the King to be Primate of the Church, or M. Tooker, that denieth it? This controuersy dependeth vpon another question, to wit, whether these two Names, Primate and Primacy, are necessarily cōnexed, or, as they say, Coniugata? M. Salclebridge thinketh that they are. Therfore, because he hath once affirmed the King to haue the Primacy of the Church, he consequently auerreth, that the King is Primate of the Church. For that with him this argument hath force à Coniugatis: The King hath Primacy, Ergo, the King is Primate. As also this: The Chaplaine hath a Bishopricke, Ergo, he is a Bishop.
               5. Now M. Tooker, he thinketh the contrary.

For pag 6. of his booke he expressely saith: That the King hath the Primacy of the Church; but yet he is not the Primate of the Church. And contrariwise, The Archbishop of Canterbury hath not the Primacy of the Church; and yet is he Primate of the Church. So as he denyeth these two consequēces à Coniugatis, to wit. 1. The King hath the Primacy, Ergo, he is Primate. 2. The Archbishop is Primate, Ergo, he hath the Primacy. And perhaps he will deny these in like manner. 1. The Chaplayne hath a Bishopricke, Ergo, he is a Bishop. 2. M. Tooker is a Deane, Ergo, he hath a Deanery.
            
            
               IIII. Question. VVhether the King, by reason of his Primacy, may be called Head of the Church?
               THIS Title first began to be vsurped of King Henry the 8. as all Authors, aswell our owne as our aduersaryes, do testifie. For thus wryteth Iacobus Thuanus in his first booke of the Historyes of his times: Henricus post diuortium, se Caput Ecclesiae constituit. K. Henry after his diuorce (from Q. Catherine) made himselfe Head of the Church &c. And Polydor Virgil lib. 27. of his History of England, saith: Interea habetur Concilium Londini, in quo Ecclesia Anglicana formam potestatis, nullis antè temporibus visam, induit. Henricus enim Rex Caput ipsius Ecclesiae constituitur. In the meane while

(to wit after his forsaid diuorce) a Councell was held at London, wherin the Church of 
                     
                        •
                     ngland tooke to it selfe a forme of power, neuer heard of before. For that King Henry was appointed Head of the same Church &c. Genebrard also in the fourth booke of his Chronology hath these words: Henricus anno 1534. in publicis Comitijs se Caput Ecclesiae Anglicanae appellauit. King Henry in the yeare of our Lord 1534. in publicke Parliament, called himselfe Head of the Church of England &c. Also Doctor Sanders in his booke of the Schisme of England, saith: Ex qua dicendi formula, primam occasionem sumptam aiunt, vt Rex Supremum Caput Ecclesiae Anglicanae diceretur. By which manner of speach, it is said, the first occasion was taken, of calling the King supreme Head of the Church of England &c. And againe, in the same booke: Proponebantur cis noua Comitiorum Decreta, & iu

                     bantur iurciurando affirmare, Regim Supremum Ecclesiae esse Caput. The new Laws or Statutes of the Parliament were propounded vnto them (to wit, to the Kings subiects) and they were commaunded to sweare, that the King was head of the Church &c. Iohn Caluin in like manner vpon the 7. Chapter of the Prophet Amos wryteth thus: Qui tantopere extu

things: and this point did euer gall me grieuously. For that they were blasphemers, when they called him the chiefe Head of the Church vnder Christ &c.
               2. The same Title did K. Edward Sonne to K. Henry, and his Successour, vsurpe, as it may be seene by his Letters to Thomas Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury, which begin thus: Edouardus Dei gratia Angliae, Franciae, & Hyberniae Rex, supremum in terris Ecclesiae Anglicanae, & Hybernicae, tam in causis spiritalibus quàm temporalibus Caput; Reuerendo Thomae Cantuariensi Archiepiscopo, salutem. Edward by the Grace of God, King of England, France and Ireland, supreme Head on earth of the Church of England and Ireland, as well in causes Ecclesiasticall as temporall: to the Reuerend, Thomas Archbishop of Canterbury, greeting &c. The same Title also did Bishop Cranmer giue vnto the said King, as appeareth by his letters wrytten to other Bishops subiect vnto him, thus: Thomas permissione diuina Cantuariensis Archiepiscopus, per Illustrissimum in Christo Principem Edouardum Regem sextum, supremum in terris Caput Ecclesiae Anglicanae & Hybernicae, sufficienter & legitimè authorizatus; Tibi Edmundo Londinensi

                  England and Ireland, do in his Maiesties Name and place, which herein we supplie, commaund you

                     dmund Bishop of London, and all the rest of our Brethren Bishops, that Images be taken out of the Churches of euery Diocesse &c. And Doctor Sanders also in his booke of the Schisme of England saith thus: Quamprimùm visum est Henrici octaui mortem diuulgare, statim Edouardus Henrici filius, nonum aetatis annum agens, Rex Angliae proclamatur, & summum 
                        •
                     cclesiae Anglicanae in terris Caput, proximè secundum Christum constituitur &c. As soone as it was thought good to diuulge King Henryes death, by and by Edward his sonne, being of the age of nyne yeares, was proclaymed King of England, and ordayned supreme Head of the Church of England on earth, next vnder Christ &c.
               3. Queene Elizabeth, although she were a woman, yet she thought her selfe no way inferiour to her Father or Brother. She therfore would be also called supreme Head of the Church of England. For so wryteth Iacobus Thuanus in his 15. booke of the Historyes of his time. Elizabetha, recepto à Patre & fratre titulo, Ecclesiae Caput per Angliam coepit appellari. Q. Elizabeth hauing receaued the (former) Title from her Father & Brother, began to be called Head of the Church throughout England &c.
               4. But now adayes, vnder K. Iames, this title is put in ieopardy. The Chaplaine (to wit M. Doctor Andrewes) doth admit the same in his Tortura Torti; but M. Tooker, and M. Burhill do reiect it. M. Tookers words, which a little before I recited are

these: Olere autem militiam, & clamitare audaciam tuam videtur illud, cùm Regem Caput Ecclesiae, Primatem
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      confingas. It may seeme to sauour of malice, and cry out vpon your sausines, when as you feigne the King to be Head and Primate of the Church &c. And in like manner doth M. Burhill pag 133. reprehend a certaine person of ouer much wantonnes and boldnes, for calling the King, Head, Pastour and Primate of Bishops.
               5. In this debate and Iarre then, what shall the King do? If he admit the Title of Supreme head of the Church of England, M. Tooker, & M. Burhill will no doubt murmure shrewdly. If he reiect it, what then will the Chaplaine say? Perhaps this contention may be mollified, if the King, as he gaue to the Chaplayne the Bishopricke of Ely: so he would giue to M. Tooker, and M. Burhill two other Bishopricks. For then, least they might seeme vngratefull they would easily graunt this Title to the King, and a far greater too.
            
            
               V. Question. VVhether the Kings Primacy do consist in any Power, or Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall?
               HEERE now, is there a great Iarre and debate amongst our English Aduersaries: nor can the same be easily vnderstood, vnlesse it be first well distinguished. Ecclesiasticall Power

is threefold, as the Deuines do teach. One of Order; another of interiour Iurisdiction; the third of exteriour Iurisdiction. To the first belongeth to effect or consecrate, and administer Sacraments: to the second, to gouerne the Church in the interiour Court, or Court of Conscience; and to the third, belongeth to gouerne the Church in the exteriour Court. Now certaine it is, that the King hath not the Power of Order, by reason of his Primacy. For this doth M. Tooker confesse pag. 14. where he saith: Reges non habent potestatem administrandi Sacramenta. Kinges haue not power to administer Sacraments. It is also certaine that he hath not Iurisdiction of the interiour Court, or Court of Conscience. For this in like manner doth M. Tooker confesse pag. 63. Omnis iurisdictio (saith he) in foro interiori Sacerdotum est, nulla Regum. All iurisdiction in the interiour Court (or Court of Conscience) belongeth to Priests, not any way to Kings &c.
               2. All the question then is, whether the King hath Iurisdictiō Ecclesiastical in the exteriour Court or no? About this point are the Englishmen at a great iarre and variance amongst themselues: some affirming it, some denying it, others distinguishing. M. Tooker affirmeth it pag. 305. in these words: Qui habet plenissimam & am
                        •
                     lissimam iurisdictionem in foro exteriore, potest eamdem dare & auferre. Rex eam habet Ergo potest eamdem dare & auferre. Totum hoc liquet ex V. & N. Testamento. He that hath most full and ample Iurisdiction in the exteriour Court, can giue and take away the same (at his pleasure.) But the

King hath this Iurisdiction. Ergo, he can giue and take away the same. Al this is manifest out of the old & new Testament &c. With him agreeth also M. Salclebridge pag. 140. Reges oleo sacro vncti, capaces sunt Iurisdictionis spiritualis. Kings (saith he) annoynted with holy oyle, are made capable of spirituall Iurisdiction &c. And then againe in the same place out of the Lawes of England. R

                     cclesiasticam & temporalem iurisdictionem habet, & quidem Supremam. The King is a person mixt, to wit, that hath both Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall and Temporall, and that in the highest degree &c. And yet more pag. 144. Per leges 
                        •

                     cclesiastica potestate & iurisdictione, quam habet in vtroque, dispensare potest. By the Ecclesiasticall Lawes approued in this Kingdome (of 
                        •
                     ngland) one Priest may not haue two Benefices, nor a Bastard be made Priest. But the King, by the Iurisdiction and Power Ecclesiasticall, which he hath, can dispense in both &c.
               3. M. Tompson, and M. Burhill do absolutely deny it: M. Tompson pag. 80. of his booke wryting thus:

                        •
                     è. We haue said before, that the King indeed doth gouerne

Ecclesiasticall things, but not Ecclesiastically. And why I pray you? Because, forsooth, he hath not Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, but only temporall. And hereunto agreeth M. Burhill pag. 234. granting this negatiue proposition. Rex (saith he) nullam habet Iurisdictionem Ecclesiasticam, nec in foro interiori, nec in exteriori. The King hath no Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, neyther in the interiour, nor exteriour Court &c.
               4. Now my Lord of Ely, he distinguisheth in this case, as may be seene in M. Tookers Booke pag. 305. in these wordes: Habet Rex omnem iurisdictionē spiritualem, in foro exteriori, exceptis quibusdam Censuris. The King hath all Iurisdiction spirituall in the exteriour Court, except in certaine Censures &c. So as now to this question (to wit whether the King, as he is Primate and Head of the Church, haue any Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall or spirituall in the exteriour Court,) we must answere thus: First with M. Tooker, and M. Salclebridge, That he hath most ample, most full, and supreme Iurisdiction. Secondly with my Lord of Ely, That he hath indeed some, but not all. And lastly, with M. Burhill, and M. Tompson, That he hath none, no not any one iote at all.
               
            
            
               
               VI. Question. VVhether the King of his owne Authority can assemble, or call togeather Councells?
               1. NOv follow the Iarres and debates of our Aduersaries, concerning the Offices and Functions of the Kings Primacy, & they 
                     •
                  re six in number, which may be disputed of. The first is, of assembling, or calling togeather of Synods. The second of enacting of Ecclesiasticall lawes. The third, of cōferring or bestowing of benefices. The fourth of creating & deposing of Bishops. The fifth, is about Excommunication. The sixt and last, is about the decision and determining of Controuersies. The question then is, whether these offices belong to the Kings Primacy? I will speake a word of ech in order.
               2. First, it may be demaunded, whether the King by vertue of his Primacy, may of his owne authority, call or assemble togeather Synods, and therin sit as chiefe and head? This was certainly persuaded that it might be done, in the tyme of King Henry, K. Edward, and Queene Elizabeth: but now vnder King Iames the matter is called into question. M. Salclebridge pag. 121. affirmeth, that he can do it, in these words: Christiani Principes in Regnis suis cum laude, propria auctoritate Synodos conuocarunt, Constitutiones condiderūt, causas audierunt & cognouerunt.

                  ing therin as chiefe or head, as also the exercise of all other offices in this kind, is a certaine mixt Right, proceeding from both Kingly and Episcopall power: which things do in a manner come downe, or descend from the origen of the Kings Primacy, and are communicated or in parted vnto Priests &c. This now againe, as you see, is contrary to that which he said next before. For there he will needs haue the assembly of Synods or Councels to belong by diuine right to the Apostles: heere, forsooth, he will haue the same chiefely to belong to Kinges, and from them to be deriued vnto Bishops. These things do not agree one with another.

                   wheras the rule of the law

of Nations in old tyme was, That consent, not carnall copulation did make the marriage lawfull; now heereafter by the law of K. Henry, it began to be a rule, That carnall copulation, not consent did make marriage lawfull. And yet for all this, the law-maker himselfe K. Henry, did, against his owne proper rule and law, reiect Anne of Cleeue his wife, whose marriage was not only contracted by consent alone, but consummated also by seauen moneths carnall copulation, vpon this only pretence, that she had giuen her consent to another before, I know not whome; and vpon this fiction, he married another, she yet remayning aliue. And of this law afterward the Protestants themselues were so much ashamed, that after K. Henryes death, they recalled, and disanulled the same &c.

For that some of them say, that the enacting of decreeing of Ecclesiasticall lawes, doth by diuine right belong vnto Bishops; others say, that it belongeth to Kings and Emperours. The first opinion holdeth M. Tooker pag. 42. of his booke, where he saith, that the Apostles in the first Councell at Hierusalem did enact this Ecclesiasticall law: Visum est Spiritui Sancto & nobis, nihil vltra imponere vobis oneris, nisi haec necessaria: vt abstineatis vos ab immolatis simulachrorum, & sanguine, & suffocato. It hath seemed good to the holy Ghost, and to vs, to lay no further burthen vpon you, then these necessary things: that you abstayne frō the things immolated to Idols, and from bloud, and that which is strangled &c. And this, saith he, the Apostles did by diuine right. The other opinion holdeth M. Tompson pag. 80. where he affirmeth, that Bishops, and Councels cannot enact or decree any Ecclesiasticall law, which hath the force of law, vnlesse Kings and Emperours consent therunto. His words are these: Decreta Conciliorum & Patrum, Ecclesiasticis Censuris, & 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      tantùm stetiss
                        •
                     nt, nisi legum vim Caesarea aura ipsis afflasset. The Decrees of the Councels and of the Fathers had bene held but only for Ecclesiasticall censures, and penalties,

vnlesse the Emperours fauour had imparted the force of lawes vnto the said Decrees &c.
               4. Heere now the Iarre is euident. For without doubt, that Ecclesiasticall law, which the Apostles decreed, had the force of a law: for that so much is gathered out of these words; Visum est, nihil vltra imponere vobis oneris, nisi haec necessaria. It hath seemed good, to lay no further burthen vpon you, then these necessary things &c. But this Ecclesiasticall law had not it force from any fauour of the Emperor, seing that neither Tyberius, nor Pilate, nor Herod, nor any other fecular Prince, which then liued, did by his fauour, authorize the force of the law; but that it came from the Apostles themselues. For that they, by their Apostolicall authority and power, which they had receiued from Christ, did decree, and promulgate that law. And the same power & authority haue Bishops now a dayes, not Kings, nor Emperours.
            
            
               VIII. Question. vvhether the King by his owne proper authority, may conferre, collate, or bestow Ecclesiasticall benefices?
               1. THAT the King may conferre Ecclesiasticall liuings, M. Henry Salclebridge affirmeth pag. 121 in these wordes: Christiani Principes in suis R

                     m illos spectare, vti Ecclesiae Anglicanae Primates vel supremos Ordinarios &c. Do you heare Iesuite, the collation of benefices, doth not only belong to the Kings of England, but also it doth belong vnto them, as they are Primates or supreme Ordinaries of the Church of England &c. And yet more: Rex ratione supremae suae Ecclesiasticae iurisdictionis praesentabit ad liberas Capellas. The King by vertue of his supreme Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, shall be able to present vnto Free Chappells &c.
               2. Now M. Tooker to the contrary denyeth it, pag. 36. where talking of the Kings of England, he saith thus: Beneficia autem curata, vel non curata, non conf
                        •

                        •
                     minandi, & praesentandi apud nos &c. Kings do not at all collate or bestow vpon any man benefices that haue care of soules, or not care, greater or lesser; & much lesse Ecclesiasticall dignities, whether Bishopri
                     •
                  kes or Archbishoprickes throughout the whole circuite of their Kingdomes. For this truly belongeth vnto those, whose office it is to dispose therof,

to wit, to the Comprouinciall Bishops, who haue power to consecrate the said persons on whome they bestow them. Indeed the Kings Majesty notwithstanding hath this right with vs in Englād, which an inferiour and subordinate power also hath, to wit, right to nominate and present vnto benefices &c.
               3. Behould heere a triple Iarre or discord betwene these two Authors, and this in a dayly and vulgar matter. The first is, that M. Henry Salclebridg saith, that the collation of benefices belongeth to the Kings of England, in that they be the Primates of the Church of England. M. Tooker saith to the contrary, that it belongeth not to Kings at all, but to Bishops. The second Iarre is, that M. Salclebridge saith, that Kings by their owne authority, haue conferred benefices. M. Tooker saith, that they neuer do, nor haue done. The third is, that M. Salclebridge saith, that Kings by vertue of their supreme Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction may present vnto benefices. M. Tooker auerreth, that in this point, Kings haue no more right, then their subiects, & other inferiour persons: for so he saith: Hoc ha
                        •
                     et iuris Regia Maiestas, quod minor & subordinata potestas habet. The Kings Maiesty hath (in this point of conferring benefices) the same right that an inferiour & subordinate power hath &c. Whether of these two then should King Iames belieue, if he had a fat benefice, or an Archbishopricke now to bestow?
            
            
               
               IX. Question. VVhether the King can create, and depose Bishops, or no?
               1. MAISTER Salclebridge saith, that he can. For thus he writeth pag. 121. Christiani Principes in suis Regnis, cum laude, propria authoritate, Episcopos crearunt & deposuerunt. Christian Prices, haue in their Kingdomes, by their owne proper authority created and deposed Bishops, and that with praise &c. And then againe pag. 144. Rex Angliae Archidiacono Richmundiae Episcopal
                        •
                     m concessit Iurisdictionem. The King of England graunted Episcopall Iurisdiction to the Archdeacon of Richmond &c. And yet further pag. 155. Reges Angliae suprema sua authoritate, de iure, atque cum laude omnium Ordinum Episcopos eleger
                        •
                     nt, ac proinde deponere potu
                        •
                     runt. The Kings of England of their owne supreme authority, by right, & with praise of all mā
                  ner Estates, haue elected Bishops, and therfore they might depose them also &c. And then lastly: Constat, Christianos Prin
                        •
                     ipes cum laude Episcopos elegisse, & deposuisse, etiam Romanos. It is manifest, that Christian Princes, haue elected, & deposed Bishops, yea Popes also, and that with their praise &c.
               2. Now M. Tooker, he denyes in the place before cited that the King can create or depose Bishops. For there he assigning two things necessary for the ordayning or creating of a Bishop, to wit, Consecratiō
                     
of the person, & a Bishopricke, addeth, that the King can performe neyther of these two. For neyther can he confer any benefice
                     •
                  , and much lesse a Bishopricke or Archbishopricke; neyther hath he any power to cō
                  secrate persons. In so much, that in another place he confesseth, that it is so far off from King Iames to haue power to create or depose Bishops, that he would rather acknowledg himselfe for one of their schollers and Disciples. For thus he wryteth pag. 311. Serenissimus ac pientissimus Rex noster Iacobus non habet quicquam antiquius & honorificentius, quàm vt cum Valentiniano filium se Ecclesiae profiteatur, & cum Theodorico Italiae Rege, se alumnum Ecclesiae, & discipulum Archiepiscoporum suorum, & Episcoporum libenter recognoscat. Our most Gratious and most pious King Iames doth esteeme or accompt nothing more noble and more honorable, then with Valentinian (the Emperour) to professe himselfe a sonne of the Church; and with Theodoricus King of Italy most willingly to acknowledge himselfe a foster-child of the Church, and a disciple of his Archbishops and Bishops &c.
               3. This Iarre now, as you see, is of great momēt. For if the King cannot create or ordaine Bishops, as M. Tooker saith he cannot; then it followeth euidently, that Thomas Cranmer who was made Archbishop of Canterbury by the King (Henry the 8.) was no true, but a false Bishop; no pastour, but a robber; one that entred not into the sheepfold by the dore, but climbed vp some other way. Whereof againe ensue three other markable points. First, that all other Bishops, who were afterward eyther created by Crāmer,
                  
or by the King, were like vnto Cranmer himselfe. Secondly whatsoeuer was done of them, by Episcopall authority or Iurisdiction, was of no validity or force. Thirdly, that they, so ordained, are bound to restitution of all reuenewes and profits which they haue reaped by their Bishopricks. What coun
                  
                     ••
                  ll now is there to be taken in this point? Let your Academicks, I pray you, consider.
            
            
               X. Question. VVhether the King can excommunicate his obstinate subiects, or no?
               1. HEERE now do our aduersaries ranke their King amongst ordinary men; & what they graunted vnto him before, heere now they seeme to reuoke. For they say, that the King cannot excommunicate any of his subiects and yet himselfe may be excommunicated by them, and expelled out of the Church of England, wherof himself is supreme Head. The former part herof doth M. Tooker affirme pag. 15. in these worlds: Rex non habet potestatem distringendi gladium spiritualem, vel quempiam excōmunicandi. The King hath no power to vnsheath the spirituall sword, nor to excommunicate any man &c. And the Chaplaine, my Lord of Ely, pag. 151. saith: Nos Principi censurae potestatem non facimus. We do not giue authority to our Prince to vse Censures &c. And againe M. Tompson pag.
                  
83. Excōmunicare nullo modo ad Supr
                        •
                     matum Ecclesiae pertinet. To excommunicate doth no way belong to the Supremacy of the Church. And againe pag. 84. Omnes fatemur R
                        •
                     gem excomunicandi potestatem nullam habere. We do all confesse, that the King hath no power to excommunicate &c.
               2. The later part of the former point affirmeth M
                        •
                      Burhill pag. 137. when he saith: Quod Ambrosio licuit in Theodosium idem & alijs in Regem simili de causa liceat &c. As it was lawfull for Ambrose to proceed against Theodosius; so is it lawfull also for others to proceed against the King, in the like cause &c. To wit (he would say) as it was lawfull for S. Ambrose being a Bishop, to excōmunicate Theodosius the Emperour; so in like manner is it lawfull for our Bishops (of England) to excomunicate King Iames, if he offend in like manner. And then againe pag. 242. Supremus Ecclesiae Gubernator, potest eijci ex Ecclesia. The supreme Gouernour of the Church, (to wit the King) may be cast forth of the Church &c. And pag. 267. Rex etsi iustissimè excommunicatus, non amittit Primatum. The King, although he should be most iustly excommunicated, yet he doth not loose his Primacy. &c.
               3. Now I do not see, how these things can possibly hang togeather, or agree with those which hitherto before haue byn att
                     •
                  ibuted to the King. For vnto him is attributed, That he is Primate, and the supreme head of the Church of England: That he is aboue all persons, aswell Ecclesiasticall, as temporall in his Kingdome: That he hath supreme, most

ample, and full iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, no lesse then politicall and temporall. And notwithstanding all this, being so great a person, yet can he not excommunicate any one of his subiects, eyther Laicke, or Church-man, although neuer so rebellious and obstinate. Nay, although he be so great, as he is, he may neuerthelesse be excommunicated by his subiects, & cast out of the Church of England, wherof he is supreme Head. I cānot vnderstand this mystery.
               4. Heerunto will I adde 3. arguments more, which will increase the difficulty. The first is: He that hath supreme, most ample, and most full Iurisdictiō Ecclesiasticall in any Kingdome, may exercise all the actions, & offices that belong vnto Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall of that Kingdome. But now the King hath supreme, most ample, and most full iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall in the Kingdome of England, as M. Tooker, and M. Salclebridg do confesse: Ergo, he may exerci
                     •
                  e all offices belonging Iurisdiction Ecclesiastical in the Kingdome of England: Ergo he may also excōmunicate: for that excōmunication which is denoūced by sentence, is an act of Ecclesiasticall Iur
                     •
                  sdiction. Or els contrariwise, if you will thus: He that cannot exercise all acts of Ecclesiasticall Iurisdi
                     ••
                  ion in any Kingdome, hath not supreme, most ample, & most full Iurisdiction Ecclesiasti
                     •
                  all in that Kingdome. But the King of England cannot exercise 
                     〈…〉
                   of 
                     •
                  cclesiasticall Iurisdiction in his Kingdo
                     •
                  e because he cannot excommunicate any man. 
                     〈…〉
                   not supreme, most ample, and most 
                     〈…〉
                   
                  
                     •••
                  l
                     •
                  siasticall in his Kingdome.
               
                  5. The second argument is this. He that giueth to another, power to excommunicate, without doubt hath power himself to excommunicate, b
                     •
                  
                  cause no man can giue to another that which he hath not himselfe. But the King of England giueth power to his Bishops to excommunicat
                     •
                  . Ergo, h
                     •
                   hath power to excommunicate. The Minor is proued out of M. Tooker pag. 304. where he affirmeth, That the Bishops (of England) do receyue all their Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction of the exteriour Court, from the King. But now, power to excommunicate belongeth to Iurisdiction of the exteriour Court, a
                     •
                   the Chaplaine pag. 41. and M. Tooker pag. 305. expressely teach vs, saying: Rex habet omnem iurisdictionem spiritualem in foro exteriori, exceptis quibusdam censuris. The King hath all Iurisdiction spirituall in the exteriour Court, excepting certaine Censures. But now h
                     •
                   excepteth Excommunicatiō, wherin yow see is to be noted againe a contradictiō in M. Tooker; for that he referreth Censures (amongst which excommunication is one) to the Iurisdiction of the exteriour Court. True indeed. Bu
                     •
                   yet he adioyneth two other things, that are con
                     •
                  radictory. The first, that the King can giue vnto Bishops all Iurisdiction of the exteriour Court: and th
                     •
                   second, that the King hath not all Iurisdiction o
                     •
                   the exteriour Court.
               6. The third Argument is: That whosoeuer is subiect to another in Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction of the exteriour Court hath not supreme, mo
                     •
                  t ample, and full Iurisdictiō Ecclesiasticall of the exteriour Court
                     •
                  
                  
But the King is subiect to some other body in Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction of the exteriour Court, to wit, to the Bishop, because he may by him be excommunicated, by sentence, and cast out of the Church, as M. Burhill doth confesse: Ergo, he hath not supreme, most ample and most full Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall in the exteriour Court &c. Or, if you will, contrarywise thus: He that is subiect to no other in Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, cannot by any man be excōmunicate
                     •
                   by sentence. But the King now, if he haue supreme Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, is subiect to no other in Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall: Ergo, he cannot by any other be excōmunicated &c. I doubt not, but you ma
                     •
                  ke well, that these things do not agree.
            
            
               XI. Question. VVhether the King may be Iudge of all Controuersies in the Church?
               1. CONTROVERSIES that arise in the Church are of two sortes: some are about faith and Religion: others are concerning Ecclesiasticall affayres. The former of these questions then, is: Whether the King by vertue of his Primacy, be supreme Iudg of all Controuersies, which pertayne vnto faith and Religion? M. Salclebridge saith he is pag. 163. in these words: Sic luce clarius 
                        •

                        •
                      Concilijs &c. So as it is more cleare then the sūne, that Christian Princes, with prais
                     •
                  , haue iudged of, and decided controuer
                     •
                  ies of faith, and that in eight Generall Councells &c. Which is as much to say, in the first of Nice, the first of Constantinople, that of Ephesus, Chalcedon, the second, third, & fourth of Constantinople, and the second of Nice, wherin diuers cōtrouersies concerning matters of faith were iudged of, and decided; especially concerning the diuinity of Christ, against the Hereticke Arius; of the diuinity of the holy Ghost, against Macedonius; of one person of Christ, against Nestorius; of two Natures in Christ, against Eutyches and Dioscorus, & so of others. All these Controuersies, saith M. Salclebrigde, were iudged of, and decided by Kings and Emperours.
               2. M. Tooker now, he affirmeth the quite contrary, who by no meanes will haue Kings or Emperors to be Iudges of Controuersies of faith. For thus he writeth pag. 3. of his booke: Olere autem malitiam, ac clamitare audaciam tuam illud vid
                        •
                     tur, cùm Regem caput Ecclesiae, Primatemque confingas, omniumque causarum & controuersiarum, quae ad fidem & R

                     r, you see, would not go to the King. What? should they go to some other Iudge then? But M. Salclebridge he will admit no other. What then were best to be done in this case? Truly euen that, which hitherto hath bin done in the debate of the Kings Supremacy: to wit, alwayes to braule, and iarre therabout, & neuer end the controuersy. And what's the cause? In very deed no other, but for that some thinke one thing, some another, and they cannot, or rather will not find out the certaine & true Iudge, who can decide the matter. And this is the property of heretikes.
               4. The other Question is, Whether the King be Iudg of all Controuersies, that concerne other Ecclesiasticall affaires? M. Salclebridge saith, that he is pag. 165. in these wordes: Audin, Controuersias Episcopales ab Imperatore dir

And yet pag. 23. he seemeth to deny it: Non est Princeps supra res, sed supra personas. The Prince (saith he) is not aboue the matters, but aboue the persons &c. And then againe pag. 49. Rex in suo Regno supremus est, non supra res, sed supra homines. The King in his owne Kingdome is the chiefe or principall, but yet not chiefe ouer thinges, but ouer men. And thus you see euery where nothing but iarring and disagreement.
            
            
               XII. Question. VVhence, & by what Title, hath the King his Primacy in the Church?
               1. THE sense hereof is, Whether the King precisely in that he is a King, or rather in that he is a Christian King, hath the Primacy of the Church? The former part of this point, M. Tompson seemeth to approue pag. 78. where he saith: Omnes Principes, 
                        •
                     tiam Pagani, obiectiuè habent supremam potestat

                     m in omnes omnino personas suorum subditorum, & generatim in res ipsas, siue ciuiles sint, siue sacrae, vt in cultu diuino & Religione procuranda,

saltem quoad modum & exercitium. All Princes, yea euen those that be Pagans, haue for the obiect of their supreme power, all manner of persons that be their subiects, and generally all thinges, whether ciuill or sacred, as in aduancing Gods honour and Religion, at leastwise, so far forth, as belongeth to the manner and exercise therof &c. And then againe pag. 94. Primatus est Regium honum, quod Censurâ tolli non potest. Nec est absurdum, Regem v
                        •

                     siae. Primacy is a certaine Kingly right, that cannot be taken away by censures. Nor is it absurd, that a King, as he is an Ethnicke, be Primate of the Church &c. And yet further in the same place: Rex Ethnicus, cùm Christo initiatur, non acquirit Primatum de nouo. An Ethnicke King (saith he) when as he is instructed in Christ, or the Christian faith, doth not purchase therby any new Primacy &c. To whome consenteth M. Burhill pag. 251. thus: Rex titulo R
                        •
                     gis temporalis potest sibi vindicare, & assumere Primatum Eccl
                        •
                     siae. A King, by the title of a temporall King, may clayme vnto himselfe and take vpon him the Primacy of the Church &c. And pag. 267. Rex etsi iustissimè excommunicatus, non amittit Primatum in rebus Ecclesiasticis. A King although he be most iustly excommunicated, yet doth he not loose his Primacy in Ecclesiasticall matters &c.
               2. My Lord of Fly now, he teacheth vs a quite contrary lesson in his Tortura Torti 
                        •
                     ag. 39. where he auerreth, that the Prima
                     •
                  y of the Church doth belong to the King, not because he is a King, but because

he is a Christian King; and therfore Ethnicke Kings haue not Primacy in the Church, so long as they remaine Ethnicks; but do then receyue the said Primacy, when they are made Christians: and loose the same againe also, when they be excōmunicated. His words are these: An non Regi Ethnico praestare fidem fas? Imo nefas non praestare. In Ethnico enim est vera potestas temporalis, id

                   &c. And a little after. Rex quiuis cùm de

                     •
                  ke, he becōmeth a Christian, doth not loose his earthly right, but getteth a new right. And so in like manner, when as of a Christi
                     •
                  n he becommeth as an Ethnicke, (to wit by 
                        •
                     xcōmunication) then by vigour of the sentence, he looseth that new right which he had gotten, but yet notwithstanding he still retayneth his earthly right in temporall things, which was proper vnto him, before he became a Christian &c.
               3. So as according to the opinion of M. Tompson, and M. Burhill it followeth, that all Kings, whether Christians or Ethnicks, or of whatsoeuer other Sect or Religion they be, are Primates of the

Church in their owne Kingdomes. Therfore all Englishmen and Scots, who liue at Constantinople, are (by their sentence) subiect to the Turke in Ecclesiasticall matters: as also they that liue in Spaine, are subiect to King Philip; and they at Rome to the Pope, and so to others, in other places. What now shall those men do, if the Turke should commaund them to follow the Alcoran? The King of Spaine force them to he
                     •
                  re Masse? The Pope to pray for the dead? and some heathen King perhaps compell them to Idolatry? Shall they then obay these Princes commaund? 
                     •
                  ut then should they do against their Consciences. Shall they refuse to obay? Then farewell Primacy of the Church. Perhaps they will answere, that they will obay, when they thinke good. Shall therfore subiects be Iudges of their Kings? May then the Catholickes in England, say after this manner, If it pl
                        •
                     ase your Maiesty, in this point we thinke good to obay your Maiestyes commaund, but in that not?
               
            
            
               XIII. Question. VVhether the King may constraine his Subiects to take the Oath of Prmacy, or no?
               1. HITHERTO haue we treated of the Iarring & disagreement of our Aduersaries, abou
                     •
                   the nature, offices, & origen of the King
                     •
                   Primacy. Now there remaineth a certaine practicall question, which toucheth the Consciēce to the

quicke; to wit, whether the King may constraine or force his Subiects to sweare, that they acknowledge his Kingly Primacy, wherof we haue spoken before? Or whether they will acknowledg the King as Primate and supreme Head of the Church of 
                     
                        •
                     ngland, vnto whome, as vnto their Primate & supreme Head they will promise fidelity, no lesse in Ecclesiasticall and Spirituall matters, then in Politicke and temporall? This question hath two points. The first, whether the King of England doth de facto exact, or hath at any time exacted such an Oath of his subiects? The other is, whether his subiects are bound in conscience to take such an Oath, if the King should exact the same? Of both these points seuerally I meane to speake a word or two.
               
                  The first Point.
                  2. The first point then is, Whether the King of England doth exact, or at any tyme hath exacted such an Oath of his subiects? It is manifest that K. Henry the 8. did. For so wryteth Doctor Sanders in his booke of the Schisme of England: Laurentius Cocchus Prior Coenobij Dancastrensis, vnà cum tribus Monachis & duobus laicis, Aegidio Horno, & Clemente Philpotto, quòd nollent Ecclesiasticum terreni Regis Primatum iuratò confiteri, exclusi è terris, ad caelestem aeterni Regis gloriam transmissi sunt. Laurence Coch Prior of the Monasterie of Dancaster, togeather with three Monkes and two Laymen, Giles Horne, and Clement Philpot, for that they would not sweare to the Ecclesiasticall Primacy of a temporall King, being excluded

from earth, were transl

                     ted to a celestiall glory of the eternall King &c. And then againe: Proponebantur eis noua Comitiorum Decreta & iubebantur iureiurando affirmare, Regem Ecclesiae supremum esse Ca
                           •
                        ut. The new decrees of the Parlament were propounded vnto them, & they were commaunded to sweare, the King to be supreme Head of the Church &c.
                  3. Now that Queene

                        lizabeth the danghter, followed heerin her Father K. Henry, it is manifest by the forme of Oath that she exacted of her subiects, which is this:

                  4. The very same also doth now King Iames, who byndeth his subiects not with one Oath alone, but with two; to wit, of Supremacy, and Allegiance. The former Oath of Supremacy beginneth thus: Ego A. B. palàm testor, & ex conscientia mea declaro, quod Maiestas Regia
                           •

I A. B. do publikely testify, and in my conscience declare, that the Kings Maiesty is the only supreme Gouernour of this Kingdome, and of all other his Maiesties dominions and territories, as well in all matters and causes spirituall or Ecclesiasticall, as in temporall: And that no forraine Prince, Person, Prelate, State or Potentate hath, or ought to haue any Iurisdiction, power, superiority, preheminence, or authority Ecclesiasticall or spirituall within this Kingdome &c. The later Oath called of Allegiance, beginneth thus: Ego A. B. verè & sincerè agnosco, profiteor, testificor, & declaro in conscientia mea coram Deo & Mundo, qùod supremus Dominus noster Rex Iacobus &c. I A. B. do truly and

sincerely acknowledg, professe, and testify in my conscience, before God and the world, that our Soueraigne Lord King Iames &c.
                  5. Bo
                        •
                     h these Oathes are set downe at large in his Maiesties Apology: and in both of them, his subiects are required publickely and openly to professe & acknowledge
                        •
                      that King Iames is the supreme Gouernour, and Lord of all England, not only in politicke and temporall matters, but in spirituall and Ecclesiasticall also: And that neither the Pope, nor any other forrayner hath any power or Iurisdiction in, or ouer the Church of

                        ngland. Againe the former of these Oathes was brought in by King Henry the 8. as his Maiesty confesseth in his Apology in these words: Sub Henrico octauo primùm introductum est Iuramentum Primatus sub eo

                           •
                        ester were beheaded; and that partly because they refused that Oath. From him all my Predecessours downward, as many as haue imbraced this Religion, did retayne the same Oath, or not much different, vnto themselues &c. Now the later Oath was inuented by K. Iames himselfe.
               
               
                  
                  The second Poynt.
                  6. The Question then is, whether all the Kings subiects in England, are bound in conscience to take both these Oathes, as often as the King shall exact the same? Or whether they should suffer imprisonments, torments, and death it selfe, rather then sweare? Concerning the former point, the Catholikes doubt nothing, for that they haue certainly and firmly determined rather to loose their liues, together with the glorious Martyrs Syr Thomas More, and the Bishop of Rochester, then to ad
                        •
                     it the Kings Primacy, and abiure the Popes. Now concerning the later Oath, there hath byn some doubt made these yeares past. For that some Catholikes, who perceaued not the force and scope of that Oath, did a little stagger at the beginning, whether they might with a safe cōscience sweare therto, or no. Which doubt of theirs notwithstanding did not last long, but was soone taken away by Pope Paul the fifth, and Cardinall Bellarmine For the Pope forthwith directed two Apostolicall Breues to the Catholikes of England, and the said Card. wrote a letter to M. Blackwell then Archpriest of this affaire. Both Pope and Cardinall do deny, that the said Oath may be taken with a safe Conscience. And their reason is this: Because no man, with a safe conscience
                        •
                      can deny the Catholicke faith. But he now, who should take this Oath proposed by the King, should deny the Catholicke faith, though not generally, yet in 
                        •
                     art, so far forth as belōgeth to some one article therof: Ergo,
                     
no man with a safe cōscience can take this Oath.
                  7. This reason, being very sound, all good Catholicks admit: but our aduersaries do not. I, in fauour and consolation of the Catholicks, haue determined to adioyne heerunto two other reasons, especially against the Oath of Supremacy, which by the Aduersaries cannot be reiected. The first is this: No man is bound in Cōscience to sweare that which is eyther apparently false, or at leastwise doubtfull: But, that the King is Primate, and supreme head of the Church, and for such to be obeyed, not only in temporall, but also in Ecclesiasticall matters, is eyther apparently false, or at leastwise doubtfull: Ergo, no man is bound in Conscience to sweare the same. The Maior is euident of it selfe, for that it is not lawfull to affirme any thing which is eyther false or doubtfull, and much lesse to sweare the same. The Minor is proued thus: For that, is it iudged apparently false, aswell amongst the Caluinists, as amongst the Catholicks, that the King is Primate and supreme head of the Church. But now amongst the Caluinists of England, who adhere vnto the King, the same is called into doubt. For that some of them affirme, others deny these points following: 1. That the King is Primate of the Church. 2. That he is supreme head of the Church. 3. That he hath Ecclesiasticall Primacy ouer the Church. 4. That he hath power & iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall. 5. That the K. by his owne proper Authority may assemble Councells or Synods, and sit as chiefe Head or President therin. 6. That he can confer benefices, or

Ecclesiasticall liuings. 7. That he can create and depose Bishops. 8. That he is Iudge in Controuersies of faith &c. So as truly, if these and the like points be doubtfull and vncertaine amongst those who adhere vnto, and fauour the King, seing that some deny them, some affirme them: it followeth necessarily, that the Kings whole Primacy is an vncertaine thing. What rashnes then, and imprudency is it, to go about to bynd Catholicks in their Consciences to sweare that, which they themselues do affirme some of them to be false, some others to be doubtfull?
                  8. I will explicate more distinctly that which I haue said. The Oath of the Kings Primacy, doth contayne so many parts as there be, or are thought to be Offices and functions of the Kings Primacy. The offices then eyther are, or are thought to be diuers, as we haue seene before, to wit, to assemble Synods, to enact and decree Ecclesiasticall lawes, to conferre benefices, to cre
                        •
                     te Bishops, to determine controuersies of faith, and the like. Therfore diuers are the parts of the Oath of the Kings Supremacy. Of these parts then, let vs take one of them by it selfe, to wit this: I A. B. do sweare in my conscience, that I will be faithfull and obedient vnto the King, as often, or whensoeuer he shall, by his owne proper authority, create Bishops, whom he will, and againe depose from their office or dignity, whome he will &c. If this part only of the Kings Offices should be exacted of all his Maiesties subiects in England, what, do you thinke, would be done? Would all, trow you, yea they who most adhere now vnto the King, sweare

this? Let them sweare that would; M. Tooker I am sure, if he be a constant man would not. For that he denyeth the creation and deposition of Bishops to belong any way vnto the King. And if so be, that he, who otherwise acknowledgeth the Kings Primacy (at least in words) would not sweare heerunto; how then should Catholicks be compelled to do the same, who doe in no wise acknowledge it? And what I haue said concerning this point, the same may be also said of the rest.
                  9. My other reason is this. King Iames doth often protest, that he claymeth no more right or Inrisdiction ouer the Church, then did the Kings in the old Testament in ancient times: and therfore that this his Primacy must be contayned within the same lymits, & termes, that theirs was in the old Testamēt. But the Kings in the old Testament could not compell their subiects to sweare such an Oath as this: I A. B. do openly testi
                           •
                        ie, and in my conscience declare, that Ieroboam is the only supreme Gouernour of this Kingdome of Israel, aswell in spirituall as temporall matters: And that no forrayner hath any iurisdiction, power, superiority, preheminence, or authority in this Kingdome &c. Ergo, neyther King Iames can inforce his subiects to take such a like Oath. The Maior is manifest out of his Maiestyes owne words in his Apology. The Minor I thus explicate. After the death of King Salomon, his Kingdome (God so disposing) was deuided into two parts: wherof one conteyned ten Tribes: the other two. So as by this meanes, they became two distinct Kingdomes afterwards, &

therin raigned two distinct Kings, one wherof had no dependance of the other in temporall gouerment. One was called King of Israel, the other King of Iuda: and both of thē had successours in their kingdomes. The first Kings that ruled, after the diuision of the kingdome made, were Ieroboam King of Israel, & Roboam King of Iuda. In eyther kingdome were Priestes and Leuites. But the high or Chiefe Priest, could not reside in both Kingdomes, but only in one, and that ordinarily in Iuda: yet notwithstanding he was Head of all the Priestes & Leuites that remayned in both Kingdomes. Neither could Ieroboam lawfully say vnto his Priests and Leuites: You shall not obey the High Priest, that resideth in the Kingdome of Iuda: but you shall obey me only: for you are exempted from his iurisdiction and power &c. And though he should haue so said; yet no doubt, but he had offended. If now King Ieroboam could not exempt the Priests and Leuites of his owne Kingdome, from the Iurisdiction and Power of a forraine High Priest: by what right then doth now King Iames of England do the same? especially, seeing he auerreth, that he claymeth no more right or iurisdiction vnto himselfe ouer the Church, then the Kings of the old Testament did?
               
            
            
               The Conclusion.
               1. ALL then that hath bene hitherto said, may be reduced vnto three heads. The first is, that the Kings Primacy in the

Church is a new thing, and first brought in by King Henry the 8. nor hitherto hath bene heard of, or vsurped in any other place then only in the Kingdome of 
                     
                        •
                     ngland. The second is: that there be so many Iarres & disagreements of the English Ministry among 
                     •
                  hemselues, concerning this Primacy, that it is not manifest nor certaine what the said Primacy is, nor what force or authority the same hath. The third: that the Oath of this Primacy can neyther be exacted by the King; nor may the Subiects take the same.
               2. Heerehence three other questions which might be made concerning the Subiects, will ea
                     •
                  ily be solued. There be three sorts of Subiects in England. The first, as some call them, are Henricians, who both a
                     •
                  knowledg, & sweare vnto this Kingly Supremacy. The second sort are Puritans, or pure Caluinists, who indeed do not acknowledge the said Supremacy, but yet do sweare therunto. The third are Catholikes, which neyther acknowledge it, nor will sweare it.
               3. The first question then is, What may be said of these Henricians, which both acknowledge and sweare to the Kings Supremacy? I answere: that they do vnwisely and inconsiderately. The reason is
                     •
                   Because it is folly and rashnes, as before I haue said, to sweare a thing that is doubtfull and vncertaine. But the Primacy of the King is a thing altogeather doubtfull and vncertaine amongst the Henricians, as is manifest by their iarres and dissentions, which hithe
                     •
                  to we haue shewed. Ergo, to sweare to such a Supremacy is both folly and rashnes.
               4. The second question is, What may be said of

the Puritans, or pure Caluinists, who do not indeed acknowledg the Kings Primacy, & yet if they be cō
                  maunded, do sweare therto? I answere: that they are periured persons and Politicians. The reason is. Because they belieue one thing, and sweare another. They belieue with Calnin, that neyther Kings nor secular Princes haue any Primacy in spirituall and Ecclesiasticall matters, but only in temporall; yet neuerthelesse they sweare Allegiance vnto the King (togeather with the forsaid Henricians) as to the Primate and supreme Head of the Church: and this they do, to make an externall and politicall peace, which is more esteemed by them, then their faith and Religion; and therfore they are rather to be called Politicks then Christians. Of whome his Maiesty gaue a most worthy testimony, in his Preface Monitory, to wit, That he had found more truth and honesty in the high-land and bordering theeues, then in that sort of people.
               
               5. The third question is, what may be said of Catholickes, who neyther acknowledge the Kings Primacy, nor sweare therto. I answere: that they be iust & vpright men, who walke before God in truth & verity. They be sincere, who professe with their mouth, that which they thinke in their hart. They are wise indeed, who with good Eleazarus had rather dye, then consent to any vnlawfull thing, no not so much, as in outward shew. They be like vnto the Apostles, who endeauour to obey God, rather then men. They be like to the Martyrs of the primitiue Church, who freely professe themselues before the

persecutours, to be such as indeed they are.
               6. But you will say, they be miserable. For if they refuse the Oath, they are forced to vndergoe imprisonments, torments, punishments. Truly they are not therfore miserable but most happy. For so did our Sauiour teach vs in the Ghospell, Matth. 5.10. Bl

               14. With these, and the like testimonies of holy Scriptures were armed Syr Thomas More, & the Bishop of Rochester, when they rather chose to dy, then to take an impious & wicked Oath. With these places were others also animated, who followed them in their glorious fight. And lastly with these, are they encouraged, who now in England are kept in prisons,

bound in fetters, spoyled of their goods and lyuings, and purpled in their owne bloud.

O happy is our Church, which the glorious bloud of Martyrs doth in these our dayes illustrate! It was made white before in the works of our brethren: but now is it made purple in the bloud of Martyrs.
               And yet more in Epist. 24.
