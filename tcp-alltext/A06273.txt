            London Printed by EDW: ALLDE. 1612.
         
         
            
            
            To the gentle Reader, R.B. wisheth all health and welfare according to his owne harts deſire.
            
               It was my good hap gentle Reader, not many dayes agoe, to hit vpon this diſcourſe of London Triacle: which after I had ſhewed vnto diuers of iudgement and skill in ſuch matters & found that they iudged the booke well worthy the ſetting out, eſpecially in this infectious ſeaſon. I reſolued thereupon to publiſh it to the world, that therby the fruite and benefite thereof might the better be imparted to our whole nation. It ſhould ſeeme the diſcourſe was fully ended before the plague in London began this laſt Summer, for otherwiſe it is not to be thought but the authour would ſomwhere haue made mention therof. Notwithſtanding, I my ſelfe hauing made diligent enquiry as wel of Phiſitions as of Surgeons & Apothecaries what tryall hath bene made therof in the time of peſtilence, I am by many of good iudgement aſſuredly certified that amongſt the poore eſpecially (whome it moſt haunted) this Triacle by good triall and experience hath beene found to be of ſingular vertue, and to haue ſaued the liues of hundreds which haue taken it: for very few which in the firſt or ſecond day of the diſſeaſe took any reaſonable quantitie of it (for litle of it as of all other preſeruatiues can haue ſmall force) and therewithall laid themſelues to ſweate, very few I ſay miſcaried: yea the moſt part did within few houres perceiue the venome of the diſeaſe to be driuen cleane from the heart to the outward partes, wherby within a day or two after, they found themſelues paſt all daunger. But becauſe it is no part of my

meaning, neyther preſume I to haue skill enough to ſet down at full the due prayſes of ſo pretious a preſeruatiue. I will ſurceaſe to proceed any further in commending the ſame vnto you: and that ſo much the rather, becauſe the Authour in the diſcourſe it ſelfe hath at large declared the vertues thereof. Onely this I will ſay therof by the way, that I can in nothing reſemble this Triacle better, then to the moſt valiant and victorious champion Hercules for his worthy actes and conqueſts canonized amongſt the Gods. For as Hercules is reported to haue trauailed continually from countrey to countrey throughout the whole world, euery where as he went deſtroying monſters, ſlaying Tyrantes, murtherers & robbers; clearing high wayes, cleanſing all peſtiferous ayres and noyſome waters, whereby he deliuered infinite nations from thraldome and ſlauery, freed all paſſages for trauailers and waifarers, and reſtored the interrupted intercourſe and trade with forraine countreyes, to the wonderfull and ineſtimable benefit of all mankind: Euen ſo this Triacle being by good aduice recieued into mans body, deſtroieth all venome and poiſon, killeth or expelleth all corrupt vapors and humors, and ſcoureth all the pipes & conduits whereby it ſaueth the heart and chiefe intrailes from ſuffocation and deſtruction, freeth all the vaines and veſſels and reſtoreth free recourſe and paſſage of the liuely and cheerefull ſpirits and nouriſhing humors into all the members of the body, to the ſinguler comfort and refreſhing of the whole man. What ſhould cauſe or induce the Authour ſo long to ſtay the publiſhing of ſo fruitefull or rather neceſſary a diſcourſe, in this ſo fit an opportunity, it is hard to gueſſe, vnleſſe peraduenture it be that he perceiued ſtraight vpon the perfecting of his booke the plauge to begin, and therefore thought it not amiſſe to deferre the ſetting out therof vntill eyther by him ſelfe or ſome learned men, ſufficient triall might be taken of the forcible effects thereof in the plague it ſelf, as already very good experiment had beene prooued in many other diſſeaſes, Wherein if I haue gueſt aright, I hope the Authour

hath leſſe cauſe to be offended with me conſidering I haue but done that which he meant to haue perfourmed himſelfe, in making him do his countrey good a litle ſooner then he intended. And my hope herein is the greater, becauſe it is apparant by the ſuppreſſing of his name, that he neither ambitiouſly therby hunted after praiſe, nor greedily gaped for gaine, but wholy reſpected the benefiting and profiting of his countrey, By how much the more his good meaning is of all men to be taken in good part. And thus preſuming that the Authour will beare with my boldneſſe and not doubting but ſo well a meant worke ſhall be acceptably receiued of the gentle Reader, I commit them both vnto the almighties protection.

            The occaſion of the making of London Triacle
            
               
                  THe Maſters & Wardens of the Grocers companie, hauing by ſundry yeares ſearches, wel marked and obſerued, that a filthy & vnwholſome baggage compoſition, (termed cōmonly Triacle of Geane) hath bene craftily, and by couine of certaine lewd perſons, in a monſtrous quantity, ſome thouſand weight yearely brought into this Realme, and here to the fowle deceauing, and danger of the liues of many thouſands, bene publikely ſould, carying credit with all ſorts of people, onely for the bare name ſake of Theriaca, or Triacle: (as their dutie to their country bound them) did diuers yeares vſe all ſuch good meanes and orders, as they could deuiſe, to banniſh cleane out of the realme, or at leaſt to hinder much the vente of ſuch a uoyſome and poyſoniſh drugge. For although that the moſt of the company were not greatly learned, yet many of them being diſcreete men, and of good inſight and experience in ſuch matters, did out of the rules of bare reaſon, gather that this ſo named Geane Triacle, being (as it is wel known) made only of the rotten garble, & refuſe outcaſt of all kinde of ſpices and drugs, hand ouer head, with a little filthy molaſſes, and tarre to worke it vp withall, was ſo farre from either curing or preuenting any diſeaſe in mans

bodie, that by all likelyhood it muſt needes ingender moſt rotten and corrupt humors. And with good reaſon might they iudge that compoſition of no great vertue and force, which hath bene often ſould of late yeares for xxx. s̄. and ſometimes for xxviii.s.̄ the hundred, which falleth out iii.d or at moſt vnder iii.d.q. a pound.
            Now, what good Spice, Suger, Hony, or other drugge of any vertue can be ſould for ſo bace a price, let any man iudge? So as it is moſt apparaunt to one that hath but halfe an eye, that ſo baſe a compoſition muſt needes be made of ſuch dregges, and refuſe, as are more fitte for the dungcartes, then the Apothecaries, or Grocers ſhoppes. And ſurely it is great pittie, that ſome ſeuere puniſhment is not by the ſuperiour maieſtrates, inflicted vpon ſuch lewd perſons, as being ſo often warned do ſtill bring in, or otherwiſe by themſelues, or their ſeruants make, or vtter ſuch filthy and rotten drugges, and that vnder the cloake and name of ſo comfortable a preſeruatiue, as Triakle hath in all ages bene eſteemed to be.
            But to goe forward, the Grocers finding that their good care, and diſcreete orders for the banniſhing of ſo vnwholſome a drugge, did not take ſuch effect as they looked for and wiſhed: and obſeruing that the very cheapnes of this miſnamed Geane Triacle, together with the exceſſiue dearnes of Venice Triacle, and Mithridate, were the onely cauſes, that ſtill contiinued ſo meruailous a vent thereof, After deliberate conſultation had, thought it beſt to entreat the learned Society of Phiſitions, to ſet downe ſome effectuall receite of Triacle, which might be both forceable againſt rotten and venemous diſſeaſes, and alſo of an eaſie and moderate price for the poore ſubiect.
            Vnto which, their ſo honeſt and reaſonable requeſt, the Colledge of Phiſitions did readily condiſcend: and therevpon they preſently committed the charge of the ſetting down of the receite, vnto three choiſe men of their companie, which ſhould (by a certaine day) deliuer vnto Mr. Beſſe an

Apothecarie (to whome both by the Phiſitions and Grocers order, the making thereof was onely committed) their preſcript, which they did after diligent conferring of ſundry receats of learned writers, together (according to the charge to them committed, carefully performe:) within fewe daies after Mr. Beſſe did bring to the Colledge, both the preſcript to him before deliuered, and alſo a pound of the compoſition, which he by their order had made vp for a tryall ſake, to the intent that all the whole company of Phiſitions together, after diligent examination of the preſcript, with ſuch tryall as Arte could take, by the colour, taſte, ſmell, and conſiſtence of the Tryacle it ſelfe, might either reſolue vpon that receat alreadie ſet downe, or elsby adding, and rebating, as by their skill ſhould ſeeme good (with ſome little change) ſette downe another. And ſo it fell out indeede, that ſome little alteration, being in one ſimple or two made, the receate, was (with the Colledge ſeale annexed vnto it) redeliuered to the ſaid Mr. Beſſe, to be yearely by him accordingly diſpenſed and prepared, with ſtreight charge, not in any iot or point, to varie from the very words of the ſame preſcript: And that euery yeare before the diſpenſing thereof, he ſhould giue notice to the Preſident, and Cenſors of the Phiſitions Colledge, that for the carefuller preparing thereof, they might with any other of their Societie, come to his houſe and there make examination, and tryall of all the ſimples, ingredients, before they were put together, & compounded.
            And that to the good of all the Realme, the ſaid Triacle might be the more faithfully prepared, the Maſter and Wardens of the Grocers, firſt preſented M.W. Beſſe to the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen his bretheren, as a very fit Man both for skill, and honeſt carefulnes in his profeſſion, to performe the Compounding of ſuch a Tryacle: where was giuen him a corporall Oath, for the true, and carefull preparing thereof: And afterwards, the ſaid Maſter and Wardens did deliuer vnto M.W. Beſſe in writing, both the receate new writte out againe, and withall, all the poynts of his Oath, with the Seale of their

Company, reſeruing the Phiſitions receate and ſeale, for their diſcharge, in the Grocers Hall. Which courſe and order of examining yearely the ſimples, and carefull making vp of the Compoſition, hath now theſe fiue years bene accordingly put in execution, and the Triacle it ſelfe (by ſo many yeares experience) throughly tried to be of ſinguler vertue, and of wonderfull force, as well in comforting nature, as in expelling all noyſome, and venomous matter from the hart, and principall partes of mans body.
            In ſetting downe of which receate, the Phiſitions tooke eſpeciall care to appoint ſuch ingredients as were perfectly knowne, not hard to be gotten, and (as much as might be in ſo forceable, and effectuall a preſeruatiue) home bredde: and this they chiefely did, for the good and eaſe of the poore ſubiect, whoſe purſe cannot reach vnto the price of coſtly medicines. All which things well conſidered, there may be more ſaid iuſtly in the commendation of this London Triacle, then may be of any other medicine whatſoeuer heretofore deuiſed, and ſet out in this Realme: And if I ſhould ſay forraine Realmes too, it might well be iuſtified, conſidering the ſound learning, deepe iudgement, and long experience of the whole Colledge of Phiſitions, that deuiſed it with the great care which both they, and alſo the magiſtrates of the Citie haue taken, for the diligent, and perfect preparing thereof. As for the price, it is ſo reaſonable (a pound not amounting aboue ij. s̄. viij. d. an ounce by retale not aboue ii.d.) as no wiſe man will ſpare ſo much to do his horſe or dogge good withall.
            This Tryacle is made, and to be had at the houſe of M. William Beſſe, dwelling in the Poultery, neere the Counter.
            
               
               Of the firſt inuention of Theriaca, and in what eſtimation mightie Princes euer haue had it.
               ALthough Andromachus the Elder, Nero the Emperours chiefe Phiſition, be of moſt men eſtéemed, as the firſt inuentour of Triacle, or Theriaca, yet you muſt vnderſtand, that he did onely adde vipers, firſt to ſome olde compoſition thereof, which he liked beſt, and withall gaue it a new name, tearming it, not Theriaca, but Galene, as much to ſay as calmenes, or ſtilnes. This Galene did Crito (a famous practicioner vnder the Veſpatians reignes) name Theriaca, becauſe it receiued the fleſh of vipers: of Phiſitions, by a preheminence named in Greeke 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   But that the Reader may, together take a view both of the firſt beginning, and originall, and alſo what great credit Theriaca was preſently in with mightie Princes, euen vpon the very firſt inuention: He muſt vnderſtand, that the verie firſt Theriaca, recorded of in writers, is that of Antiochus, whome Plinie ſurnameth Magnus, and Galen Philometor. He reigned in Siria ſome 200. yeares before Chriſt. This was called Antiochus his Theriaca, becauſe that great and mightie King himſelfe did continually vſe it as a preſeruatiue againſt all poyſons, and venomous ſtingings. By whoſe countenance, it grew preſently into ſuch eſtimation and credit, that the famous Phiſition Endemus, (as Galen reporteth) put the receate thereof in verſe: And that all men might pertake the good and profite of ſo forceable a preſeruatiue: The verſes (as Plinie recordeth) were engrauen in ſtone, ouer the porch doore of Aeſculapius his Temple, as a medicine of ſo diuine power and vertue, as not to be eſteemed for any mans inuention, but rather a diuine receate reuealed vnto mankinde, by the great God of Phiſick himſelfe. Within two or three ages after Antiochus,
                  
did Nicander, that learned Phiſition and Poet, dedicate his booke, named Theriaca, vnto Attalus then King of Perganum, where after, Galen was borne. This Attalus was a noble Prince, greatly fauouring and aduancing all kinde of good learning: but aboue all things, wonderfully giuen to make triall of the vertues of medicines, and eſpecially of ſuch as were thought of force againſt venomous beaſts, & poyſons: which both he then, and by his example afterward, Mithridates the great (as Galen truly teſtifieth) did curiouſly and diligently, make experiment of vpon condemned perſons. The experiments of this learned King Attalus, rōming within an age or two after vnto the hands of Mithridates, and being by his like ſtudie, and tryall in immitation of Attelus (
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ) much encreaſed, he culd out of both their experiences, the very choiſe ſimples, and thereof deuiſed a moſt effectuall compoſition, named by Galen Theriaca Mithridatis (much differing from that which we commonly call Methridatum) by continuall vſe of which medicine, he preſerued himſelfe many ſcore yeares free from all danger of poyſoning: ſo that (as Galen writeth) being ſtreightly beſeiged by the Conquering Romans, and out of all hope to eſcape, to preuent their cruelty, and to auoide his owne ſhame, he twice tooke ranke and ſtrong poyſon: but the force of his ſo often receaued Tryacle was ſuch, as no poyſon neuer ſo great could preuaile againſt it, whereby in the end, the good king was compelled to dye vpon his owne ſword.
               About fourſcore yeares after Mithridates miſerable end, did Aelius Gallus, Tiberius the Emperours lieftenant in Aegipt and Arabiae, in his returne from thence, bring two receates of Theriaca home with him: wherewith he preſented the Emperour Tiberius, eſteeming them as fit preſents for ſo mighty a Manarch.
               Now in what wonderfull eſtimation, or rather admiration, Tryacle was had in Galens time, Galen himſelfe doth at large ſet downe, in his booke Intituled of Triacle, and

dedicated vnto Piſo a noble Roman: which booke (as may be gathered by the text) he writ in the beginning of Caracalla his Raigne, before he had made away his brother Geta. For Marcus Aurelius (in the beginning of whoſe raigne Galen firſt came to Rome) a Prince for his deepe and profound learning, named Marcus the Philoſopher, and which (as Galen teſtifieth) had a perfect and exquiſite knowledge of his owne temprature and complexion, by the daily vſe of Triacle (being both by nature, and alſo by trauaile, as well of body as minde, of a weake conſtitution) liued many yeares (notwithſtāding) in excellent good health, & ſtate of bodie. So that the wonderfull opinion, which was had through all the world of this Emperours wiſdome, & learning, together with his long continued health, procured by the onely vſe of this preſeruatiue, brought Triacle into ſuch credit and eſtimation, that all great men, as well in the Court of Rome, as els where in the Country and Prouinces abroad, following the Emperours example, fell to the vſe thereof. And leaſt the reader ſhould thinke that Marcus Aurelius onely vſed Andromachus his Triacle: let him reade the laſt chapter of Galens ſecond booke of Counter-poyſons, where, in the very firſt line he ſhall finde the receate that Aurelius ſo much vſed, compounded but onely of four ſimples, and God he knowes, a ſimple compoſition indeede (for all the great credit it had) if it be compared with our London Tryacle.
               Some fourteene yeare after M. Aurelius his departure, ſucceeded in the Empire Soptianus Seuerus, a prince though not greatly learned, yet both very wiſe and valiant.
               This Emperour made that moſt renowned Phiſition (or rather Prince of all Phiſitions) Galen, to prepare and compound for the Emperours owne vſe, the Theriaca of Andromachus, and that of the chiefeſt, and moſt choyce ſimples, which could be got in the whole world: whereby through the renounce of ſo famous a Phiſitian, the glorious name of Triacle was euer after amongſt all poſteritie

wonderfully encreaſed and aduaunced. From Galen vntill our dayes (almoſt 1400. yeares) If one ouer-runne the ſtories of all nations and ages, He ſhall finde that Triacle hath beene from time to time, of all mighty Princes had in wonderfull eſtunation and reputation. Yea that moſt Tyrannous and Barbarous Monarch, the great Turke, euery yeare in Egypt (becauſe that Country lieth moſt fitly to get all Indian and Arabian ſimples freſheſt) hath by the handes of the skilfulleſt and learnedſt Phiſitions, which that ſauadge & vnlettered nation yeildeth, a compoſition of Theriaca prepared by the name of Tharach Faruc, which both of the Emperour himſelfe, & of all his Baſhawes and great men, is had in wonderfull eſtimation. Although that through the ignorance of their Phiſitions in the making therof, both the vipers themſelues (for whom they ſubſtitute a kind of Serpent with horns, called therfore of the Greeks Ceraſtes but of the Egyptians Tahyr) and many other eſpeciall ſimples beſides are miſtaken and falſified: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that the Alexandrian or Egyptian Theriaca is in no degree to be compared with any kind of Triacle artificially prepared in ſundry Citties of Chriſtendome, where all kindes of good learning, and namely of Phiſicke do moſt plentifully flouriſh.
            
            
               VVhy it was called Triacle or Theriaca.
               FOr the naming of it Theriaca or Triacle, diuers and ſundry reaſons may be alleaged. Firſt, becauſe it was of purpoſe ordained to ſupply the vſe, or rather to reforme the abuſe, and to enioy and poſſeſſe the roome and place of that baſtard Triacle, which hath theſe many yeares, to the vnſpeakable annoyance of many thouſands, beene too too much vſed in this Realme, by the name of Geane Triacle. The ſecond, but principall reaſon is, for

that all, or moſt of the ingredients, hauing ſinguler force againſt, either inward poyſons, or outward venomous bytings▪ or ſtingings of venomous beaſts, it muſt needes follow, that ſo perfect a compoſition made of ſo choiſe counter-poyſons, & thoſe ſo orderly in weight and meaſure proportioned, could not but be of wonderfull vertue and efficacy, not onely againſt poiſons and venomes, but alſo againſt all corruption and rottenneſſe, either of humors or ſpirits: Neither is the name Triacle or Theriaca to be thought, as vnfitly attributed to the London compoſition, although it receaue no vipers fleſh in it at all. For notwithſtanding that Crito a famous Empericke about Veſpatianus his dayes, gaue that ſame compoſition, which Andromachus Neroes Phiſition, firſt either inuented or enlarged, & withall tearmed it Galene the name of Theriaca, becauſe it receiued vipers fleſh, (which kind of Serpent is of many Greekes both Phiſitions & Philoſophers, by a prerogatiue called 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   yet the name of Theriaca hath both before Neroes time and ſince, bene commonly attributed not only to compounds, contayning no vipers fleſh at all, but alſo to very ſimples, only for that they were iudged of force againſt the bytinges and ſtinginges of venomous beaſtes. For compoundes, who ſo doubteth, let him read the 10. chap. of the 2 booke of Galen of counterpoiſons (for ſo I tranſlate Antidotus) where he ſhall finde fiue ſeuerall Theriacaes vpon a row, into none of which, vipers fleſh is any ingredient. The firſt, of Antipater, The ſecond, & third, of Aelius Gallus (vnder whoſe conduct in our Sauiour Chriſts time, Strabo that learned Geographer did trauaile both Egypt and Arabia) The fourth, of Euclide by-named Palatianus. The fifth, of Zeno the Laodician. Againe, in the fourteenth chap. he ſhal finde Theriaca Antiochi, Philometoris (Plini calleth him Magnus) which raigned in Siria ſome 12. ſcore years before euer vipers fleſh was put into any Theriaca. For Andromachus Neroes Phiſition, by Galens owne teſtimony, was the very firſt that added vipers fleſh vnto Theriaca. Now

ſince Andromachus time, we may finde infinite receipts of Theriaca in ſundry Phiſitions, clearely voide of vipers fleſh: As namely, that which M. Aurelius ſo much vſed with ſo good ſucceſſe, then the vulger Theriaca diateſſaron a ſimple receate, in ſhew of foure common ſimples, yet a receate no doubt of ſingular force and vertue: And laſt of all, that baggage compoſition, thruſt in vnder the name of Geane Triacle, hath theſe many yeares vſurped the name of Theriaca, although it hath no vipers fleſh in it at all.
               As for ſimples, both Galen calleth Garlicke the country mans Triacle, and Plinie maketh mention, of a kinde of Vine in the Iland of Thaſos, called therefore Theriaca, becauſe, as well the grape, as the wine would heale the bitings, and ſtingings of Serpents. Beſides, Valeriana is of ſondry late writers, named Theriaca for the ſame reaſon: which things conſidered, the learned Colledge of Phiſitions of this famous Citie of London, did very aptly, and aduiſedly (to this their Compoſition) attribute the name of Theriaca. And that ſo much the more, for that this London Triacle, beſides the choyſe of olde ſimples, containeth in it, at leaſt a dozen ſpices and hearbes, not knowne to the olde writers: whoſe wonderfull vertues, are notwithſtanding againſt all poyſons and venomes (by many a hundred yeares tryal) ſufficiently approoued. And theſe late knowne ſimples were added, by warraant both of reaſon (the perfect rule and leuell of all Phiſitions actions) and alſo of Auerroes, the beſt learned, both Philoſopher, and Phiſition of all the Arabians, which in his abridgement of Phiſick, (commonly called the Colliget) doth iuſtly reprooue the opinion of Auicen, (otherwiſe himſelfe a moſt famous Phiſition) affirming the Andromachus his Triacle, taketh his ſo wonderfull force, not from the vertues & qualities of the ſimples which are in it, but from a fift ſupernaturall hidden propertie, proceeding from the eſſentiall forme (as he tearmeth it forſooth) of the whole mixture, and therefore ſtrictly warneth all Phiſitions, neither to adde too, nor

diminiſh any thing from Andromachus his firſt preſcript: Which opinion of Auicen, as too ſuperſtitiouſly tying all poſterity to our fore-fathers receipts, Auerroze doth, and that iuſtly confute, wiſhing (which in this compoſition, the Phiſitions of London haue with great reaſon put in practiſe) that diuers of ſuch excellent counter-poyſon ſimples, as later times haue diſcouered, ſhould be either added ouer and aboue the olde ingredients, or elſe ſubſtituted in ſome of their places, which were found to be of leaſt force and vertue.
            
            
               Of the vertues, and qualities of London Tryacle.
               TO recite all the vertues, and vſes of the London Triacle, as well in preuenting, as incuring moſt gréeuous diſſeaſes, would require a learneder, and larger diſcourſe, then at this preſent is either requiſite, or intended to be ſet downe. Notwithſtanding the cheife, and moſt principall quallities thereof, and thoſe from which the reaſons and grounds of all the reſt muſt be fetched, are theſe that follow. Firſt, this Triacle heateth, and dryeth about the midſt (as Phiſitions tearme it) of the ſecond degree, and withall, is of very thinne parts. Secondly, it hath a skowring, or deanſing vertue, with a moderate aſtriction. By his heate, it helpeth all kindes of concoction, and ripeneth all crud humors, or drines in mans body. By his heate, & thinnes of parts, it openeth all poares & paſſages, it thinneth & breatheth out groſſe humors and windes, it ſofteneth hard tumors, and relaxeth ſtifnes of partes, and conſequently mittigateth all kinde of paines, and greifes: It prouoketh ſweate, vrine, and womens courſes, it openeth the Emerands, and furthereth all euacuations: By his drynes, and cleanſing powre, it conſumeth and waſteth, or els wypeth away all groſſe, tough, and clammy humors: and thereby deliuereth

obſtructions, and mightily reſiſteth all putrifaction, and poyſons, either inward or outward. By his milde aſtriction and moderate warmth, it ſtrengthneth all the principall members of mans bodie, and thereby renueth good ſpirits, ingendereth pure blood, and ſtayeth all immoderate waſtings, and euacuations, either of humors or ſpirits. So that what ſoeuer infirmity in mans body, proceedeth either from too much aboundance of humors and winde, or els from their faultines in coldnes, groſenes, toughnes, clammines, or rottennes: likewiſe what ſoeuer is cauſed by ſtopping of the conduits, and paſſages, or by the aſtriction, and ſhutting of the poares: Beſides whatſoeuer imperfections or defaultes poſſeſſe the cheife and principall partes, and thereby hinder or depraue any of their functions or workes: all theſe (if they be by inward medicines curable) may by this Triacle (artificially and skilfully vſed) be either wholy, and altogether cured, or at leaſt greatly eaſed, and amended. To a Phiſition, or any other man trayned vp in good literature, theſe breife inſtructions are ſufficient, to direct him fully to the perfect vſe of this Triacle, in all conuenient diſſeaſes. But becauſe this diſcourſe dooth cheifly reſpect, and is eſpecially written for the ignorant, and vnlettered multitude of the common people, which is no wayes able to conceaue the naturall cauſes of things: it will not be amiſſe, for the ſimple perſons better inſtruction, to ſet down by name, ſuch common and running diſſeaſes, as this Triacle is moſt to be vſed againſt. Firſt, of all therefore it is of marueilous force againſt the Plague, Sweating-ſicknes Pocks (ſmall I meane) or meaſels, or any other malitious & peſtilent Feauer. For being giuen the ſicke perſon to drinke with Dragons, Carduus Benedictus, or Angelica water, it driueth out from the hart and principall partes to the skinne, all the venome and corruption of the diſſeaſe. By the ſame vertue it both preſerueth, and alſo cureth as well any inward poyſon, as any byting or ſtinging of madde dogge or venomous beaſt: yea, being outwardly

applyed to the bytings and ſtingings: or to the Carbunble or Bubo in the plague, it doth (as it were) miraculouſly drawe out all the inward venome, and corruption by that iſſue. As for long head-aches, & megrames, Turnſicknes, dulnes of ſight, thicknes of hearing, and ſuch like diſſeaſes of the braine, ſinewes, and inſtruments of Senſes, which proceede from colde and tough humors, or from winde, all theſe by the continuall vſage hereof, may in time be either cleane taken away, or elſe greatly aſſwaged and diminiſhed: For by comforting the braine, it cheareth the ſpirits, ſharpeneth the wit, ſtrengthneth the memorie, quickneth all the Senſces. Againſt the falling ſicknes, and wormes, being diſſeaſes moſt commonly troubling children this Triacle is an eſpeciall remedie: as hauing diuers choyce ingredients, perticularly reſpecting thoſe infirmities of purpoſe inſerted into it: For the Wheaſings, and olde coughs, being taken with the water or decoction of Hyſope, or Horehound, it is very effectuall: as alſo with the decoction of Comfrey rootes, or conſeruc of olde red Roſes, it excellently ſtayeth any lingering ſpitting of blood, iſſuing from the lungs or cheſt: Likewiſe it healeth any ſtitches in the ſides (if they proceede not from hotte inflamations or pleurifles) being either inwardly taken, or outwardly applyed hot. Now in the ſtomacke, it prouoketh appetite, helpeth concoction, and diſtribution, breaketh and diſcuſſeth winde and either digeſteth or driueth out from thence, all rawe and corrupt humors, whereby it healeth the inflation, or puffing vp of the ſtomacke with winde, and cureth that kinde of greedines (which Phiſitions tearme the dogges appetite) which diſſeaſe forceth them that haue it, to eate their meate greedily, and that very much, but preſently after to caſte it againe: notwithſtanding after they haue vomited, their appetite is no whit ſtayed nor abayted, but ſtreight way they become as greedy againe as before: In the lyuer it deliuereth all obſtructions, & cureth the yealow Iaundiſe, eſpetially being taken with the decoction

of worme wood (ground pure) Horehound, Alecoaſt, Maudline, or Succory: Whereby it cureth the gréene ſicknes, and the dropſie, not being growne too farre, nor rooted. The like force it hath in infirmities of the ſpleene, wherein it helpeth all ſtoppings, diſcuſſeth windineſſes, and diminiſheth all ſort of colde ſwellings or tumors: namely, being receaued with the decoction of Tamariſke, barke of Capers rootes, or of Finger-fearne. Neither is it of leſſe power and vertue, in curing the diſſeaſes of the entralls or guttes: for it ſingularly helpeth the Collick, and ſtayeth all lares, and aſwageth all torments, and grypings, if it be orderly taken with fitte, & conuenient liquors, ſtrops, or conſerues. But the moſt eſpeciall, and ſingular vertue thereof, is the wonderfull comfort and ſtrength it yeeldeth and imparteth to the hart, the principall parte of the life of man: which his force is moſt mightily perceaued in faintings, and ſwoundings. The ſame effects it ſhoweth in tremblings of the hart, and in all melancholie-paſſions and frights.
               But to goe forward: in the kidnies and bladder, it mildly ſcowreth away and clenſeth ſand, grauell, or ſtones, and thereby often times cureth the ſtoppings of Vrine, and the Stran
                     〈…〉
                  rie. For the Gowt (after generall euacuations orderly adminiſtred) the continuall vſe of this Tryacle, is a moſt effectuall remedie: which effect it worketh by helping concoction in the ſtomacke and Lyuer, by comforting the braine, and by drying vp, or driuing out, either by ſweate, or inſcenſible outbreathings, all ſuperfluous moyſture, both there and in all other parts of the bodie. Beſides all theſe, it is a ſingular remedie, both for Palſies and cramps, either inwardly taken, or outwardly applyed, and annoynted with ſome conuenient Oyle or greaſe. In womens matters, although the vertues thereof be excellently effectual, notwithſtanding, I thinke it not amis to omit the rehearſall of them at this time, becauſe any large diſcourſe thereof, eſpecially in the mother tongue, may ſeeme vnfit for chaſte eares, and

beſides, is more likely to do harme then good, in vnchaſte mindes.
               But here I may not ouer paſſe the mighty power it hath in driuing away any long lingering Ague, proceeding from colde, groſſe, or tough humors, & namely, of an old quartane Ague, if it be orderly giuen in good large proportion, with the decoction of Germander, or Tamariſke halfe an houre before the fit, the partie withall being put into a warme bed, & with ſtore of warme clothes prouoked preſently to ſweate: marry here great heede muſt be taken, that firſt the body be well purged, and let blood (if neede be) and that the humor be ripe and concocted. To ſet downe at large, all the perticuler vertues, & effects of this London Triacle, would make vp a large volume. For becauſe therefore both I meane to be ſhort, and theſe vertues alreadie expreſſed are ſufficient to direct any reaſonable man to the orderly vſe of this London Triacle, in moſt common diſſeaſes: I will ſurceaſe to diſcourſe any longer of the quallities thereof, and proceede to the order of vſing it.
            
            
               The order of vſing London Triacle.
               IN the vſe of London Triacle, three things are to be conſidered: firſt, the quantitie, next the time, and laſtly, the manner of miniſtring of it. A certaine quantitie, either in weight or meaſure thereof, cannot preciſely be declared in words, by reaſon of the manifold diuerſities, as well of the ſtrength, age, ſexe, temperature, and complexion of the ſicke bodie, as of the diſſeaſes themſelues, their cauſes, and the parts of mans body therewith poſſeſſed: In ſucking children halfe a ſcruple will be a reaſonable quantitie: In women with childe, or in child-bed, in very olde folkes, or yong children paſt ſucking, a whole ſcruple may be well borne: in ſtronger bodies, and abler conſtitutions, a larger proportion

may be allowed, (due conſideration being had of the vrgencie of the diſſeaſe, and the ſtrength of the partie) as from a ſcruple weight vpward to a whole dra
                     •
                  me or foure ſcruples in very vrgent and hard diſſeaſes, as in driuing away of a quartane or ſuch like. But when poyſon is already receaued inwardly, or any bodie newly bitten, ſlung with a mad dog, or venomous beaſt, you muſt aſcend yet higher, and encreaſe your daſts to two dragmes weight, yea, and in ſtrong poyſons and venomes, vnto three dragmes, and this you muſt often times doe, and not be content with once giuing it.
               And here becauſe moſt men knowes not theſe names of Scruples and Dragmes, and many men though, they peraduenture knowe them, yet haue them not readie at hand when neede requires, it is to be vnderſtood, that a drag-weight in Engliſh ſiluer is vii.d. ob. iuſt, and a ſcruple (which is the third part of a dragme, weigheth iuſt ij.d. ob. now who ſo cannot halfe or double any of theſe, is too ſimple to be thought fit to miniſter medicines vnto any ſicke bodie being in danger. Furthermore, for becauſe that moſt of the common and vulgar people, though they had weights, yet they knowe them not: and which is more, knoweth not how to weigh any thing by thoſe coynes which they beſt knowe, it is thought not amis, to ſet downe ſuch directions in giuing of this Triacle, as the ignoranteſt man of all cannot much goe amis. For a ſcruple, they are full the bignes of a meane and ordinarie haſell. Nut huſked: and for a dragme, the quantity of a ſmall nutmeggo, may ſafely be adminiſtred, and ſo the reſt 
                     •
                  atably: And thus much for the quantity. Now for the time and fit ſeaſon of giuing it (which, as in all other medicines adminiſtring, ſo in this Triacle giuing is the difficulteſt poynte of ſkill in all phiſick) two things are chiefly to be noted: The time of the day, and the time of the diſſeaſe. Of all times of the day the morning is moſt apt, and fitteſt both for this medicine and all other ſuch like to be taken in. And good cauſe why: For in

the morning, after the whole nights reſt, the former dayes meate being fully digeſted and diſpearſed into the outward parts of the bodie, the inward parts, as the ſtomacke, liuer, ſpleene, and bellie vaines, are then empty, & therefore more apt both to receaue in themſelues, and to diſpearſe throw into the whole bodie, the force and vertue of the medicine then taken. For alwaies, eſpeciall care and regarde is to be taken, that neyther this Triacle, nor any ſuch like ſtrong & forceable medicine, be adminiſtred inwardly after meate, or vpon a full belly. Yea, and if the bellie be not either by nature looſe, or by Arte made ſoluble, the vſe of Triacle can no wayes be ſafe.
               The other time to be obſerued, is that of the diſſeaſe it ſelfe, which caryeth ſo great ſway, that often times it ouerruleth the time of the day, and altereth it at pleaſure, according to the time of the whole diſſeaſe, or of that preſent fitt then poſſeſſing the ſick body: for the time of the whole ſicknes, as a long Ague, or other lingering diſſeaſe, it is againſt all rules of Arte to miniſter Triacle, either in the beginning, or in the encreaſe of the diſſeaſe, vntil manyfeſt tokens of concoction and ripenes appeare: after which time (if the obſtructions of the lyuer or ſpleene continue not ſtill great) you may ſafely, accordingly as the ripenes encreaſe, & the obſtructions decreaſe, ratably augment the quantitie of your Triacle. The ſame is to be obſerued in the time of the fit: for vntill the matter of that fit make ſhow of ripenes, & that the paſſages of the outward parts and ſkinne be ſomwhat opened, you may no wayes giue any Triacle: but after that time you may ſafely miniſter it, the better thereby to further the iſſue of ſweate, and inſencible out-breathings: by which kindes of euacuations (being aboundantly performed) very often times it falleth out▪ that the whole diſſeaſe is diſſolued and rid away.
               Beſides the two times rehearſed, ſhe one of the

                   the other of the diſſeaſe, the age of the Triacle it leſſe is diligently to be conſidered: for the newer he is, the better,

As gaine, the older this Triacle is, the more forceable and effectuall are his vertues, in opening all ſtoppings and obſtructions of the principall parts, and conſequently in expecting, and driuing out from the inward to the outward parts all venomous and rotten, either humors or vapors.
               Now for the manner of giuing it, you muſt note, that if your intent be to ſtay any fluxe or euacuation, by ſtrengthening the principall parts, or elſe to mittigate & aſſwage any inward point, in ſuch caſes you muſt miniſter your Triacle in ſolide or drye forme, either alone, or with ſome conſerue, or Electuary, and then ſleepe vpon it: vnles you meane to ſtay immoderate ſweating. Contrariewiſe, if you meane and deſire to driue out, and expell any corrupt or noyſome humor or vapor, then giue it diſſolued in ſome conuenient liquor, and ſleepe not after it: except your meaning be to procure ſweate, which of all euacuations is onely furthered by ſleeping: And thus much for the right vſe of this London Tryacle.
