And, this (most gratious princesse) is the effect of my poore trauaile, which beeing thus simply performed, true affection mooued me and the daylie experience of your Maiesties clemencie, resolued mee, this daye (though trembling) to make it a messenger of my loyaltie: although in value, lesse then the poore widowes mite, and therefore farre vnaunswerable, to your princely worthinesse: yet in true zeale not inferiour to a most precious present. It may please your Maiesty, graciously to accept it (so were I happy) but through the weakenesse of my abilitie, I can not but reuerently acknowledge, that, might it bee accepted, at your princely handes, with bening patience, it is not in respect of my deseruinges, but proceeding onelye, and altogeather, of your Maiesties wonted clemencye. The experience whereof, hath engrauen in the heartes of your truely affected subiectes, suche a perfect print of free presumption, of your gratious acceptaunce, euen of a cup of colde water, flowinge from the fountaine, of their loyall obedience: that I nothing dispayre of that, which your royall heart hath so generally afforded to many.
            Among whome, although I bee the most vnworthy, the causes mouing my willing minde, to wade hereinto (time and occasions considered) were not vnreasonable: tending (moste godly princesse) to the comfort of the little stocke of true Christians, that in these dangerous dayes, they yeeld not vnto the course, nor be dismayed

The churche of God is compared to a ship tossed vpon the sea. and kept back with the blusterous blasts of his buffets: It is rightly resembled vnto a ship, that is beaten, battered, and continually subiecte to the rough and boyling waues of the raging Sea. But herein is our comfort, that when the greatest tempestes and stormes doe arise, when wee seeme to be in most perill, and likely to be ouerwhelmed

with the belowes & fomy flashings of affliction, and when we think that our heauenly father is a sleepe and regardeth not our troubles our daungers, or present and imminent perills, he suddenly ariseth and rebuketh the windes, and chaungeth the stormes into calme weather, our despaire of helpe, into a manifest token of our certaine safetie. And as in respect of the trobles incident vnto the professors of the trueth, their estate is resembled vnto a ship tossed in the sea: Euen so let vs further consider, that as the ship that is greeuously tossed, and the mariners and passengers, that thereby are most perilously endaungered, haue then the greatest care, and take circumspectest heede, that they runne not against the rocks, nor be driuen into any gulph:Deliuery frō deepest danger procureth greatest ioye. and if they safely ariue vnto their expected harbour, their ioy is then the more great & gladesome, by howe much they were in desperate perill. Euen so the poore soules that are most cruelly handled, and the bark of their fraile fleshe most sharply tossed and driuen to and fro with the force of bitter persecution, for the testimony of the truth: their care and diligence to keep the euen and direct course, is thē most regarded & they carry then an eye vnto their course, least the wind of these troubles shoulde driue them vpon the rockes of error. And when they shall safely, namely truely & constantly ariue at their wished harbour, namely of the passage from this mortall life, vnto the immortal hauen, whether

it be by Martirdome or by any other kind of determination of their course, their ioyes shall bee so much the greater, by how much their afflictions and persecutions haue bene for the testimony of their godly professions with constancy & due pacience tollerated & accepted: for blessed are they that suffer persecution for righteousnes sake, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen.

And therefore although through persecution and crosses, wee be thought contemptible in this world, and through the slaunders & reproches of the wicked, we be thought and accompted abiects in the worlde, let vs perswade our selues that all the persecutions, afflictions, troubles, cares, calamities, scornings, scoffings, scurgings, and crosses which wee can beare in this life, are not worthy of the ioy of the life to come. Yet may we fully resolue our selues, that as a sparrowe lighteth not on the ground without the prouidence of God: no more doeth the least of these afflictions light vppon vs without our heauenly fathers will for our saluation. And therefore wee may not think it straunge, when this firy tryall of persecution commeth, but rather1. Pet. 4. 12.

Why doth Christ suffer his sheepe thus guiltlesse to be slaine: and his spouse (the church) to be so persecuted & afflicted? for that shepheard that hath speciall regard vnto his flocke, will not suffer thē to be so hunted and vexed by the tiranny of rauening wolues. Neither will that father that loueth his children see them abused, and ill dealt withall by any, but will with speed show himself a carefull father, and the shepheard a watchfull shepheard vnto his flocke. Euen so naturall reason would seeme to controll Christ, in that hee wincketh at the wicked when with open mouths they run vpon the godly as though they woulde swallow them, and deuoure them vp quick: but should rather presently take their cause in hand, and reuenge himself of such as defile his sanctuary.VVherein our comforte standeth in persecution.

For my names sake (saith hee.) And in that they thus afflicte them, they shal think they do god good seruice, namly in that they knowe neither God the Father, neither Christ: whereby we see, that none that trulie

know God, or seeke his glory, will moue as much as their hands, or tongues against any of his seruaunts: much lesse against his annointedThey that knovve not Christ persecute his members. against lawfully established kings, princes, and magistrates, which couet to maintaine the setting foorth of his truth, and exalting his name. Then to conclude: what may wee holde them that seeke the murthering of Christs annointed, namely our Queene and gouernesse, and suche like defenders of his true religion. May wee not say they be such as know not God, such as seeke nothing but how to crucifie Christ in his members? Nabuchadnezar, not knowing God, neitherDan. 3. 1. being acquainted with his trueth, did euen the like in persecuting the three children. So did those that cried out crucify Christ, crucify Christ and such as longed for the bloud of his Apostles: and finally all such as haue of late dayes martyred, or caused so many godly ones to bee burned, and otherwise done to death, for the testimony of their maister Christ: as in the tymeIgnorance of the trueth mother of persecution. of Queene Mary in England, now in France, & Spaine, and in other countreyes where the truth of Gods word, is turned into mens owne inuentions, Dioclesian, Maximinian, Maximius, Maxentius,

            What thing can there bee more lamentable, then the want of the knowledge of GOD and Christ? whereby men flye vnto all kinde of euill

deuises, without remorce of conscience, euen as blinde horses runne into the dyke of their owne destruction, contempning the trueth, and imbracing falsehood, making warre with christ and christians, putting their confidence in Pharoas strength and multitudes, the broken reede of Aegipt, whereby they endeuor to pul downe such as GOD hath exalted, and to exalt those whome Gods worde pulleth downe, to root vp that which God hath planted, and to plant that which the trueth of God rooteth vp: to condemne those whome God vouchsafeth to saue,The Papistes absurdities. and to saue those that the iudgement of God condemneth. This wee daily see commeth to passe through want of knowledge of the worde of God, which yet the most parte perceiue not, the multitude consider not, neither do they desire to knowe it. But the time will come, when their owne consciences, wherein they are nowe nothing touched, shalbe as a thousand witnesses against them, yea as a booke laide open before them, wherein they shall see, that they haue takenThe conscience as a booke laide open. foolish enterprises in hande for want of the wisdome of God: and shall then acknowledge that they whome they accounted heretickes, & whome they accounted vile and contemptible, whome they persecuted and put to death for acknowledging that which they accounted false & erroneous, were the true seruaunts of the high God: the sheepe of the heauenly shepheard: the church immaculate of the true God, and the obedient

But they wil say, no, they persecute not Christ, they seeke not to crucify him againe: but they seeke the bloud of such as agree not to their inuentions: they thinke that they themselues (knowing not God) doe not stretch forth their handes to the spoile of the saincts, and that their tiranny reacheth not vnto Christ. But alasse,

they are farre deceiued: Paule thought the likePauls persecution before his conuersion. before his conuersion, who persecuted with might and maine, the Christian congregations, when he (being voide of the true knowledge of God) with much cruelty thirsted after the bloud of many innocents, as he traueled towards Damascus,Act. 9. 4. with authority from the highpreist (as these men now pretend to haue from the highe Byshop) to persecute the christians, the mighty power of God strake him to the earthe, and the Lord spake vnto him saying, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou mee? he said not, why persecutest thou my Saincts? why seekest thou thus to vexe mortall men, but plainly said: why persecutestPauls conuersion. thou mee? which proueth, that although christ be in heauen, who is the head, his church which are his members here militant in earth, is moste deare vnto him, and hee that toucheth them, toucheth him, yea they are as tender vnto him, as the apple of his eye. Yea such a vnion is there betwene him and his children the saincts, namely the godly in earth, that he with a general term nameth them himselfe, and maketh no exceptionChrist and his church all one. betweene them and himselfe.

And by reason thereof is the verie sounde of the multitude, terrible, only for that they knowe not, nor consider the mightie workes of the Lord, whose hand bringeth mightie thinges to passe, they are ignorant of the truth, and therefore can not conceyue the goodnesse of the Lord: but desperately break out into this dangerous resolutiō: namely to take part with the multitude, be it with or against the truth. They consider not how that godRo. 2. 11. hath said, that he hath chosen the weake thinges of the earth, to confound the mightie, the foolish, such as in the world are accounted foolish, to confound the wise in their own conceits: the vile and base ones and such as are not regarded but despised in the world, he hath raised vp and appointed to bring those things to nought which in the iudgment of man are of great estimation and account: and the cause is that none should too much glorie in his owne strength, wisdome,

or power. No flesh should glorie in the presence of God.
            Is not this sufficient to mooue the heartes of all those that couet to be accounted Christians to stande in the truth, although they be therefore despised in the worlde, threatned of the worlde, and are as strangers, and outcastes to the world? rather then to accompanie the multitude and become glorious in the world and hated of god: strong in the worlde, and weake in the truth, familier with the world, & at discord with Christ: conuersant in the worlde, and straungers in the Church of God.

            This we see is the resolute opinion of the mostThe good & godly resolution of Sidrach, mesech & Abednago of them, that haue not the truth in their hearts. But it is a resolucion contrary to the resolucion of Sydrach, Mesech, and Abednago: for they sawe the multitude to doe that which they detested, and stoutly refused: and whereunto if they had framed their affections, and measured their opinions according to the course and general consent of the whole multitude, they had runne into wilfull rebellion againste the liuinge God, and committed horrible idolatry, in giuing worship vnto a false God, to a stocke, a block, to dirt, and drosse of the earth: they sawe the whole multitude to fall downe at the sounde of the trumpets, and gaue solemne worship vnto the image, yet coulde not that president preuayle with them, they sawe it no sufficient warraunt forTo follovv the multitude is no good excuse. them, no lawfull excuse before the liuing God whome they serued, and therfore absolutely resolued themselues, not to follow the multitude in an action so repugnant against the truth, and so great a derogation of the glorye of the high God. This was a good and a godly resolucion, wherein they constantlye perseuered, beeing apprehended as rebels againste the kinges decree, they were neither dismayed in respect of the multitude, nor tied vnto consent vnto the thing in respecte that the multitude helde it as a

necessary duty, and seruice done for the kinges pleasure: No although they sawe the Nobles, Princes, Dukes, Iudges, Receiuers, Counsailors, and all the officers and gouernours of all prouinces, yea all the nations vnder the kinges gouernment to fall down and worship it, they were nothing mooued to commit such abhomination before the Lord. The fierce and cruell countenaunce of the king himselfe, the threats of his tortors, torments, and of death it selfe could not discourage them or remooue their hearts from this sounde resolucion, this godly and salutarye resolucion, seeing the kinges deuise to bee so meerely repugnant against the truth. Thus must euery good Christian, euery one that will thinkeChristians ought to haue this resolution. himselfe the true member of Christ, resolue him selfe, namely constantly and boldye to refuse to bowe their knees, or doe any outward action to Baal of Rome, to the dishonor of the true God, to fulfill and satisfie the sawcie, malapert, & hautie minde of him that hath set himselfe againste God, crauing his honour to be done vnto him, and his power to be attributed vnto him: no, although we see many and mighty multitudes toVVeaknes of potentates in yeelding seruitude to Antichrist. bowe to him before our eyes, though we see Emperours, Kinges, and mightye potentates of the worlde to kisse his feete, and to afforde their neckes to bee his foote-stooles, and all the wise men of many nations to doe him reuerence: Let vs refuse it, for beholde it is meerely against the truth: and therfore the president of the mighty,

the president of the multitude, the president of generallities is nothing to vs that haue & ought to gouerne oure affections by the worde of God.

But suche is the subtiltie of their shamelesse deuises, that it is almost impossible to discribe their resolucion rightly. For mark where as Sydrach, Misech, and Abednago, were willed to fall downe and worship the image, they stoode not mute, or dumbe, or with this bare desence: namely pardon vs, we are resolued not to do it, as our recusants do. But they did boldly yeelde a reason of their recusancie, sayinge that it was contrary to their duty to the liuing God, whom they ought onely to serue. But these men will maintaine their idolatry euen with this onely aunswere: Forsooth we are resolued, wherin, and how?

But this seemeth not agreeable to my matter, beeing Euangelical, for that this application is poeticall: But surelie it is not without good morall: for the multitude in deede may be well compared to a beaste of manye heades vnstayed in respect of manye guides, vnconstaunt in respect ofThe multitude vvith their many heads resembled vn to Hydra the serpent. many mindes, vnruly in respect of manye members.

But a sillie woman perceiuing this their rashe resolucion, by the instincte of the holye Ghoste, the teacher of the truth, openly reprooued them, in that they shewed in themselues no sparke of patience, neither allowed that power and omnipotencie to God for their deliuerie, which he shewed to manye before them, but tying (as it were his will vnto their wils) indented with him the tyme and maner of their deliuerie.

wherein their pride so increased, and their hearts asspired against the God of heauen, who beholding the secreats thereof, and their weake and rebellious intent, in that they coulde not content them-selues to enioye the libertie and commodities of the earth, and their liues at hisGod throvveth downe aspiring mindes. handes, but would aspire to make themselues equall with him, and as it were his fellow neighbours euen in the cloudes, where they pretended to haue their habitations neare vnto his seate of Maiestie in heauen, as they imagined, quickly cut them short, and vsed a speedy confusion of their follye: namely confounded theirThe confusiō of

But as his wisedome is alwayes vnsearcheable, and his power infinite, and all to bring all thinges to passe without the ayde of man, he vsed this onely meane to stop their deuise, namely to confounde their language whereby their worke ceased, they were scattered, and their enterprise

came to none effect.
            By this moste worthye example we maye see how God abhorreth those aspiring heartes thatGod detesteth the deuises of those that couet to climbe into heauen by their ovvne deserts. couet to clymbe vp into heauen by the tower of their owne deuises.

            Poore Daniell was in a meruailous distresse, inDan. 6. 12. a desperate estate in the iudgment of man, when he for the seruice which he did to the true God, was (by a sinister decree made and signed by Darius, through a generall conspiracie of wicked men) caste into the Lions denne, whome the mighty hand of the God whome he serued sufficientlye protected, shutting the Lions mouthes so that they could not hurt him. But when thoseThe revvard of conspirators. were cast into the den that conspired his death,

they were rent in peeces ere they came to the ground of the den.

Whereat the whole multitude of the Babylonians raged not onely against Daniell, but also against the king himselfe, for that hee permitted Daniell to take this enterprise in hand: The king being timorous and more fearing the force of the multitude, then seeking the glory of the liuing God, deliuered poore Daniell into their handes, who threw him violentlye into the Lions den to be deuoured. But such was the omnipotent power of God ouer these greedy and rauenous beastes, which Daniels aduersaries of purpose kept hungry and without meat to make their stomaches so much the more greedy of the bloud of this seruant of the true GOD, who in suche sort stopped their mouthes that they hurt not Daniell at all.

For the truth whereupon the conuersation of euerye Christian is to bee grounded, is setled in the heart of none, by the power, the will, the wisedome, or inuentions of man, neither can it bee increased or bettered by the pollicie of anie, nor sufficientlye protected or mainteined by the authoritie of princes, but where first the spirit of GOD hath framed the foundation.

And the reason is, because their deuises and traditions are of the world. For saith Christ vnto his disciples, if you were of the worlde the worlde woulde loue you, but I haue chosen you out of the world, and therfore doth the world hate you. We see then that the way to become true christians, is not to ioyne with the multitude, to tread the steps of the greatest part of the world, for so shall we shake hands with the Elders and rulers, with the whole troupe of the Iewes, with Pilate, with Herode, and the Emperours power, to rise vp againste Christe and his truth (as now the greatest part of the world do) which God forbid, many are called but few areAll that hear the vvorde of God of not the seruants of god chosen.

The truth is not tyed to the multitude, nor to the outwarde shew of coloured christian conuersation, but hee that feareth the Lorde (which is in the heart) and worketh righteousnesse (which is also in the outwarde conuersation) is accepted with him. The multitude then make not any thing at all for vs or against vs, the

truth shall (no doubt) triumph & mightely preuaile, when we shall see Pharaoh of Rome, and all the huge host of his confederacie ouer throwne in the red sea of their owne inuentions.

               11 Oh sing praises, sing praises therefore vnto the Lord, that hath his dwelling on high, and yet so beholdeth all such as are true of heart, let vs declare vnto al people the worthy acts which he hath done for vs already, wherof great cause we haue to reioyce in him.
               12 He seeketh and findeth out such as are desirous to shed bloud, & thirste after the destruction of his annoynted, shewing himselfe moste mindfull of those that loue him, and forgetteth not to deliuer such as are in daunger, and winketh not at the wicked.
               13 Haue mercy (Lord) vpon me, oh thou that hast miraculouslye defended me from deathes doore. Consider how mine enimies yet cease not to imagine mischiefe against me, and to lay violent handes vppon my guiltles person, thou my strength and aid, consider it, and deliuer me.
               14 That I may with ioy sing foorth thy worthy praises and entring into Syon, maye reioysingly declare, that thou art he that sauest me, by

whom I stande, and by whome my enimies are throwne downe on euery side of me.
               15 A huge multitude of enimies haue risen vp against mee, but thou hast brought it so to passe that they are ouerwhelmed with the sloud they deuised to bring in vpō me, they are fallen into the pit they digged for mee, and they are strangled in the snare, they layd priuelie for me. This oh Lord is thy doing, and it is comfortable euen vnto my soule.
               16 Oh Lord thy wisedome is vnsearcheable, thy loue incomprehensible, and thy mercyes wonderfull, and thy iudgement knowne by executing iustice, vppon such as vse crafty wylenes against the innocent.
               17 Rise vp, rise vp (oh lord) in the behalf of thy seruant, let not thy hādmayd be alwaies forgotten, let not her hope, which she hath alwaies in thy defence, be frustrate, let not the wicked preuaile, in the craftie conspiracies which they imagined: Cast them down (oh Lord) and let the effect of their deuises shew their folly, & themselues to be but mortall men.
