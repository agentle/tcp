            ¶To the most excellent Prince, and our most redoubted souereigne Lord Edward the sixt, by the grace of God Kyng of England, Fraunce, and Ireland, Defendour of the faith, and of the Churches of England, and Irelande, in yearth the supreme heade, your moste faithfull and obedient subiect Thomas Vvilson wisheth long life with moste prosperouse Reigne.
            IF my power & habilite were answerable to my good wil, most excellent Prince and souereigne Lord, this token of mine hūble duetie which I now offer vnto your Maiestie, shoulde be as great & preciouse, as by reason of the cōtrarie, it is base and slender. wherefore I most humbly beseche your Maiestie in no

waxe euery one daie more pleasaunt then other. But in simple and plaine woordes to declare vnto your Maiestie, wherin my witt and earnest endeuour hath at this season trauailed: I haue assaie
                  •
                through my diligence to make Logique as familiar to Thenglishe man, as by diuerse mēnes industries the most parte of the other the liberall Sciences are. For considering the forwardenesse of this age, wherein the very multitude are prompte & ripe in al Sciences that haue by any mans diligence bene sett forth vnto them: weighyng also that the capacitie of my country men the Englishnaciō is so pregnaunt and quicke to achiue any kynde, or Arte
                  •
                of knowlege, whereunto wit maie attain, that

               treis haue heretofore for the furtheraunce of knowlege, not suffred any of the Sciences liberal to be hidden in the Greke, or Latine tongue, but haue with most earnest trauaile made euery of them familiar to their vulgare people: I thought that Logique among all other beyng an Arte as apte for the English wittes, & as profitable for there knowlege as any the other Sciences are, myght with as good grace be sette forth in Thenglishe, as the other Artes, heretofore haue bene. And therefore I haue so farre as my slēder practise hath enabled me, enterprised to ioyne an acquaintaunce betwiene Logique,

and my countrymē, from the whiche they haue bene hetherto barred, by tongues vnacquaynted. Notwithstandyng I must nedes cōfesse, that ye Printer hereof your Maiesties seruaunt prouoked me firste hereunto, vnto whome I haue euer founde my selfe greately beholdyng, not onely at my beyng in Cambrige, but also at all times els, when I moste neded helpe. But as touchyng the thyng self though I haue not done it with so good perfectiō as the worthinesse of the Arte requireth, or as some other better learned could do: yet I hope that wheras now it is dedicated vnto your highnesse, and so made commune to all: my good will shall want no fauorers in that I haue first labored

And yet herein I professe to be but as a spurre or a whet stone, to sharpe the pē

            The Arte of Logique.
            Logique is an art to reason probably on both partes, of all matters that be put furth, so farre as the nature of euery thing canne beare.
            
               The diuision of Logique.
               THis Arte is deuided into .ii. partes. The first parte stādeth in framing of thinges aptlye together, in knitting woordes, for the purpose accordingly, & in Latin is called Iudicium.
                  
                     Iudicium
                  
               
               The second parte consisteth in finding out matter, and searching stuffe agreable to the cause, and in Latine is called Inuentio.
                  
                     Inuentio.
                   For you must vnderstande, that when one goeth about to proue any thing, he must firste inuente somewhat to proue his cause, the which whē he hath done: he muste vse iudgement, bothe in framing the same reason so inuēted, & also to see, whether it serueth for the purpose or not.
               ¶And now some wil say, that I should first speake of the finding out of an argument,

before I should teache the waye how to frame an argument. Truthe it is that naturally we finde a reason or we beginne to fashiō thesame. And yet notwithstanding, it is more mete that the ordring of an argument shoulde be first handeled: forasmuche as it shal no more profit a man to find out hi
                     •
                   argument, except he first know how to order thesame and to shape it acording
                     •
                  y (which he doth not yet perfectli know) then stones or Timber shal profite the

                  ō or Carpenter, which knoweth not how to work vpō thesame. A reasō is easlier found then fashioned, for euery manne can geue a reason naturally and without arte, but how to fashion and frame thesam
                     •
                  , according to the art, none can do at all, except they be learned. Therfore, because euery mans wit can geue lightly a reason of diuers thinges without any learning at all, euen by the instinct of nature, & yet not be able to set thesame in order Scholerlike, either to proue or to confute: I purpose firste to shew the maner of

making an Argumente, as whyche is more nedefull: Nexte after that ye shall learne the maner of finding of an Argument. And the places where all Argumentes dooe reste, and laste of all ye shall know the captious or deceiptful Argumentes, as they be in Aristotle.

               ¶The difference betwene Logique and Sophistry.
               LOgique otherwise called Dialecte (for they are bothe one) is an Arte to try the corne from the chaffe, the truthe frō euery falshed, by defining the nature of any thing, by diuiding thesame, and also by knitting together true Argumentes and vntwining all knotty Subtiltees that are bothe false, and wrongfully framed together.
               ¶Sophistrie is euer occupied eyther in prouing the truthe alwayes to bee false, or els that whiche is false to be true, so that euermore
                     •
                   one parte of the argument is either false, by vsing some ambiguous worde, or by not wel appliyng it to the purpose, or els not framing it according to the Rules: so that a skilful artificer
                     •
                   mai y• soner put the vayne Sophister to silence by opening the fraude, & declaring the crafte of his inuencion. Wheras otherwise an argument made by the rulers of Logique cānot be auoyded, but must nedes be true, whosoeuer say nay. And so

muche more is Logique to be preferred before Sophistrie, as he is the more to be estemed that telleth a true tale, thē he whiche telleth a lie. And euen as a Grammarian is better liked, that speketh true and good Latine, then he is that speaketh false: Euen so Logique of it selfe is good, when Sophistrie on the otherside is nought. And wel may we saye, that Sophisters are like those whiche play with false dice, and would make other beleue that they are true, or els properly to tearme them, they be like those that go for honest men and are none.
            
            
               The difference betwene Logique and Rethorique.
               BOthe these Artes are much like sauing that Logique is occupied aboute all matters, and doeth playnly and nakedly setfurthe with apt wordes the summe of thinges by the way of Argumentacion. Againe of the other side Rethorique vseth gay paincted Sentences, and setteth furth those matters with fresh colours and goodly ornamentes, and that at large
               
                  Insomuche, that Zeno beyng asked the difference betwene Logique and Rethorique, made answere by Demonstration of his Hande, declaring that when his hande was closed, it resembled Logique, when it was opē & stretched out, it was like Rethorique.
            
            
               The Office of Logique.
               LOgique professeth to teach truly, orderly & plainly. And here wee may se how vniuersall this cōmoditie is, and howe largely it extendeth, not onely to know worldly affaires: but also to know God, and all his heauēly workes, so farre as nature may comprehend.
               There be .iiij. partes of this office or duty wherunto Logique is bounde. That is. To define the nature of euerye thing, to diuide, to knitte true argumentes, and vnknit false,
            
            
               Of Questions.
               THIS same maner of knitting wordes in a due order, beyng one of y• partes of Logique, or rather Logique it self, sheweth the maner of all Questions, called otherwise either

Propositions, or seueral wordes.
               A questiō is either a word or sentence put furth, as when I aske what such a thing is, & would know an other mans aduise therin, as thus, What is man? What is truthe? What is ambicion?
               Euery Question is either Single or double. A single questiō resteth in a single word, as thus. What is frendship? What is Philosophy? A doble questiō standeth not in one word, but in .ii. seueral sentences, as thus. Is the study of Philosophy praise worthy, or is it not?
               Lykewise a propositiō, which is a sentence vttered in plain wordes e
                     •
                  presly signifiyng either truth or falshed, is either single or doble. A single Proposition as thus: Wicked men cānot abide to reade the word of God. Of the whiche you may make a double proposition by addyng somwhat therunto as thus. Wicked men not onely can they not abide to reade the word of God, but also they seke by al meanes possible to ouer throwe the same.
            
            
               ¶Of the 
                     •
                  iue Predicables, otherwise called the fiue common wordes, which are spoken of other
               
                  WHen we go about to expound any matter, first we must beginne with the definition, to know the very nature of the thing, the whiche we cannot do, except we first learne the predicables, for thei shew the largenes and the narrownes of wordes, how farre they do extende, and how muche they comprehende in them. As when I se one afarre of come vnto me, first I know that he is a man, then when he commeth nigher, I know whether he be of mine acquaintance or no. Likewise, when I go aboute to declare what one is, & to open the nature of any thīg, I vse the largest words, & so it must nedes bee, that I begin with the Predicables, because they shewe how muche euery worde doth comprehende in it selfe, and how large or narrow it is. They be called Predicables because some one thing is spoken of an other. And they are (as a mā wold say) markes or notes of words yt are spoken of many, shewing how & by what manner the same words are atributed to other.

proposition (Iustice is a vertue) Iustice is the Species, and vertue is the general worde, which comprehendeth the sayde Iustice, and is spoken of the same
               Or thus, Species
                  
                     •
                   is a common word that is spoken of many whiche differ only in number, as manne is spoken of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and of euery proper name belonging to any man. As Socrates is a man. Plato is a man. Aristotle is a man.
               Euery Species or kinde in thinges is of .ij. sortes. The one is called the lowest kind, whiche is alwayes spoken of euery proper name, & euer is Species neyther can it at any tyme be Genus, although somtime it beare the name of genꝰ. The other is called Species ītermedia, that is the kind placed betwixt the higheste and the loweste, whiche at diuers times and by diuers considerations may both be Genus, and Species For that whiche is vnder the generall Woorde that same maye be called Species or Kinde, that whiche comprehendethe other, maye bee called

the general word.

I meane to be able or to be apt by Nature to speake, is proper to euery man.
               ¶Note further that Proprium is not alwayes taken after one sorte, but it is foure wayes considered.
               
                  First the propertie is that which agreeth to some kinde only, although not to euery persone comprehended vnder the same kind. As it is proper to a man only to be a Poete, or to be a Phisition, and yet not proper to euery man.
                  Secondly, the propertie is that whiche agreth to euery singuler persone, and yet not onely to Man. As to haue two fete agreeth to euery singuler persone, and yet not to man onely.
                  Thirdly, the propertie is that whiche agreeth to euery man, and to man only and yet not alwayes nor for euermore. As to haue hoare heares in the old age agreeth to man only, & yet not alwayes, but for the moste parte menne haue hoare heares in theyr olde age.
                  Fourthly, the propertie is that which in dede is most aptly and chiefly called Proprium, when any thing doeth agre to euery man, to man only and alwaies

to man. As to be able to Speake, to laughe, to go vpright, agreeth to euery man, to man only, and alwayes to man
               
               This diuersite many haue made betwixt the differēce & the properte, that the difference is one parte of Mannes substance, and is the parte that maketh vp man. As to haue the gift of reason doeth signifie the minde, whiche is one parte of man, for man himself is cōpact of body and minde.
               A Propertie doth signifie a certaine thing, Whiche is attributed to Man when he is made, and as a man woulde say, doth come after, when man is holy made, as to be able to speake, to laugh, to go vpright.
               
                  Accidens (that is to say, a thing cleauing, or chaunsing, or cōming to a substaūce) is that which doth not stande by himselfe, neither is the parte of a substance, but rather is after suche sorte in the substaunce, that it may bothe be away, and be there, sometimes more and sometime lesse, without destruction or losse of the Subiecte, or substaunce, as mirth, sorow, to runne, to sit, to be well

coloured, all these may be away, & yet the man maie be on lyue in whom they ware before. So that the lacke of them in their quantite, or greatnes, is not ye losse of the Substaunce. And al though no Substaunce at any tyme doth altogether forsake his Accidētes, Yet this we see, that one & the same Substan̄ce, doth some time alter his Accidētes, forsaking some, and takyng other. As water beyng sette on the fire, altereth the coldnes, & taketh heat, so that we maie iudge by this, that coldenes in the water is not a Substaūce, but an Accidēt.
               An Accident is two wayes considered, for either it may be separated, or it maie not
                     •
                   some maie be separated from their Subiecte as colde maie be taken from water, and knoweledge from the mind. Other are inseparable, because they cannot be taken awaie al together, as 
                     ••
                  ature or brodenes, cannot be taken from man. Heate cannot be taken from fire, nor moisture from water, the which notwithstādyng they are not separat frō their substaūce, yet the quantite or greatnes is changeable

in euery one of them, for some time it is more, and some time it is lesse. And wee se heate in other thynges to be separated from the Subiecte. Where vpō we iudge that the heate is an other thyng then the very Substan̄ce of fire. Therfore this is worthy to be knowen, that the Substaunce is one thyng, and the Accident an other thyng, and mete it is to make a difference betwixt them, as thus. The soule is one thyng, the feare of God is an other thing. Man may be without the feare of God (as many one is at this day the more pite) Therfore the feare of God is an Accident, the soule is a Substaunce.

white, long, and brode. So that no proposition can be, but the partes of the same are comprehēded with in these .v. cōmune wordes. Fourthlie, the general worde, the kynde, the difference, & proprete are ioyned together necessarily, so that when yow name one, al thother folowe. Therfore when a propositiō is made from the kynde, to the general, to his difference, or propertie: it is euermore an vndoubted true proposition, as this. Homo est animal ratione praeditū, loquendi facultatem habens. A man is a liuing creature endewed with reason, hauyng aptenesse by nature to speake. A man can not he except he be a liuyng creature, endewed with reason and hauing aptnes of nature to speake. The accident not withstandyng is not necessarely spokē of the subiect, but is there casually, & may be chaunged, as thus. Homo est albus. Somme man is white. This proposition may be aftreward false, for he may be blacke, or alter his complexiō some other way, so that the accidēt is often altered, & an other succedeth in his ronme. Therfore

it is good to be knowē, when you haue a Proposition, whether it be vndoubted true, for euermore, or els maye be false at any tyme.
            
            
               ¶Of the Predicamentes, called in Englishe Generall wordes.
               A Predicament is an ordre of single wordes, wherein thynges of one kinde, are couched aud comprehended vnder one woorde, whiche is most generall.
               A Predicamente is nothyng els in Englishe, but a shewyng or a rehersyng what wordes maye be truely ioyned together, or els a settyng furthe of the nature of euery thyng, & also shewyng what may be truely spoken and what not. and for this cause artes were inuented, because that the truth might be knowē, & euery thyng vttered with his propre wordes. For when I say, A man is a creature, I know this proposition hath his propre wordes, and that like as Man is a Substaunce, so is the creature, which is the generall worde vnto him, which bothe are in one Predicamente, and the ordre in this Proposition

is obserued accordyng to the Arte, for we muste alwaies begynne at the lowest and go vpwardes, which ordre agreth also to nature, when thynges lesse knowne, are declared by thinges that are more knowē, as shall more plainly hereafter appere.
               The Predicamentes are deuided in to the Substaunce, and the Accidente. The first, is both called the Substaūce and is a Substaunce in deede. The other are Accidentes, as not beyng of the Substaunce, but cleauyng therevnto.
               The commoditee of these Predicamentes is great. First, where as they be deuided into the Substaunce & Accident, it is a good lesson to know euermore the substaūce, frō the thing which is Accidentall. Again, of these moste generall woordes ariseth this profite
                     •
                   that if you wil define any thing, or shew the nature thereof, you maye know in which of al these store houses the worde resteth, whiche shoulde expresse the nature of another.
               Thirdly, yf one will bestow a litle

diligēce herin, searchyng where euery worde is setteled, & knowyng to which of al these most general wordes he may best referre it: he shal faithfully knowe the nature of all thynges, no man better, then the which, nothing is more necessary. and this difference is betwixte the .v. commune wordes otherwise called the Predicables, and these most generall wordes called Predicamentes, that the Predicables, set forth the largenesse of wordes, the Predicamentes do name the verey nature of thynges, declaryng (and that substātially) what they are in very deede.
            
            
               ¶A note of certaine thynges diligently to b

                   obserued before the rehersal of the most generall wordes.
               COnsideryng ambiguite bredeth error, moste warenesse ought to be vsed, that the doublenesse of no one worde deceaue the hearer. The cause of all controuersie, is either the not wel vnderstanding, or els the wily vsyng of wordes that in sēce haue double meanyng. Aristotel the Scolemaister to all scholers, geueth good warning

that all men be right ware in any wyse to haue the ryght vnderstanding of euery seueral worde.
               There be wordes that vnder one & the same title, comprehende the nature of many thynges, as these wordes folowyng.
               
                  as a Croune.
                  as a Beare.
                  as Tyme.
                  as Sage.
                  
                     a noble
                  
               
               A croune signifieth the croune of a mās head, & also signifieth a croun of gold, suche as is curraunt, or els suche as Kynges weare at the daye of their coronacion. A beare, signifieth a brute beast that is baited with dogges, & also signifieth the cophine where in a dead man is caried to his burial. Tyme noteth both the space of howre, daie and yeare, and yet we call an herbe by that name, whiche groweth in gardyns. Sage also betokeneth an herbe, & yet we cal wyse men, sage men: so yt euery one of these wordes haue a double meanyng, and ioyned onely together by felowship of name, by nature, and in very deede, do veri muche dissente. Therfore this ought euermore to be marked

                     SVbstātia, the Substance, or beyng which Cicero calleth Nature, is a thing whiche standeth by it selfe, and nedeth no helpe of an other, but hathe his propre beyng and substaunce naturally, or thus.
                  The substaunce is a thing whiche hath his propre being of hymsel
                        •
                     e, and conteineth accidentes whiche happen therunto, neither can any substance be sene, sauing only the accidentes, as the colour, the greatenes, and suche lyke qualities of man are sene, but the very substaunce cannot be sene.
               
            
            
               ¶The diuision of the Substance.
               THe substance is diuided into the first, and second. The first substance is called euery singuler persone or propre name as Socrates, Plato, Virgil, Homere.
               
               ¶The second substance cōprehendeth both the general worde, and the kinde also of euery singuler persone, as thus Tullie, Coesar, Hanibal with other. Likewise this word (a liuīg creature) being a substance and general worde to

euery propre name conteineth al thinges particulerlie that haue life.
               It is profitable to marke the order of substaunce, set furthe in a table a litle before, for we maie by the same, deuide seuerally euery substaunce, of all thynges in this worlde
                     •
                   the whiche when we knowe, and remembre in our myndes, we perceiue euidētly, the difference, betwene God, and his creatures, & seyng the thyng created of God and the properties there with all, we rest vpon the same, and learne the vse, and propre cōmoditie of many thinges here in yearth. We maie define many thynges, by the same table: as we maie define God, man, heauen, yearth, beast stone, & any thyng els yt is a substance.
            
            
               ¶Of quantitee.
               THe quantitie, is the greatnes of a thyng, or the nombre. And proper it is to this mooste generall woorde, to be deuided, as greatnesse, is deuided into seuerall partes, and nombres into euery seuerall nombre.
            
            
               ¶Quantitee is .ii. waies considered.
               
                  The one is called Continua quantitas, that is, when the question is asked, how greate, or brode any thyng is
                     •
                   and therefore the length, the latitude, and the depenesse of bodies artificiall, are herein obserued: the vse whereof, is moste sene in Geometrie.
               The other is called discreta quantitas, when the question is asked, how many thinges there be, and is occupied altogether in nōbryng. The vse of this is perceiued in Arithmetique.
            
            
               ¶Of qualit
                     •
                  e.
               THe qualite, is a forme, or shape of the body, or mynde, wherof some name is deriued, as of wisedom, men are called wise, of Iustice, men are called Iust.
               There be three maner of qualitees, whereof the first doth contein the habite, otherwise called, the perfecte hauyng of any thyng. The other is, a forwardnes in any thing, gottē by labour and trauaile, not geuen by natures goodnesse, or els wee maie call it, the halfe attainyng of that, whiche we go aboute to haue, wantyng perfeccion,

for lacke of full tyme, and is called in Latine dispositio, as to haue meane knowlege, & not to be fully instructed in ye practise of iustice, is dispositio. Again to be fully learned, to haue accō
                  plished all thynges, due to righteousnesse and Iustice, is called in Latine, habitus, as who should saie, the absolute atteinyng, and strong hold of thesame. The pith of this worde habitus, can hardely be vttered with one worde in this our tongue. Notwithstandyng it maie in mo wordes be opened, for the better vnderstandyng of it. For euen as wax chaufed with the hande, is made softer, euen so some partes of mā are made by vs more apte to compasse any thing. He that vseth oft to speake Frenche, shall by continuance, obtein perfecciō: he that vseth much to write, at length shall haue a redy hande, and this is called habitus. So that no mā hath knowlege, or perfecte skill in any thyng, except he get it by labour, & acquaint nature with trauail. Notwithstandyng, I muste nedes confesse, that all natures be not like apte, to receiue

knowlege. Some are geuē to one thing and some to another. Therefore

                  ilip nature forward. God geueth some one manne a passyng gift, to serche the influence of the starres, to another he graunteth, a natural enclinacion to Musike, and al heauenly harmonies. So that if either of these two, would seke to folowe their natural aptnesse, it wer moste like thei should e

                  cell. Other that do not finde nature so fauorable, can neuer come to any suche perfeccion.
               The full atteinyng of any thyng, by long tyme, is twoo waies considered, for either it is of the body, or els of the mynde. Perfectiō, gottē b
                     •
                   helpe of the body, is when men can by muche vse, leape, wrastle, or cast the barre, better then any other, or els do excell in any handie craft, aboue the common sorte.
               The habite of the mynde, that is to

saie, that constaunt hold of any thyng, whiche is in the mynde, either consisteth in knowlege, or els in practise. In knowlege, are comprehended all artes as Grāmer, Logique, Astronomie &c. and all other learnyng, wherunto wit canne atteine. That habite of the mynde, whiche is in practise, and by good aduisement is chosen, standeth in the will of man. As all vertue, and all vice do. Iuste dealyng euermore, manhode in sufferyng all harmes stoutly for honesties sake, and temperaunce of life, in forbearyng lust, and 
                     •
                  ilthie glotonie. These vertues though their ofspryng be from God, yet tyme maketh them perfect, in the iyes of man. Other vertues are geuen of God wholy, and altogether without mannes labor to attain thē. As faithe, hope, charitee, & all other like giftes of the holy ghoste.
               The secōd forme, is called ye power strēgth, or pronesse of nature, in latine Naturalis uis. And the contrary herevnto, is called the weakenesse of nature, when she hath denied her power, to any one thyng, in Latine it is called

                  Imbecillitas naturae.
               
               The natural strength, is an aptnes of nature, geuen either to the body, or to the mynd. To the mynd, as the aptnes to learne, the prōptnes of memory

                   of the body (in mā) to be apt by nature to wrastle, for a horse, to be quicke and stirryng, for a birde, to be apte to flie, for fishe, to liue in the water, (the whiche man cannot dooe) for an Asse to be slowe, for a stone to be hard. &c. Naturall weakenes, is whē nature diminisheth her gift, as when she denieth aptnes to learnyng, as we see many dull wittes for lernyng, & muche vnfit that waie. Nature hath denied some men, health of body, that thei are neuer wel at ease, some men are so sicke in their braine, that thei are neuer wise, some are capons by kynd, and some so blunt by nature, that no arte can whet them An Asse will neuer bee swifte, a stone will neuer be soft of nature. All qualities be instrumentes of nature, where by the worketh, as heate, is the instrument of fire. The heate and cold, in the iuyce of herbes are instrumētes, wherby

menne either are healed, or els past healyng, for this worlde.

                  e a wife.
               Therefore we maie se, that Relatiues are referred euermore to another, neither can thei bee taken absolutely, without hauyng respect, to some other worde. There is no worde, but we maie considre thesame to bee a Relatiue, if we referre it to some other thyng, and

therefore wee maie go throughout all the predicamētes, with this one place, and finde relacion in euery one of thē.
               Those that are referred to some thyng, are of two sortes. First thei are properly so called, as the father, and the sonne, the master, and his seruaūt, neither can thei be considered, excepte thei bee compared with some other, for when one is called father, he is properly so called, because he hath a sonne, and thereof hath he his proper beyng.
               Again relatiues, vnproperly so called, are those seuerall woordes, whiche are knowen, & haue their beyng, euen when thei stande alone: and yet considered with other, thei haue diuerse respectes. as loue, is the loue of the thyng loued. Or thus, loue beholdeth the thyng loued. Faithe beholdeth that thyng, whervnto it leaueth. And therfore where as Paule saieth, we beyng iustified by faithe, haue peace before God, it is asmuche to saie, that we are not receiued for the worthinesse of the qualitee, but for his sake, that is the sonne of God. For I praie you, whervnto

leaueth faithe, or what thyng doeth it els behold? Sauyng onely our Lorde Iesus, that died freely once for al. Or els thus, Relatiues are so called, (and yet vnproprely) whiche are not accordyng to their propre beeyng, but accordyng as thei are so named, whereof the .vj. predicamentes that folowe, beare the name. As he that doth any thyng, is referred to a thyng doen, whe
                     •
                  ein the twoo places that folowe are declared, whiche signifie, to do, and to suffer. By the place (vbi) where, one neighbor is cōpared with his ne

                  t neighbor. By the place quando, whē, A childe of .vj. yere olde, is compared with a child of thesame yeres. He that lieth vpright, is cōpared with him that
                     •
                   lieth doune grouelyng. In all these the proper beeyng, is not declared, for a childe maie bee sixe yeres of age, although he be not compared with another, and therefore it is called relatio secundum dici improprie. But a man can neuer be a father, sauyng o
                     •
                  ely in consideraciō of his sonne And yet note this one thyng, it is proper to all Relatiues,

alwaies to be true, euen by cō
                  uercion. And thus whosoeuer is a father, thesame hath a sonne, whosoeuer is a sonne, thesame hath a father. Who soeuer hath faithe, that same man leaneth to Christ onely. Whosoeuer leaneth to Christ onely, that same manne hath faithe. Here are twoo thynges to be marked in relacion. The ground of euery thyng, and the ende wherevnto it hath respecte, or consideracion. As a father is the grounde, in that he doeth begette, and hath respect to his sonne, in that he is begotten. The sonne is the ground, in that he is begotten, & hath respect to his father, whiche did beget hym. And thus likewise in all other.

                  horte distinction geueth a lighte to many waightie matters, the which thyng whan men know not, they wander in greate darkenesse, and for lacke of light, faull in to error.
            
            
               What a diuision is.
               A Diuision is a diuidynge of that whiche is more commune, into those whiche are lesse common. As a definition therfore dothe declare what a thyng is, so the diuision sheweth howe many thynges are contayned in the same.
               
                  A diuision, is either the deuidyng of a worde, or of a thyng. A diuision firste of a word, is whē any worde that signifiyng diuerse thynges, is deuided into euery seueral significatiō that he hath, as if I would deuide this word, Canis, into a dog, a fish of the sea, and a starre in the Elemente, thus might I say, Canis is either a dog that liueth vpō the yearth, or els a starre in the elemente.
               A diuision of the thyng is .iij. wayes considered, for either it is whan the generall is deuided into his kynde, the whole into his partes, or els whan the substaunce is deuided into his accidentes. The generall is deuided into his kynde thus, as an Element is deuided into the fier, the aier, the water, and the yearth. A common weale is deuided into the state of people whiche beare rule, & also into that powre where the beste, and wisest haue the gouernaunce, and thirdly into ones hande whiche alone beareth the stroke and is chief magistrate. Of liuyng creatures some are endued with reason, some are with out reason.
               
                  The whole is diuided into his partes as thus. The body is diuided into the head, bealie, hādes, & feete. A man is deuided into bodie, and soule, & this kynde of deuidyng is proprelie called Partitio. And the very difference betwixt diuisio, and partitio is, that in a deuision where the general, and the kynde are, the generall worde is spoken of the kynde it self, as. Iustitia est virtus. Iustice is a vertue, where as it cannot be so, when the whole is deuided into his partes, that the whole should be spoken of his part, as I can not saye, Caput est homo. the head is man. For the head is not man, nor yet the bealy, al though they both be partes of man. We haue euermore nede of this Partition in all matters. The law of Moses is deuided into .iij. partes, for either it is Morall, Iudiciall, or Ceremonial, neither is this Partition necessarie for Moses common weale only, but for all other regimentes that be. The morall law standeth for euer, and is not altered at any time but is receyued from tyme, to tyme, euen

as Moses receyued the same of God in stony tables. The Iudiciall law is next, the which although we be not boūd to obserue as the Israelites ware, yet must ther be actes of Parliamente made for the reformacion of thinges that be amisse, and Magistrates apointed to punysh such as breake the ten commaundementes, called the morall lawe, and euen so maie we iudge of the Ceremoniall Lawe. that although it appertaine nothing to vs to kepe suche Ceremonies as Moses, and Aaron haue enacted, yet it is nedefull that there be an ordre in al our doings and that we resort together to the temple reuerently, and that the Parentes appoint their childrē a tyme to learne at schole, and for their seruauntes a tyme to do their true seruice.
               The substaunce is deuided into his accidētes, as thus, of men, som are fre, some are bo
                     •
                  de.
               ¶An other maner of deuiding there is contrary to this, as when the accidentes are deuided into there substaunces, as thus. Of good thinges some are of the mind, some of ye
                  
bodie, and some of fortune. Also there is a deuision when accidentes are deuided into accidentes, as of good thinges, some are honeste, some profitable, and some plesaunt.
            
            
               ¶Rules necessarie to be obserued in euerie diuision.
               FIrst it must be prouided that the diuision as muche as maie be (for it cannot alwaies be so) ought to be made with twoo contrary differences, fully containyng in them self the whole cumpasse or widenes of the generall worde, or that which is deuided, for it is a fault to forget any thyng, or let slip any part.
               Againe the differences whiche deuide the generall worde, beyng ioined both together, must be egall to the said generall worde, and the partes coupeled together, must be asmuche as the hoole, or els the diuision is not good. A liuyng creature is deuided into his twoo differences, as into a thyng hauyng reason, and a thyng that hath no reason. Nowe what so euer is a liuyng creature, the same is a thyng that either

hath reason or els that lacketh reason. And agayne euerie thyng that is endewed with reason, and without reason, that same is a liuing creature. So that in euerie diuisiō, the membres, or partes that dooe deuide, by conuersion are turned with ye thyng deuided, euen likewise it is with partitiō, as I haue spoken before of deuisiō. Where as logike hath two partes, Iudgement and findyng o
                     •
                  t of thynges, euen as I saie logique is nothing els but iudgement, and findyng out of thynges, so of the other side, iudgement, and findyng out of thinges, is nothyng els, but logique it self. Wherby appereth a plain
                     •
                   conuersion, that what so euer the one is, the same is the other, whiche thyng must diligentlie be obserued in euerie diuision. Fo

                   if the membres that do deuide, be either more or lesse than the thyng deuided: streight waie the diuision is not good, for accordyng to a Precept that we haue in latine. Memb
                        •
                     a diuidentia semper cum diuiso conuerti debent. The partes that do deuide must alway be equall with the thyng

deuided, and turned by cōuersion with the same, or els the diuision is not lawfull.
            
            
               ¶The maner of handeling a single Question, 
                     •
                  nd the readie waie howe to teache and sette forth any thyng plainlie, and in order, as it should be, in latine Methodus.
               IN handeling of any single question, the preceptes and rules geuen before in the commune wordes, in the moste generall wordes, in the definition, and diuision, doe very good seruice, and helpe towardes the orderyng of euery suche mater. The whole nature of suche questions are thoroughlie sene by vsyng of this order. Euery single question is eight waies examined, first to aske whether the thing be, or no. As thus. Is there any one man that maye be called wise? Is there any lawe? Is there any frendship vpon yearth? This question is often proued, either by experience, or els by authoritee of the wise. Therfore in questionyng what the thyng is, we muste declare the very nature
                     •
                   as if I shall speake of frendshippe, I will

first be at a pointe of what frendshyp I must speake. For frendship is of two sortes. The one is true & perfect frendshippe, whiche commeth from the hart for vertues sake, and is onely among good men: the other is fay
                     •
                  ed fauour, when one for lucre beareth a fayre face outwardely, and fedeth inwardly a maliciouse stomake. And this is the commune frendshippe, wherof the wicked onely are partakers. The seconde question is, to aske what a thyng is. And this cometh from the definition, whiche is of two sortes. either of the substaunce of any thyng, or els of the name. Of the name as thus, a realme is that countrey whiche is ruled by a kyng. Of the substance thus. A realme is a gatheryng of people together, beyng able to liue, and withstande other for preseruatiō of thēselues, abiding seuerall. The law is an ordina
                     ••
                  ce which commaundeth thynges in ordre, to be done, and forbiddeth the cōtrary. The third question is, when the partes, and euery seuerall kynde is considered, & for this question the deuision and partition

dooe much good. As the lawe of the Gospell and the politicall lawe. The fourthe question is to aske what are the causes, and especially what is the efficient cause, and what is the finall cause, or the ende of any thyng. The efficient cause of all good lawes, is God, and his minister. The finall cause, or the end, is to liue vprightlie in the feare of God, and to walke all the daies of our life in the obseruacion of his holy will. The fifte question is, when the effecte, the office, or propre workyng is examined. As the effecte of the lawe is, to conserue the state of mā to continue peace vniuersally, to encreace wealth, and make loue betwixt all. The syxt question is when thinges be asked that happē after, or the which haue great affinite, or likelyhode together. As if lawes be kept and folowed, we se our childrens children waxe to welth. We se muche neyghbourhode and good will to helpe the needie, & so forth. The seuenth is to aske what are disagreyng. As from the lawe, dissenteth rebellion, stubbournesse, pryde,

with other. The eight question is to bryng in witnesse, & to showe by whose authoritee the lawe taketh place. The scripture teacheth that God gaue the lawe to Moses, and Poule with Peter also, and Christ himself commaunded euery man to obeye the higher power in all thynges, that are not directely repugnaunt from the wil of God. Thus

vertue by it selfe. And this order both Tullie hath folowed in his boke de officijs, and also Aristotle in hys Ethikes hath done the like, to ye great admiration of al those that be learned.
            
            
               ¶Of a proposition.
               EUen the very ordre of nature requireth that first of all we should speake of seuerall wordes, and as a man woulde saie, teache one his lettres, and teache hym the maner of spelling, before we teache him to rede, and afterward ioyne sentences together, & frame propositions by knittyng seuerall woordes in ordre, for it is the very office of the mind first to knowe, and then to knitte
                     •
                   neyther can any chylde vtter a sentence, before he learne to speake a worde. Againe, when nature hath taught seueral wordes, then the minde ioyneth to guether, deuideth, and afterwarde geueth a Iudgement whether they be well or no. For a man ware litle better then a brute beaste, if he could but onelie apprehende seueral wordes, hauing no gifte, or aptnes to ioyne them in order,

and to iudge howe thynges are ioyned together. But seyng God hath kindeled th
                     •
                  s light in man, that he can both ioyne, and iudge, we will nowe speake of the knittyng together, & the ioynyng of wordes in a proposition.
            
            
               ¶What a Proposition is.
               A Proposition is a perfite sentence spoken by the Indicatiue mode, signifiyng either a trewe thyng, or a false, without al ambiguitie, or doubtfulnes. As thus, euery man is a liar.
               There be two partes in a proposition, the one is called Subiectum (that is to saye that where of sumwhat is spoken,) the other is attributum, commōly called predicatum, that is to sai, that whiche is spoken of any thyng, as in the aboue rehersed propositiō. Euery man is a liar, Man, is that whereof this saiyng (to be a liar) is spoken, and this same saiyng (to be a liar) is that whiche is spoken of man.
               Euerie proposition is two waies deuided, either it is a single sentence, standing of one perfect sentence, as Iustice

is a vertue, or els it is a double sentēce hauyng two propositiōs in it, as thus. If iustice be a vertue, it is a good thing prayse worthie.
               That propositiō is called false, the which either naturall reason proueth to be plaine false, or the experience of man declareth to be vntrue, as thus. The stone doth feale. the soule of man is mortall. Experience showeth the soule to be immortall, and nature teacheth vs that no stone hath the sence of fealyng.
            
            
               The second diuision of a Proposition.
               AGaine Propositions do either affirme, or denie, as this propositiō. Pleasure is a good thing, dothe affirme that pleasure is good. Againe, pleasure is not a good thyng, doth denie yt pleasure is good. That Propositiō doth affirme, whē any thing is reported to be in any thing That Proposition doth denie, when any thyng is denied to be in any thing.
            
            
               ¶The third deuision of a Proposition.
               
                  THirdly al Propositions ar either, generall, particular, indiffinite, or singular
                     •
                   Those Propositions ar called general, or vniuersal, the which haue a general signe ioyned to the first parte of the Propositiō, as thus. Euery couetous mā is poore. No mā both loueth, and is wise. No man is euermore happie. General signes are these
                     •
                   
                  Omnis, Nullus, Quilibet, Nemo. Euery bodie, nobodie, all the world, not one in all the world.
               Particular propositions are these, where a particular signe is added to the former parte of the Proposition, which doth not conteine al but a part or a fewe, as thus. Some men feare God. Some men are to muche desierous of glory. The particular signes be these. Quidam, Aliquis, Plerique, Plerun
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                     . A certain man, some bodie, all men for the most part, oftentymes.
               The Propositions are called Indefinite (that is to say, vncertain) where the former part of the Proposition is a generall woorde without a signe, as

thus. The soule is immortall. Manhode is a vertue. One man is better then an other. Old men are couetous. And note this diligētly, that those Indefinite Propositions (whose laste rehersed parte is necessary, and is so spoken of the former part, that it doth alwaie agree to the same, and to the whole nature of the same) do implie as muche as a generall propositino, as in the aboue rehersed Proposition. The soule is immortal. this word (to be immortall) whiche is spoken of the soule, agre
                     •
                  h not to one man, or to certaine, but to euery man liuyng. when the Accidentes are spokē of the former part, it implieth as muche as a particular Proposition doth. as
                     •
                   
                  Homo homini prestat ingenio, virtute, doctrina. (Some man is better then an other in witte, learnyng, and vertue,) is no more to say, than Quidam homo homini prestat. Some one mā is better then an other.
               A singular Proposition, is when a propre name of a man is conteined in a Proposition, and is the former part

of the same, as. Cicero est Orator. Cicero is an Oratour. Alexander est bellicosus. Alexander is a warriour.

               There be .iiij. in nombre, called in Latine. Contrariae, Subcontrariae, Cō
                     tradictoriae, and Subalternae.
               
               Generall cōtrarie Proposiciōs, are those, whereof the one doth affirme, & the other doth denye, as thus. Omnes homines gloria ducuntur, All men are moued with glory. Nulli homines gloria ducuntur, No men are moued with glory.
               Particular contrarie, are twoo Particulars, whereof the one doth affirme, the other doth deny. Aliqui homines gloria ducuntur, Some men are moued with glory. Aliqui homines gloria non ducuntur, Some men are not moued with glory.
               
                  Contradictory Proposiciōs are, whē the one is Uniuersal affirmatiue, and the other Particular negatiue. or els when the one is Uniuersal negatiue, and the other Particular affirmatiue, as thus. Omnes homines gloria ducuntur
                        •
                     
                   All men are moued with glory. Aliqui homines gloria non ducū
                     tur. Some men are not moued with glory, and likewyse backeward.
               
                  Subalternae are those, whiche be either Uniuersall affirmatiue, & Particular affirmatiue, or els vniuersall negatiue, and particular negatiue.

                  PRopositio Categorica (other wise called a single Proposition) is deuided into, true and false Propositions.
               They are true Propositiōs, whiche agre to the matter, and are either necessarie, or els such as maie be either true, or false, called in Latine fortuitae or contingentes.
               
               Necessarie Propositions, are assuredly true, and knowen so to be either

Pecunia est bonum, Mony, is a good thyng. & whersoeuer the Accident is spoken of that which conteineth hym: euery suche Proposition is called chaunceable or that which may be true, as: Water is made whot; here we see that it chaunceth to water (cō

                  HEre we must be diligent that in all such repugnauncie of Propositiōs, there be no doubtfulnes in any worde, and that alwaies there be one maner of woordes that go before, and also one maner of wordes that ende the sentence, plainly and without double vnderstandyng. This diuersite of Propositions is very necessary to discerne, the truth, frō that which is false, for when we ioyne two Propositions that are dissonant, we shal easely trie the chaffe from the corne, the which when we haue done, we maie the better, sticke to the truth with full assente, the contrary beyng ones disclosed and reiected.
            
            
               ¶De Conuersione, of the turnyng of Propositions.
               COnuersion, is the chaungyng or alteryng of wordes in a Proposicion, when ye former part (wherof any thyng is rehersed) and the hynder parte (which is rehersed of the former) are chaunged, the one, into the others place.
               There be .iij. maner of Conuersiōs,

                  Simplex, per Accidens, per Contrapositionem.
               
               A plaine Conuersion is, when both the Proposition
                     •
                   are like in all thy
                     •
                  
                  ges, both in signes, and also in affirmacion, or negation, sauing onely that of the last rehersed, is made the former part of the sentence, & the former part, is made the last rehersed part.
               Suche Conuersion is made, when both Propositions be either Uniuersall negatiues, or els particular affirmatiues, for the first thus. Nemo timens Deum, cōtaminat se adulterio. Ergo, Nemo contaminans se adulterio timet Deum. No man that feareth God, de
                     •
                  ileth him self with adultrie
                     •
                   therfore, no man that defileth him self with adultrie, feareth God. Here we maie see the Conuersion plaine, as the rule aboue rehersed teacheth. For ij. particular affirmatiues, this shalbe an example. Quidā aulici, boni sunt. Ergo quidā boni, aulici sunt. Some courtiers are honest, Ergo some honest men are courtiers.
               A Conuersion by Accidēt, is when

the former parte of ye sentence, is made the last rehersed parte, and the last rehersed parte, made ye former part, both the Propositions affirmyng, or deniyng, sauyng onely that the signes bee chaunged, that is the one beyng Uniuersall, the second beyng Particular. First a Conuersion is made of .ij. affirmatiues, thus. Omnis virtus est laudāda, Ergo laudandū aliquid, est virtus. All vertue is to be praised, therefore some thing to be praised is a vertue. A conuersiō of .ij. negatiues, thus. Nemo malus foelix, foelix igitur (sapiens cum sit) non est malus. No euill man is absolutely happy. Therfore an absolute happie man (consyderyng he is wise) cannot be euill. This kynde of Conuersion is very profitable for him that wil dispute. for where as we reason often frō the general worde, to the kynde, we must nedes vse this maner of Conuersion, as thus. If al exercise be good, then this exercise is good, and so of other.
               A Conuersion by contraposition, is when the former part of the sentēce

is turned into the last rehersed parte, and the last rehersed part, turned into the former parte of the sentence, both the propositions being vniuersall, and affirmatiue, sauyng that in the second Proposition there be certaine negatiues enterlaced, as thus.
               
                  
                     Omnis homo auet aliquid videre, audire, scire.
                  
                  
                     Ergo quod non auet aliquid videre, audire, scire, non est homo.
                  
               
               Euery mā desireth to se, to heare, or to know somwhat, therfore what soeuer he is that desiereth not to see, to heare, or to know somwhat, that same bodie is not a man. This Conuersion is profitable, and serueth well to reason by. thus reasoneth Christ by this Conuersion against the Iewes in the viij. Chapter of Iohn
                     •
                   
                  Qui ex Deo est, verba Dei audit, vos igitur cum non audiatis, ex Deo non estis. He that is of God, heareth the woordes of God, You therefore because you heare not, be not of God. This Conuersion co
                     •
                  
                  futeth the Iewes plainly, & proueth that they are not of God. Yf, we will

reason from the general worde to the kynd, or from the greater, to the lesse, we may vse this Conuersiō very wel. Omnis homo est animal, Ergo quodcnn
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      nō est animal, id nec homo est. Euery man is a liuing creature, therefore what soeuer thyng is not a liuyng creature, that same is not a mā. Take away the general worde, and there cā no kynde remaine at all. From the superior vniuersall, to the inferior, thus we maie reason. All pure golde loketh yealowe, therefore what soeuer loketh not yealowe, yt same is not pure golde. This Conuersiō serueth wel to make an Argument in the second figure, as I will declare hereafter, the whiche ought diligently to be obserued.
            
            
               
                  Propositio Hypothetica, that is to say a double Proposition.
               
                  PRopositio Hypothetica, is a sentence with two single Propositiōs knit together alwaies, with some Coniunction, as thus. Si iustitia est virtus, est laudabilis. If iustice be a vertue, it is praise worthie.
            
            
               ¶There be .iii. maner of double Propositions.
               
                  A Double Proposition standet
                     •
                   of .iij. partes, wherof the one is a conditionall Proposition, affirming a thing to be either true or false, with an (if.) As thus. Yf faith be vpon the yearth, some men feare God. Yf the worlde continue stil as it doth, walowyng in most abhominable synne, God wil at length punishe the offenders very sore. All which Propopositions are euer true, whē the partes are so knit together: that the latter parte, must nedes folowe vpō that, which goeth before. The second part is, when a Proposition hath a disiunctiue, which knitteth the sentence vp, as thus. Either it is daie, or els it is night. Suche Propositions are true, when bothe the partes are true, & the same also are false, when either of the partes are false. The thirde parte is, when coniunctions that do denie are ioyned toguether, as thus. Battail beyng not laufull, is not to be desiered.
               By all which double Propositions wee maie reason formally in diuerse causes, is thus by the first. If faith be

vpon the yearth, some men feare God, but no mā feareth God, therfore faith is not vpō the yerth. Again, if we feare God, we are in charite, but we are not in charitie. Therefore we feare no
                     •
                   God. By the seconde thus. Either it is daie, or els it is night, but it is daie, Therfore it is not night. Couetouse men either be the seruauntes of God, or els of the Deuill, but they are not the seruantes of God: Ergo, they are the seruauntes of the Deuill. By the third thus. Battail beyng not lauful, is not to be vsed, but battail is lauful Therfore it is to be vsed.
            
            
               Of makyng an Argument.
               I Haue rehersed hetherto al single wordes, what the nature is of euery one, & in what general worde they may be founde. I haue set forthe the nature of a definition, and a diuision. I haue taught also to ioyne these seuerall wordes into a proposition, and to make the same a perfect sentence. Nowe therfore by goddes grace, I wyll shewe the maner how to ioyne sentences together, and

to proue a matter by knittyng proposicions handesomely in an argument, or els to cōfute any thing that a man list, by placing the proposiciōs accordingly. Therefore there ought good diligence to be vsed in this behalf, for as muche as it is the clerkliest part of al, and the hardest piece of worke, to frame an argument aptly, & to know the very reason, why thynges are so knit together.
            
            
               ¶What an argument is.
               An argumēt, is a waie to proue how one thyng is gathered by another, and to shewe that thyng, whiche is doubtfull, by that whiche is not doubtful.
            
            
               ¶To finde out the reason, that shall proue, (in Latine) called medium, (in Englishe) the double repete.
               After this sort we maie finde the reason, whereby to proue our matter. When we haue a question or sentence, that we would either confirme, or confute, Aske the cause of our selfe, why, and wherefore that thyng, whiche is spoken of the former parte in any sentence, should be so applied to thesame. And to make the matter more plain, I

will make this question. Est ne auarus pauper? Is a couetous man poore or not? I maie thus reason with my self. why shoulde a couetous man be called poore, what affinitie is betwixt theim twoo? marie in this poynct, thei bothe agree, that like as the poore man, euer lacketh and desireth to haue: so the couetous manne euer lacketh, wantyng the vse of that whiche he hath, and desirereth stil to haue, beyng neuer cōtēt though god geue enough. Then seyng it is euen so, that bothe doe lacke, and bothe do desire to haue: this same reason is the onely cause, whereby myne argument is made perfect. For thus I maie frame myne argument aptly.
               
                  Whosoeuer lacketh, & desireth euermore to haue, that same man is poore.
                  A couetous man lacketh, & desireth euermore to haue.
                  Therfore a couetous man is poore.
               
               Thus this argumēt is made perfect by askyng this questiō, wherfore a couetous man is poore? As hereafter I

wil shewe it more at large, by other exāples, 
                     •
                  o make the thyng more plain.

                  SYllogismus, is an argument wherby the last sentēce, whiche we would proue, is confirmed by other proposiciōs, and sentences, more vniuersall, and better knowen, then the thyng whiche is proued: conteinyng in themselfes the reason, why the laste sentence is true, and why thei are applied to the same. This kynd of argument, is from the general worde, to the kynde, as thus. If I wil proue theft worthie of punishement, I must first aske the questiō, why? & that thyng that commeth to my mynd, more vniuersall then theft, cōprehēdyng the offēce of theft in it, maie serue to make the argument. As I maie thus reason, that theft should be punished, because it is a vice, or a mischeuous deede, and

then thus I knit vp myne argument.
               
                  Euery vice or mischeuous diede is to be punished.
                  Theft is a vice, or a mischeuous diede.
                  Therefore thefte is to be punished.
               
               Here we se thre proposicions, or sentences, whereof the first is called Maior, that is to saie, the proposicion at large. the seconde is called Minor, that is to saie, the seuerall proposicion. the thirde is called conclusio. that is, the lappyng vp of all. And here we muste note, that like as there be thre Propositions, euen so there bee thre diuerse endynges, called in Latine, Termini, of the which, thone is called the terme at large, in the first proposicion onely, and afterwarde is referred, to the former part of the conclusion, called subiectū conclusionis. The second terme is called the seuerall, whiche is in the second proposicion, & this is the worde whereof the question is made, & is spoken of in the conclusion. The thirde is called the double repeate, whiche is

twise rehersed, before the conclusion, and therefore it is twise rehersed, because it is the knitting together, of the ij. proposicions, and the cause, why the former part of the proposiciō, (wherof a thyng is saied,) and the last rehersed part, (beyng attributed to the part goyng before,) are ioyned together in the cōclusion. As to make the thyng plain by the former argument, I will proue this conclusion. Thefte is to be punished. Thefte is called the former parte whereof this worde (punished) is spoken, and this worde (punished) therefore is called the last rehersed part, because it is spoken of theft, which went before. Now to make my argumēt, and to proue this sentēce true, I must seke a worde, whiche is more generall then that, whiche is proued. And that worde that commeth to my mynd, & is perteinyng to the cause, beyng more vniuersall: (for euery thyng that is proued, is proued by a thyng more knowen) that same worde or reasō, is called the double repete. whose propertie is twise to be rehersed in an argument, and that

in the first and seconde proposicion, neuer enteryng into the conclusion, as thus. Euery vice is to bee punished, (vice) is the double repete, which must be rehersed in the seconde proposicion, (for I saied before) it must be twise rehersed because it maie be euident, that the former 
                     •
                  art of the conclusion, is in very deede comprehended, vnder the former part of the first proposiciō. And then the argumēt is made as foloweth.
               
                  Euery vice is to be punished
                  Theft is a vice.
                  Ergo it is to be punished.
               
               Here we se the double repete (whiche proueth the matter) is twise rehersed in the first, and second proposicion, and entereth not into the conclusion. The terme at large, is in the first proposicion, and the terme seuerall, is in the second proposicion, and enter both into the conclusion. So that we maye se that, whiche proueth the thyng, doth not entre into the conclusion, but is twise rehersed in the two propo
                     •
                  iciōs, and so the conclusion foloweth, by reason that these twoo woordes, vice, and

theft, agree in a third altogether, and whatsoeuer is saied of the one, is saied of the other, and nothyng can be comprehended vnder the generall, but all the kyndes haue thesame conteined in in theim, which in this proposicion, are r
                     •
                  ferred to the generall. (Al vice is to be punished, vnto vice, is referred this worde punished) therfore, whatsoeuer is cōprehended vnder this worde, vice, as theft, adultery, wrōg dealyng, murder, this worde punished, is rehersed of theim all: because it agreeth to the generall, & is rehersed of thesame. Therfore I reason thus. All vice is to bee punished.
               Therfore

                     Adultery
                           •

                     Murder. are to be punished
                  
               
               For if that, whiche is general, is to be punished, then the kyndes, or sortes in thinges, are al
                     •
                  o to be punished. Accordyng to this saiyng. whatsoeuer is truely, and altogether rehersed, of the generall, that same also is rehersed of the kynde, whiche is included in the generall.

               FIrst, that in euery Syllogismus, the firste proposicion bee vniuersall I call that proposicion vniuersall, when there is omnis, that is to saie, all: or els nullus, that is to saie, none, in the proposiciō. As for example. Euery vice is to be punished, this proposiciō is vniuersall, because it hath omnis, in it, which signifieth all, or euery one. Likewise I call it perticular, when the proposiciō hath quidam, or aliquis, that is to saie certaine, or some body, quidam aulici sunt honesti, some courtiers be honest.
            
            
               ¶The se

                  ond rule.
               If one of the proposicions be perticular, or negatiue, the conclusiō is perticular, or negatiue, I call that proposicion negatiue, when nullus, or nemo, (that is to say) none, or no body, is in ye proposicion. As nullus Christianus est foenerator, no Christian is an vsurer.

yet particulars togethers, for euen as of two negatiues, there foloweth nothyng, so of two particulars, there foloweth nothyng. Therefore, when any suche argument is made, we maie boldely saie it is not lawful, because it is in no mode, as it is very plai

                  e to se in makyng of this argument folowyng.

                  I will be a Courtier.
                  Therefore I shalbe riche.

                  Suche a one is a bishop.
                  Therfore he is a good bishop.
               
               This argument is not lawful, first, bycause by my rule I am taught, that of pure particulars, nothyng doth folow, as Quidam (somme) is a particular Ego, I, is a singular word, or signignifieng asmuche as a propre name, & againe it is in no figure as hereafter I shal shewe. Thirdly it is mete that the firste parte of the seconde proposition shoulde be included in the first proposition, whereof some what is rehersed

or els it is no good argument, in the first figure.
               
                  Some Kynges be righteous.
                  Nero is a Kyng.
                  Therfore Nero is righteous.
               
               This is no good argument, bicause that Nero (which is the first worde in the second proposition of whome some thing is rehersed) is not comprehended vnder the former part of the firste propositiō, which is Kynges, for this former part (some kinges) doth not speake of Nero, nor comprehend such as he is, but honest, and godly disposed gouernors. And yet in weightie causes suche argumentes haue been vsed, euen of those that would haue drawen vs from the obedience of gods holie worde, and persuaded some that we ware free frō the obseruation of any one thyng comprehended in Moses lawes. As thus.
               
                  The lawe of Moses is abolished from the Gentiles.
                  The law of the .x. commaundementes is the lawe of Moses.
                  Ergo the law of the ten comman̄dementes

is abolished from the Gentiles.
               
               Where as this first proposition comprehendeth not all the lawes of Moses, but the lawes ceremonialle whiche ware as figures ordeined in declacla

                  Medius terminus, called the double repete (whiche is a worde rehersed in both propositions) must not entre into the conclusion, because the other two partes, called termini, be proued by this, and brought to the conclusion, by reason they agree with this thirde, the whiche two otherwise could not entre into the conclusion, if this double repete were not mencioned in both propositions, and kept out it selfe from the conclusion, as is euidently to se by an argumentacion.
            
            
               ¶The fift Rule.
               In an argumēt, called Syllogismus there ought not to be doubtfull wordes, or mo wordes in ye conclusion then was before rehersed. For mo thinges to be in the conclusion, this example shall serue which An

               Unprofitable thynges are not to be taught.
               In Philosophie are vnprofitable thinges.
               Ergo philosophie is not to be taught
               This argument is to be denied, because

there is more in the conclusion, then was rehersed in the two first propositions. For this shuld haue bene the conclusiō. Some vnprofitable thynges whiche be in philosophie, are not to be learned, not yt philosophie it selfe is to be reiected, for els we myght make this argument likewise.
               Dronkenes is not to be allowed.
               In drinking is often times dronkenes.
               Therfore drinkyng at any tyme is not to be allowed.
               Therefore we must frame our argument so, that nothing be more in the cō
                  clusion, then was in the other propositions. As thus.
               Dronkenes is not to be al-alowed.
               In some drinkyng is oftentimes dronkenes.
               Therefore some drinkyng is not to be allowed.
            
            
               ¶The sixt Rule.
               There ought not to be mo termes

in an argumentacion then thre, for otherwise there is no good argument.
               Euerie politicall Magistrate ought to kepe vnder disobedient persones, with corporall punishment.
               Peter is an Apostle.
               Therefore Peter shoulde punishe the disobedient.
               In this argument, is no ioynyng together of the first proposition, and the second: for the politicall magistrate, & an Apostle, are two maner of thynges. Therfore it hāgeth together like germaines lyppes as we vse to saye.
            
            
               ¶The seuenth Rule.
               The double repeate, which is twise mencioned in both propositions, ought to be no doubtfull worde, for doubtful wordes make foure seuerall termes whiche should not be, as thus.
               No bondman is free.
               All that beleue the Gospel truely, are free.
               Ergo none that beleue the gospell truely, are bond men.
               This argument is false, and must

be de
                     •
                  ied at the first, because, there be foure termes, for in the first propositiō, fredome, is taken for such a libertie as men do vse in cōmon weales, to make seruauntes, and apprentises fre, in the seconde proposition, fredome is taken for deliueryng the soule frō the wrath of God, from sinne, and from death euerlasting, as we rede in the scripture. Whom the sonne hath made free, they are fre in very diede, not that this fredome taketh away all orders in the cō
                  mon weale, that no man shall haue an apprentise, or a bond mā. For although the father in heauen hath made them free from sinne, from death, and from the wrath of God, yet are they still apprentises, and bond by a political law
                     •
                   therfore we may see that there be .iiij. endynges or termes, consideryng he speaketh of one libertie in the first proposition, and of an other in the second, so that the argumēt is not good. A like argument there is, which one made to Diogenes.
               
               That whiche I am, thou art not
               I am a man.
               
                  Ergo thou art none.
               Here is ambiguite in this verbe (I am) far if it be vnderstanded in the first propositiō that this worde (I am) is not considered accordyng to the generall substaunce, but according to the qualitie, or rather propre beyng, speakyng of ye diuersitie of men, as when I liue, I haue mine own bodie, my flesh, and mine owne bones, thou hast thyne also propre vnto the, and not that I am thou, nor thou art I. Then it is well sayde, that whiche I am, thou art not. But if I vnderstand this word (I am) in the first proposition as a substaunce vniuersall, or rather generall copulatiue, to be rehersed of the inferiors, thē it is not good. For as I may saie, Diogenes is a mā, Aristotle is a man, so I maie saye of al men. Whereby we may see here also foure partes, or endinges, and therfore the argument must be denied at the first, geuyng this reason yt I haue shewed before.
               Nowe that I haue set forth the preceptes whiche are to be obserued in an argument, I will declare howe to seat

be & place an argument, that any bodie may geue a reason, why euery worde is set in an argument, in this, or that place. First therfore we must considre, there be foure figures, whiche serue for the makyng of an argument, & modes also, whiche teache the ordering of propositions whether they shalbe vniuersal, particular, affirmatiue, or negatiue. I wil define them both after this sorte.
               A figure is a lawfull placing of the double repeate, in the twoo propositions, and euen as the double repeate is placed, so we maie iudge with ease in what figure the argument is. The first figure is such an order of propositions in an argumēt, that ye double repeate must be the former part in ye first proposition, and the last rehersed parte in the second proposition, where vpon the cōclusion doth folow. And the reason that it must be so, is because that where as in this figure the argument is euermore made from the generall, to the kynde vniuersally, (for ye first proposition euermore in these two figures

must be vniuersal, either affirmatiue, or negatiue) and because of the general worde, there is sumwhat rehersed of the kynde: one of the propositions must be so placed, that it may euidently appeare that the kynde is encluded in the general. And therfore ye general is spoken in the seconde proposition of the kynde.
               A mode, is a lawfull placing of propositions in there due qualitie, or quantitie. I call that in the propositiō a qualitie, when it doth affirme or denie. I call it a quantitie, when it is either vniuersal, or particular. Unto the first figure belong foure modes, which may be perceiued by these .iiij. wordes.
               
                  
                     Barbara.

                     Ferio.
                  
               
               THese foure wordes must not be forgotten if we wil make an argument truely in the first figure, for euery argument that is made in this figure, is in one of these

foure modes, or els it is no argument of the first figure. If the double repete be the former parte in the first proposition, and the laste rehersed parte in the second proposition, it is in the first 
                     •
                  igure, notwithstandyng, except it be in mode also, it is no argument. Therefore we must learne to place an argument in mode al
                     •
                  o. And for the better knowledge of this thyng, note that in these wordes there be foure vowels to be considered, and marked. That is to saye, A, E, I, &, O. And where we see A in Barbara thrise, we must cōsidre that these thre AAA in this one worde, declare vnto vs thre vniuersall propositiōs affirmatiue, E, declareth a proposition negatiue vniuersall. As in Celarent we se twise. E, whereby we are taught that the argument (if we make it in this mode) must haue two vniuersall negatiues, and one vniuersal affirmatiue, by reason of A, which is in the middest of Celarent. I dothe signifie a particular affirmatiue. O. doth signi
                     ••
                  e a particular negatiue, as in Ferio, the first must be a negatiue vniuersall, the

second an affirmatiue particular, the third a negatiue particular. That these thynges may be more euident to make an argument, both in figure, and mode, I will gyue examples for euery mode of this figure, that one may plainely see the whole matter as though it were in a glasse, remembryng alwaies, that these modes serue for this figure, whiche figure is knowē (as I sayd before) when the double repete is the former part of the first proposition, and the last rehersed part of the second proposition. And where as I sayde before that certayne argumentes were in no mode, althoug they were in the first figure, and therefore not good because they were not both in one mode, and figure, these shalbe to vnderstande, they were not in one mode, because the first proposition must be vniuersall euer, or els it is not good. Now therefore here folowe examples of the first figure and of the modes thereof.

               The second figure is, where the the double repete is the last, rehersed parte in bothe propositions, after this sorte followynge, and there be .iiij. modes

belongyng to the same figure, as it shal appere, whiche all they haue these iiij. vowels in thē. A.E.I.O. so that they make the proposition to be vniuersal, or particular, affirmatiue, or negatiue, as it was before.
               Note that the cōclusion is alwayes negatiue, for asmuche as the firste, and the second, are alwayes repugnaunt, neither do they agree in the double repeate, called Medius terminus. And therfore the conclusion is negatiue by contraposition, wherof I spake before when I entreated of the conuersion or turnyng of propositions.

(which is lesse) to the generall worde whiche is more vniuersall, but so not withstandynge, that the conclusion be particular. and therfore this kynde of argument is very good. For the Species, or kynd, beyng ones put, the generall, must nedes folowe.

               It is verye necessarie that there shuld be .iij. figures, as I haue shewed alreadye. for in euerye argument that hath the shape of a Sillogismus (for the induction & the exāple haue it not, nether be thei in mode & figure) euermore we reason from the general, to the kind

vniuersal, makyng the conclusion vniuersal, or els we reason from the kynd, to the generall, makyng the conclusion particular, or els there is a repugnancie of the terme at large, and the seuerall, when they do not agree with the double repete, or laste of all we ioyne many causes, and many effectes together, wherof is made an argument, called Sorites, or coaceruatio, that is to say, a heapyng together of thinges
               Whan we make an argument, and procede from the general worde, to the kynde, it is in the first figure. and euen by oure reason we learne this, that if the greater be not, the lesser cannot be.

               These half imperfect Argumentes called Enthymemata, consiste partely of likelyhodes, and partely of infallible reasons.
               Likelyhodes, are those, that often hitte the trueth, & yet are not alwaies so, as thus.

               This kynde of Argument is called Inductio, because that shewing diuerse propre names, it enduceth at length, and moueth the mind to make a generall conclusion. Therfore necessary it is, that in such Argumentes al the examples which are induced be like, for if any be found contrary, the Argument is of no force, as thus,

                     Athanasius liued vnmaried,
                     Ambrosius liued vnmaried,
                     Basilius had no wife & a great many mo.
                     Ergo all Bishoppes heretofore were vnmaried.
                  
               
               The Argument is not Lawful, forasmuche

as diuerse haue been maried in the Primatiue Churche, as Spiridion, Hermes, Hilarius, Policrates, Tertullianus, and diuers other. for it was the maner in ye primatiue church that honeste maried men were chosen to be Bishoppes, and had the charge of christes flocke. The Apostles also (as Egnatius wittenesseth) had wiues aswel as other men, and as I think vsed them, as other mē do their wiues, or elles asked their leaue, and consent to forbeare them.
            
            
               De Exemplo.
               AN example, is a maner of Argumentation, where one thyng is proued by an other, for the likenes, that is found to be in them both, as thus. If Marcus Attilius Regulus had rather lose his life, then not kepe promise with his enemie, thē shoulde euery man beyng taken prisoner kepe promise with his enemy. Yf cities haue bene destroied for breaking of wedlocke, then adulterers muste nedes be punished. Yf Alexander dawned a weake souldiour when he was

                  SOrites, vel coaceruatio, is a heapyng together of causes, one, vpon an other. A kynd of Argument when the last rehersed

worde of the first Proposition, is repeted in the firste parte of the seconde Proposition, necessarily agreyng there vnto, and so goyng stil forth in like maner, til at the length the last rehersed worde be added vnto the first woorde, called Subiectum of the first Proposition. And it is a kynde of Argument muche vsed, when we ascend vpward frō the lowest, to the highest. or els when we go from the causes, to the next thyng done. whiche thynges done, are the occasiō of other thynges besides, as thus.

               From that, whiche by nature is in any thyng, to that whiche happeth casually, or cōmeth by some miseuill, the reason is not good. As thus.

                  Another argument vsed by the Romishe bishop.
                  Synne doth not beget man.
                  The worke of lust begetteth man.
                  Therfore lust otherwise called concupiscentia, is not synne.
               
               The second proposicion is not true, for wicked concupiscence, came in by mannes foly, and hath muche defaced that, which nature first ordeined. Therfore nature it self through god, geueth increase, whiche is muche contrary to the wicked lust of concupiscence.

               Some hold fast vpon a saiyng of. S. Augustine, and buylde wonders vpon that text. I would not beleue the Gospell saieth Augustine, excepte the catholike churche did perswade me. And herevpon saie thei.
               
                  The Gospel is beleued, for the churche sake.
                  Ergo the Churche is of more aucthoritee.
               
               And here thei heape a nōbre of mischiefes. Therfore (saie thei) the church maie make lawes, appoynct tradicions whatsoeuer thei bee. But I answere thus, the Antecedent is false. For I chiefly beleue the Gospell, cōsideryng God is the aucthor: and seyng the wō
                  ders that he hath doen, I geue credite to it for his sake. I graūt we do beleue the Gospell, for the churche sake, but yet principally, for that GOD is the chief aucthor, that perswadeth vs to receiue his worde, and after the churche

(as the secōde cause) telleth vs that the Gospel is the truth of God. Therfore if thei will make this suche an argument, as thei seme to saie it is, then this that foloweth, is of as good force, for in all thynges it is like.
               
                  This child is a good boye, gramercie rod.
                  Ergo the rodde is better then the boye.
               
            
         
         
            
            Of the secōd part of Logique, called Inuentio, that is to saie, the fyndyng out of an argument.
            HEtherto we haue treated of the former parte of logique called in latine Iuditium, that is to saye, Iudgement, or skill, to declare the nature of euerye worde seuerallie, to set the same wordes in a perfecte sentence, and to knitte them vp in argument, so that hereby we myght with ease espie, the ryght frame in matters, howe they agree beyng lapped vp in order. Nowe therefore the other parte shalbe sette forth whiche is called Inuentio, whereby we maie finde argumentes, and reasons, mete to proue euery matter where vpon question maie ryse. This parte is the store house of places wherin argumentes rest, vnto the whiche if

wee conferre the matter whiche wee entende to proue, there will appere diuerse argumētes to cōfirme the cause. Like as they therefore that digge for golde in ye grounde, do searche narowly the vaynes of the yearth, and by diligent markyng the nature thereof, at length fynde out the mine, which ones beyng founde, they strayght bryng to lyght, for the onely behoue of man: So he that will reason wysely, aswell for the commune profite of other, as for his owne priuate gayne, must be a very diligent labourer. and consideryng matters are put to the proufe, wherein often resteth doubte, his parte must be euermore to marke ye nature of his cause and to seke confirmation therof in euery parte. First by the definition, the cause, the effecte, and propre office. Agayne to se what is contrarie, what is like, and what thinges be incidēt thervnto, the which all when he hath done
                  •
                he shall se at length that some one argument aboue al other, serueth best to confirme his cause, the whiche when with trauayle, he hath founde out, he

maie bryng to light and vse, accordyng to his will.
            
               ¶What a place is.
               A Place is the restyng corner of an argumēt, or els a marke whiche giueth warnyng to our memory what we maie speake probablie, either in the one parte, or the other, vpon all causes that fall in question. Those that be good hare finders will sone finde the hare by her fourme. For when they se the grounde beaten flatte round about, & faire to the sight: thei haue a narow gesse by al likelihod that the hare was there a litle before. Likewyse the hontesman in huntyng ye foxe, wil sone espie when he seeth a hose, whether it be a foxe borough, or not. So he yt will take profite in this parte of logique, must be like a hunter, and learne by labour to knowe the boroughes. For these places be nothyng el
                     •
                   but couertes or boroughes, wherein if any one searche diligentlie, he maie fynde game at pleasure. And although perhappes one place fayle him, yet shal he finde a dousen other places, to accomplishe

his purpose. Therfore if any one will do good in this kynde, he must go from place to place, and by serching euery borough, he shall haue his purpose vndoubtedlie in moste part of thē, if not in all. We se that euery proposicion dooth either affirme a thyng to be true, or els denieth, yt it is true. Therefore when any thyng is cōstantly saide
                     •
                   it nedeth somewhat euermore to confirme it. As for example. The Sacramentes are necessarie in the churche of God. I maie proue this sayng true, by reasonyng from that place whiche is called the ende of euery thynge. As thus.
               To geue testimonie of our faythe, and to nousell our selfe in the practise thereof, is very necessarie.
               The Sacramentes geue testimonie of our fayth. &c.
               Ergo the Sacramentes are verie necessarie.
               When anie proposition doth denie, it is nedefull to haue a thirde worde whiche maie agree with one parte of the proposition. As if one should thus

saie. Man is not iustified by his workes. The place of repugnaunt wordes that do altogether disagree geueth iust matter. And therfore I maie saie, man is not iustified by his workes, because he is iustified by his fayth onely. For if mercie come by grace, and that frelie, then workes cannot saue vs. Paule proueth the first, therefore the seconde is for euer true.

               Of the generall worde.
               The generall woorde, is spoken of many, that differ either in kynd, or els

diffre in nombre, when the question is asked, what it is, we maie reason negatiuely, from this place thus.

                  No wastfulnes is a vertue.

                  No vertue maie bee called wastfulnes.
                  Liberalitie is a vertue.
                  Therfore liberalitie maie not be called wastfulnes.
               
            
            
               ¶The generall rule.
               If the generall woorde be taken awaie, the kynde tarieth not. If the generall woorde doo remain, it shall not straight folowe, that the kynd shall ensue. For it is no good argument, if I se a tree a good way from me, to say, it is a tree, therefore it is an Apple tree. I maie say thus well negatiuely, it is no tree. Therfore it is neither apple tree nor other.
            
            
               ¶The maner of reasonyg.
               If euery creature by nature loue it self, then man doth loue hymself. If euery

vertue be praise worthye, then in thadministracion of iustice, to geue euery man his awne, it is praise worthy.
            
            
               ¶The vse.
               The generall worde, declareth the largenesse of any thyng, so that where the generall taketh no place, the other that be inferior cānot be. As if there be no liuyng creature, in some one house, then there muste nedes be no maner of man in thesame house.
            
            
               Of the kynde.
               The kynde beynge reckened emong the places, is taken to be anye one thynge that is lesse generall than an other, and by this shyfte euen propre noumes or names of thinges shal serue for the kynde, and go in steade thereof. Therfore as we reason from the kynd to the generall, so may we reason from nownes proper, to their kyndes.
            
            
               Of the kynde
               From the kynde to the generall, an argument is made affirmatiuelye, as thus. if iustice is to be desyred, than vertue is to be desyred. Such a man is a slaunderer, ergo he is a naughtie mā.
            
            
               
               The general rule.
               To whome the kynde doth agree, to the same also the general doth agree.

                   reasonyng.
               Yf sobriete be praise worthie, then vertue is praise worthie. If drōckenes be deuelishe, then surfeytyng is deuelishe.
            
            
               The vse.
               The kynde is general to euery propre name, and therfore in describynge the nature of euery noune proper, we haue muche nede of this place, to know vnder what kynde euery seueral thing i
                     •
                   comprehended. Againe what soeuer is defined, that same is ye kynd of some one thynge, so that hereby we learne how farre this worde stretcheth beyng ordeyned to sette forthe the nature of euery propre name.

               From the propretye, and difference argumentes are deriued both affirmatiue, and negatiue. he can reason a matter artificiallye, therfore he is a good logicien. Aesope coulde not vtter his minde at large, but dyd stammer, and

staye muche in his speche, therefore he was no Oratour.
            
            
               The general rule.
               When the propretye, or difference is graunted, then the kynde straight foloweth, take awaye the same, and ther remayneth no kynde at all.
            
            
               The maner of reasonyng.
               Whosoeuer is endued with reason, the same is a man
            
            
               The vse.
               The difference, and the proprety declare natures workyng in all thynges lyuyng, and therfore they h

                  lpe wel to shewe what euery thyng is by his propre gyfte.
               we spake before of a methode, or directe order to be vsed in all our doinges: and herein we maie wel se the vse therof. for hetherto we handeled those places which do nothyng els but comprehende the nature of a perfecte definition. nowe whereas the place foloweth of the whole and his partes, it is nothynge els but the right maner of a perfecte diuisiō. the places that folowe 
                     •
                  fter, declare the causes, the effectes,

what be incident, what be disagreyng frome the matter, shewynge example and testimonies of the auncient.
            
            
               Of the whole and the partes.
               The whole is that same which consisteth of his partes, and is deuided .ij. maner of wayes. Firste there is the whole in substaunce, which standeth of suche partes, that if one betaken away, the whole decayeth straight, neyther can it afterwarde kepe his name, as it did before. For an example. A man is diuided into bodye, and soule. Take away the bodie, who cōpteth the soule to be that man, which before had his bodye ioyned thereunto? we saye the soule liueth whā the body is dede, but no man saieth the soule is the veray man, euen as we called hym before, when he was compacte of both.
               Againe there is the whole absolute with his partes, which serueth to make the whole perfect, addyng suche thinges that althoughe they be awaye, yet the whole notwithstandynge remayneth, and hathe his name still, as whan a mā is made of body, and soule,

(whiche are the partes of his substāce, and cannot be away) yet hath he othe
                     •
                   partes, whiche although thei be away, the whole notwithstandynge kepethe his name stil. As if a man lose his hand
                     •
                   his arme, or one of his fete, yet is he called a man, and these be called partes integrales, that is to saye, the partes whiche finishe the whole, and make it perfecte, after that it hath those partes whiche make the substaunce.
            
            
               The general rule.
               Yf the whole be, the partes of the substance muste nedes be. As if a man be alyue, the bodie, & soule, both lyue.
            
            
               The maner of reasonyng.
               Yf philosophie be good, then it is good to knowe the nature of thynges, the waye of ordering mans life, and the skyl howe to reason probablie, for philosophie it selfe is diuided into these thre partes.
            
            
               The vse.
               Here by we learne to examine the whole by the partes, that if we cannot obteyne our purpose to haue the whole graunted, to examine it by the partes,

and force oure aduersarie to assente to some member.
               The integrale partes, whiche make perfecte the whole, and cause the bignesse therof, are called partes like, or not lyke.
               Partes like, are those which are alwayes like, and deuided euermore into like. As the flesh, bones, sinewes, fyer, water, gold, yron, wyne, wood, stone. Euery part of al these, is called asmuch as the whole. as a piece of fleshe, is called flesh, apiece of wood, is called wood a droppe of water, is called water, as wel as a gallō of water is called water. They be called in latin Similares partes, bycause thei are named like vnto the whole, for a piece of fleshe is aswel called fleshe, and asmoche hath it the name of fleshe, as a great braune hath. The partes which haue not like names to the whole, are partly prīcipal, & partely not principal. the principal partes are those which in no wise mai be away without losse of the whole it selfe: as the partes of mans bodye whiche conteyne life, cannot be awaye withoute

losse of the man. As the head, the bealy, the hart, & the entrailes. Ye
                     •
                   notwithstandyng the partes of these cannot be called lyke to the whole, for no man saith that a piece of the hart, is a hart, or a piece of the heade, is a head, & so in the other.
               Those which are not principal partes, maye be awaye: and the whole not withstandyng remayne stil, as the handes, the fiete, the legges, & the armes.
            
            
               The general rule.
               When the chief partes are taken awaye, the whole nedes decaieth: the chief partes beynge brought altogether, the whole nedes muste followe.
               Suche a man hathe learned moral philosophie, natural, and logique, therfore he is a Philosopher.
               
                  Badius can neither write wel, speake well, nor yet recite authours acordyngly. Therfore he is no grāmarien. This man is no rethoricien, because he cānot place his thynges in good ordre. For where as fiue thinges be required 
                     •
                  n an Oratour, first, to inuente, aftre to place thynges inuented, thirdlie, to set

forth y• matter in good wordes, fourthly, to remembre all these, and last of al to vtter the same distinctlie, and with a clere voice. If one lacke any of these fyue, he cannot be called an oratour. Therfore I may saye, suche a one hath an euell memorie. Ergo he is no oratour. or such a one hath no vtteraunce. Ergo he may not be called an oratour. In the negatiue part, it is enoughe to take one part away, for the disalowing of any thyng. But if I wil affirme any thyng by ye partes, I must take all the partes, and not one, or two partes. For he is not an oratour that canne inuent onely, or place thynges in good ordre onlie, except he can do the whole as it is required. Agayne he is no good oratour that can teache onelie, or delite, but he is absolute that can both teach, delite, and also perswade.
            
            
               ¶The maner of reasonyng.
               We reason frō the part to the whole affirmatiuely, and negatiuely. Thus. Suche a one can neither iudge the knitting of wordes together, nor frame thē in order accordyng to the arte, nor auoyde

any subtilties. Ergo he is no logician.
            
            
               ¶The vse.
               The partes sette forth the whole, and are a great beautifieng to the same, beyng seuerally handeled, and in their natures sette forth at large.
            
            
               ¶Of woordes yoked together.
               Yoked wordes whiche beyng deriued of one, are chaunged in the speakyng. As of Sapiens, sapientia, sapienter. A wise man, wisdome, wisely. Here we se that of a wise man, is deriued wysdome. I may reason from this place both affirmatiuely, and negatiuely, If one be not wise, he hath no wisdom, if one be wyse, he hath wisedome. If one do circumspectely, he is called a circumspecte man. If it be no misery to die, then death is not miserable. Such a one is a philosopher, therfore he hath studied philosophie. Argumentes deriued from hence haue great force, if the only yoked wordes be ioyned together without additiō of an other, or els they are not strong. As thus. Preachers be euell liuers. Ergo preachyng is euell.
            
            
               
               ¶The generall Rule.
               When one of the yoked wordes is added, or put away, the other also is added, or put awaye.
            
            
               ¶The maner of reasonyng.
               Suche a one is a priestely minister, Ergo he is a priest. Suche a man hath serued the kyng nobly. Ergo he is a noble man. The preacher handled his matter learnedlie. Ergo the preacher hath learnyng.
            
            
               ¶The vse.
               We maie learne by this place to knowe what thynges are, beyng considered in other. For if I woulde knowe whether it be good, or no, to be a mā of honour, and to haue rule in the cōmune weale: I may learne by them that do rule, what it is to be a man of honoure, and howe daungerouse a callyng they haue, that are placed in high estate.
            
            
               ¶Of wordes adioyned to the substaunce and yet not of the substaunce.
               Wordes adioyned are called those accidentes whereby the singuler word, or propre name, hath an other name thē of the verie substaunce, as vnto Cato,
                  
(whiche of his substaunce is a man) wisdome doth happen, whereby he is called wyse. Unto Cicero also (whiche by his substaunce is a man) there happeneth eloquence, whereby he is called eloquent. So that he hath an other name then his substaunce geueth, whiche is to be eloquent, and this is the word adioyned. Al quantities, qualities, and those that are comprehended in the predicament of relation, are referred to this place, when they are considered to be comprehended in a substaunce. Uertue referred to the mynde whiche conteyneth it, is a worde adioyned: compared with vice, it is a contrarie: referred to iustice, it is a generall worde. Wordes adioyned are perceiued. either by the senses (as those whiche are subiect to the senses) or els by vndrestandyng. As swyftenesse may be considered to be in a man, although we se him lie a longe. And so we saye suche a lacquie ronneth wel, although we do not then presently se him runne, but we remembre that he hath ronne, saiyng now as we haue sene before in dede. Againe

some wordes adioyned are by nature in the thyng which conteine thē, as heate is naturally in fire. And because we se that ye same heate, although it neuer go awaye, yet at all tymes it is not of like strength: but at some time less whote, then at an other, we iudge ye same heate to be an accidēt. Some wordes adioyned are not naturally cleauyng, but by some other waye are ioyned to ye thing conteinyng them, as heate in water set vppon the fyer.
            
            
               ¶The generall Rule.
               I fone of the wordes adioyned be in the subiect or thyng conteinyng, the other also is lyke to be there, which foloweth vpon the first. As thus. Cato is a mā worthie praise, because he is ware sober, and full of experience. Prayse foloweth vertue, as the shadow doth the bodie. Therefore whosoeuer hath modestie & great knowledge of thynges, the same mā of necessitie winneth praise, and fame, that cannot die. Agayne if the wordes adioyned be, ye subiect that conteyneth them must nedes be also, as thus. If God be all goodnes then

there is a God.
            
            
               ¶The maner of reasonynng.
               Christ came to this worlde beyng gentle and milde. Ergo Christ came not to destroye the lost shepe, but to saue them. Scholers be godlie, vertuouse, and occupied in learnyng. Ergo it is a graciouse dede to helpe suche of theim as haue nede.
            
            
               ¶The vse.
               We maie by this place either praise, or dispraise, setting forth the nature of men, & iudgyng thē by their workes.
            
            
               ¶Of dedes done, or suffred to be done, called Actus.
               
               THe maner of doyng, or sufferyng is, when we are supposed to bee occupied, or affected any maner of waie, either in doyng, or in suffryng. There be so many maner of doinges, as there be adiacētes, or wordes adioyned. And of these adiacentes, feare, sorowe, trauaile, reste, heate, colde, are deriued these: to feare, to be sory, to trauaile, to rest, to be hotte, to be colde. And generally all those wordes that are referred vnto ye
                  
two Predicamentes called the maner of doyng, and the sufferyng, are compassed with in this place, if the same woordes be considered as Accidentes which cleaue to the substaunce, & maie both be present, & also be a waie without losse of the substaunce. For if thinges done, be waied accordyng to their proper maner of doing, they are referred to the two places aboue, called the differēce and the propretie. For where as we saie. Such a one speaketh, Ergo he is man (for nothyng els can speake naturally but man onely) although in this case (to speake) be a maner of doyng, yet it is not referred to this, but rather to the propretie, bicause it belō
                  geth to man alone, & alwaies to man.
            
            
               ¶The generall rule.
               If the maner of doyng, or sufferyng be, the thyng conteynyng is also, and the woordes adioyned also (whereof doyng, and sufferyng haue their of spryng) folowe vpon the same.
            
            
               ¶The maner of reasonyng from this place.
               If one breathe, the same man hath

life in him. If Iulius Cesar came into England, then there was such a man called Iulius Cesar. Yf Richard the third plaied the tyrante here in Englande, then there was suche a man in Englande.
            
            
               ¶The Use.
               This place much helpeth either for praise, or dispraise. Some officers bribe the poore, robbe their Maister, and wayst their own. Ergo suche are worthie death.
            
            
               ¶Of the thyng tonteynyng.
               The Subiecte, or the thyng conteinyng, is a substaunce being the stoorehouse of Accidentes, & the very proppe to hold vp diedes done: for neither wisdom, strength, health, nor Policie can be at al, except they be conteined with in some one body.
            
            
               ¶The generall rule.
               Take away the thyng conteinyng, and there remaineth nether adiacent, nor yet dede done.
            
            
               ¶The maner of reasonyng.
               There is fie
                     •
                  , Ergo it is hotte. Christ was a very mā, Ergo Christ died, and

sufferde the panges at his departyng.
            
            
               ¶An other.
               Why doest thou say that I owe the a croune, whome I knowe was neuer yet worth a grote. Melāchthon liueth and readeth. Therfore there is great learnyng to be had where he is.
            
            
               ¶The Use.
               By naming a worthy persō, his prayse is sufficiently set forth, euen when his name is ons vtterd. For what learned man hearing the name of Cicero, doth not remembre thereby, the ful practise and the absolute skil of all eloquence? These places therfore helpe aswel for the amplifiyng of matters, either in prayse or disprayse, as they do for the stedfast prouyng of any cause.
            
            
               ¶Of outward places beyng not in the substaunce, but only touching the substaūce, and without the nature of it.

               Some causes, are called the very causes of thynges, euen by their owne nature: other causes are happenyng causes, the which may perhapps bryng forth the effect, lastely there be causes without the which, thinges can not be done, and yet are they not any cause to force the effecte

               The very cause of thynges, is such a one that if it be practised in very diede, and set forth with other naturall causes, the effect must nedes folowe: and againe if it be not putte in practise, although the other be put, yet the effect shall not folowe. As for exā
                  ple, although one haue a cloth, yet can he not haue the vse of it, excepte the tailer cutte it out. And although the milner grinde, yet we are like to dine without breade, excepte the baker, do his parte also in the batche.
               The happenyng cause, is such a one that although it bee putte in practise in very diede, yet it shall not straight waie so be, that the effect muste n

folowe. As an ague may be the happenyng cause, that some one man kepeth good diet, & yet not any forcyng cause: for then all sicke folke might be compted for sober men. The cause without the whiche, thynges cannot be dooen, as thus. The Surgean cannot heale a wounde, except the dedde fleshe be cut out. The waiefarer shall hardly come to his iorneis end, except he haue some money in his purse. In time of warre, it is euill trauailyng without a passe porte, & this is called in Latine, Causa sine qua non, that is to say, the cause without the which we cā not, and yet it is not the cause of our iourneyng.

               A cause in very dede, is a meane, by whose force some thyng doth folowe.

               The efficient cause, is the working cause, by whose meanes, thynges are brought to passe.
               Of those that are workyng causes,

some by nature bring thynges to passe, some by aduisement, and by a fore purposed choyse. Thynges woorke by nature (and that necessarily) which lacke knowlege to chuse this, or that, & haue no iudgement, to discerne thynges. As the Sonne, the fire, herbes, precious stones. The sonne, euen by nature, geueth light to the daie, and cānot other wise doo. the fire burneth naturally

Thei worke by the force and violence of nature, whose beginnyng, is within theimselfes: beyng ayded by none other outward thing.

               From the naturall workyng cause, the effecte must nedes folowe, as thus. If the Sonne shine, the daie muste nedes be, whiche is the effecte, or workemanship of the Sunne. Suche a man hath eaten Hemlock: Ergo he is poysoned, and in daunger of death. Fire is in the Chimney, or in the toppe of the house, therefore it muste nedes burne. Take away the cause, and theffect can not be at al: for if there be no fire, there can bee no flame, nor burnyng neither.
               The seconde workyng cause, is whē thynges are dooen by aduisement, and by choyse, not by any necessitie at all, for thynges maie aswell not bee doen, as be doen, as if there be a Shomaker, there maie be shone made, and contrary, if there be no Shomaker, there can

be no shone at all.

               Suche a one hath drōke poyson, ergo he will dye shortly. Christe hath reconciled mankind to his father, by sufferyng death vpon the Crosse, Ergo suche as beleue in this sauyng health, shall liue for euer.

                  auses efficient.
               Some efficient causes, are cōmaundyng causes. As the Kyng is the commaundyng cause to his subiecte, to doo this or that. The Master of workes, is the commaundyng cause, to all the laborers. The other efficient causes, are obediēt causes, when the seruant worketh at his maisters commaundement.

                   the efficient obeyer: gunnes dartes, bowes, and billes, the instrumentes of doyng. Good hede ought to bee had, that in all causes wee make a difference, not confoundyng one with another, that the nigh causes, & the farther causes, be not taken all for one. A cause farre fetched, is this. Such a one fell out with his neighbour: Ergo he killed hym. Fallyng out bryngeth chidyng, chidyng bryngeth hatred, hatred causeth fightyng, fightyng geueth blowes, blowes sone dispatche, sone dispatchyng, is ready death. Therefore, I might more probably reason thus. Suche a one gaue his neighbor a dedly wounde: Ergo he hath killed hym. And thus the argumeist is made from the nighest cause.
            
            
               
               ¶Another diuision.
               Some causes are principall causes, as the holy ghoste workyng all Godly mociōs, and stirryng our nature, euermore to the best. Other causes, are the inclinaciōs in mā, that are either good or eiuill Thirdly, there are helpyng causes, whiche are meanes the rather, to further vs in all vertue. As learnyng, practisyng of honest behauor, acquaintyng our nature, euermore with the best. The principall cause, that Ioseph forbare, to company with another mannes wife: was the holy ghost, that stirred his mind with the fear of God. The secōd cause, was his awne mynd, that remembred the worde of God, and the punishement dewe for synne. The thirde cause was, that he accustomed himself, euer to liue vprightly, and not onely to auoyde synne, but also to auoyde the occasion of synne. There be other diuisions, but I leaue to reherse them, for feare I should be ouer long.
            
            
               ¶The ende, called. Finis.
               
               
                  THe ende is, for whose cause any thyng is doen, and is twoo waies considered. For there is an absolute ende, whervnto al other are referred, beeyng called the perfeccion, and chief propertie in any thyng: as the chiefest ende in any man, is to be perfectly endued with reason, and to attain euerliuyng felicitie. The chiefest propertie in a horse, is to be of a very good courage, & to want no stomacke: the chifest perfeccion in fire, is to bee very hote, and very drye. There is another ende, called a helpyng ende, whiche serueth to an higher ende, and is onely ordeined for this purpose, that wee might attain thereby, the perfecte ende of all. As meate, drinke, apparell, and other necessary thynges, are helping endes for man, to attain the chifest ende. For without these endes, mā could not liue. To liue honestly in this life, to be vpright in dealyng, with all persones, is an helpyng ende, (as the Philosophiers take it,) and a testimonie to the worlde of our faith (as the Christians take it) for man to liue, world without

ende. To mary a wife, is a helpyng ende, for a man to auoyde fornicacion. The pore man laboureth, and wherefore? To get his liuyng. Wherfore getteth he his liuyng? That he maie the better be able to serue God. The souldiour fighteth at his princes commaū
                  dement, chiefly because God commaū
                  deth him, next after for loue of the kyng and his countrey: thirdly and last of al that he might liue the rather, in quiet at home with his wife, and childrē. So that of one, and thesame thyng, there maie bee many endes, beeyng orderly considred.
            
            
               ¶The general rule.
               Whose ende is good, or euill, thesame thyng is good, or euil, as a sweard is good, because it is good for a man, to defende hymsef. Faithe in Christ Iesu is good, for by faithe we are saued. To vndo my neighbour, with lendyng for gain, is moste vngodly: therefore to be an vsurer, is moste vngodly. To desire another mannes wife, is vngodly, because adultery, is vngodly. Battaill is good, because it bryngeth peace. For al

men should fight, for this ende, that we might liue in quiete, with our neighbours. If thou wilt be honest

                   and estemed for a godly person, do the accions of vertue, and thou shalt be wel reported of, especially of the honest. It is good to learne, because learning it self is good, whiche is thende of our study.

Ergo there is no house. But if I reason thus by the substance, that chā

               The commoditie of these causes is so great, that in settyng furthe the vse of them, a man might soner lacke wordes, than want matter. First we know that nothyng is done without a cause, and therfore seyng this worlde framed as it is, euerye thinge proporcioned in

his due order, we maye trulie gather that there is one aboue all, that ruleth all, whom the Christian calleth God. In praisyng or dispraysyng, how can a man better procede, than by rehersyng the ende of euery thyng. Again in examinyng and searchyng out the profite or disprofite, by thende we knowe what is gainfull: by the efficient cause we knowe what maie be dooen. For whatsoeuer is profitable, the same is profitable for some ende, and whatsoeuer we wolde haue done, we maye soone perceaue by the efficient, if it may be done. yea in causes of iudgement, we maye iudge, what wil some one mā had to do this or that, when we consider, to what ende he did this or that. Last of all, we know hereby, that God hath ordeyned nothing in vayne, and that euery thing is ordeyned for some one end. The end of Christes death was, to merite mans redemption. The ende of mans lyfe is, to trust wholly in Christes passion, and to lyue thereby for euer.

               Yf one list to reason from the place, called in latin Locus, he may thus say. Suche a one is in the countrye, Ergo he is not in the Citie. Yf I will proue that a man beynge accused of murder vniustly, did not offend: I may reason both from the time, and the place. The man was killed in the fieldes, aboute iij. of the clocke in the after none, all whiche time this other man came not

abrode. No, he loked not out of his house all that daye. Ergo this man dyd not kyll hym. Clodius was accused at Rome that he had made a spoyle of the reliques in the tēple of Bona Dea, where as he at the same tyme when this dede was thought to be done, was at Interamna, a village in the countrye beside Rome. Quintilian saith thus. Thou hast killed an adulterer, which the law doth permitte, but bycause thow haste kylled the same mā in a brothels house, thou art worthye to dye thie selfe. Notwithstandinge these .i

                  . places are rather vsed of the Rethoriciens, than emong the logiciens, for when a man is taken of suspection we go aboute to proue hym faultie by diuerse coniectures. As if he ware about ye same place, at the self same time, whan a man was slayne, and also had his sworde aboute hym: we coniecture that he might haue killed hym. Againe if we perceiue one to be a riotous felowe, readie to fight with euery bodie, accompanyeng with naughtie packes, and euermore at one end of al frayes, waxyng pale when he is apprehended,

shakynge for feare, or runnyng awaye, when he should be taken, we suspect suche a one that he is not altogether cliere. Therfore Oratours do vse to marke thinges that go before the facte, as whether he hated the man or no, or what gaine he might haue by his death, and also obserue thynges ioyned with the faulte, as changynge of hewe, when he is apprehended, or his sworde to be blodie, or any parte of his apparell, and thyrdlye thei note what followeth. that is, if he ran awaye, if he cannot tell his tale plainlye, and so they conclude as they are led by suspection. Some Argumētes are necessary, some probable, as thus, from the consequent. Such a womā is brought in bed with a childe, Ergo she hathe had the compaignie of man. Suche a man had a bluddye sworde in his hande straight after the death of his neyghbour, euen in the same fildes wher his neyghbour was slaine, Ergo it is like this mā hath slayne hym. All which argumentes are deriued from the place called Contingentia as I wyll shewe it hereafter.

To bee an Officer, a Mayour, a Sherieue, lord Chauncelour, cōptrollour, or any other officer in the common weale, all these are annexed to their inferiour, ouer whome thei haue aucthorite. In this point differ wordes knitte, called annexed, from wordes adioyned, called adiacentia, that all adiacentes, or woordes adioyned cannot be with out the subiect, as heat, colde, whitenes, or any other like cannot be, except they be comprehended with in some Subiecte. For it is propre to euery Accident, to be in some one thing cōteining him. If ther be nothyng conteynyng, then the Accident cannot be. Not withstandyng, wordes knitte, are so placed, that one is without the other, & may be, either of them seuerally, if the one happen to perishe: as a housebande is without the substaunce of his wife, and although his wife dye, yet the housband maie be onliue,

               ¶The diuersitie of thre diuerse places.
               Wordes adioyned, wordes knit to another, & wordes chauncyng to a thyng differ thus, that in woordes adioyned called adiacentia, the cause why thynges are so named, is euer in the subiect neither can the wordes adioyned continue, except thei be cōprehended within some one substaunce. Wordes knit, are of suche sorte that by namyng one, the other is strayght knowen. As when I name a Scholemaister, I signifie scholers also, although I do not expresselie name them. But in wordes chauncyng called Contingentia, we must at the lest compare .ii. together, that we maie better knowe them to be of this place. Therfore if I name this worde (craft) by it self, without any further consideraciō, then it is an adiacent, or a worde adioyned. If I name this worde (seruaunt) crafte is referred to the place

called a word knit, considering craft is mencioned in respect of the seruan̄t. If I say thus (a craftie seruaunt) then these two are considered to be in thys place called Contingentia, whiche is a place of wordes chancing to a thing so, yt whether they chaunce or no, y• thyng it self maie be notwithstāding. As a seruaunte may be, & yet not craftie. Again one may be craftie, & yet not a seruant.

Therfore if ye will expound what a philosopher is, you maie reason thus, from the interpretation of the worde. Whosoeuer he be that hath an earnest loue to philosophie, and seketh knowledge thereof, that man is a philosopher.
               
                  Cato hath an earnest loue to philosophie, and seketh knowledge therof.

               ¶Of the place called authoritie, otherwise named sentences of the sage.
               AL suche testimonies maie be called sentences of the sage, whiche are brought to confirme anye thyng, either taken out of olde authours, or els suche as haue bene vsed

in this commune life. As the sentences of noble men, ye lawes in anie realme, quicke saiynges, prouerbes, that either haue bene vsed heretofore, or bee nowe vsed. Histories of wise philosophers, the iudgementes of learned mē, the commune opiniō of the multitude, olde custome, auncient fashions, or anie suche like. Testimonies, are two waies considered. For either they are such as pertayne to God, or els to man. Those authorities which come from God, and are spoken by the holy ghost, are vndoubtedly true, neither can they be false: therefore we ought moste reuerentlie to receiue the worde of God, & agre to such textes as are writen & spoken, euen as though we heard God him selfe speake, with liuely voice vnto vs. Mās autority hath no such great force, although noble men, learned Philosophers, and stoute capitaines haue pronounced manie thynges moste wiselie. For although Aristotle saieth that the worlde neither had beginnyng, nor yet at any tyme shall haue endyng: I maye reiecte this saiyng, (if anie man bryng

me it for his confirmation,) although this great philosopher did pronounce thesame. For except I be perswaded bi reason, it is in my choyse, either to admit, or to refuse such authorities. Not withstandyng we shoulde not forsake wyse mens wordes rashely, but with a modest answer desire y• aduersarie not so muche to sticke to his authoritie, as to proue the same by some good reason. In prophane thynges ye maye reason affirmatiuely very well, as thus. The best thynges are first to be learned, for so doth Quintilian teache. Nusquam tuta fides. It is hard trustyng any bodie. For so saieth Virgile. But I can not reason negatiuelie, when I bryng mine authoritie out of prophane aucthours. For I reason amysse if I saie. There is no suche disease called the Frenche pocques, because Galene the chiefe of phisicians neuer maketh mencion in al his bokes of any such disease. For this euell hath crept in, sence his tyme, through the noughtines of men. And although it were then, yet may it be that he neuer hearde of it. Hereunto

myght be added all suche sentences as by the lawe of nature are graffed in man. As these folowyng. Do as thou wouldest be done vnto. Be thankefull to hym, that doth the a pleasure. Honoure thy father, & thy mother. Know there is a God. He that hath not these opiniōs naturally fastened in his hart, he maie iustely bee thought rather a beast, then man endued with reason.
               In matiers of scripture I may reason both affirmatiuely, and negatiuely, Christ saith to his disciples. Rege
                        •
                      Gentium dominātur, vos autem non sic. Kinges beare rule ouer coūtreis, but you must not doo so. Therfore no ministres shoulde haue any temporall powre, because Christ saith so. Ye may reason negatiuely thus, we reade not in all the scripture frō 
                  Genesis to the reuelatiō of sainct Ihō, that euer there was frier, moncke, nonne, or chanon, ergo let them go frō whens they came. We reade not in ye scripture that worshipping of ymages, was euer allowed to be Laie mens bookes. Therefore, take down suche idolles, and let them

serue for other vses.
               The generall rule for prophane authorities. That whiche is allowed by al wise men, or at the leaste by the better part: no mā ought rashely to gaine saie it, or thus. Euery connyng man must be beleued in his owne art.
            
            
               ¶The maner of reasonyng.
               Aristotle thought best that dronkerds should haue double punishemēt. therfore they deserue it. By textes of the scripture we may better reason y• matter, as thus. Cursed be he that doth ye worke of the lord guilefully, saith the Prophete. Ergo euil Bishops, or loytering pastours are accursed of God.
            
            
               ¶Of the similitude, or likenesse.
               A Similitude, is when .ii. thinges or more, are so compared together, that euen as in the firste there is one propertie, so in the other there is a like propretie, accordyng to bothe their natures seuerally obserued. For like as water by continuance weareth a stone, so there is nothyng so hard, but by time it maie be compassed, or brought to passe. As spiders

make their own copwebbes without any other helpe: so some good felowes can bring vp newes & tel stran̄g tales without any hearyng, whē there is not one woorde true. As the palme tree beyng ouerlaide with weightes, riseth higher, & buddeth vpward more freshelye: so a noble stomake vexed with muche aduersite is euermore the s
                     •
                  outer. And this ought diligētly to be obserued yt the thing which is brought to make the Similitude, be like vnto that which is proued.
            
            
               ¶The maner of findyng out a similitude.
               In euery cause that we do purpose to hādle at large, we must obserue diligently, what thynges are spoken by translacion, that is, from the propre signification, to a meanyng that is not propre. As speakyng in the prayse of a Kyng, and callyug hym the bright son of the yearth, I may gather a similitude by this worde (sonne) and make it thus. Euen as the sonne onely geuet

               ¶The maner of reasonyng.

               ¶Of thynges compared.
               THinges are cōpared toguether in one thirde worde, whereūto they both do agre, as thus. If thefte be worthye death, then murther is worthy no lesse. Here ye se that thefte, & murther are cōpared together in one third worde, which is death.
               Comparacions are deuided twoo maner of waies, for either they bee equal, or not equall. They are equal in this wise. if the father haue aucthorite

ouer his sonne, he hath also aucthorite ouer his daughter.
            
            
               ¶The generall rule.
               Where thinges are equal, ther must nedes be equall Iudgement. Comparacions are vnequall, when I reason either fro
                     •
                   the greater to the lesse, or els from the lesse, to the greater. From the greater to the lesse, ye may reason thus. If a Capitain with his whole companie be not able to sacke a toune, muche lesse one base souldiour can be able to do it. The scholemaster cannot vnderstande the Greke, or the Hebrue toungue, muche lesse can the scholer, whiche neuer learned either of them.
               Frō the lesse, to the greater, ye may reason affirmatiuely, as thus. Children can suffre muche cold, and cannot young mē beare a frost? Custome beareth swynge, and shall reason take no place? Women haue died for there cō
                  trey, therfore may not mē be ashamed to feare death? Noble menne are desirous to haue a good horskeper that cā kepe their horses well, and they spare not to geue great stipendes to suche, &

shall thei not muche more be desirous, to haue a good scholmaster, that might Godly bryng vp their children, in vertue and wisedome? If a horse bee not well broken, the awner will se that he maie be made gentle: & shall not a man seyng his naturall child, euill brought vp, take paines, and se hym brought to some good order? We can se a spauain, a splent, a ring bone, or suche other disease in a horse, and shall we not be as ready to loke, that there bee no fautes in our childrē, or in the teacher, to whō we geue the charge, to bryng theim vp in learnyng, and good maners?
            
            
               ¶The generall rule.
               If that which semeth to be the greater, be not added, neither shalbe added, that whiche is the lesse. Again, if that, whiche is lesse be added, that which is greater, shalbe added also.
            
            
               ¶The maner of reasonyng.
               The scholer vnderstandeth Latine, ergo his scholemaster also hath knowlege in thesame toungue. Negatiuely thus. If God will not allowe a vowe,

made by the daughter, without the knowlege of her father, although the vowe bee but for one daie: how muche lesse shal that mariage take place, whē young folke make priuie contractes, without the good wil obteined of their parentes.
            
            
               ¶The vse.

               A repugnaunce, is suche a disagreyng state of thynges that no one thyng can be thesame, that thother is, by one nature, or substance, as thus. Manne, and vertue, the one cannot be the

               COntraries, are suche discordantes, as cannot be, at one, and thesame tyme in one substance: notwithstandyng, thei maie both seuerally be, in two subiectes, or substances
                     •
                   at one, and thesame time. As whitnes, blacknes, vertue, and vice, wisedome, and foolishnes. Contraries are two waies cōsidered, for some be suche that if one be not, the other must nedes folowe, and thei are called in Latine, Contraria immediata, that is to saie, contraries, where nothyng commeth betwixt: as thus. A wise man, a foole.

Uertue, vice. Faith, vnbelief. Al these are suche, that if the one bee not in a man, the other must nedes be. As thus. Such a one is wise, ergo he is no foole. If a man be not wise, it must nedes be, that he is foolishe. Wee are saued by faith: ergo we are cōdēned by vnbelief
               Again, other contraries be so, that though the one be awaie, yet the other foloweth not therfore of necessitie. For blacke, and white, be cōtrary, and yet thei be not so cōtrary, that if the white colour be not, the other must nedes be. For a manne maie be high coloured, or sallowe coloured, and yet not blacke. Therefore in suche contraries, where some thyng may be put betwixt the extremes, it is no good reason to say, that if the one be not, the other muste nedes be. Note further, that all discordantes are not cōtrary, accordyng to their generall worde, or common accidentes, but according to their proper differēce
                     •
                   For if we reason thus.
               
                  Fire is an Element.
                  Ergo water is none.
               
               The argument is not good, for fir
                     •
                  
                  
and water are not contrary, accordyng to their generall woorde, whiche agreeth to theim bothe, but accordyng to their proper differences, as in that, fire is hote and dry, it is contrary to water, whiche is colde and moyste. Thus some, that mainteined counterfeicte chastitie, were wont to reason against Mariage.
               
                  Uirginitie is good.
                  Therfore mariage is not good.
               
               Whereas Uirginitie, and mariage, are not contrary, accordyng to their generall woorde, whiche is (good) but accordyng to their proper difference. As thus.
               
                  Uirginitie is a single life, without knowlege of carnall acte.
                  Therefore mariage is not so.
               
               Therefore this worde (good) in the aboue rehersed argument, doth signify a thyng graunted of God, and alowed by his will, whiche doth aswell, comprehende mariage, as it doth virginitie therefore this argument, is of no more force, then if I should saie.
               
                  
                  Iustice is good.
                  Ergo temperance is not good.

               SEntēces gainsaiyng, are two proposicions, the one deniyng that, whiche the other affirmeth: as thus. Christ is in the Sacrament really: Christ is not in the Sacrament really. It cannot bee, but one of these two proposicions, must nedes be false.
            
            
               ¶The generall rule.
               If one of the twoo proposicions, be graunted to be true, the other must nedes be graunted to be false. Neither cā it be, by any meanes possible, that both of thē should either be true or false, at one, and thesame tyme. Alwaies prouided,

that there be no doubtfulnes in the wordes: for if one worde signifie diuersely, then maie bothe proposicions, be either true, or false, at one, and thesame tyme. As thus.

               If we be iustified frely, through the onely merites of Iesus Christe: Then this is false, that we are not iustified, onely through the merites of Iesus Christ: but the other is true: ergo this is false.

Either the soule is immortall, or els it is not immortall, but the first is true: ergo the second is false.
            
            
               ¶Of wordes differyng.
               THen haue wee the vse of this place, when we reason & proue that one thyng is not thesame. that another is, as thus. King Lud is not thesame, that Iulius Cesar, or Brutus was: Kyng Lud buylded London, of whom the citee had his name, beyng called Luddes toune, and afterwarde, by alteracion of letters, called London. Ergo neither Cesar, nor Brutus, builded thesame. Discordātes called opposita are not thesame that wordes differyng are, called differentia. For asmuche as where discordātes be
                     •
                   one thyng onely is set against another one. As for example. Nothyng can be set against brightnes, as discordant,

but onely darkenesse, nothyng cā be set against heate, but onely cold, and so in other. But in this place, there maie many thynges differ from some one thyng, and whatsoeuer is not thesame that another is, maie bee called a worde differyng, in Latine, differens, or disparatum. Socrates is a man, ergo he is not an ore, a stone, a horse or any other thyng els.
               Thynges differ foure waies, either by nombryng. As euery singuler man, diff

Lastly, wordes differ by their moste generals, whē thei are placed in diuerse predicamētes A kyng, manhod, thone is placed emōg

               We cannot make thynges, that doe muche differ, to be of one nature.
            
            
               ¶The maner of reasonyng.
               We reason from wordes differyng, negatiuely altogether.
               From suche as differ in nomber, we reason thus.
               Suche a one is called Thomas, therfore he is not thesame, that Ihon is. Peter is not Paule, nor yet Paule is Peter. Faithe is not woorkes, nor yet workes are faithe.
               From suche as differ in kynd, thus,
               I am a man, therefore I should not be vsed like a brute beast.
               Frō such as differ by ye general word.
               I did borowe plain clothe of the, & why doest thou require raysed veluet of me?
               From suche as differ in predicamēt.
               Uertue is a qualitie of the mynde, therfore it is no substance.
               AFter knowlege atteined, exercise is moste necessary. And happie shal he be, that vnto skill, addeth

practise, for then learnyng is best cōfirmed, when knowlege is put in vre.
               Therfore consideryng, I haue sette forthe the places, I thynke it necessarie after knowlege of the same, to describe matters by euery one of them, as thei lye in order: that other maye lykewyse, when anye question commeth in controuersie, go thorowe the places themselfes with it, and examine euery worde, by euery seueral place.
               And to make this thyng more plain, I wyll go through the places with one certaine worde, and loke what helpe I shall finde there for knowlege of the same. The worde shall be (a kyng) or (a Magistrate.)
            
            
               The definition.
               The definition of a magistrate. Euery Kyng, or magistrate, is the minister of god, for a good ende, to the punishynge of naughtye persones, and to the confortyng of godlye men.

               ¶Similitudes.
               That whiche the shepeherd is to the shepe, the same is the magistrate to his subiectes. That which the maister of the shippe, is to the ship, or the maister of an houshold, to his house, or the head to the whole bodie: the same is the magistrate to his subiectes.
            
            
               ¶Thynges compared.
               Seruauntes must be obedient and subiect to there maisters with all reuerence, as we reade in the scripture: howe muche more then should the subiectes be obedient to their kyng and souereigne

lorde, whiche by the ordinaunce of God, is appointed to rule, and to haue gouernaunce ouer them.
               Ye maie se by this one exāple, that the searchyng of places, ministreth argumentes plentifully. For if ye wyll proue a magistrate necessarie, ye maie reason from the definition, from the causes, from the authoritie, from the thyng conteynyng, from the adiacentes, from the similitude, and make good reasons for the purpose. Not withstandyng, I thynke it not necessarie that ye searche all the places at euerye tyme, and for euerye matter: but that ye searche moste parte of them. And although we cannot finde a good argument in euerie one of them, yet it is wel if we maie gather but thre or .iiij. good argumentes. As when we go into a gardyne, we shall not finde all herbes growing there, although we searche euery corner: so when we loke in all yt places of inuention for the profe of ou
                     •
                   matter, we shall not finde in euerie place a good argument for oure purpose. Not withstandyng it is moste necessarie,

either when we will proue a matter oure selfe, or els trie an others labour, which is set forth at large most eloquentlie: to bring the whole some of his long tale to these places, & make an argument in thre lynes of that, whiche he dilateth, into thre shietes.
               And for our selfe, if we wil reason a matter earnestlie, it shalbe profitable to see oure owne argumentes before hand deriued out of the places, the whiche shall make vs more bolde to speake, when we shall euidently perceiue oure owne reasons suerly groū
                  ded. And the better able we shalbe to confirme our owne cause, & to auoyde all obiections, when we knowe suerly by this arte, wherunto we maie leaue. For although other shall empece oure doynges, and wrest oure wordes, yet we shalbe able euermore to kepe oure owne, when we playnelie perceaue whereof oure argumēt hath his groūd Many speake wisely which neuer read logique, but to speke wisely with a iudgement, and to knowe the verie fountaine of thynges: that can none do, except

they haue some skill in this art.
               Therefore what diuersitie there is betwixt a blynd man, & hym that seeth, the same difference is betwixte a wise man vnlearned, and a wyse man learned. Ye haue sene the commoditie of this art by this one word (magistrate) which I dyd applie to euery place, that myght geue any light for the makyng of an argument. Nowe ye shall haue a question set forth, and both the partes of a proposition referred to the places of inuention, that thereby ye maie knowe wherein the places do agree, & wherein they do not. For where as the places agree (that is to saie, al thynges are referred to ye one, that are referred to the other) there the proposition is good, and the latter parte of the proposition, is truly spoken of the first. But where the places do not agree (that is to saie, some thynges are referred to ye one worde, that are not referred to the other) ther the thinges themselues can not agree. I will vse this question for an example. whether it be lawfull for a priest to marie a wyfe or no. And first

of all I will examine a Priest, aud applie hym to all the places. Next after that wee will refe

               The tyme.
               A younge woman, or an olde. Aristotle saith, it is mete for men to marye at .xxxvj. for maidens to marie at .xviij. but then was then, and now is now, al thynges in this worlde are ripe before there tyme. I meane not that honestie it self is so, for I neuer knew it ripe as yeat, but euer rawe. But thus ye see the time of mariage was not so hastely loked for, as it is now. In this worlde

a child shal scant be out of his shel, but he shalbe suer to one or other, y• which I doubte, whether it maye be called a mariage or no: for those that be of ripe yeres, no man doubteth, but if thei can agree both, & haue there frendes good wyll (for that ought to be sought for, and also obtained) the mariage is allowed before God.
            
            
               Wordes anne
                     ••
                  d or knitte together.
               Mariage is referred to this place, for a wife is so called, bycause the hath a housband, neyther can any woman be called a wife, except she haue an husband, therfore she is placed emonge the wordes annexed, that is, where one thynge is knitte to an other, so that the one cannot be, except the other be also.
               Nowe that we haue drawen these wordes, the preacher, and the wyfe, after this sort, through out the places, so far as we could: we shuld cōpare them together, and se wherein theido agree, and wherein they varie. Let vs compare the definitions together, and we shall finde sumwhat euen there, where these wordes be (desiryng to liue vertuously)

whiche shall gyue light for an argument, as thus.
               
                  Whosoeuer desireth to liue vertuously, must mary a wyfe.
                  Euery true preacher of gods word, desireth to liue vertuously
                  Ergo euery true preacher must mary a wife
               
               Now if mine aduersary wil deny the proposition at large, called the maior, then can I doe no good with it, except I finde somwhat in the definition of a wife, whiche is agreing to this aboue rehersed proposition. I finde in this worde (wife) that she is maried for the encrease of children, and to auoide fornication. Then I reason thus for the confirmation of my purpose by the argument called Sorites.
               
                  Whosoeuer desireth to liue vertuously, desireth to auoyd fornication.
                  Whosoeuer desiereth to auoyde fornication, desiereth mariage.
                  Ergo whosoeuer desiereth to lyue vertuously, desiereth mariage.
               
               
                  Againe the generall worde of bothe these definitions gyueth light for an argument. Euery wyfe is a woman, euery preacher is a man, and nature hath ordeyned that man and woman may liue in mariage, (if they be so disposed) of what degre, cōdition, or state, so euer they be, nothyng in all the scriptures to the coutrarye. Therfore I may reason thus.
               
                  What soeuer is a man, that same may marie a woman by gods ordinaunce.
                  Euery preacher is a man.
                  Ergo euery preacher may marie a woman by gods ordinaunce.
               
               Euen as I haue doen in these places, comparynge one to an other, so ye may doe in the residew, and where ye se any thyng serueth for your purpose, that they agre together on bothe parties, ye maye vse the same: if they do not agre in some places, ye may refuse them, or els so mollyfye the thyng that suche repugnauncies maye not harme your cause at all. As where it is in the wordes adioyned that a womā is often

Nowe I wil entre into the other places which doe not seuerally handle one word, but haue respecte euermore to an other, and so by the knittyng together of .ij. thyngs, or setting the one against the other, the trueth of oure purpose is espied, and the cause confirmed.
            
            
               From the similitude.

               From authoritie.
               If the greate workeman of thynges god almightie himselfe after the floud being reconciled to man made this law (as we reade in scriptures) that men shulde not liue single, but encrease and be multiplied, that the yearth might be filled: and seyng also that Christe himselfe sence that time hath allowed mariage by a miracle of chaungyng water into wine, which miracle was the first that he dyd vpon yearth: and seynge Paule also biddeth euery man that cā
                  not liue chaste, to marie, and that it is better to marye, then to burne in filthie desires, and besides this willeth a bishop should be the husbande of one wife: it muste nedes be that preachers may lawful marye, aswel as any other temporal men.
            
            
               From comparison of the lesse, to the greater.
               It is a shame to se brute beastes obey the lawe of nature, and man, especiallye a learned man, and a preacher, like a stoute giaunt to striue with nature, & do contrarye to her biddyng.
            
            
               
               From the greater to the lesse.

               Of discordantes.
               Ye maye reason from the contrarye thus, if virginitie be a thyng geuen to aungels and almost aboue mans reach, than mariage is a thynge propre to man.
            
            
               From the Priuation.
               If the lacke of children be a thynge hateful to man, than the hauing of children is a thyng ioyful to man.

               ¶From wordes differyng
               That worde is called a differyng worde, whatsoeuer it is, whiche is not the same, that an other is. As thus. A preacher is a man. Ergo he is no God. Priestes be men as other men be, and that some maried men

That is to saie, of contraries, there is one maner of doctrine, for he, whiche can handsomly set furth a lion. in his shape & portraicture, maie iudge with reason a Lion euill fauouredly painted, and can with litle difficultie, shewe the faultes in euery parte. so in like maner, if one can make an argument, accordyng to the rules aboue rehersed, in his due fourme and mode, he can tell also, when an argument is other wise made then the rules cā beare
            To some men, these places of crafte that folowe, maie seme straunge, and yet euen in waightie matters, the wicked haue deriued their subtle defences, from these deceiptfull corners. Therfore, because suche places, maie the rather be auoyded, and better knowen, I will bothe set them furthe at large, and also teache aswell as I am able, how to confute them. And first to confute, is nothyng els but to Iudge false packyng, and to vnlose by reason, thynges knit together by craft. Therefore the Logician, if he will doo his parte, muste not onely fence hymself, for confirmacion

of his awne cause, but must also ouerthrow, the assercion of other, and also by reasō, proue their saiynges to be false, whiche by deceipte, would inueigle the weake.
            
               ¶The maner of confutacion twoo waies considered.
               For the firste, either we purpose by disputacion, to answere fully to the matter, or els secondly (if power want to compasse that) wee seke some other meanes, to satisfie the manne, and that thre maner of waies, either by makyng the obiecciō seme lesse then it is, or by bryngyng some other example against it, or els by sekyng some meanes, to go from the matter.
               We make the argument appere slē
                  der, whē we receiue it laughyngly, and declare by wordes, euē at the first, that it is nothyng to the purpose, and so abashe the opponent.
               Again, we turne another argument in our aduersaries necke, when wee bryng another exāple against hym. Or els when wee charge hym, with a like faute, and laye some greater matter in

his dishe. Lastly, we shift awaie, from the violence of our aduersarie, by makyng some digression, or geuyng occasion of some other talke, whereby the aduersary, either is driuē to forget his argumēt, or els beyng blynded with to muche matter, is forced either to go no further, or els to thynke hymself content. In all whiche maner of confutation, when we purpose to put a man to silence, I would wishe greate moderation to be vsed, and as litle aduantage takē by suche meanes, as may be possible. For although it be a poore help (as in deede it is none other) yet many a mā loseth his estimacion, by muche vsyng of suche fashiōs. It is a world to se the subtle brain, of many braggyng bodies whiche with bold countenaunce, beare an outward shadowe of wisedome, hauyng onely the maskyng visage, & lackyng the naturall face. Thei wil stand stoutly in maintenance of an vntruth, and with countenaunce seme to shewe it: yea, and by their bold bearyng it out almoste perswade the hearers, that thei onely haue the true parte, and that other,

are altogether deceiued. Thei wil saie, that no wise manne, would ones thinke that for shame, whiche their aduersarie, vttereth without all shame, yea, thei will saie, he speaketh too too baby shelye, and so dashe hym out of countenaunce, that he shall not well knowe what to saie, and last of all, thei wil trifle and toye merely, and so with imp

                  dēt laughyng
                     •
                   make the other past speakyng. I will not putte any in this memento, as though thei ware gyltie: but their awne doynges, shall put in theimselfes, on Goddes name, for me. Notwithstandyng, I would gladly wish (as I said before) that there ware a measure vsed, and then suche doynges, might better be borne.
               We answere to the matter, ij. wayes, either generally, or particularly. A generall answere is made thre wayes. First, whē the faute is in the matter, that is to saie, in the wordes of either proposicion, when thei signifie diuerse thynges, or be diuersly applied, to shewe it plainly: & either denie it a
                     •
                   folishe, or els dissolue it, as doubtfull.

As thus, the libertiues reason.
               
                  What soeuer is naturall, that same is not euill.
                  To synne is a thyng naturall.
                  Ergo to synne is not euill.
               
               The seuerall or seconde proposicion is not true. And therfore the argumēt i
                     •
                   false, in the matter it self. For God did create the nature of man, pure and cleane, and saied, that all was good, whiche he made, at the firste creacion. Neither was it Goddes will, that mā should altre his commaundement, and swarue from the pathe, of his appoynted lawes, but rather the suggestion of the deuill, and the weakenesse of oure fleshe, brought man to helle, death and dampnacion.
               Again, when the faulte appereth in the forme, and maner of makyng an argument, we must declare that it is not framed
                     •
                   accordyng to the rules, whiche require that euery argument, should bothe be in mode and figure, as I haue before sufficiently declared. As thus.
               
                  
                  All Magistrates do reuenge
                        •
                     
                  
                  Euery bold hardy man doth reuenge
                  Ergo euery bold hardy man, is a Magistrate.
               
               This argument, beyng made in the second figure, is of no force, cōsideryng it is in no mode, of thesame figure. For in this figure, all the proposicions, doo not affirme altogether, but one of thē euer doth deny, as it appereth plainly, to hym that list to se.
               Thirdly, when the fault is bothe in the matter, & in the maner of makyng, we must refuse the argument, & shewe the faultes plainly. As thus.
               
                  Euery slaughter, is synne.
                  Euery adulterie is synne.
                  Ergo euery adultry is slaughter
               
               First the faulte is, that slaughter is not well defined. For in warre tyme, it is lawfull to kill, and euery man maie stand in his awne defence, against violent robbers, and rather kill then bee killed. Thirdly, the argument is in no mode
                     •
                   although it be in the secōd figure
               The particular auoydyng of an argument,

is .v. waies vsed, either by declaryng in what deceipfull subtiltie, it is conteined, or from which of the places, it is wrōgfully deriued, or to shewe the wrong framyng, in euery mode and figure, or to make an argument, with a like reason, and so to auoyde the cause, or last of all, to vse the strange deceiptfull places, which shalbe last rehersed.
               And now will I tell particularly, euery deceiptfull argument, that whē suche a subtle argumēt shalbe vsed, either in disputacion, or priuate talke: any one may espie the fault out of hāde and shewe in whiche of these capcious reasons, the subteltie resteth.
               And first, a false conclusion, is a deceipte vsed in an argument, whereby one vnder the colour of truth, goeth aboute, to inuegle the hearer, or thus, a false conclusion is an argument, apperyng to the ignorant, as though it wer true, and yet is nothyng true at all. Aristotle doth deuide them into two partes. Some be called deceiptfull argumentes, when a doubtfull worde is vsed, or the kynd of speache is straunge,

and maie be taken two waies, and that the fault is rather in the kynd and maner of speakyng, then in the matter or very thyng it selfe. Therefore those yt be good grāmarians, and know the properties of wordes, and are skylfull in the tongues, can gailie wel solute such errors as be made by the mystakyng of wordes, or by false vnderstandyng of phrases, whereof in verie deade manie heresies, and muche false doctrine haue had there first beginnyng. There be agayne some craftie subtilties whiche are not in the worde, but rather spring either of the euel knittyng together of the propositions, or els of the confusion of thynges, that is to saye, when one thyng is falsely appointed for an other, as in this proposition, a man maie easely espie false packyng whiche is in the second figure.
               
                  Fes
                  No synne doth beget a man.
                  ti
                  Cōcupiscēce doth beget a mā
                  
                  no.
                  Ergo concupiscence is no syn
               
               The seconde proposition although it may deceiue a man, that is not ware, yet is it altogether false, because nature

which is a thyng ordeyned of god, doth begette man, not the wicked impotencie or rather the destruction of nature, which afterward followed. Here it is playne that a mingle mangle is made of thynges, when generation which should be attributed to nature, is referred to the cōcupiscence, because it is in nature, and next adioynyng vnto it.
               Nowe for the nombre and deuidyng of these deceiptfull argumentes, it is to vnderstande, that there be .xiij. whereof syx are called subtilties in the worde, or maner of speakyng, and the other .vij. ar called subtilties, without the worde, when thynges be confounded, and one taken for an other.
            
            
               ¶Deceitpfull argumentes.
               In the worde are these folowyng.
               
                  1. The doubtfulnesse of a worde.
                  2. The double meanyng of a sentence

                     e.
               
               
                  ALl these names be comprehended vnder this one worde (doubtefull) notwithstandyng Aristotle setteth forth diuerse waies, that he maie shewe the differēce of these doubtful thynges. For some argumentes haue the doubte in a worde signifiyng diuersly, some in the propretie o
                     •
                   the phrase, some in the ioyning together of wordes, and some other in the deuidyng, and displacyng of the same, as it shall appere more playnlie in the handelyng of these places seuerallye. Homonumia, whiche maie be called in english, the doubtfulnes of one worde, when it signifieth diuersly, is a maner of subtiltie, when the deceipt is in a worde that hath mo significations then one. And the reason is, that suche argumentes are not good, because there are foure termes in the two propositions, for the double repete, sygnifieth one thyng in the first proposition, and an other thyng in the seconde proposition. Therefore nothyng is proued in the cō
                  clusion, when suche doubtfull wordes are placed in a proposition. And therefore

when suche a subtiltie is espied, a man maie denie the cō

                  i.
                  Ergo God the Father is one that hath a substance of flesh bloud, bones, sinues, and veines.
               
               I aunswere: This knittyng is not good, and therefore I deny the whole. The reason is, because it is a subtiltie of a doubtful word
                     •
                  , for in the first proposition, the arme is considered to be such a one, as a mā hath, but in the second Proposition it is not so ment, for

                  t signifieth by a Metaphore the powre, strength, or might of God.

                  Ergo God is ye aucthor of sinne.
               
               I denie the consequent. Because their is doubtfulnes in this worde euill: for in the first Proposition euill doth signifie, the euill of punishement, as wee call cōmonly all calamitie, euil, and al punishemēt euil, which are not sinne: & in the second Proposition, euil doth signifie offence, & all naughtines that is committed. Therefore the seconde Proposition is not agreeyng with the first, and therfore the argument is not good.
            
            
               ¶The second subtiltie, called Ambiguitas.
               The Ambiguitee, is, when the construction bringeth errour, hauyng diuerse vnderstandinges in it, as when the woordes be placed doubtfully, as thus. Craesus halim penetrans magnam peruertet opum vim. Cresus going ouer the floude halim, shal ouerthrow a great empire. Here is not mē

hath, where as if the Argument ware true, there shoulde be none other faith considered in the second Proposition, then was rehersed, and mencioned in the first Proposition. I haue laboured the rather at large, to make this matter more plaine to the ignoraunt, not that it so muche neded, for the euasion is easie of it selfe, and this Argument is of no greater weight, then the other aboue rehersed were.

                  DIsiunctio coniunctorum, is a diuidyng of thynges whiche should be ioyned together, & a makyng of wordes seueral, or els a disseuering of .ij. partes, which should be but one. for like as by the other place, wordes are ioyned together whiche shoulde be diuided, so now by this place, that thing is diuided, which should be all one.
               
                  The Lawe and the Gospel are two diuerse thinges.
                  The worde of God is the Law and the Gospel.
                  
                     Ergo, the worde of God is two diuerse thynges.
               
               In this Argument (the woorde of God) beyng a whole thyng of it selfe, is diuided, and where respecte shoulde be had to the two partes ioy

                  tely considered together, whiche are nothyng els but the whole: the partes are seuerally vnderstanded, and referred to the whole, not both together as they shoulde bee, but seuerally with their pro
                     •
                  erties, as they shoulde not be. For the worde of God is not the Law onely, or the Gospell onely, although it stand of these two, but is the Law and the Gospell both ioyned together: for where as a man is made of bodie and soule, the bodie is not man, nor yet the soule neither, and yet they both ioyned together, make vp a perfect man.
            
            
               ¶An other example.
               
                  The articles of our faith, are .xij. in nombre,
                  To beleue in God the Father, and in Iesus Christ his only sonne, are the articles of our faith.
                  
                     Ergo to beleue in God the Father, and in Iesus Christ his onely sonne, are .xij. in nombre.
               
               This Argument is to be denyed, because the doubtfulnes riseth of the diuision, for, to beleue in God the Father, & in Iesus Christ his only sonne, are the Articles of our faith, and yet they .ij. are not the whole .xij. in nōber. Therefore they two beyng of the .xij. are wronglie placed if they be diuided into .xij. Aagain there be .iiij. endes, or termes. for in the first Propositiō, this part (the articles of our faith) comprehend the .xij. in nomber, but in the second Proposition this part (to beleue in God and in Iesus Christe) do not comprehend all the articles, but twoo onely, therfore it is an euil Argument.
               This kynd of Argument is vsed often times of those, which by reporting an other mans labour, and his wel doyng, depraue the same, either by addyng, or diminishyng the same, as by takyng a piece of a sentēce out of some Doctour, & applieng it for there purpose, or by adding more then they find,

as both diuines & lawers often times full vngodly haue done, not regarding the whole course, & order of the thing, but takyng out patches and pieces to serue their vngodly purposes, whiche in dede, made nothynge for thē, neither they them selues do vnderstand, what they bryng, when they doo not marke the whole course of the matter. The Romishe, reason thus.

                  Therefore kepyng the commaundementes, purchaseth heauen.
               
               This Argument is false by leauyng the best out, for the doctrine of the gospell must first be had, our faith must be fastened, and Christ must sanctifie our doinges, before they can be good. Neither is any thyng good because we do it, but because it pleaseth god so to accept it. It is true, he yt doth wel, shall haue well, but who is he? euen ye same bodie, whiche first beleueth in Christ, & apprehendeth mercie by faith, whose workes God accepteth for good, other wise he shall neuer come where God

is. Therfore espie the subtilties of the vugodlie, and flye there fraude.

                     •
                   called otherwise in good Latine Forma orationis, the maner of the speche, is whē the phrase bredeth errour, and the propertie of the tounge not well knowen, engendreth ambiguite, as in the .viij. Chapiter of Math. When Christ bad those which were healed of the leprosy: Go & shew thēselfes to the Priest, our forfathers applied this saiyng to confession, thinkyng that euery one was bonde in conscience vnder payne of damnation, to confesse his sinnes to the priest euerye yere ones, whereas Christes meanyng was nothynge so, & therfore they ware moche deceyued in the maner of speakyng. This order was in the olde lawe as we maye read in Leuiticus, that lepers came not into the towne, but if any happened to be whole, and amended, he was first commaunded to shew him selfe to the priest, that the curate seing his bodie cleane, might be a witnesse to

the parishe of his amendement, and so the man after that, might the rather be suffered to go abrode, and be in company with other men.
               But euen as they haue fondely wrested this place to confession, euen so might light women, and euil disposed wyues, abuse their husbandes fondely, expoundyng sainct Paules wordes in the .vij. of the first, to the Corinthians, where he saith. The wife is bonde to the lawe, as longe as her husbande lyueth, but if her husbande slepe, she is at lybertie to marie wyth whome she wyll. God forbidde, women shoulde take this aduauntage of theyr husbandes slepyng, as the Romish folke haue abused all men wakyng. Slepe in this texte, signifieth nothyng but death, and yet, might women aswell abuse this texte, as other mē haue abused christes saiyng, for the maintenaunce of confession. Therfore the propretie of euery speche, and the maner of speakynge ought alwaies to be obserued: we say in Englishe some time, to some one with whom we are offended, Ah sirrha ye are

an honeste man indede, and yet we do not meane that he is honest indede, but thinke rather that he is a naughty fellowe. So likewyse, Christe when he should be taken of the Iewes saide to his Apostles, Dormite & requiescite, slepe one syrs, and take your rest, not that he would they should so do, but to ther rebuke and shame he spake it, because they were careles, and toke there rest. So Paule rebukyng the Corinthians, bycause thei made heathen men their iudges, and pleaded there causes vnder them, said, if there be no body emonge you to heare your owne causes, make vile persons and abiectes, to be Iudges emōgst you. Not that he wold it shoulde so be, but to their shame, he spake it, as he saith hymselfe. Also vnto this place maye be referred the kynd of phrase propre to euery tonge. As where it is in the gospell. Non exibit, donec vltimum quadrantem soluerit, he shal not go out, vntil he hath payd the las

                  e farthyng, this sentence doth not signifie a condition, but it signifieth that he he shall neuer come out at al. Therfore

those that be ignoraunt in the tonges are easely deceyued: Likewyse in Mathewe we reade. Qui dixerit verbum aduersus spiritum sanctum nō remittetur ei, neque in hoc seculo neque in 
                        •
                     uturo. He that shal speake a worde against the holy ghost shall not be forgeuen nether in this world, nor yet in the worlde to come, that is to say, he shall neuer be forgeuen. Although the papistes referre this place to purgatory, most vainely and vnlearnedly. The accent causeth ambiguite, by reason of the affinitie in wordes, as when one hath lost al the money in his purse, and for lacke of coyne is fayne to holde the candel: for an other man when he seeth the same bodie doe his duetie with his cappe of, to his better, to say merely by the waye of a sute to the worthiest person: I praye you syr let this good fellowe be couered, he is bare, where as bare signifieth a bare purse: aswell as a bare heade, and is properlye so sayde. Againe and moste aptely this subtiltie taketh place, when sentences be euill pointed, and the sense therby

depraued, as some that mainteine iustification by workes, haue straūgely abused a texte of sainct Augustine, making the point plaine, whereas it shuld be an interrogatiue, and hath bene of late yeres so founde in an olde writen hand. The sentence is this. Qui fecit te sine te, nō potest seruare te, sine te? he that made the without the, can not he saue the, without the? whereas, makyng it a playne point in latine, it hath a cleane contrarie vnderstandyng, and maketh muche for the maintenance of false religion. for it is asmuche, as who should saye: he that made the, without the, cānot saue the, without the. Moreouer, wordes spoken by imitation, that is to saye, whan one reherseth that whiche an other man saith, muste diligently be obserued. Paule writyng to the Collossiens sheweth the noughtines of some men that will kepe simple folke in subiection with there traditions, and trouble the consciences of the weake, saiyng, do not touche, do not tast, do not handle meate, which Paule reciteth, in rebuke to the hypocrites &

Thus farre haue I handled these subtile argumentes, which are in the wordes, nowe wyll I reherse all such false cōclusiōs as are in the matter.

The other subtilities aboue rehersed maye either be aduoyded by well markynge the true definition, or els hauyng respecte to the diuision, by declaryng seuerally howe large euerye worde maye be taken, and what errour

               ¶The first deceipt.
               
                  FAllacia accidentis, the deceipt fulnesse of the accident, is whē diuerse thynges are ioyned to gether, in one subiecte, that is to saie, when one, and thesame thyng,

is referred bothe to the substance, and also to the accident, or els, when the accidētes (which are not of the very substaunce of man, but maie be awaie, the man liuyng still,) are not well ioyned together, or els, when we make our argument ab euentis, that is to saie, by that thyng, whiche happeneth to a man casually, and pronounce thesame, to be the very proper cause, why, and wherfore, this or that is so. Of the first, this maie be an example.
               
                  That same whiche fleshe is, bread is not.
                  Fleshe is foode,
                  Therefore bread is none.
               
               In the firste proposicion, I vnderstand the substance of fleshe, and in the seconde proposicion, I meane the accident or propertie, whiche is in theim bothe, and therfore myne argument is not lawfull. because I referred, bothe the substance and the accident, to one, and to thesame subiecte. For although fleshe and breade, be not all one in substance,

because fleshe is one thyng, and bread is another, and either of thē hath their proper beyng, & distinct substāce: yet thei agree bothe in their accident, that is to saie, in foode, to serue for the sustenaunce of man.
               
                  No synne must be committed,
                  Wicked men, euen when thei execute Iustice, do synne.
                  Therefore, wicked men muste doo no Iustice, beyng set in aucthoritie.
               
               The first proposiciō is true, and the seconde also, for what soeuer is not of faithe, thesame is sinne. Neither can any thyng be wel, how soeuer it semeth in our iyes, except our faith be first fastened vpon the free mercie of Christ. Therfore the Iewes, how soeuer

                   liue, kepyng order, obseruyng lawes, forbearyng riot, yet all their doynges, are nothing but sinne, whatsoeuer thei do, seme it neuer so honest, or Godly, to the sight of man. And yet this argumēt is not truely lapte vp. For in the firste

proposiciō, (synne) is not considered by hymself, and therefore it is truly said, that no synne muste be committed. In the second 
                     •
                  roposicion, where execuciō of Iustice, is reported to be synne, it is not so of it self, but because the person is euill hymself, whiche executeth the Lawe, and therefore the offence commeth casually, and as the Logicians saie, per accidens, where as synne before was considered, accordyng to the substaunce. And therefore, though the officer beeyng naught, offendeth when he ministreth Iustice, (because faithe maketh al workes good) yet must he do iustice, because it is so cōmaunded, euen as he must assuredly beleue, that Iesus is the Messias, and the promised sauior sent of God. And though the doyng be euill to hym, yet it is good to other.
               Again, thus reason some.
               
                  By faithe we are iustified.
                  Faithe is a worke.
                  Ergo by workes we are iustified.
               
               This proposicion is false, consideryng that faithe, in the first proposiciō,

is thesame, through whiche we are iustified, not by the worthines of our beleuyng, but through the free mercie of Christ, the whiche we apprehende thorowe faithe. And therefore we must in this saiyng consider, that faithe is referred by relacion to Christe, through whom onely, al mercie is atteined, and that grace commeth, not because faith is a worke, but because mercy goth before, and receiueth frely all beleuers, without worthines either of beleuyng or els of doyng any other worke. Therfore in the first proposicion, faith beyng not so taken, as it is in the seconde, we maie saie well, it spryngeth frō this deceiptful place, & is therfore not lawful
            
            
               ¶Another argument.
               
                  This man is a wittie felowe,
                  This same man is lame,
                  Ergo this same mā hath a lame witte.
               
               This is euident false, because the accidentes of the body, are referred to the substaunce of the mynd, as by this last argument, ye maie see that lamenesse,

whiche is of the body, is attributed to the mind, and the reason is vain.
               The thirde deceipte is, when many thinges are referred to one subiect, we make that to be the very next and chief cause, whiche is a casuall thyng, and cōmeth by hap vnto any body as thus.
               
                  Dauid is a blessed man.
                  Dauid is an adulterer.
                  Ergo adulterers are blessed men
               
               I deny the consequēce, because it is a deceiptfull argument, by that, which is the accident. For when many thynges chaunce to one manne, we must se what are the very causes of that thyng whiche wee attribute to the subiecte. Dauid is a blessed mā. And wherfore? Not because he was an adulterer, for that happened to hym casually, but because he was chosen of God, and had the feare of God before his iyes, and although this happened by the instinct of the deuill, yet he called for grace, repented sore, and trusted in Gods mercie, as the Psalmes plentifully be are witnesse, and this was the cause, why

                  
                     •
                  e was blessed.
               Ye must obserue, that in this deceiptfull argument, although many thynges, are referred to one subiect, yet are thei not after one sorte, comprehended in thesame subiect, but diuersly considered, as whē I ioyne accidentes, bothe of body, and mynd together, as thus.
               
                  This felowe is a singyng man,
                  This felowe is blynd.
                  Ergo he is a blind singyng man.
               
               Here ye maie se the accidētes of the mynd and body, ioyned together, whiche should not be so.
            
            
               ¶The Anabaptistes reason thus.
               
                  That whiche is nothyng, deserueth no punishement.
                  Synne is nothyng.
                  Ergo synne deserueth no punishment.
               
               In the first proposiciō, that thyng is ment, whiche is not at al, but is cleane gone frō nature, or els neuer was with in the nature of thynges. In the secōde

proposiciō, (synne) is to bee reported to bee nothyng, because it self beyng nothyng worthe, spoyleth a man of his other vertues, and so ouerthroweth nature, asmuche as it can. When we se a man blynde, we iudge that he hath lost his sight, herein we esteme the sight, to be a gift geuen of God, and blyndnesse to bee the taker awaie of that, whiche was geuen of God. In like case, synne is the destruccion of that, whiche was, beyng of it self nothyng. And so in this case, to dooe well, is a thyng, the want wherof, is nothyng, the whiche, is sin.

               This argumēt is from the particular, to the vniuersall, the which is easy

to be aduoyded. Therefore errors doo often chaunce, when we comprehende the whole, speakyng onely of the part, or when we make the signe, to bee the very self thyng, and although ye haue had childishe examples before, onely to make the matter plain, ye shall se that in weightie matters, this deceiptfull argument hath been vsed.

                   and are neuer suspected nowe a dayes for adulterie beyng yoked in lawfull mariage: But some spare not to saye agayne, that they haue made an exchauge, leauyng vp whoredome, and folowyng couetousnesse, the deuell and al: marie God forbidde that all priestes should so do. And in dede if anye one should so reason, I would recken hys argument to be comprehended within

the compasse of this false conclusion. Thus reason the Anabaptistes.
               
                  Unrighteousnes is altogether reproued.
                  In euerie kyngdome is muche vnrighteousnes vsed.
                  Ergo euery kyngdome is altogether reproued.
               
               By this meanes we shall haue no kyngdome, no lawe, no political order, no trade, no discipline, no iudgement for offendours. But this argument is to be reiected, because it is deryued frō the part, to the whole. For although many thynges be amisse in a politicall bodie, yet the whole therfore must not be dissolued, the lawes must not be abrogated, nor yet good order abādoned: for the chiefe thynge that is in euerie empire is a thing, ordeined of God, and a righteous thyng, as for an example. Political order, lawes, statutes, Iudgement, execution, and punyshyng offendours, and therefore they reason amisse, that saye there is an abuse in a politicall ordre, therefore we shal haue no order at all in anie common weale, &

agayne ye shall perceyue, that there is more in the conclusion, then was rehersed in the two former propositions. Therfore we ought diligently to note the circumstaunce of the thyng, if we will auoyde this subtiltie, and when a thyng is spoken in parte, we must not thereby iudge the whole: or measure ye vniuersall, by that whiche is comprehended vnder the generall.
               
                  A man maye forsake an adulterouse wyfe.
                  Ergo he maie forsake his wyfe.
               
               This is from the inferior to the vniuersall, whiche is not well gathered, as it standeth here: for although a man maie forsake his wife, beyng naught of her bodie, yet maye he not forsake an honest woman, when it liketh hym to change. for this worde (wife) in the first proposition, is hedged with her circū
                  stance, that is to say, aduoutry, whiche causeth diuorcement. Neither is this argument good, the Kyng maie put to death euery euill man, Ergo the kyng maie put to death euery man. Againe if we will reason negatiuely, as we dyd

before affirmatiuelie, we shall frame our argument amisse. As thus.
               
                  No wife should be put awaie.
                  Ergo neither a naughty wife should be put awaie.
               
            
            
               ¶Agayne.
               
                  No wyne is euell
                  Ergo no myngled wyne is euell.
               
               This is from the vniuersal, to that which is inferior, and as ye would saie hedged with his circūstance, & compassed with that, whiche before, was neither in wife, nor yet in wine. For a wife so lōg as she kepeth her self to her husband only, she is no aduoutresse. Wine that drinketh of itself, is not myngled, and therfore the argument is not good because that thyng is in the lesse, or inferior, whiche was not in the generall.
               There is a figure in Rethorick, called Hiperbole, that is to saye, when a thyng is spoken beyond measure vncrediblie, and yet is not so largely ment. As when I wyll prayse a man for hys strēgth, I wil say, he passeth Hercules in manhode, meanyng that he excelleth

in manhode and valeauntnes. If we knowe one that ronneth well, eyther dogge, man, or horse, we vse to saye, he is as swifte as a swallowe, he flieth like an arrowe out of a bowe, meanyng onely that he is excedyng swifte. Therfore we must diligētly take hede, when such speches are vsed, that we take not them as they be spoken, but as they are ment, neyther take the whole for the part, when the whole is expressed in wordes, and the part ment in vnderstandyng. Ieremie saieth.

                     
                        Scio domine quod non est hominis via eius.
                     
                     I knowe Lorde that man hath not his waie.
                     Therefore man hath no fre will at al, no aduise, no choise, to deliberate either this waie, or that waie.
                  
This consequent is not good, for Ieremias saiyng, muste be vnderstande exclusiuely. The waie of man, that is to saye, the callyng of man, is not only ruled or led by the powre, strength, or force of mā, neither can he do any thing of himselfe alone, without the helpe or

grace of god. Sennacherib that wicked kyng, thought by his own powre and wisdom, to wynne his spurres against Ierusalem, but he trusted so muche to himselfe, & hys owne wisdome, that he lost his bootes & al, at lēgth. The chief and principal cause of all godly actiōs, procede from God, but so not withstandyng do they procede, that man hath choise, wil, and libertie, to do what him liketh, beyng assisted with the grace of God. As Christ prayseth the labourer and saith. To him that hath, shalbe geuen. And Chrisostome saieth verie well. God draweth vnto hym, but he draweth the willing. For god wil haue our good wil, to be ioyned with his callyng. Therfore Plato in his .iiij. booke where he framed his cōmō weale, doth well mitigate this Hiperbola, in this sentence whiche semeth credible (God doth al thynges, & orders euery action) saiyng, I do wel allowe this sentence, that God ruleth al thynges, but so not withstandyng I allowe it, if it be well vnderstād. For it ware best to grounde it so, that mans will, labour, and diligence,

must be ioyned thereunto, as we se in sailyng vpon the sea, Shipmen cal to God for helpe, and God will helpe them, but so not withstandyng, if they helpe them selfes. Accordyng wherunto there is in the fables of Esope a tale of one, whose cart stode fast in the myre, whiche man seyng his cart laied faste, cried to Hercules for helpe, and praied that he might come from heauē: answer was made, that he should first helpe himself, & then cal vpō Hercules, or els his cart were like to stick fast stil.
            
            
               ¶An other argument.
               
                  The churche doth not erre.
                  The Phariseis are the churche.
                  Ergo the Phariseis do not erre.
               
               The disceipt is, from the particular to the vniuersall. As who should saie, some do not erre in the churche, Ergo no bodie doth erre at all, that be of the churche: which is false, for the churche is as wel of the euel as of the good. The good men that are trayned in the truth of God, and taught the true loue of God, by ofte readyng and folowyng

his worde, haue the true lyght & erre not: Other that be slouhtfull, careles, brouned in ambition, and all wordlie luste, both can erre, and do erre, from tyme to tyme. Therefore where as I saie, the church doth not erre, it is called Synecdoche, that is to saye, when the part is vsed for the whole.
            
            
               An other argument made by the Anabaptistes.
               
                  To the iust, ther is no law sett.
                  The riotouse soune after his conuersion, is iust.
                  Ergo vnto him there is no law sette.
               
               This argumēt is frō the part to the whole: he is deliuered frō the lawe, for somuch as perteineth to his condemnation, but he is not fre for so muche as belōgeth to the due obediēce, which he oweth vnto God: for this order stā
                  deth for euer most stedfastly, that euery creature be obedient to God the creatour. Again for asmuch as in euery iust man that is conuerted from his euill waies there remaineth a wycked inclination,

                     〈2 pages duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
                  
the same must alwayes be bride led and kepte in, euen with the terrour of the lawe, as thoughe it ware with a mouserolle.

                  Ergo it is saint George himself.
               
               This argumēt men haue vsed, when they haue seen a man painted in a wal, or grauen in a stone, as thus. This is sainct Christopher, this is sainct Loy. This is the picture of Christ, Ergo it is Christe. This is an Image of oure Ladye, Ergo it is oure Ladye, and here she wyll worke wounders. more than in an other place, as she dyd at walsingham, at Boston, at Lincoln, at Ipswiche, and I cannot tell where, when priestes gatherd monye, & poore folkes ware mocked. here, ye must denie the consequēt, bycause the signe is not the thing signified, neither is god boūd to any place, to the whiche he hath not bound hym selfe by his worde, nor yet and saint neither.

               An other argument.
               
                  
                  Some young men, when thei come tother landes, fal to vnthriftines.
                  Ergo riches are not good.
               
               In all suche argumentes, wherei

                     •
                   and the naughty inclination of the man whiche abuseth suche thynges is to be rebuked: and therfore whē it is otherwise, it may be said, that a cause which is not, is put for a cause. As some abuse Paules meanyng, when they go about to depraue philosophie.
               
                  Paule warneth that we should not be deceaued by philosophie.
                  Ergo Philosophie is naught, say some.
               
               The argument doth not folowe, for a good thyng may be much abused, and yet the thynge it selfe may not be altogether reiected as naught: therfore Paule doth not condemne demonstrations and principles whiche are assured truthes, taught by the sciences, as in arithmeticke .iiij. and .iiij. make .viij. In philosophie. The whole is greater

then the parte, do as thou woldest be done vnto, but he reproueth the abuse of sciences, when there is made a mingle mangle of them, and one confounded with an other, as some haue sayde that philosophie wil teache a christian, asmuche for his profession, as all the Prophetes and the whole Bible besides wyll doe: this made Paule byd men take hede, that they be not deceaued by philosophie.
               Now a dayes they wyll saye. I cannot tell, here is is muche preachynge, muche teachyng of godes worde, but I see fewe folowers of it, it was a better worlde when we had not halfe so many preachers, heresies were neuer more ripe, naughtinesse neuer more abounded, therfore gyue vs the olde learnyng again, and take you the new.
               This reason is not worthy a strawe, The wickednes of the Preachers cometh not of their learning, but of their vicious natures, and naughty desiers: for out of one and the same floure the Bee sucketh hony, and the spider draweth poison. By these and such other

like examples, ye maie easely espie, wherefore the Argument is not good, yf ye marke whether the true cause be in the former Proposition, or some counterfect reason, whiche semeth to proue, and yet in diede doth not proue the matter at al. for if I reason thus.

As whē the godly heare this (feare not death) it doth not folow, but that death is an horrible thyng, and much repugnaunt to mans nature. This deceiptful Argument is muche vsed in this our life, and made a bucklar for diuerse matters. As when I am lothe to bee of a quest, or that any such busines shoulde trouble me, beyng sent for, I faine my self sicke, because I would not gladlie come. Or whē one that is riche should healpe a poore mā, to saie: God healpe you syr. I haue a great charge my self, I can not do for you. Or when a Bisshoppe shoulde be desired to teache or preache, to saie: he is sick. Or when a lawyer being desired to healpe a poore man, and profered there vpon, a litle mony, euen so muche as the poore man can not well spare, and yet not halfe so muche as the lawyer woulde haue:

                  l to do you good. This is as thei saie in English, better a badde excuse, then none at all, in Latine it is called, non causa pro causa posita. And the vsing of such excuses emōg the Rethoritians, is called, translatio, that is to saie, a shiftyng, or puttyng of the faulte from one, to an other. As wee reade that Demades vsed a wōderfull good shifte, whē it was laidesore to his charge yt he had writttē a very naughtie decre and vnhonest, for the obteynyng of the peace at Alexanders hand: He aunswered that the same Decree was not writtten with his owne writyng pen, but with Alexanders warryng speare, which is asmuche to saie, feare did driue him to take suche, and such conditions of peace. We reade a notable Historie of a younge childe in Rome, called Papirius, whiche because both it is pleasaūt, & much to be woundred at, and also serueth for this purpose right aptly, I thinke it meete

to be rehersed in this place. This Papirius beyng a young ladde of .x. or .xij. yeres olde, and sonne to one of the Senatours in Rome, whiche were then, as noble men be nowe in Englande, lords of the Counsail, went euery day with his father to the Parliamente house, and hard from time to time all matters that were debated there. His father euermore charged hym that he should not vtter any thyng, which he hard, to any bodie liuing. It happened afterward that vpon vrgent causes & weightie affaires, the Counsail did sit muche longer then they were wount, and cōtinued so, for the space of a seuē-night. Euery bodie meruailed what this matter shoulde be. This boy Papirius knew all. His mother beyng most of all desirous to knowe what it should be, when she could not attaine the knowlege thereof by her housbād, she called the boie to confession, & hauyng the instrument of absolution by her, that is, a very good birchē rodde, charged her sonne truely to tell her euery whitte that was debated in the

Parliament house, or els he shoulde smart for it surely: for, what with the secretenesse of the thyng, and what with the silence of her sonne, she was wonderfull with childe, till she had gotte some what of the boie. The boie himselfe, first remēbryng his fathers cōmaundement, and consideryng how he shoulde be paide at his hande, if he tolde al thynges in diede as they were: and again of the other side, seyng presente paine before hym, the rodde at hande, his mother with childe till she were somewhat satisfied, thought it better, pretely & by the waie to mocke his mother, and so to stop her mouth with some forged tale: then falsely to bewraie his father, his frendes, and al his country. and therfore thus he began craftely to shape his tale: Mother if you wil promise me to kepe that close, which I shal disclose vnto you, and tell it no body liuynge, you shall heare the whole matter, euen as it is. She aunswered, she would not tell it againe whatsoeuer it were. Then said he, Mother the matter wholly cōcerneth

mariage, and the Counsaill haue long debated, whether it were better for one man to haue two wiues, or one wife to haue two housbandes, and as yet the matter hangeth in suspence. When she harde this, her hart burned & her stomake was ouercharged wonderfully, that except she had laied it in one of her neighbours lappes, it was like she woulde haue brast. Out she goeth, & maketh asmuch spede with her toung, as she doth with her fete, & telleth it immediatly to her nexte neighbour, and from one, to an other, till at length a nomber knew it, where vpon they agreed wholly to go all together to the Counsaill house, to entreat the Senatours to sit no longer vpon this matter, but clearely to determine with one assente and consente, that it were best, & most expedient for euery womā to haue .ij. housbandes, and not otherwise for no worldes good, any thyng heretofore to the contrarie notwithstandyng. By this example ye maie see the subtiltie of this deceipte. For whē the mother asked her sonne, what the

cause was of their lōge sitting, he told
                     •
                   her a cleane cōtrarie thyng, which the Counsaill neuer thought nor yet once minded, this is, nō causa pro causa posita. A cause that is not, put for a cause

                  tes, and therefore, though euill deedes deserue death, yet good deedes can neuer purchase life, so long as we be not able, to fulfill the Lawe, as God knoweth, we shall neuer be: scripture, our consciences, the worlde, and all, bearyng witnesse against vs. Of signes that bee not proper, neither tary long, no strong argument is made, as thus.
               
                  He is pale in countenaunce.
                  Ergo he is in loue.
               
               Palenes maie come of study, of care and thought, of abstinēce, of watchyng of some distēperature in the body, and many other waies besides.
               Again, there is an other rule. A posse ad esse, non est bona consequentia. Because a thyng maie bee, it shall not therefore folowe that it is. As the Catholikes haue serued vs, for the Sacrament, saiyng, that because God is omnipotent, and maie bee in the Sacrament, by his power really: Ergo he is there really. For so maie I saie. God

may fede euery christian, both in body & soule, with the might of his worde. Ergo he doth so. The prophet saith, I neuer sawe a iust mā forsaken of god, nor his sede begging his bread. And yet god doth not fede al christiās with his word only, but vseth his appoyncted wil generally. Likewise in the Sacrament, God fedeth vs spiritually, because the fleshe eatē, profiteth nothyng, and thei that eate the Sacrament in faith, tary in God

                   al thynges should be, as thei would haue it, & yet I cannot bee perswaded to thynke that because al priestes maie be honest, therfore thei all be honest.
               From the general, to the inferior, affirmatiuely, is no good argumēt made.
               
                  He is a man.
                  Ergo he is a good man.

                  ell. Or if thei haue dwellyng places still, yet few cā finde them at home. Again, to make an argument, from those thynges, whiche happen to a man, and maie bee awaye: the reason cannot of necessitie folowe.
               
                  This old manne goeth gaily, and like a young man.
                  Ergo he is in loue with some woman.
               
               In this reason, a likelihode is made necessary, as though it could not other wise bee, but that he was in loue, because he went in freshe apparell, yong man like. But for this whole capcious cause, I thynke it best, that ye marke the rules, aboue rehersed, and ye shall not faile to espie the faulte, for the dec

               The questiō is asked, so that he must answere to them bothe, whiche he can not do at one tyme, and geue one resolute answere directly, accordyng to the demaunders will. But this is a trifle, and one that hath but a spōfull of wit, maie answere to this question, v

               Here ye se, that for .ij. diuerse thynges, one certain question is directly required,

whereas no man can iustly answere at a worde: and therfore the question beyng vain made ioyntly, must seuerally be soluted.
               I will merily adde another, whiche agreeth to the secōd maner of askyng, & I wil adde thesame, rather to geue matter of laughyng, then that there is any great waight in it. A lawyer toke paines in a matter of law, for a certain gē
                  tleman, that was some tyme a scholer. The gentleman promised hym a horse for his labour, the lawyer after paines taken, requireth his horse, the gentleman denieth his debt, although the lawyer had witnesse. And thus the gentlemā reasoned merily for hym self: sir qd he, all horses be not of one colour, but of diuerse coloures, some blacke, some white, some baye, some daple: if I owe you any by promise, I owe you no more of one colour, then I do of another, cō
                  sideryng, I did promise you no more of one colour, then I did of another, and I maie be discharged of my promise, as well in deliueryng one certain colored horse, as another. Therefore, either I

owe you horses of all colours, or els I owe you none at all: but I do not owe you horses of all colours, (consideryng I promised you but one) therefore I owe you none. Yea, serue you me so, qd the Lawyer, mary this schoole poynct, much passeth al our lawe poīctes. Wel sir as it pleaseth you, qd he, if you be at that poynct. Whē the gentleman sawe hym so reasonable, and heard hym saie so, he gaue him accordyng vnto his promise, cōsideryng, he referred the whole matter so gently, to his pleasure.
               For this seconde maner of askyng, when of one thing, many are asked, one maie easely be inuegled and brought to an incōuenience, before he be ware, & of this kinde of askyng, there is also a notable exāple in Tullie, where he speaketh in his boke De inuentione, of this figure inductio, whiche is by thynges not doubtful, to proue that thyng true which is doubtfull. Socrates sheweth that Aspasia had this talke with zenophon, and his wife, in maner and forme folowyng, after other communication had before. And tell me in faith, (quod

Aspasia) if thy neighbour had more precious Iewels then thou nowe haste, whether wouldest thou wisshe to haue hers, or thine owne? She aunswered. I woulde haue hers, what if she had more costelie garmentes, more fine apparell, wouldest thou not haue it also, ye mary would I, (quod she.) Ah well I say, what if thy neighbour had a better husband then thou nowe hast, whether haddest thou rather kepe thyne owne still, or hers? With that she bloushed. Then Aspasia when apportunitie serued, spake to zenophon likewise, and said merelie vnto him, he not knowing of this that was spoken before. I praye the tell me zenophon, What if thy neighbour had a better horse then thyne is, haddest thou rather haue thine own or thy neighbors? I would haue his saieth he. what if he had better lande then thou hast, wouldest thou haue

For asmuche as both of you onely hath not aunswered me, in that poinct, which I moste desired to knowe: I my selfe will showe what both you thinke. For you beyng a woman, first you desire a very honest man to your husband: and zenophon beyng a man, desireth to haue a ryght honest woman.

                     , the cuckowes song, that is, a repeting of that wholly in the conclusion, whiche before was onely spoken in the first proposition: or els by thynges doubtful, to proue thynges that are as doubtfull.
               
                  
                     Euery slaunderer must be banyshed the court.
                  Suche a man is a slaunderer.
                  Ergo euerie slaunderer must be banished the court.
               
               The conclusion is not well gathered, for it should not be vniuersall, but particular, & therefore seyng the same is repeted that was spokē before, with out any good probation: in my mynde it maie be called the cuckowes songe. Agayne, when an vnknowen thyng is proued by a thyng, that is as much vnknowen, as the other is.
               
                  In purgatorie, sinnes be forgeuen to the dead.
                  Ergo we must saye masse styll for the dead.
               
               This wyse reason, fond preachers heretofore haue made, that therefore we must haue masse for the dead, because in purgatorie sinnes be forgeuen the dead. And yet doubte I asmuch of this place purgatorie, as I mistruste this folish massyng, & to saie truth it is sinne to like either of thē both, & as for purgatorie, I thynke there was neuer

none suche, but onely inuented to feare the simple, as children haue bene made afraied with a visar, or els founde out to pike mens purses. An other.
               
                  Thus many hūdred yeres haue men vsed to

                     raie to sainctes departed.
                  Ergo they do not amisse, that praie to the dead still.
               
               I aunswere, whoredom hath bene vsed these many hundreth yeares, Ergo it is lawful both to haue the stewes and to go to the stewes still.
               Euery man may see howe foolyshe this argument is, and yet it is as good as the other, euery ynche of it. For although men haue praied, mē haue gone on pilgremage thus lōg, and thus lōg: yet it is not therfore true, that the people did well therein. For we Englyshe men knowe (not only by heare say, but also by good experience) that custome is the mother, and the sucke geuer vnto all error. And therefore, when suche argumentes are made, we saie. Dubiū per id quod aeque dubium est, confirmatur. That which is doubtful, is proued by that whiche is as doubtful, and

so we do not allowe the argumēnt.
               Thirdly, when that thynge is taken to proue, as thoughe it ware vndoubted, and euery bodie agreed therunto: where as yet it is in controuersie.
               
                  The anabaptistes haue the holy ghost the teacher of al thinges.
                  Ergo thei nede not to here ye gospel, nor yet be boūd to folow it.
               
               Who knoweth not, that hath any knowlege of the truth, that the firste may lawfully be doubted, and rather denied, then graunted.
               Fourthly, this deceipte is then vsed when that whiche foloweth, proueth that which goeth before, as though the cart went before the horse, for often times that thynge whiche is proued, is more assured then that whiche dothe proue, as thus.
               
                  Infantes haue faith.
                  Ergo they must be baptised.
               
               The consequent is vndoubtedly true, for as muche as we fi

               The .vii. deceipt.
               
                  IGnoratio elenchi, (that is the mistakyng of cōtradictorie propositions) is a disceiptful argument which comprehēdeth in it selfe al other aboue rehersed subtilties Aristotel notwithstandynge hath compassed this deceipt with in his boūdes. First when respect is not made to one and the same thynge, but diuersely applied.
               
                  To eate fleshe is good for helth sake.
                  To eate fleshe is not good when offence maye folowe.
                  Ergo to eate fleshe is good and not good.
               
               Truth it is & yet shal it not folowe, that whosoeuer eateth, the same man doth offende: cōsidering to eate is lawfull, and is none offence to God at all, beyng ones allowed by the magistrate, in whose hande lyeth the whole orderyng of this matter.
               
                  Againe, this deceipt is vsed when contradiction is made according to diuerse respectes, as thus.
               
                  The law is to be folowed in morall preceptes, and not in ceremonials, nor yet alwayes in iudicials neyther.
                  Ergo the lawe is to be folowed and not to be folowed.
               
               It is euen so, and yet not true neyther, that the law is alwayes to be reiected, and to be folowed, as it pleaseth our phantasies.
               Thirdly, this subtiltie is fashioned, when a contradiction is vsed, and yet not vsed of lyke sorte, so that the latter parte doth not denye the former in one maner of vnderstandyng, as thus.
               
                  I knowe the worde of God, and I doe not knowe it.
               
               Those that liue licentiously, & feare not the general resurrection, may iustly be here included, and the .ij. sentences whiche seeme to gayne saye, maye both be true in them: for some knowe that the scriptures are of God, or at least, thei know that the scriptures are

commonly taken for the worde of god, and yet they themselues, knowe not one worde of gods will, nor yet passe a whitte for it. Or we may say that those poore soules in the Popes reigne knew the word of god o
                     •
                  ly by here say, when thei hard the ghosphell redde in latine, & coulde not tel one word what it mēt.
               Fourthly, the time, maye alter thinges, and make .ij. diuerse thinges to be both true, thus.
               
                  To worke vpon the Saboth is forbid, and yet, not to worke vpon other dayes, is also forbid.
                  Ergo to worke, & not to worke, are both forbed.
               
               It is an easye matter to auoyde all suche deceiptes. Therfore there is a rule in logique that .ij. contradictions can neuer be both, either false or true, at one and the same time, and that in one respect, as thus.
               
                  Al true beleuers shall attayne saluation.
                  Some true beleuers shall not attayne saluation.
               
               These .ij. propositions can neuer be

bothe together either true or false. Nowe the other whiche were made before, maye be both true, at one and the same time, & therfore they are not contradictories, bycause they are not considered in respec
                     •
                  e of one, and the same thing, at one and the same time, but diuersly applied and considered, as thus.
               
                  To preache in the congregation is meete for a man, and not for a woman.
                  Ergo to preache is meete and not meete.
               
               Al this is true being diuersly consi
                  
                     •
                  ered, first, a womā may not preache, & yet a man may, & so the sentēce is true, and it maye well be sayde to preache is meete and not meete, with out anye contradiction at all, bycause of the diuerse respectes, whiche be had bothe to the man, and to the woman. if the rule of contradictorie propositions before rehersed, be well marked, all these deceiptes may easely be auoyded.
            
            
               Of particular auoydyng false argume

                  WHen I see an argumrnt deriued frō these subtile places, or els frō the places of inuentiō, which I haue before at large declared: I ought to obserue diligently the general rules & preceptes there gyuen, for if one reason thus from the generall worde, suche a man foloweth noughtines, Ergo he is a thefe, the argument is not good, and the error appereth the rather, by this general rule, From the gene

               THe wrong framyng, may with ease be espied, if the rules be ones learned, that are before set forth for the same purpose. And again all other kynd of argumentes, haue rules especiall, and propre to themselfes whereby the true orderyng of an argument is better knowen.
            
            
               
               Of obiections made to an argument.
               OBiections are then vsed, whē we doe not dissolue the argument by the rules of logique, or directly auoyd the danger, but bryng an other thyng, as an example, to ouerthrowe that whiche was spoken before, and this maner is foure wayes vsed.

               Of the second, thus. Suche a one is an honest mā for I saw him ones gyue almose to the poore, I answere, such a one is no dronckarde, for I sawe him ones sober.
               Of the third, thus. Suche an honest

man hathe ones receaued a great displeasure of his frinde and neighboure, Ergo he maye hate hym deadly for euer. Naye not so, for the wycked man will sometimes forgyue, receauyng displeasure, and therefore the goodman must muche more forgyue.

                  The two first proposicions are manifestly false, and yet the conclusion is very true. So that ye maie se, after .ij. false proposiciōs, a true cōclusion may folowe, and not contrary wise, of two true proposicions, a false conclusion cā bee made. For as we saie in Latine.

               Thus we se a false conclusion, made of twoo vndoubted true proposicions, and yet I said before, of true saiynges, nothyng doth folowe but onely truth.

There be foure thynges (saieth he) which should not be examined by reason. And first no mā ought to argue of those thynges wherein if any one put doubte, he deserueth punishement. As to reason whether there be a God or no. And therefore Tullie sayeth very wel, it is a wicked and an vngodly custome, to dispute or talke against God, either in

earnest, or yet in sporte. Again it is fondnesse, to reason of those thynges which our senses iudge to be true. As to know by reason, whether fire be hote, or no. the whiche were madnesse to aske, and surely, if any one should so reason with me, I would bidde hym putte his fynger in it. Thirdely, it is euell to reason of those thynges, whiche can not bee knowen by mans witte. As to knowe what God ye father is in persone, what the holy ghoste is, howe they sytte and are placed in heauen, or of what makyng the soule of man is. Fourthlie, to talke and dispute of those thynges, whiche are vndoubtedly true. As in Arithmetike .iii. and .iij. are syx. In Philosophie. The whole is greater then the parte. In all whiche matters to moue any earnest questiō, or to doubte ouermuch in thinges nothing doubtefull, is either starke madnesse, or els playne foolyshnesse.
