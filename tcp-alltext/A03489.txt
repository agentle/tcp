And yf thou hadde not so done / woman sholde not haue had payne in berynge of childern. And therto thou shalt be euer

               vnd mānes power. God then̄e sayd to Adam. For yu ete of that fruyte at thy wyues byddynge ayenste my forbyddynge / & for yu letest the abbay of the holy ghost to be so foule destroyed / & lete thabbesse & her couent to rēne awaye fro theyr order & knowest not whether / this shal be thy penaūce. Thou shalt be dryue out of paradyse in to the erthe acursed for thy synne. Therin shall thou dwelle with moche sorowe & woo all ye dayes of thy lyfe / and the erthe shall brynge forth to the thornes & breres. And yu shalt ete grasse that groweth on the erthe.

            ¶After yt our lorde bad an angel to dryue Adam & his wyf out of ye blysse of paradyse in to ye wretched worlde. He had hym go & seke there the abbesse of the abbaye of the holy ghost. And sayd that nother he ne his wyfe ne none of theyr ofsprynge sholde come agayne in to the blysse of paradyse ne in to heuen / tyll they haue made agayne the ababye of the holy ghost as well as it was before. Also tyll they haue brought agayn thabbesse wt them and all the couent in as good poynt as they were or they wente awaye. ¶Thenne made god to Adam a cote of leder / & to Eue an other cote / and put them out of paradyse And thus they went forthe in to this wretched worlde wt moche sorowe

            AFter the tyme that Adam & his wyfe were departed from this transytory lyfe and put in ye pryson of helle / there came in to the worlde many wyse & famous men as Patryarkes and Prophetes & other good men many that hadde moche sorowe for the abbaye of the holy ghost and for al the couent for they were so gone awaye / they wente about & sought after them in many syndre cō

The maydens be paste awaye in to wretchednes. They herde me well how I syghed & made moch moon but there was none of thē yt wolde me comforte wt a worde. Therfore I haue so wepte for sorowe yt myn eyen be in poynt to faylle. Who shall gyue me water to my heed / & who shal yeue me a welle of teeres to myn eyen.
