            To my vvithipol.
            
               IT happeneth atte this
tyme (my harty beloued
Edmonde) that I
am in such place, wher
I haue no maner of
bokes with me, to passe the tyme
after my maner and custome. And
thoughe I had here with me plenty
of bokes: yet the place suffrethe
me not to spende in them any study.
For you shal vnderstand, that
I lye waytynge on my lorde Cardinal,
whose houres I muste obserue,
to be alwaye at hande, lest I
be called, whan I am not bye: the
whiche shuld be streight taken for
a faute of gret negligence. Wherfore,
nowe that I am well satiated
with the beholdynge of these gaye
hangynges, that garnissheth here
euery wall: I wyll turne me and
talke with you. For you muste

knowe, that my mynde hath longe
coueted, to shewe what affecte I
beare to warde you: the which hytherto
parauenture I neuer vttered
vnto yon soo playnelye, that
you might take therof any perfect
knowlege. And that I so dyd kepe
in, suche outwarde tokyns, wherof
when you were with me, you
shoulde haue perceyued my loue:
the cause was none other, but that
in dede,How masters hurt their scholars most. I loued you. For longe I
haue ben taught, that the mayster
neuer hurtethe his scholer more,
than whan he vttereth & shewethe
by cheryshyng and cokerynge the
loue that he bearethe to his scholers.
I thinke you lacked with me
no cheryshinge, but of cokerynge
you hadde very lyttel: bycause I
was loth to hurt you: the whiche
lothnesse cam I saye, of that I loued

you. But nowe in as moche
you be of age, and also by the common
borde of houselynge admytted
into the nombre of men, to be
no more in the company of chyldren,
and speciallye for as moche
as my rule ouer you is cessed, I
wyl not deferre any longer the expressynge
of myne harte, that no
lesse louethe and fauourethe you,
than yf nature had made you, eyther
my sonne or my brother. For
this alway is my mynde, if I haue
a frende, in whom I fynde suche
feythe, & honestie, that I inwardly
ioy in harte with hym: I reken
streyght, that al his be myne with
out any exception:Trewe frendshyp So that in very
dede I take to my care, as myn
owne, all thynges that be in my
frendes care. This mynde had I
to my frende Andrewe Smythe,

whose son, Christofer your felow,
I euer toke for my sonne, & nowe
I thynke playnely, that he is so in
very dede. This strengthe hathe
true loue in frendshyp, the whiche
hath likewyse ioyned your father
in suche maner to my harte, that
one thynke you shulde be no more
his sonne then you be myne. And
thoughe I can suffre your father
to take the rule of you, more then
I do: Yet I can not suffre, that he
shulde care more for your profyte
then I do. For as I desire & wishe,
that you neuer haue nede of me: so
surely if you euer shulde haue, it
shulde well then appere, that as
nature hath giuen you one father,
so your fathers frendshyppe hathe
prouided for you an other father.
Wherfore good Edmonde, reken
noo lesse affecte in me to doo you

good than is in your owne father,
whose only study and care is, to se
you growe & prosper towarde the
state of an honeste man: and I to
further you to the same, am as desyrous
as he is, and as moche as
I can, I wyl helpe you both with
my counsayle and power, suche as
I haue.
            ¶If you wyll call to your minde
all the frayes, that haue benne betwene
you and me, or betwene me
and Smythe, you shall fynde, the
causes euer depended of a care I
had for your and his maniers.
            When I sawe certayne phantasies
in you or him, that iarred frō
true opinions, the which true opinions,True opinions.
aboue al lernyng, I wolde
haue masters euer tech theyr scholers.
But nowe that you be of better
habilite to take coūseyll, I wyl

begynne to shewe you my mynde,
in stayinge you for the hole course
of your lyfe, that you may in time
lerne what is to be done, to be a
good & an honest man. You be yet
in the first entree of your lyfe, and
nowe is the tyme to haue a guyde,
that may faithfully conducte you
in the ryght way: For there be so
many by pathes, and for the most
parte, all by pathes be more worne
with the steppes of your fore goers
thā is the very true path of liuing:
that if you go alone, you may paraduenture
long wandre out of the
streyghte way. Wherfore as nere
as I can, I wylle in fewe wordes
appoynte vnto you certayne markes,
vppon the whiche if you dilygentlye
loke, you canne not erre
nor fayle of the waye, that leadeth
to the rewarde of an honeste good

man, whose vertue sauoureth plesantly
to heuen, pleseth the world,
and nourisheth hym selfe, with an
incomperable delite and gladnes,
that continually reygneth in his
clene & pure consciēce. With these
markes & tokēs, the which I wold
you loked stil vpon, I wil assigne
you certaine auctors, in whose workes
I wold you shuld bestow your
lesure, when you may haue time to
rede, yt by them you may at the full
be instructed in al thinges apperteining
to vertu: & in al your life I
wold you medled not greatly with
any other bokes, then with these,
yt I shal name vnto you: it is not
the reding of many bokes,Reding of many bokes. that getteth
increace of knowlege & iudgement:
for the most parte of them,
that redeth al indifferētly, confoūd
their wittes and memorie without

any notable fruite of their redyng.
It muste be a diligent reder, that
shal take the profyte of his labour
and diligence. No man (specially
of them that haue other occupations)
can vse redinge but in verye
fewe workes, the whiche I wolde
shuld be piked out of the best sorte:
that the fruite of the reders diligence
maye be the greatter. I se
many lose theyr tyme, when they
thinke to bestowe their time beste,
bicause they lacke iudgemente or
knowelege, to pyke oute the bokes,
the whiche be worthye to be
studied. And in euerye thynge an
order wel obserued, bringeth more
profitte then any labour or peine
besyde. Wherfore my good Withipolle,
take hede to my lesson.
I am in doubte, whether you
haue anye other louer, that canne

and wylle shewe you a lyke tale:
but welle I am assured, that you
haue none, that can thus teache
you with a better will, to haue you
take profite by him, then I do: &
of me howe longe you shall haue
this vse, it is in goddes wil to determyne:
As moche as lyeth in me,
I wyl nowe procure and prouide,
that these letters shal kepe to your
vse the summe of my councell, by
the whiche if you order your will,
I putte noo doubte, but fyrste the
grace of god shalbe rooted in you,
and next you shal liue with a mery
harte, and finally neuer to lacke
the commodities requisite for the
shorte tyme in this worlde, in the
whiche case you shall opteyne the
worshyp and dignitie of a good &
an honest man, whose conditions
I had rather se you haue with pouerte,

than in greate abundance to
be a man of smal honeste. You may
be good, honest, and ryche, and so
study to be, or els thynke neuer of
ryches: for other wyse you shal deceyue
your selfe, & do contrary to yt
way, that as wel worldly wisedom
as the trouth of our faith sheweth
you. But nowe here what I saye.
            ¶Fyrst and last (myn owne good
Withipol) remēbre ernestly to haue
in your mind .iii. certeine thinges,
the whiche be of suche valure, that
he that forgetteth eyther their dignitie
and nature, orles the degrees
& order of them: he can not please
nother god, nor hym selfe, nor the
worlde. I saye, in all the course of
your lyfe there be .iii. thinges to be
loked so vpō, that the first of them
must be firste of you regarded: the
second enext after, and the third in

his place after the .ii. Beware, as
of dedly poison, that you ruffil not
them without care, one before the
other, as to take the .iii. in the place
of the fyrste, or the second after the
third, or both the second & the third
before the first. In this conclusion
you shal (as I haue sayd) both offēd
god, & displese your selfe, & also
nothinge contēt the world. Like as
the most part of men now a dayes
trespas al for the rechfulnes & negligēce
in not keping these .iii. thinges,
vnder the dignite & degre according
as they ought to be obserued
and kept. And what be we (my
good Edmōd) if we be out of goddis
fauor? odious to our selfe, and
dispiteful to men. Therfore agayne
I exhort you, to thentent you may
eschewe this abhominable condycion,
& growe to be admitted in the

blessed nombre of them that rest in
the grace of god, in the clennes of
theyr conscience, and in the fauour
of the world, to be iudged a good,
a wyse, and an honeste man. For
this finall ende myn exhortation
is nowe, that you in al your actes
in the hole course of your lyfe, remembre
these three thinges, that
I wil reherse vnto you. But I say
to you, yt you must not only remē
               bre
these thre thinges, but also specially
haue in minde the degres of
them: so that euer the first of them
be chiefly in your thoughte aboue
al other: and then in his place put
the second, and let not the third be
regarded, but as his place requireth,
that is, when you haue done
with the fyrste, and also with the
seconde. There lieth more weight
& valure vpon the knowynge and

kepynge of this tale, that I shall
tell you: then if I coude shewe you
the waye within fewe monethes,
to be a man of greate power, both
in excedynge abundance of riches,
and also in passynge auctoritie of
rule. Therfore as wel for the frute,
that foloweth, if you do after myn
exhortation, as for the infinite hurtes,
that you canne not escape, if
you shulde forgette that I say: I
warne & warne you agayne, here
this lesson with a glad eare, and
print the same in your mind, to execute
with lyuely diligence the effect
of this counseyl, wherin is cō
               teyned
your life and deathe, your
ioye and sorowe, as welle in this
world, as in that shalbe here after:
These .iii. thinges, be the soule, the
bodye, and the substaunce of this
worlde.Soule. The fyrst place hath by

good reason the soule, seynge hit
is a thynge immortal, that is created
and made after the fygure &
shape of almyghtye god.Body. The
nexte and seconde rome hath the
bodye, as the caas and sepulture
of the soule, and nereste seruaunt
to the secretis of the spirite. The .iii.
rome occupieth ye riches & goodis
of this world,Goodes of this worlde. as the necessarie instrumentes
or toles for the bodye,
the whiche can not want nor lacke
suche thynges. Let then the eie of
your inward minde fyrst & chiefely
euer beholde the first thing in you
that is your soule: Nexte therto
haue a respecte to your bodye:
and thirdely considre the worlde:
Care for your soule, as for your
chiefe iewell and only treasure.
            Care for your body, for the soules
sake. Care for the worlde for the

bodis sake. Beware aboue al thinges,
that you go not backewarde,
as he doothe, that carethe fyrste to
be a ryche man: nexte to be an helthye
manne, and thyrdely to be a
good manne: where he shoulde
do clene contrary, first to study for
goodnes, nexte for helth, and then
for welthe. You se so greate blindnes
amonge men, that some folke
so careth for ryches, that very littel
they loke for the helth of the bodye,
& nothing at al they mind the
state of the soule. I say to you, som
folkes do thus: I wolde to god I
myghte not truely report, that for
the most parte al mē in maner now
a dayes do no nother wyse. Loke
vpō eyther the spiritual sort or the
temporal: and moch a do you shal
hauein the great swarmyng multitude
of this blynd sorte, to fynde

oute theym, that fyrste aboue all
thynges care for theyr soule, nexte
for their body: and thirdly for goodes
of this world. You shal se marchantes
spare no trauayle nor ieopardie
of the body, to get these goodes.
They be (to sey the trouth) so
occupied in the study of this third
thynge, that scant they haue tyme
to care for the seconde, and as for
the fyrste, they passe nothynge ther
vppon, it semeth a thynge leaste in
theyr thoughte, where, of conueniencye
the same care, studye, and
thought, that they gyue to the opteynynge
of these worldly goodes:
they shulde spend it al in the mainteynaunce
of the fyrste thynge,
that is the soule: and the smalle
lyttelle regarde, that they take
for the fyrste, shoulde be bestowed
for the thyrde: and more than they

do, they shuld cherishe the seconde.
The same cōfusiō is with vs scholers:scholers.
for our first study is to get promotion,
to get these goodis, to liue
welthily. In this care we busely be
occupied continually. Somewhat
more we cheryshe our bodies then
doth the marchant: but our cherysshynge
is for the longer vse of
these goodes, not as it shuld be for
the soules sake. And as for ye soule
we haue as lyttel regarde as other
men haue, although we speke therof
more then parauēture other mē
do. This ouerthwarte confusion
of these thre thynges marreth all.
And playnely I may say, that all
mischief cometh onely of this misorder,
that we put the chyefe care
of our study to the thyrde thynge,
and not to the fyrste, as of duitye,
we oughte to do the contrarye.
            
               
If my purpose were to shewe you,
what other men do, and not rather
what I wolde haue you doo: I
wolde farther procede to expresse
vnto you, how farre out of square
our lyfe is nowe a dayes: and how
blessed a life we shuld haue in this
traunsitorie worlde, if the care of
our soule were fyrst and chiefely in
mens myndes, lyke as the care of
the worldly substāce occupieth our
hartis aboue all other thinges. If
it were as it ought to be, yt in our
phantasie reigned the study for the
soule, thē shuld be here that celestial
kyngedom, the whiche Christ techeth
vs to pray for in oure pater
noster, where we craue of god, that
his rule and reygne maye come amonge
vs. But as I despayre that
commonly this study and care can
not be changed from these worldly

ryches to the soule: so I am ful of
good hope, that you wyl take hede
to your lyfe, to ordre therein your
desyres, in this dewe maner, more
regardynge what shulde be done,
then what is done. When you se
and knowe the ryght path, I trust
you wil not walk in the croked hye
way. The trouth shal more drawe
you to loue and to folowe vertue,
then the common ensample shalle
entice you to folowe vyce, the whiche
no man can loue, not the synner
hym selfe.
            But nowe myne owne good Edmonde,
here of these three thynges
somewhat more you muste prynte
in your mynde, with a perfect perswasiō,
that your soule is the chief
treasure, that you haue: wherevppon
your continualle thoughte
and care muste be, to kepe hit, to

defende it, to norishe it, to comfort
it by al waies and meanes possible
for you. In this studie you muste
spende all your wittes: night and
day you must think on this thing,
what so euer you do, you must direct
your act to this thing. If you
be occupied in the state of your body,
eyther to dryue away syckenes,
or to susteyne helth, let it be for the
seruice your bodi oweth to ye soule.
If you trauayle for goodes of this
worlde, to get your owne lyuyng,
or to helpe your frende, orels to prouide
for your chyldren, when god
shal sende you them: let your trauayle
be for the necessyties of the
body, and so finally for the soule.
Consydre what the goodes of the
worlde be, howe they be but instrumentes
for the body. Use then the
worlde in his kynde. Loke agayne

vpon your body, howe it is preciouser
then the goodes: vse hym thē
in his worthynes, & hurte not your
body for a thing of lesse valu. And
as ye haue nothinge, nother your
body nor your goodes, to be cōpared
with the dignite of your soule:
so my swete withipol, let nothinge
be in your reputation aboue this
chief & principal iewel, the whiche
must only for him self be cared for,
& al other thinges in this life, must
be cherished for it. I sticke moche
with you in repetinge one thynge,
but maruayle nat, though I so do:
For I se vs al in this world so blinded,
partly by a vse & custome frō ye
cradil, in the magnifienge of these
goodis, partli by thēsāple of them,
with whom we be daily conuersāt:
that scant after longe crieng it can
nowe be harde, yt the soule must be

cheifly cared for. And except grace
worke with you, that you your self
wyll consent to the trouth, it is not
possible to perswade you, that the
very trewe way of lyuyng is this,
to care chiefly for the soule, and to
care for all other thynges onelye
for the soules sake. This sayenge
thoughe it be trewe, yet I saye, hit
can not be harde: in as moche the
lyues of all them, with whome ye
shalbe continuallye conuersaunt,
shall crye oute clene contrarye agaynste
my sayeng. For on al sides
you shall se menne sweatynge in a
contynuall worke, bothe of bodye
and of mynde, to get these worldly
goodes, withoute any mention
made of the soules state: the whiche
the verye friers care lyttel for:
as it openly appereth. But euer
I say to you, loke what Christen

men shuld do, and if you se men so
do, be glad of that syght, & folowe
the same: if you se the contrarie, fle
from the ensample, and cleue euer
fastly to the trouthe, with a sorowful
harte for the losse of other men,
that so blyndely rushe forthe in the
trayne of a vicious lyuyng, where
the soule is so lyttel cared fore.
            ¶That this firste thynge may be
ye better in your study, I wil brefely
touche som what of tho thynges
that appertein hereto: to haue you
knowe what nourisheth and comforteth
the soule, & what hurteth
and noyeth the same. The soule
can not but euer lyue, it hath noo
ende of lyuynge, yet we may saye,
that the soule liueth and dyeth: It
liueth in the grace of god, and dieth
in the malice of the diuel. The
soules lyfe is the lyghte of vertue:

his death is the derkenes of sinne.
You haue a free wyll gyuen you,
wherby you may either quicken or
slaye at your owne pleasure, your
soule in ye bryght Paradise of life,
and you may set your soule in the
blacke dungeon of deathe. Let
therefore this wyll of yours euer
study to procure for the soules life,
the whiche is your owne lyfe: and
in the same study you shall delyuer
the soule from his death, the whiche
is the perpetualle payne ordeined
for synne, that seperateth the
image of god frome his patrone.
I saye syn plucketh your soule frō
god, whose image your soule shuld
beare. Therfore in all your actis
so doo, that you wyllyngely displease
not god: who canne not be
pleased but with a pure and clene
conscience, pure and cleane if you

suffre noo synne to remaygne soo
longe in your desyre and mynde,
that hit cankerethe the thoughte.
Your thoughte is cankered with
the longe resydence of synne: when
eyther you be weake in the studye
of vertue, orelles make verye littelle
of a faulte, or defende youre
vyce, or nowselle youre selfe in a
custome of an inordynate desyre.
The fraylenes of our flesshe is so
greatte, that it canne not be, but
that syn shall come to our desyre:
but it is our blame, if synne tarye
and abyde within vs. God hath
gyuen vs a myghtye power ouer
our selfe: we maye when we wyll
correcte our desires, and dryue out
all synne. If you knowe not what
is synne, nor what is vertue: by
the feare and loue of god, you shal
knowe boothe.
            
               
The feare of god wylle teache you
to flee sinne and folowe vertu.Feare of god. Loue of god. The
loue of god wylle teache you to folowe
vertu and flee sinne: wherby
your priuey and secrete conscience
shall better and more clerely perceiue,
what is to be done, and what
is not, than any diffinition or descryption
can appoynt oute to you.
Therfore my dere Withipoll, enwarpe
your selfe faste and sure in
the fere and loue of god, from your
firste rysynge to your reste, drawe
forth the day in all your busynesse,
as this louynge feare and feareful
loue shal secretely admonishe and
warne you: and dye rather than
you wolde pursue any lust against
your knowlege of goddes plesure.
            ¶What marchandise so euer you
occupie: remembre, it is the busynes
of the thirde care, for the whiche

you may not leaue any poynte
of this fyrste care, that belongeth
to the soule. Lyke wise if ye be occupied
about the body: remembre,
it is the warke of the seconde care,
the which also must be ordered vnder
the fyrste, the whiche fyrst must
alwey sticke in your mynde, sturred
vp and led in all desires & appetites
by the sayde feare & loue of
god. Do neuer that thynge, wherin
you feare goddis displeasure.
            ¶More partycularlye in wrytinges
you shall lerne this lesson,Newe testamente.
if you wold somtyme take in your
handes the newe testamente, and
rede it with a dewe reuerence. For
I wold not haue you in that boke
forgette, with whome you talke,
hit is god that there speakethe,
hit is you a poore creature of god
that redeth. Consider the matche,

and meke downe your wittes. Presume
not in no case to thynke, that
there you vnderstonde ought: leue
deuisinge thervpon: submit your
selfe to the expositiōs of holy doctours:
and euer conforme your cō
               sent
to agre with Christes church.
This is the surest way that you cā
take, both before god & man. Your
obediēce to the vniuersal faith shal
excuse you before god, although it
might be in a false belefe: & ye same
obediēce shal also kepe you out of
trouble in this worlde, where you
se, howe folishe medlars be daylie
sore punyshed, both to theyr owne
vndoing, & also to their gret sorow
& lamenting of their louers & frendes.
Surely the trouthe is as I
haue sayd, that it is your parte to
obey, and to folowe the church: so
that both for your soules sake, and

for your bodily quietnes, with the
cōforte of your frendes, I exhorte
you to meddel in no point of your
faith, other wise then the churche
shal instruct & teache you. In the
whiche obedience rede for your increase
in vertue, the storie of oure
mayster Christe, that liuely expressethe
the hole course of a vertuous
lyfe.Mat. 6. And there you shall here the
holye gooste commande you,Luc. 12. to
seeke fyrste afore all thynges, the
kingedome of heuen, & than (saith
the spirite of god) al other thinges
apperteyninge to the bodye and
worlde, shall by them selfe folowe
withoute your care.
            ¶In reding the gospels,Redynge ye gospels Chrysost. Ierom I wold
you had at hande Chrysostome &
Ierom, by whom you might surely
be brought to a perfecte vnderstanding
of the text. And hereafter

at leysure, I wolde you redde the
Ethikes of Aristotell,Ethica. eyther vnder
some expert philosopher,Arist. orels
with comment of Futtiratius.
            And lette PlatoPlato be familiar with
you, specially in the bokes that he
wryteth De re publica. Also you shall
fynde moch for your knowelege in
the moral philosophie of Cic.Cicero. as in
his bokes De officiis, de senectute, de fato,
de finibus, de Achademicis questio. de
Thust. Specially rede with diligēce
the workes of Seneca:Seneca. of whom
ye shall lerne as moche of vertue
as mans wit can teche you. These
workes I thinke sufficiēt, to shew
you what is vertue, and what is
vice: and by redynge of these, you
shall growe in to a highe corage
to ryse in a iudgemente aboue the
commen sorte, to esteme this world
accordynge to his worthines, that

is farre vnder the dignitie of the
vertues, the whiche the mynde of
men conceyueth and reioycethe in
these bokes, shal lyft you vp from
the claye of this erthe, and set you
in a hill of highe contemplacion:
from whence you shal loke downe
and dispise the vanite, that folishe
men take, in the deceyteful pompe
of this shorte & wretched life. Mobokes,
I wyll not aduyse you, for
your soules study, to rede, thanne
these: excepte hit be Enchiridion,
that Erasmus wrytethe, a worke
doubtles, that in fewe leaues conteynethe
an infynite knowlege of
goodnes. Thynke not my good
Edmond, that I ouer charge you.
For I knowe what pleasure you
haue in redinge: & in better bokes
you can not bestowe your plesure,
than in these, the whiche be in nō
               bre

but fewe, and yet they shall do
you more good thā the reding here
& there of many other. I wolde to
Iesus I had in your age folowed
lyke coūseil in redinge onely these
workes, the whiche nowe at laste
by a great losse of tyme in redyng
of other, I haue chosen out for my
purpose, to refreshe with them the
reste of my lyfe. And I councel
you nowe to begynnne to doo the
same, when tyme and conueniente
leyser shall be giuen you to rede any
boke.
            ¶The second care is for the body,
the which you must cherish as moche
as may stande with the seruice
of your former thought and study
for your chief treasure. Haue a resspecte

is not onely in hym that dothe nothynge,
but also in hym that doth

you be not well occupied.Temperance. Be temperate
in your lustes, touching the
bodyly pleasure: the tyme shal not

honeste mate. In the meane season
let the feare & loue of god kepe
you in chastitie, the whiche apperteyneth
to your chiefe care: for nedes
you must so do, seinge yt other
wise lecherie shal sore defoyle your
soule, ye which you must regard be
fore ye bodis appetite. For this part
I wolde you redde, as your leiser
shalbe,Gale. De bona bale tud. tuen. a littel worke of Galen De
bona valetudine tuenda. And in the workes

afore named, you shal find many
thynges, that shall instruct you
well for this parte also, and lyke
wise for the third, the whiche thyrd
euer hath occupied mens stomackes
more thē eyther the first or the
seconde. Wherfore as wel in holy
scripture, as in the other philosophers,
& specially in Seneca,Seneca. you
shal finde many lessons, that apperteine
to the thirde care. This
third care is for the goodes in this
world. In this part I can giue you
smal aduyse of my selfe, bycause I
haue had but smal experience here
in: yet euer I se, that you may not
in the study of gettyng these goodes,
leue or slake the chief care, for
the fyrste thynge, nor yet the secō
               darye
care for the bodye. Labour
you muste for your lyuynge in a
dewe order, as in the thyrd degree

of your thinges. If matens, masse,
or a sermon be to be harde, set your
marchādise aparte for the season,
& prefer the mattens of your soule,
yt loketh to haue suche gostly fode.
If the tyme require to haue you
take a mele, eyther a diner or a supper
for your refection, let not your
marchādise defer the going therto
in a dewe tyme. For remēbre, that
busines is one degree aboue your
marchandise.Almes dede. If you espie a pore
man to be in nede of your helpe,
hast to helpe him befor any eare of
makinge a bargayne, for yt worke
of mercy perteyneth to your chiefe
iewell: & therfore your soule shall
growe in the grace of god. Breke
not moch, to the hurt of your helth
the cōuenient time of going to bed
for any occupatiōs or rekeninges
in your study for these goodes. For

remēbre, that reste & slepeSlepe. perteine

making your bargaine kepe faith
and promise: deceiue no man with
any gyle or false color. For let it be
euer in your phantasie, howe the
gaines that you shuld get with suche
vntrue dealyng, be cōteined vnder
your .iii. yt is to sey vnder your
lest care, wher ye breking of faith &
ꝓpmise, with false deceite & vntrue
deling, sore hurteth your soule: in
whom resteth your chief thought.
And by falshed, you coulde not get
so moch of riches, as by ye same you
shuld lose of honestie & goodnes.
wherfore trauayle euer as the degres
of these .iii. thinges shal req̄re.
If an infinite hepe of worldly goodes
might be got with a smal hurte
& damage of ye soule, forsake rather

that great heape, than you wolde
suffre this small hurte. There can
be no comparison betwene the soules
helth and the riches: the leaste
droppe that can be of your soules
parte, must pondre and weye more
in your thought, thē al this world
besyde can do.
            ¶Let not any similitudeSimilitudes. deceyue
your indgement. As if par cas a
man wolde reson, that the goodes
of the soule be all golde, the goodes
of the worlde be all leade: all
thoughe that golde is euer better
than lede, yet there may be a great
quātite of leade, yt shal be valured
aboue the smalle portion of golde.
So in your phantasy a great gaines
& lucre of the worldly goodes
may seme better than a smal point
of our soules substaunce. Wherfore,
he wyll conclude, that with a

lyttel losse of honestie or goodnes,
we maye venture to gette a greate
aduauntage in this worlde: and
some littel small portion we maye
borowe of our soule, to wynne by
that meanes a great summe of riches.
Beware good withipoll, of
suche reasonnyng, and to the deth,
to gayne al the hole royalte of this
hole worlde, neuer trespas against
your soule in the smallest iote that
can be imagined. As if ye might
be made a lorde of greate myght &
power with abundance of possessions
and goodes, onelye for the
speakynge in wyttenesse of one
worde agaynste the trouthe, with
grudge of your conscience: for
sake you all that offer, rather then
you wolde fele the priuey bytte of
your offence. For if you loke well,
you shal see, that there is a greatter

valu of gaynes in the smallest
iote of vertue, then is in the moste
wer of riches: & yt ye losse of ye smallest
mote, perteining to your soules
state, is more hurte & domage,
thē the refusing or forgoing of al yt
is vnder heuē. So that I say, it is
not like betwene the soules goodis
& the goodes of this world, as it is
betwene golde and lead valured aboue
a peny weight of gold: where
there is no title so small of vertue,
that is not to be valured without
comparison aboue the hole power
of the erth and sees, throughe out
Asia, Affrica, and Europa. The
profe of my saieng dependeth here
vpon, that euery iote, euery title, euery
mote of vertu, wherin is conteined
ye soules welthie state, hath
appointed his propre state & place
in the heuē & kingdom of god: & al

the spiritual goodes, both small &
great be vnder god, of whom vertue
receiueth hir rewarde: Of the
which reward he yt leseth any maner
portion, loseth more than the
losse of the hole dominiō & rule of
this world, whose prince is the diuel,Diuel.
yt reineth ouer al them, as ouer
his bonde seruātes, the which can
finde in their hartes to forsake vertue
to wynne these false and vaine
goodes, that stande to vs in no erthily
stede: but for the shorte tyme
of a fewe yeres in this life, where ye
possessiōs of vertu be euerlasting.
Thus I shewe you good Edmōd,
that your care to get these worldly
goodes muste be subdued vnder
due order, as in his thyrde place.
But what be these goodes, & what
wey you may laufully gette them,
I doubte not, but your father wyll

in tyme conuenint shewe you. He
is of that sorte of men, the whiche
hath by longe approued honestie
purchased hym a good name, and
is therby beloued and regarded of
good men: whose steppes if you
folowe, you shal by goddes grace
come to lyke worshyppe, and be of
lyke or more habilitie to leaue to
your childrē sufficiēt to passe this
lyfe with. Here remēbre, the more
your father loueth you, the lesse is
your thirde care: and the lesse that
your thirde care is, the more leiser
you haue to think vpon your chief
iewell, the whiche god hath gyuen
you to be ordered after your wyll,
in the whiche iewel you shall after
this lyfe well passed, haue the fruition
of goddis presence, wherein
resteth the ioye ineffable of the blessed
lammes. The gotis, that is to

say, the gredie soules of this third
care, the which neuer mendeth, or
very lyttel and weakely mendeth,
the fyrste care, shal remayne for euer
more, in the peineful darknes,
where is nothynge but cryeng out
and lamentynge with frettyng of
stomakes, and snarrynge of teth,
as the gospell shall teache you: In
the whiche boke of god, you shall
here what an harde thyng it is for
a ryche man to entre in to heuen:
bicause that most commonly riche
men spend al theyr care & thought
out of order, onely for this worlde,
and seldome or neuer they thinke
of theyr soule: and whenne they
thynke thereof, they soo thynke,
that they put that care far vnder
the care of these worldely busines,
doynge clene contrarye to this order.
The whiche god wolde haue

vs to kepe. The which order thouh
you shal se very litel regarded of al
sortes of men, yet good Edmonde
regarde you it, & haue pite of them
yt regarde it not.Mat. 20. et. 22. It is the sonne of
god, the which saith, many be called
to heuen, but fewe be chosen.
Enforce your selfe to be amonge
the few, & forsake ye multitude. Be
not drawē to an yuel opinion, neither
with the ensample of popis,
cardinalles, and priestes, nor with
ye ensāple of princes, lordes, knightes,
gentilmen, and marchātes, nor
yet with ye ensāpe, of mōkes, friers.
You may by your self know, what
is the right path, folowe you coragiously
ye same, & forsake the cōmō
hie way of sīners. Yet before I leue
this .iii. care, I wyll shew you my
mind, what is chiefly in this ꝑte to
be cared fore: as the best portion of

worldely ryches. Surely I reken
no possession of londes, nor yet no
substāce of marchādise, nor yet no
abūdance of money, to be cōparable
to a good frēd.A good frende. Therfore aboue
all things in this worlde, procure
to haue plētie of frēdes, & make of
them your cōpte, as of your best &
most p̄cious goodes. Alweys your
frende shall be more profitable to
you, then any tresure or power beside
can be. Nowe you shall know
them yt be worthy to be your frendis,
& by what menes, & what wey
frendes be both gotten & also kept,
ye shall best lerne in Ciceros littell
boke De amicitia.
               Cicero de amicitia. I cā not say in this
thing any point that is left of him.
wherfore I remit you to yt worke.
An other point touching this care
of worldly goodes is to vse accordingly
your wife, whē ye time shall

               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉

come, that you shall haue one. For
to opteyne substance of goodes, it
lieth as moche in the wife, to kepe
that you bringe home,House wife. as in your
trauayle to bryng home. And surely
onelesse she be the keper and sparer,
the husbande shal littel go forwarde
in his labour of gettynge:
And the very trouth is, that there
is noo yuelle houswyfe, but for hir
fautes the good man is to be blamed.
For I am vtterly of this opiniō,
that the mā may make, shape,
and forme the womā, as he wil. I
wolde go farther with you in this
thing, & shew somwhat of ye wey to
order your householde, if I sawe
not this matter so largelye intreatedde
of dyuers phylosothers, of
whome ye shall here as moche, as
may be said in this thing. Specially
I wolde you redde with most

diligence, the propre boke, yt XenophonXenoph.
writeth herof, it is called oeconomia,
               oeconomi.
that is to say, the craft to order
and kepe an howse, where this
auctour geueth suche counsell, for
all the course of an honeste mans
lyfe in this worlde to growe in ryches,
vnder the meanes of discretion
and wisedome, that noo man
in my mynde can sey more therin,
or better: the whiche iudgemente
of myne I doubt not but you wyll
approue, whenne you haue redde
the sayde worke: it is translated
out of greke in to latine by one Raphaelle,
but in his translation the
worke leseth a greatte parte of the
grace, that hit hath in the greke
tonge, and also his translation in
many places is false: and it playnly
appereth, that Raphaell vnderstode
not wel, what Xenophō wrot

in greke. I haue therfore, for dyuers
of my frendes sake translated
the same worke out of greke tonge
in to englyshe, and you shall haue
the same with my good wyl, when
your pleasure is to rede it.
            ¶I wolde also for some parte of
this thirde care, haue you rede the
vii. & the .viii. boke of Aristot.Aristot. politikes,Politic.
for to here his counsel concernynge
the bryngyng vp of children,
and the vse of other certayne
thinges.
            ¶This is the effecte & some, myn
owne good Edmond, of my coū
               cell,
touching the .iii. said thinges:
in ye which I reken to rest the hole
course of your lyfe, and if you obserue
& kepe them in theyr degrees
& order accordingly, you shall surely
content god, nexte please your
selfe, & thyrdly satisfie the worlde.

On ye cōtrary parte, misorder these
caris, & you shal rūne in to the vengeāce
of god, into the hate of your
selfe, and in to the indignation of
al men. Be holde I pray you these
hungrie and gredy wretches, that
make of the thyrde thynge theyr
fyrste thought and care, what life
lead they in the sclander of al their
acqueintāce? what deth haue they
in the sight of theyr priuy cōsciēce,
whan they remembre their false
swearinges, their deceitful bargaines,
their playne robberies, theyr
pollinges, their cruelle exactions,
their oppressinges of ye poore men?
what hope haue they of goddes fauor,
whā they remēbre al their care
& thought hath bē for the welth of
this world? ye which whē they leue
& forsake, they despeire of al other
welthines: in as moch their mīdes

neuer ernestly cared for that welth,
the whiche euer endureth.
            This remembraunce of theyr misorder,
is an heuy burthen to their
consciēce. It can not be otherwise.
Cōsyder nowe agayne, how clere
and lyght his mynde is, that in all
his lyfe hath euer chiefely studied
for the soules welth, that remembreth
euer howe his care hath ben
for the rewarde of vertue? Of this
man howe well doth euery manne
speake? what ioy and comforte enbraceth
the consciēce of this man,
whē the hande of god calleth him
frome his shorte lyfe, to that perpetualle
lyfe, for the whiche he
hath so moche labored. The tother
be he neuer so rich, is called a false
felowe a wretched knaue. This
man be he neuer so pore, is called
an honest person, a good man, for

whome the heuē gatis standeth open,
whilste the tother falleth to
endles turmentes. This is thend
of misorder, & this is thēd of good
order, in breaking and kepyng the
degres of the forsaid thre thinges.
Wherfore I can not warne you
to often, to take hede of this councel:
and you can not to often here
the same. The ieoperdie is not
small, if you shoulde forgette this
tale, hit is no lesse perill then vtter
shame in this worlde, with deathe
euerlastyng. where so euer is sclā
               der,
there is shame: greater sclander
there can be none, than foloweth
on all sydes the vniuste riche
man. And he euer, where some euer
he be, gathereth uniustely ryches,
that careth chiefely for these
worldely promotions, the whiche
man hath (I saye) bothe in his life

extreme shame, & also after this life
extreme punishement. You be not
forboden to get riches, but the vnordinate
desire of geting riches is
abominable both in ye sight of god
& mā: your desire is vnordinate, if
it be not ordred vnder the degre of
your chif care, as now oftē inough
hath bē repeted. I wolde now leue
you & make an end of these .3. cares
& studies, apꝑteinīg to your soule,
body, & goodes: sauinge yt bicause
I somwhat know your dispositiō,
& wil particularly touch one thing
or two that you muste most ernestly
beware of: bicause you be moch
naturallye inclyned otherwyse to
falle in to certayne poyntes, that
sore disquieteth the minde, hurteth
the body, and hindreth the profites
of this lyfe: so that frendly I wyll
admonishe you of one or two thinges,

that perteyne to all your three
charges.
            ¶Take hede my good Withipoll
of your passion toward wrath,wrath, ire, & anger. ire,
& anger: resist as moch as you can
the prouocatiō of your stomake to
this vehemēt pāge. Be not light ered
in hering a word of displesure:
Consider the kinde of life that you
take: you must be cōuersante with
many and diuers marchantis, amonge
whom euery one thynketh
him self both lorde & mayster. In
suche company chanceth to be oftē
dysdayneful lokes, proude coūtenāces,
scornes, mockes, scoffes, cō
               parisons,
bytyng tauntes, odyous
checkes, spytefull reproches, with
frettinge enuye, and with manye
other corrupte affections, whereby
ryseth moche debate, and some
tyme there foloweth plaine furie,

that maketh men more lyke wylde
beastes, for the tyme of their madnes,
than to reasonable creatures.
It is a great grace in him yt feleth
his harte agreued,Furrie. & yet sheweth
not outwardly his grefe. This prudent
dissimulation more auengeth
his quarel, thā any rēdring of any
wordes coude do.Pacience. For it is a deedly
stroke, that the pacient manne
gyueth in this softe and mylde suffering
the ragis of an angrie fole.
Loke wel vpon them both, he that
suffrethe and saythe naughte, is
like a manne, the rayler or taunter
is lyke a beaste or a foole. The sufferer
alway both in his tyme of sufferynge
and also afterward, when
all fumes be cessed, hath a greate
prayse of all that beholdeth hym:
and euer he hath cause of reioising
and gladnes, where the tother fretteth

with hym selfe: and scant the
nexte daye after he can shewe his
face: behynde whose backe his cō
               pany
reporteth the folly of his hastynes,
& sore they blame hym for
his vncomly behauour. Let ye quarel
be what you lust, euer by your
pacience & sufferāce, you shal haue
aduauntage of hym that prouoketh
you, and finally, for your often
forbearynge, a name of sobrenes,
wisedome, & discretion: wherof
shal folowe great credence, & a
loue of al honest persons towarde
you, where he yt wil suffre naught,
but wyll ease his stomacke, in gyuinge
mocke for mocke, checke for
checke, shalbe taken for a wrangler,
a brauler: and fewe or noone
honeste men wyll gladlye meddyll
with hym.
            ¶To rule this passion of ire, you

shalbe moch more strōger thā min
exhortatiō cā make you, if you wil
(as I haue councelled you before)
haue PlatoPlato. your familiar. And SenecaSeneca▪
               
shalbe a mere phisition for to
helpe your mind ayenst these greuoꝰ
pāges. The best is not to be angrie,
the nexte is not to shewe in
wordes or coūtenāce your angre,
but remēbre, if it chāce that you be
angred, and that you haue in shewynge
your angre moued & sturred
some other to be displesed: beware
that you nourisshe not this
grefe, spit out of your stomake all
peuishnes, & seke atonmēt as sone
as it cā be possible. If the ꝑty speke
not to you, speke you to hym, it is
no shame to be agreed, it is a foule
shame to cōtinue in anger: & in the
mene season your prayer to god is
voide. For out of charitie, & out of

fauor & grace of god. It is ye groūd
& only stay of our religion, to loue
to gether like brotherne, al vnder
one fader yt loketh ouer vs in heuē,
for whose sake, se yt you neuer slepe
with grudge ayenst any ꝑson: in so
doinge you shal finally opteine, yt
no man wil bere you grudge, & for
your loue you shal haue loue plentifully
of god & of ye world: Begin
mine owne good withipoll to ouer
throw this bestely passiō of wroth,
before your age make your stomak
stubborne. Ouercome now in time
sullines, before men haue regarde
of your displesure: accustome your
selfe with mildenes, softnes, paciēce,
sufferāce, & specially with gentilnes,
that can not abyde an harte
mindefulle of any grefe. To your
enferior be pitiful, buxome, & redy
in offering your selfe, both to take

and kepe frendeshyp with your felowe
and companion. Striue not,
compare not: but alwayes studye
to encrease familiaritie by louinge
maners, and easly forget iniuries.
Let no displesure be taken of you,
howe many someuer dyspleasures
be gyuen you. To your better and
superiour if you obey & giue place,
it shall be reputed to your commē
               dation
and prayse. There is noo
man so vile, but his loue may stād
in stede to you, and of the pooreste
mans hatred, you may haue some
tyme hurte.
            ¶Thus I say both for the worldly
wisedome, and also for the bondes
of your faythe, you muste take
hede to this warnynge: & the more
ye be enclyned not only to be quickely
angrie, but also to nourysshe
lōge your angre: the more diligēce

you must bitimes take, to correcte
and amende your nature, remembrynge
alway your chief care, that
perteyneth to the fyrste thyng, the
whiche is with nothing more hurted
and hyndered, in his waye to
grace warde, then with the breaking
of loue and charitie. And as
often as you be angrie, soo often
plucke you your soule frō the presence
of god, by the same passion.
Also you disquiete your body, and
oftē times folow diseses by ye fiers
pursuinge of a grefe, & sometime
by rages chanceth plaine bataile,
& therof your body stādeth euer in
ieoꝑdye. Also nothing more hyndreth
ye gaines of your .iii. care, thē
doth vnpacient chidynge with other.
For it causeth manye to forbeare
companye: and by that euer
foloweth losse of occupienge. And

sometyme a good worde behynde
your back may auātage you more
thē a longe sayling in to Spaine,
and an yuel worde lykewyse may
do you more hurte than a losse of a
shyppe: Let no man haue cause to
be angrye with you, and euer you
be sure to be wel reported by.
            One other thynge or two I wolde
warne you of, with as many wordes
as I haue done of the said passiō,
if I thought not yt by ye reding
of the said workes, you shal moche
better than I can shewe you, not
only fle frō al misbehauors, & corrupt
vses of yl fātasies, but also folowe
ye clene piked vertues, and by
your own study grow to be a ꝑfect
mā, in ye fauor of god & al other. No
mā shal coūsel you better, then you
shall doo your owne selfe, if in reding
you wil examin secretly your

cōscience, whether such ꝓpretis be
in you as you rede, or no. If they
be in you & be dispreised, determine
with your selfe to amend them: if
they be not in you, & be good, determyne
with your selfe to get them.
As in reding you shal here aboue
all other fautes dispraised, an vntru
tōge,Vntrewe tonge. which bringeth a mā out
of credēce, a thing very hurtful for
marchātes, whose craft you be like
to exercise: & beside it sore offēdeth
ye eares of god, to here his best beloued
creature make yt noise ayēst
his knowlege & priuey conscience:
where nothinge garnisheth mans
voice better thē trouth of his tale.
This thing chiefly apꝑteineth to
the care of the soule, yt is your first
charge. It maketh also for the .ii.
and for the .iii. care. For surely whē
the minde is disquieted with the remembraunce

of the offence in lyenge,
the body hath his parte of yl
reste: And by the same vntrue spekynge
moche hurte and domage
ensueth agaynste your credence, a
thinge I say moste necessary to be
kepte and maynteyned of al them,
yt seke by marchādise any lucre or
gaynes. Therfore let your mynde
my good Withipol neuer delite to
vtter any lie. Eyther speke not, or
speke truly. what faute so euer you
may do, let it not be defēded with a
false tale: for yt were to fle out of the
smoke in to ye fire, as to do a worse
faute in choking an yll, and in the
mene season your soule suffereth a
sore stroke. This euer as you rede
of this matter, haue minde of your
selfe to take fruit of your redynge.
            ¶In consideration also of al thre
partes, that is to say, both for the

defence of your soules state, & for
the welth of your bodye, and also
for the worldly goodes sake, vse in
all your actes a certayne cōmendable
wisedome, neuer to be none
of these busy medlers: Leue other
mens fautes, leue correcting, that
you haue no power in, leaue teachinge
of that you knowe not. Let
the gospel be ordered by them, that
be admitted for doctours therof.
            Let the prestes be blamed of them
that haue the rule of the order. Let
common ceremonies and all olde
customes alone. Put euer your
trust in the power and wyl of god,
and obey to he consent of the churche,
without quarellynge or resystynge.
Go you fourth your waye
after the meke steppes of a trewe
christen man. Let the worlde bluster
and blowe as hit wyll, be you

none of the blowers. Scurge who
wyl, be you none of the scourgers.
For beleue me, sooner shal the rod,
than the chylde yt is beaten, be cast
in to the fier. In eschewinge all
medlyng, you shal saue your goodes,
you shal kepe your body from
trauayle, and by the same meanes
you shal best prouide a sure buckeler
for your soule.Obedience. For vnder the
clooke of obedience, chaunce what
chance shal, your soule is euer sure
for takynge any hurte: the iustice
of god wyll kepe you harmelesse,
howe some euer the tempeste of enormities
ouerfloweth this world.
If you shoulde be malaperte,malapert. and
presume to be a doer: reporte me to
you, what may in this world happen
to your vndoing both in goodes
& bodye, & by the same trouble
you shalbe caste from the succour

of god, who abideth not any presū
               tion.
You falle in to presumption,presumption.
when you grudge agaynste your
rulers, though they be worthy of
all disprayses. You presume, when
you meddel with them, that be not
vnder you. You presume, whan
you take in hande to amende this
or that, where your parte is not to
speake. And specially you be presumptuous,
when you dare crake,
that you knowe goddes wil. Leue
therfore my good Edmond, al maner
of medlynge, and praye to god
to accepte your obedience. Praye
also bitterly, that his wyll may be
fulfilled in this worlde amōge vs,
as the angels fulfille in heuen.
            Thus pray, and meddille no farther.
For I assure you, it is so to
be done.
            ¶Many my thynges myghte be

sayd for these .iii. cares, but to you
I recken it inough this moch that
I haue here touched. yet one word
or .ii. more shall not be suꝑfluous.
For I wolde not haue you deceyued
by any word that I haue here
vsed: As perauenture you might
be, if I shuld thus leaue you. Seinge
that I haue bed you fyrste to
care for your soule, next to care for
your body, and thyrdely to care for
the goodes of this worlde. Moreouer
I sayd, there be goodes of the
soule, goodes of the body, goodes
of this lyfe. But lette these wordes
be to you as not spoken in their exacte
and propre signification. For
to speake truely, there is noo care
but one, nor there be noo goodes
but of one. We muste haue a certayne
slyght regarde to our body,
& a slighter regarde to the worlde:

but care we may not for neither of
these two. You knowe, that to care
were to take an inwarde weyghty
thought: the whiche muste not be
taken, but for a thynge of greate
worthynes, and also of more suretie,
than is either our body, or the
worlde. Only our soule is the thīg
to be cared fore: and these smal cō
               modities,
with certayn praty pleasures
of the body, and the worlde,
can not truelye be named goodes:
for in very dede they be not good.
For this worde good includethe a
dignitie in hym that sauoureth of
god and heuen: So that tho thinges
be onely worthye to be called
goodes, the which haue a ꝑpetuitie
and stedfastnesse of godly substaunce:
Other thinges variable,
chaungable, flytterynge, suche as
maye be taken from vs mawgree

our heed, be not worthye of this
hyghe name. Neyther the bodye
nor yet fortune hath any goodes:
our spirite & mynde only hath thinges,
that truly be called goodes, ye
whiche be so constantly and surely
ours, that euer they remayne with
vs in spite of all chaunces, and all
our aduersaries. Mercy, pitie, deuotion,
mekenes, sobrenes, pacience,
faythefulnes, charitie, and
such other vertues be the very tru
goodes, the which we may iustely
reken ours, & for them we shulde
continually labour. For these be
the substaunce that our soule must
haue, to be with them rychely decked
and garnished, that we maye
haue our holy day array, and our
nuptial vesture according, to com
to the great feast, that Christ saith
we shall ones be called to.
            
               
All these false goodes of the bodyes
lustynges,false goodes. beautie, fayrenes,
strengthe, helthe: and also these
triflynge goodes of Fortune, royall
houses, large heritance, great
rentes, implementis, costly apparayle,
golde, syluer, honour, power,
frendshyppe, nobilitie, and
what you wyll els in this worlde:
All these vayne thynges, bothe of
bodye and fortune, can make but
a raggyd garmente for our soule,
the whiche shall be with extreme
shame drawen frome the sayde
feaste, if hit come in goddes presence
with these beggerlye ragges.
This sayenge good Wythipolle,
I speake to ease and comforte
your mynde: for by this tale
that is trewe, you nowe lerne, that
al though before I sayd you shuld
haue thre cares in this lyfe, yet in

dede you haue but one care, the
whiche is to care for the true goodes,
that be to be purchased for the
soules welthy state. Wherfore of
your three cares, stryke of two, if
you wyll speake of ernest care. Yet
I wyl sticke a lytle more with you
in this poynte: for fayne I wolde
you shulde se a true marke, wherby
you may gouerne and rule all
your phantasies and opinions. If
your phantasie be well directed to
the true marke, you cā not misse of
the ryght pathe to vertue, the whiche
bryngeth man thither, where
he shall receiue the inestimable rewarde
for his trauayle. I say your
soule onely must be cared for: and
this onely care must be to get and
kepe the true goodes, that be only
the goodes of the mynde: Other
goodes be not called proprely goodes.

you se howe these praty commodities
of the bodye, & also these
small gyftes of fortune, mawgree
our heed be taken from vs, as I
cā not escape alway sykenes, I cā
not escape misfortunes: I can not
flee frome the cruel handes of tyrātes,
I may be cast into tortures,
I may rotte in fetters, I may lose
al my substance, by water, by fyer,
by theues, or by other violent robberye.
Agaynst these chances no
man cā resist, no care nor thought
preuayleth to assure vs, eyther of
our bodyes or of suche goodes.
            Wherfore lerne you, that I say before
god, we haue no goodes, but
onely the goodes of the spirite and
mynde, the whiche goodes (as I
haue sayde) be so sure ours, yt they
can not be takē from vs, but with
our owne wyll consentynge to the

losse of them. In this spirytualle
possession, euery man is an inuincible
emperour. We may dispise al
violence of princis, al worldly chā
               ces
touching the kepyng of vertu,
maugre the holle power of the diuel,
& all his retinue. Here of lerne
and marke myn Edmonde, wherin
you maye be hurted, that your
care may the better be bestowed.
            For to care wher you haue no hurt
it is nedeles: or not to care, where
you be hurted, is a blind ignorāce.
            ¶We be hurted whā we lose any
parte of goddis fauour, we lose
goddis fauour, when we lose any
goodes of the mynde: we lose the
goodes of the mind, whē we either
reioice of ye hauing bodily & worldly
goodes, or make sorowe of the
lackynge the same. we be not hurted,
whā god cōtinueth his fauor,

whē we decay not in the strēgthis
of minde: we decay not in the strēgthes
of minde whē we be not ouercome,
neyther with the gladnes of
the bodis and worldes prosperite,
nor with bewaylynge of theyr aduersite.
Thus you se, nother in the
goodes of the body, nor in the goodes
of the world, you cā other take
or escape hurte: it is only the vertu
of your minde, wherin you muste
serch, wheder you be safe or hurted.
            ¶Now whē you knowe the place
of your hurte, knowe also what
may do you hurte, that you maye
be more charie of your hurter.
            You se ones, the place wherin you
maye be hurted, is your secrete
mynde, a very sure place. For it
is not fyre nor water: nor thefe
that can come there: it is no princis
sworde, that cā perce into this

place it is no misslucke of fortune
that can lyght vpon your spirite:
finally there is no diuel of hel, that
can fasten a stroke vpon you, to do
you in this place any hurte. This
shulde be a greatter gladnes vnto
you to considre, in howe stronge a
tower you be from all hurte: but
se thenne agayne, who hit is that
maye hurte you. For surelye you
cā not be hurted but of one, in whō
is power to do hurte: this is your
owne free wyl. This wyl of yours
& nothing els, hath power to hurt
you. Se shortely in ensāple, howe
your lādes be takē frō you, you be
spoyled of your goodes, fire burneth
vp your house, you be haled
to prisō, you be beatē, you be torne
with whips, you be drawē vpon ye
rackes, you lie in chaynes, you cōe
forth to opē shame, you suffre cold,

you be gnawen with hunger and
thyrste, finallye you be putte to
death. what of al this? yet I can
not saye, that you be hurted: I se
that with al this the fauor & grace
of good may cōtinue with you, as
it did with the holy martyrs. And
also before Christis passion holye
Iob suffred al this, & was not hurted.
This is a great cōfort for you,
to se that nothing cā hurt you but
only your owne selfe. This is the
hyghe grace of god, that so hathe
made man to be ouer al a myghty
conquerour, that can take no hurt
but of hym selfe. Wherfore I trust
you will lyue euer safe and sownd.
For I wyll not thynke, that euer
you wil be so mad, as to hurt your
selfe. Than for these trifles of the
body and worlde, take no care: it
it is neyther the seconde thyng nor

the thirde thynge, that canne be so
vnto you, that in eyther of theym
you can de hurted. Marie take
hede, lest by the displeasures done
in the second and in the thyrd, you
of madnes take occasion to be hurted,
and wyllyngelye hurte your
selfe in the fyrste thinge, the which
onely is the place, where you may
be hurted. And none besyde your
owne wyl hath power to hurt you
there: as if in the tyme of the losse
of worldly goodes, you wil fret in
anger, you wil dispise god, you wil
curse and ban, you wyl enforce to
be auēged, you crye out in furie &
madnes: now take you thought &
care, for surely you be hurted, and
your chief iewel hath a great losse.
For god withdraweth from your
soule a great part of his grace: so
that this hurt you do to your own

selfe by this frowardenes. Lykewyse
whylste your body is turmē
               ted,
eyther with sykenes or otherwise:
if you therfor forsake paciēce,
and swelle in wrothe: you be than
hurted in dede, but of noone other
person besyde your selfe onely.
            Thus you may take frō the secōd
and the thyrde, in the whiche two
you can not be hurted, an occasion
to hurte your selfe, & to haue therof
a greatte cause of a sore and an
erneste care, for the peril that your
soule therby falleth in.
            ¶To confirme you the faster in
these ryghte opinions, I wolde
you redde the lyttell boke of Epictetus,Epicteꝰ.
intitled his Enchiridion,
well translated into latyne by Angelus
Politiane: But to saye
the trouth the worke is so briefely
and darkely written, that without

a coment or a good mayster, you
shall not perceyue the fruite of the
texte. I am in mynde, if I maye
haue therto leysure, to translate
the cōment of Simplicius vppon
the sayd worke: and then shal you
finde suche swetenes in that boke,
that I beleue hit will rauishe you
in to an hygher contemplation,
than a greatte sorte of our religious
men come to. And one thinge
beleue me, my good withipol, that
in redynge of these olde substanciall
workes, the whiche I haue named
vnto you, shal besyde the perfection
of knowlege, gender a certayne
iudgement in you, that you
shal neuer take delite nor pleasure
in the trifles and vayne inuentions
that men nowe daies write, to
the inquietinge of all good order:
by reason that the moste parte of

men that rede these new flittering
workes, lacke perfecte iudgement
to dyscryue a weyghtye sentence
fro me a lyghte clause, the whiche
iudgemente can not be gotten, but
by a longe exercysynge of our wittes
with the best sorte of writers.
            And to me it is a pitiful thynge, to
beholde the folishe dremes of these
yonge clerkes in mens handes: &
to se these noble olde workes of the
holy fathers and philosophers lye
vntouched. Where if these newe
wryters speke any thynge well, it
is piked out of this aunciente bokes.
But what so euer these petye
clarkes pike out nowe a dayes, for
the mooste parte it is defaced and
broughte out of good fashiō with
theyr yuel handelynge.
            ¶I wyl nowe make an ende, it is
sufficient to a wyllynge mynde, suche

as I truste is in you, to haue
with a frendes fynger the way appoynted,
where you must walke, if
you wil procede in vertu: the whiche
is onely the thynge, that maketh
a man boothe happye in this
worlde, and also blessed in the
worlde to come. Beleue you
my counsayle, and vse
the same, orels
hereafter
you
will paraduenture bewayle
your negligence.
Fare ye
wel.
