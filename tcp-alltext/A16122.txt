SEing that all persones can not rede or
vnderstonde all bokes / to thētent that
every man may knowe whate ys
the foundacyon of all the scriptures / and
whate thinge they do teache vs. I haue
shortly compyled in this present boke / the
foundacyon and the somme of the holy scripture
of the which the hede and princypall
is the faith 
                  •
               from whome procede hope
and charite. To thintent that euery mā
may knowe / whate he shall beleve / whate
he shall hope / & whye he shall love god / 
and howe god is oure father / and we hys
children / and howe that we be enheriters
of the kingdome of god / as shewith vnto
vs saint Paul in all his epistles / in divers
chapters
                  •
                / whiche be many tymes alleged / 
and recyted / in this present boke. Also howe
that without oure merites we be iustified
to thintent that we shuld not put oure
trust in oure good workes / as dyd the
Iues. Neverthelesse albeit that I wryte
in this boke that God iustifieth vs wyth
out oure good workes and merites / it ys
not myne entent to discounsell eny mā to
do good werkes / but myne euient is to teche
all persones howe they shall do the

werkes / and that they shall not trust vpō
theire good werkes / nor in theym to seke
theire hel
                  •••
               
               ▪ but all only in the feith of Iesu
Christ / and in the grace of god.
            This faith had Abraham / as writeth
saint Paule vnto the Romayns.Ro. 4. For Abraham
beleved agaynst hope in hope.
That is to saye / that whiche by mannes
nature and vertue was impossible he beleved
alwayes hit shulde come to passe / evyn
as god had promysed them. So must
every christen lyve ageinste hope in hope / 
that is to sey / hit behoveth that he repute
all his good workes for sinne / and thinke
that if god wolde iudge him accordinge to
his workes he might not be saved. For if
I haue done eny good hit is of God / and
not of me / for. I haue done it by the grace
of God / and therby I deserve no reward
And if I haue done eny thinge of my silfe
without the grace of god / hit is ypochrisye
and greate sinne / and therby I deserve
euerlastinge deth / wherfore then shall I
trust in my good workes / for I haue no
good workes / all my goodnesse belongeth
to god. So shulde a christē hūble him silfe
and repute all his good workes for sinne

as truely they be As sheweth vnto vs Esaye
saying / all oure rightuousnes be as
a clothe polluted with the floures af a woman.Esa. 64▪
               
And when the person so distrusteth
of him silfe / and of his good workes he shall
hope agayn ageinst hope / and shall trust
in the mercy of God / and shall beleve
forth on certaynly that he shalbe saved bycause
of the worde of God. For god hath
promysed to vs his realme to all theym / 
that trust in him / and god is faithfull and
veritable in his wordes / wherfore seyng
that god hath promysed it vnto vs▪ let vs
beleve it stebfastly / and haue ferme fayth
that we shalbe saved not by oure deserving / 
but by the promyses of god. And so
it behoveth that euery christen dispere ād
hope (as dyd Abraham) dispeyre of him silfe / 
and then a newe to trust in the worde of
god. And these be the two thinges which
the lawe and the gospell doth. The lawe
maketh vs to dispeyre / because that we
never fulfill the cōmaundementes of god▪
These gospell (that is to say the grace of
the newe testament / maketh vs agayn certeynly
to hope and to trust. And for to teache
these two thynges be wrytten all the

cript
                  •
               res. The parson shall alweyes abide
                  ••
               
humylyte and alweyes thynke that
if god wolde iudge hym according to hys
workes he shulde never come vnto helth.
As sheweth vnto vs Iesus christe in.Lu. 17 S.
Kuke sayng / when ye haue done all the
thinges whiche to you are commauded
say ye / we be vnprousitable servauntes / 
we haue done but oure dutye. And thys
is the verey Christen humylite / as in this
present boke shalbe more pleynly declared
And if we can thus repute all oure good
workes for sinne / ād in theym to have no
maner of trust and then ageyn beleve that
we shalbe saved by the promyses of god / 
we be the children of Abraham / of whome
all the scriptures bere witnesse that by
his faith he was iustified / and gat helth.
And for that cause he is called the father of
belevers and of the feithfull. And this ys
the fayth wherof I wryte here ī this boke
to thintent that all parsones myght come
to knowledge and knowe whate ys the
Christen sayth. Of the whyche all the scriptures
do speake / and namely the Gospell
after S. Iohn / and the epistles of S.
Paule / for heryn do these two apostles cō
               prehend

all other scripture.
            And for bicause that it behoueth that
the parson beleve that his faith iustifieth
him / and not his workes I haue shortly
compyled here and declared howe the fayth
doth iustifie vs / and howe we be the
children of God / and howe we must serve
oure father by charite / and howe that
we shalt nothyng doubt of oure helth bycause
of the wordes of God. And when
a parson getteth thys hope he learneth to
bere pacyenly all tribulacyon and adversite.
For he knoweth that this lyfe ys not
hys lyfe / and hath greate desyre aftrr the
other lyfe / and holdeth not this lyfe for
hys. And this maketh the fayth the whiche
ys alwayes affectuously attendaunte
after Christ oure espouse. But he that
hath not this fayth is all desolate when he
hath mysfortune / and yf to hym yt happon
well he gyveth hym silfe to voluptuosite
and sinne. And for bicause he hath
no hope of the everlasting life he thinkes
in him silf I will vse this life as long as it
is lēt me / And that he doth bicause he knoweth
not whate oure feith is / & whate our
hope is / & howe that we be the children, of
God.
            
               
To thintent therfore that none gyue
him silfe to sinne by desperacion I have
shortly compyled in this present boke / howe
that we be iustified with out oure merites.
For when eny parson hath done
his best with all his power / as I haue seyd / 
then let him say yet / that he is an vnproufitable
servaunt. And the humble her
te wherby he knowlegith his imperfection
maketh that his sinnes / his evell thoughtes
and the fragilite of his flesshe to
him be pardoned of god and that lytell that
he hath / god gyveth it him of him silfe / 
and god is his iustice / that is to saye / god
maketh him rightuous, for Iesu christ hath
satisfied for vs vnto his hevēly father / 
for to come in socoure to oure infirmite.
And this describeth saint Paule in his first .viij.
chapters vnto the Romayns / and
in the first epistle vnto the Corinthyans / 
and saynt Iohn in the seconde chaptre of
his first epistle. And of this mater treateth
this present boke.
            The last part of this boke sheweth howe
all estates shulde lyve / if they will lyve
according to the gospell. Myne intent
is not to refourme all estates aswell espirituell

as seculer. For of that I will not
presume. But I shewe alonely by the scriptures
howe we shulde lyve if we wolde
lyve according to the gospell / to thintēt
that every man may knowe / howe farre
his life is separate from the doctrine of Iesu
christ / and that then wyth the grace of
god he may amende and refourme his lyfe
him silfe.
            Nether teache I / that one shulde not
obey vnto the superiours 
                  〈…〉
               
but I teache them by whate meane they
shall knowe howe they shulde lyve / and
when they do not so lyve that then they
knowlege theyre defautes / & do diligence
so to lyve. For els were better before god

And yet allweyes

we haue the
verey true fayth.
Saint Paul the worthy apostell doth
exhorte vs to no vertue so strongly as
vnto the faith. And he in all his epistles

                  ••
               ayseth nothinge so moche as the faith.
Therfore it must nedes be that it be a precyous
vertuē / for he wryteth not one epistle
which is not full of faith. We take the
faith for the beginnynge of christen life: but
truely he that hath parfaith faith the same
hath not onely begonne the christen lyfe / 
but hath fulfilled it. And this erroure comith
because we knowe not whate the fayth
is / nor whate thing a good christē ought

to beleve / for to be saved▪ we thinke
that when we be baptised / and when we
beleve that god is god that thē we shalbe
saved.Mar. 19 As writeth. S. Marke sayīg. He that
shal beleve & shalbe baptised shalbe saved.
But he that beleveth not shalbe
cōdēpned. It is truth / but emong a thousand
there is not one that knoweth whate
thing the baptesme betokeneth nor whate
thing he shall beleve.
            The water of baptesme taketh not away
oure sinne for then it were a precious
water▪ And then it be

the font eny more vertue in hir silf thē the
water that rynneth in the river of Ryne.Act. 8
For we may aswell baptyse in Ryne / as
in the font. When saint Phillip baptysed
Eunuchus the servaunt of Candace a quene
of Ethyope (as wryteth saint Luke in
the actes of thappostles) there was then
no halowed water / nor candell / nor salt / 
nor creame nether whyte abite / but he baptised
him in the first water they came to
vpon the way. Hereby mayst thou perceyve
that the vertue of baptesme lyeth not

he is made the childe of God and that god

                made certayne
that he shalbe saved. And is made parttaker
of the passion of Christ whereof the
baptesme hath his vertue.
            And when one ys baptysed he is borne
agayn / and getteth an other father / and
other bretheren for God ys made hys father / 
and he ys made the brother of Iesus
Christ: as wryteth Saynt Paule vnto
the Romayns where he calleth. Christ
a sonne first begotten emong other.Ro. 8. And
therfore is Christ called yn the holy scripture
the sonne fyrst begotten / for he ys
the first childe of hys father / and we all
are begotten afterward when we be baptysed.
And therfore is the baptesme called
in the holy scripture the seconde nati

Christ vnto Nicodemus) he may not 
                  •
               ntre
into the kyngdome of heven. For we
be therby borne agayn / and they that were

the children of the devell bicause of the
originall synne are made the children of
God by baptesme. As saith Saynt Paule
Christ hath healed vs by the bath of regeneracyon
and renovacyon of the holy
gost.Ephe. 2 And vnto the Ephesyans▪ we were
by nature the children of wrath: but whē
we were deed Christ hath viuified vs agayn
by his greate love / And thys shalt
thou vnderstond in this maner.
            There were sumtyme .ij. Adams / as
writeth saint Paule. The first Adā was
oure first father. The seconde and newe
Adam was Iesus Christ. For the sinne
of the olde Adam we were all children
of the devell made hys owne and subiected
vnto hym by oure synne. The seconde
Adam (that ys to sey Iesus Christ)
hath bought vs agayn / and hath put vs
yn lybertie / and hath made vs of the children
of deth / children of everlastynge lyfe,
and of the chyldren of wrathe children
of grace: For Iesu Christe hath by hys
deth foughe ageynste the devell hath vaynquysshed
the devell / and deth / and hath
taken away all theyre ryght they had over
vs.
            
               
Nowe then when we be baptised we
be made partakers of this grace / and so is
it come to oure proufit that Iesu christ dyed
for vs. For (as I haue nowe sayed) the
baptisme hath his vertue of the deth of Iesu
christ. Then when we be baptised / we
betoken that we will dye with Christ / we
betoken / I say / that we will dye as vnto
the lyfe passed as touching oure sinnes &
evill concupiscences: ād that / as saieth. S.
Paule / we must walke in a newe lyfe.Ro. 6
And therfore be we plonged vnder the water:
to thintent that by the maner of spekinge / 
we shuld be here deed and buryed / as
wryteth saint Paule vnto the RomaynsRo. 6.
Bretheren / sayth he / Esteme ye that ye are
deed as concerning sinne but alyde vnto
god: by Iesu christ oure lord. And yn
the same place: Ye are buryed with Christ
by baptesme into deth. So that we shall
not lyve after the lyfe of the world nor after
the lyfe of the flesshe but we must lyve
as the children of god. And oure lyfe shal
be hyd befor the world and also hyd with
Christ in god / as wryteth saint Paule saying:Col. 3
Yf ye be mortified and your life ys
hyd with Iesu christ ī god in whate tyme

that Iesu christ oure life shall shewe hym
silf then also shall ye be made manifest with
him in glory. Then when oure lord shal
come agayn at the last day of iudgemēt
oure life shalbe made open: but as long as
we lyve here we must lerne all to dye▪ For
we shall not repute this life that we haue
here for a lyfe.
            This life here is of the world and of
worldly thinges that is to sey of theym / 
that be estraungers to God that haue no
trust of the other life to come. Nether doo
they loke for it nor desyre it. Suche people
ioy of this world / for the world wyth
his vaine desyres and plesaunces belongeth
to theym.Iohn. 15. and, 16. And they theym silves be
also called the world in the holye scripture.
As sayeth oure lord Christ in saint Iohn.
You be not of the world / but I haue
chosen you from the world. And agayn.
The world shalbe ioyons and you shalbe
sory: Nowe call we all theym worldy
whiche be not monkes. Oure lord made
a distinction bytwene the world & hys
disciples before the monkes came into the
worlde. Wherfore they be not called the
world in holy scripture which be not mō
               kes:

but all those that lyve after the flesshe
whiche desyre not here to dye with Iesu
christ / and to be hydden here after to lyve
with God. All suche whatesoever they
be are worldly be he monke or chanone / 
nunne or Syster / nobill or vnnoble grete
or small. For (as I have sayed) the lyfe
of theym whiche apperteyn to God is here
hyd / and they seme to be deed before the
world. For they lyve not comunely according
to the lyfe of the world. And therfore
they be hated of the world / for they be
not of the world / as sayeth the Gospell in
this maner. They be not of the world / for
if they were of the world / the world surely
wolde love theym as his owne.Iohn. 15. But
for as moche as they (accordyng to theyre
promyse made at the font of baptesme) do
applye theym silves to renounce the pleasures
of the world and to dye with chryst
in killing of the desyres of the flesshe / and
also are strongly ageynst the appetites of
the flesshe in other by ensaumple of theyre
good lyving therfore be they persecuted of
the world.
            And hereby may we alweyes knowe
the disciples and children of God: yf they

love to gyther the one the other. And y
                  •
               
they lyve not here after the life of the world
nor after the pleasure of the flesshe / ād
if they do not repute this lyfe for a life / but
abide with a ioyfull hart the coming of oure
lord Iesu christ. Then shall theyre lyfe
be made open / and shall appere before
God.
            So shuld we all lyve here / as though
this life were not oure life. For we must
abide oure life before God / and we may
do none other thing in this life but fight.
Ageynst oure evell desires / and learne to
dye (for as the prophet Iob sayeth) the lyfe
of man is a batayle vpon erth / that is to
say a batayle in a goostly deth.Iob. 2 And
thys do we promyse to do
when we be baptised / and
we signifie evē the
same / when we
be plonged
vnder the
water.

            THen when we be baptised yt behoveth
vs to knowe surely and to beleve
that all oure sinnes to vs are
pardoned and that we be made the childrē
of god. For god is bycome oure father / ād
Iesus christ oure brother. And that same
right that Iesus christ hath vnto the glory
of his father / have we also gotten / for
the bretheren have egall right vnto theyre
fathers goodes. And this haue we not
gotten by oure good workes / for we haue
yet done no good: when we were baptised
But this comyth holly bi the grace of god
and by oure faith / by that we put oure hole
trust in hym / and that we knowlege hī
for oure lorde and savionre. And that we
beleve all that he hath done ād suffred for
vs. for he dyed to make vs to lyve.

                  Cor. 8 He became
lytell and poer to make vs greate

maner ye knowe the liberalite of oure lorde
Christ / whiche though he were ryche / 
yet for your sakes became poore: that ye
through his povertye myght be made ryche / 

for Iesus christ is holly gyven to vs
of his father / to thintent that he shulde make
vs greate ryche and happy by his deth
For we could not helpe oure silves & therfore
he was borne for vs. As saieth Esaie
A childe is borne to vs.Esa. 
                     •
                  
                For we were all
egally dettours / aud bound to god / by the
sinne of Adam.
            Then when we coulde not helpe oure
silves / for asmoche as we were servauntes
and subiectes vnto the devell / god hath
gyven to us .ij. no table giftes / ād hath
done .ij. thinges for the love that he hath
vnto vs. First that he hath bought vs ād
made vs fre from the devill / and from oure
sinnes. Secondly that he hath made vs
his children and heriters of his glorye / ād

And the water of the font doth nowe betoken
the water of the syde of Iesu christ
In this water be we purged and sanctified
by oure faith / to thintent that we shulde
come pure and clene before God / the
father whiche hath receyved vs for hys
children / and hath made vs enheritours
of his glorye / with hys sonne Iesu christ
oure brother. And this is the grace the
whiche comyth to vs and is gyven at the
font of baptesme.
            But to thintent that we shulde not be
vnkinde / therfore for this grace we do binde
oure silves ageyn and yelde vs vnto

him / promysing that we will serve him / &
denye the devell / & all his temptacion / pō

we oure name / & god hath writē vs
as in a rolle for his Champyons & servauntes / 
and so be we made propre to god.
For he is oure father / and we be his children.
            This baptesme was figured vnto vs
when the children of Israell went thorough
the redde see out of Egipt / &Exo. 1
                     •
                  
                when
Pharo with all his company was drowned
in the see. The children of Israell
went in the see all as though they had gone
into deth. But for bicause they beleved
vnto Moyses / they passed the water by
theyre fayth. And be (after the maner of
spekinge) gone out of the deth into lyfe.
when they hath gotten on the other syde / 
on londe Pharo folowed theym / and so
was drowned wyth his people. So doth
everyone vppon the font when he is baptised.
First he fle
                  •
               th from Pharo / when he
beginneth for to knowlege his subiection / 
and bondage by the which he was subiect
and servaunt vnto the devell / and when

he desyreth to be enfraunchised from hys
synne / and from Pharo that is the devell
But he may not escape from Pharo without
passyng through the redde see / that is
to say / he may not escape from the devell
without he must be baptised. And for bicause
that the children of Israell when they
sawe that Pharo folowed theym beleved
god / therfore vpon that faith in god / they
be entred into the see / as though they were
gone into deth. But by the meane of thre
faith / they haue passed the water and are
gone as from the deth vnto life.
            So if eny man will escape from the hō
               des
of the devill it behoveth him to entre
into the water. He entreth therin / as though
he ētred into the deth / for he promyseth
that he will dye as concernynge all his evell
desyres / and that he will here lyve before
the worlde as though he were deed
(that is to say) that he will not live as the
worlde lyveth / but will hyde ād cover his
life with god. And so entre we by faith into
the font (that is to
                  •
                say) by faith we enterpryse
to entre into the deth / not into corporall
deth / but into the deth of sinne / no
more willing to lyve in sinne. And yet all

be it that it seme to vs a pleasau
                  •
               t thinge
to lyve in sinne / and that we thinke yt an
harde thing / thus to entre into the see (that
is to sey / into this deth / we take alwayes
courage / and beleve & trust in the pnissaunce
and goodnesse of God / and so entre
we into the see (that is to sey) into this espirituell
deth / and we enterpryse and promyse
to dye as concerning oure sinnes. And
as by a stedfast faith and trust we dare begynne
to entre / so gyveth God vnto vs
grace and streyngth to passe through that
see / that is to say / through this espirituell
deth / and to come on londe on the other syde
(that is) vnto the everlasting lyfe. Pharo
(that is to sey) the devill with oure sinnes
pursue vs. but they drowne theym silves
in the water (that is to sey) the power
of the devill and of all oure sinnes perisshe
when we entre into the water with suche
a feith.
            Whē Pharo was deed then songe the
children of Israell / and thanked god / that
they were arryved a londe out of the water / 
as out of the deth. So lykewyse must
every christen / when out of this water / that
is to say / out of this espirituell deth he

comyth vnto life / that is to sey / when he
dyeth he shall thanke and preyse God bycause
he hath brought hym out of suche a
daunger / vnto the helth of euerlastyng life.
But as long as he is yet here in thys
worlde / he shalbe in the deeth / that is to
say / he shall alweyes dye spiritually / and
his life shalbe hydden byfore the worlde
with God. Here mayst thou well see how
that oure baptesme is signified by the redde
see / as writeth saynt Paule vnto the
Corinthyans saying.1. Cor. 10 Oure fathers were
all vnder a clowde / a
                  •
               d did passe the see all
and were all baptyzed in Moyses / in the
clowde / and in the see / and they all did eate
one spirituell meate / and they all dyd
drynke one spirituell drynke. So seest
thou well whate thing 
                  •
               ignifieth the baptesme / 
and whate thing we promyse in the
same.
            Nowe: to thintent that we shulde be
alweyes remembryng of this that we haue
promysed we be merked with a crosse / 
and with that water. The fayth that we
haue at the baptesme taketh away oure
sinnes / and the water is nothynge but a
sygne or token / wher with we be merked

that we must be vnder the standard / that
is to sey vnder the crosse of Iesu Christ / 
ād valiauntly fight. As the Iues had the
token of the circumcision / wherby men might
knowe whether they were Iues or

                  •
               aynyms. And as when the servauntes
of the lordes bere the badge of theyre lordes / 
one may therby knowe whose servauntes
they be. So lyke wyse receyve we
the signe of baptesme at the font / by the
whiche we gyve knowlege that Christ is
oure lorde.
            Secondly / the baptesme of the water
ys also a sygne of the grace of God.
wherby God maketh vs sure / that we
shall enioy hys grace and mercy / and that
he pardoneth vs oure synnes / and maketh
vs hys chyldren. Here vppon gyveth
he to vs the token of Baptesme for
a gage / to thyntent that we shulde be sure / 
that he wyll not forsake vs yn oure
batayle and deeth / whyche we leade here
yn oure evyll desyres and synnes.
And that he will surely gyve to vs the euerlastyng
lyfe. And to thintent thē that
we shulde enterpryse by a stedfast constance
to fight / being assured and certayn that

god will never forsake vs / for we haue 
                  •••
               ceyved
of him a gage the token of baptesme.
And if it happon that we mysse sum

to all thassemble of Christen men / and to
all theym that call on the name of Iesus.
And vnto the Romayns he saith: To you
all that be at Rome the frendes of god.Ro. 1.
And Iesus Christ hath aswell suffered
deth for the comon housholder / as for the
prestes. God shall alwayes requyre the
scriptures of the prestes / for they be ydell
and do not study / nor make no diligence to
declare theym vnto the simple.
            Therfore it is very nedefull that the
common people shulde vnderstond the gospell

After that was Italy and affryque
converted where as well the wymen as
the men spake latyn / & for this cause was
the byble translated into latyn to thintent
that euery one might vnderstond it / and
they preached in latyn / and the prophetes

Chanonryes and chapels and founding
of Obites and prebendes. Or of the
money that men offer in churches / and of
the whiche men make vessels of golde and
silver and other precious ornamentes.
They might enploy this money a thousand
folde better / if ther with they dyd holde
these yong children to scole / till suche tyme
that they corde reade well. For (alas)
ye shall fynde thousandes of auncyent persones
that can not sey the pater noster and
Crede in theyre mother tongue / and of theym
that say it in latyn are many that wote
not whate they sey / nor knowe not of
never an article of the faith. Wherfore
I say that it is expedient for the christen
to set all theyre children to skole till they
can reade a
                  •
               d vnderstonde the holy scriptures
namely when they be wrytē in theyre
mother tongue. And then they that had
not wyt and vnderstondinge worthy to
be contynued at scole / shulde be caused to
lerne an occupacion. If they did thus they
shulde bring into the worlde double prou
                  •
               fit.
First we shulde not haue suche a great

nombre of prestes and monkes vnlettered
and knowing nothing in the christen churche.
For nowe there are made many prestes / 
monkes and freres / that for lacke of
litterature are nothing cōveniēt for that office.
By the vnlettered prestes is this grete
erroure comen into the worlde / that ys / 
that in the stede of the pure scriptures whiche
is the lyvely worde of God / whiche
they knowe not / they preche narracions
fables lyes and tradicions of the invenciō
of the yppochrites / that (alas) the faythfull
trust & honoure which belongeth to gods
worde / they cause the people to gyve to
theyre fables and lyes.
            Secōdly it wolde proufit, for if euery body
wēt so long to skole / they shuld vnderstōd
more lightly the prechers / & if thei thē
silves / had redde the storyes or the Gospell
after the letre / then they might reherce
to theyre childrē & servaūtes / ī doing of their
busines / some thing of the gospell of the
stories or of the scripture / īstede of vaine fables / 
ydell wordes / & vncouenabill maters
which they speake the one to the other. As
we se sūtyme nowe a dayes / that felowes
of one crast whiche haue bin at scole / syng

many tymes the song in doing theyre bussynesse / 
whiche they haue learned to sing
at the scole or at the churche / and the other
vileyn songes / for they haue lerned none
other thing.
         
         
            ¶Whate thing is the Christen faith / and
whate thing one ought to beleve
to haue helth. Chaptre. iiij.
            I Haue seyd at the beginning that the foundacion
of Christendome is the faith
whyche so fewe people haue: and
vnderstond not whate the faith is, we thī
               ke
that when we beleve that god is god / 
and can oure crede that we haue the faith
that a Christen is bounde to haue. The devell
beleveth also that there is a God / and
one life everlasting and one hell / but he is
never the better for it. Ye and he trembleth
alway for this feith / as faith saint Iames.Iam. 2.
The devels beleve and they tremble.
            Som
                  •
                man might axe whate shall I thē
beleve. Thou shalt beleve then first plainly
and vndoutedly that the father / the
sonne / and the holy gost / is one onely god
                  •
               
And this thou shalt not desyre to vnderstond
howe / nor busy thy silfe moche therin:

for this is not the principall that we
must beleve: Oure faith lyeth not principally
therin. For this likewise beleve the
wicked sprites as is saide before and are
nothing the better therfore. There is yet
an other feith whiche Christ so moche requyreth
of vs in the gospell / and wher unto
also saint Paule almost in all his epistles
so strongly exhorteth vs. That is that
we must first beleve the gospell, when oure
lorde began first to preache he said (as reherseth
saint Marke) haue repentaunce ād
beleve in the gospell.Mar. 1.
            
            Thou mayst axe me / whate thing ys
the gospell? Hit is a good and ioyfull message
or glad tydinges. For it is newes of
the favour / grace / mercy / and goodnesse of
god towarde vs. It is (I sey) tydinges
that god hath taken vs to mercy / and therfore
songe the aungels when Christ was
borne (as reherseth saint Luke)Lu.

                I shewe
vnto you greate ioy / for this day is borne
youre savioure whiche is Christ the lorde
In this gospell that is to sey in this message
we beleve certainly that god the father
hath sent hither his sonne / for to bye vs agayn
to enfraunchise vs / and to delyuer

vs frō the devel to whome we were made
subiectes and servauntes / by the sinne of
oure fore father, we coude not helpe ou

               nde.
None of vs was abill to satisfie for vs
For we were all like wise subiected, as sayth
Saynt Paule vnto the Romayns.Ro. 3.
They haue all sinned ād haue nede to the
grace of god. It was nedefull then that
he that shuld satisfie for vs shulde be without
sinne without subiection or obligacion.
And no suche patron or mediatour
was there founde in the worlde. Thē this
one thing was of necessite that other we
must abide lost for euer / or it behoved that
god shulde be made mā. So hath oure god
almighty had pitye and compassion on vs
by the greate love that he had toward vs
and hath sent his onely sonne Iesu christ.Hiere. 31
As writeth the prophete Hieremye saing:
I haue loved them a-perpetuell
charyte / 
therfore I haue drawen the having mercy.
He hath sent him to thintent / that b
                  •
               
his deth whiche he had not deserved / he
myght appayse God and satisfie hym for
vs.Co
                     •
                  . 5 As wryteth saynt Paule. All is of
God / whiche hath reconcilyed vs vnto

him by christ. Then is Christ made a mediator
bytwene god and man and hath offered
him silfe an oblacion for vs to his father / 
wherby he hath reconsiled vs agayn
and made oure peace. And for bicause the
devell did set his honde vppon Christ to
whome he had no right he hath so lost all
his right whiche he had over vs. And so
are we delyuered from the servitude and
subiection of the devell / and belong vnto
Christ. And by that that the sonne of god
is nowe made man / he is also made oure
brother. And if we be his bretheren / we be
also enheriters wyth hym of the glory of
his father.Ro. 8. As writeth saint Paule vnto
the Romayne / saying. If we be children
we be also heyres with Christ. And
we haue as moche and as greate right to
heven as Iesu Christ hym silfe. For christe
is a sonne of God / so be we / reserved / 
that he is a sonne naturall / and was for euer
without beginning the sonne of God.
But we be the children of God allonly by
the goodnesse and grace of God / whyche
he hath done to vs, as sayeth Saynt Paule.Ephe. 1.
He hath predestinate vs into an election
of the children of God. Then ys

it this comen to passe / that we must beleve
surely / that we be the children of god / and
that god is oure father.
            Secondly thou shalt stedfastly beleve
the wordes of god / that is to sey / that
all that god hath seyde shall come to passe
and be done / without ony f

                As did the
faithfull Abraham whiche when god had
promysed to him (a thing impossible in all
mannes reason) that he shulde haue a sonne
of his baraine wife Sara / of whom kinges
of the people shuld aryse / and that in
his sede all people shulde be blessed (all
be it that it was a thing ageinst nature that
a woman of foure score and tenne yeres
olde shulde conceyve and bere a childe) beleved
vndoughtedly / ād as the childe was

Abraham albeit that all carnall wisdome
wolde haue persuaded him to haue dispeyred
in the promesse / never douted / was all
redy to do it / beleving stedfastly that it shulde
rather be possible / that his son shulde
ryse again from deth / rather then the worde

and promyse of god shulde not be true.
So stedfast aud so certayn must we stonde
vnto the worde of god / ye and although
it were so / that all men aungels and devels
wold persuade vs to the cōtrary / we
must beleve surely that the worde of god
is true / & that he will fulfill all that he hath
promysed.
            Whate thyng hath god promysed vs?Ma.
                     •
                   4 Mar. 16
he hath promysed vs his everlasting lyfe / 
saying: repent the kingdome of heven is at
honde.Mar. 16 And in an other place: whosoeuer
shall beleve and be baptised shall be saved
He hath also promysed vnto vs remission
of all oure sinnes / as seyd saint Peter speking
of Christ to Cornelius the centurion
To him (sayd he)Act. 10 gyveth all the prophetes
witnesse / that thorowe his name shall
receyve remission of sinnes all that beleve
in him / that is to sey / that al they that with
entyre courage forsake they m s
                  •
               lfe and
put all there trust in the grace and mercy
of him / shall haue remission of all there sinnes.
Moreover he hath promysed vs that
we shall be the children of God / as sayth
saint Iohn.Iohn. 1. He hath gyven to theym power
to be the childrē of god / to theym that

beleve in his name. All this must we beleue
stedfastly / all though that we thinke it
impossibill after oure workes and sinfull
life. We must also with a parfa
                  •
               t courage
put all oure trust in god / as did Abraham
for as saint Paule wryteth. Abraham beleved
god and hit was imputed vnto him
for rightuousnesse.Ro. 4. Then when with a
parfayt courage / we do so put all oure trust
in god / and in his promyses it is unpossible
that we shulde perisshe. For he hath
promysed vs his life euerlasting. And for
asmoche as he is almightye and may all
thing he may wel holde to vs that he hath
promysed. And in that that he is mercyfull
and true he will holde to vs his promys
if we can beleve it stedfastly / and put

(that by a stedfast feyth abide vppon
god as dyd the good thefe that was crucified
with christ whiche when he with a
stedfast beleue had called vppon Chryst
was answered: this day shalt thou be with
me in paradize. And as did Mary magdaleyne
to whome it was likewise sayde / 
thy faith hath saved the goo thou in peace)
shalbe saved.
            Thirdli we must also beleve that god desiteth
none other thing but oure helth. and
therfore whatesomever thīg happō to vs
here be we in helth or in dysease / riche or
pore / honoured or dispised / noble or vnnoble / 
alyve or deed: we shall alweyes be cō

whate thing soeuer god send knowyng
certeynly that nothing comith without
the wil & sufferaūce of god. for if it so

be that one leefe falleth not from the tree &
that a sparowe or a flie descend not on the
erth without the will of your father? Howe
moche more comith there nothinge to
vs without the wil ād suffraunce of god?
As writeth saint Mathewe / where oure
lord sayeth be not .ij. sparowes solde for a
peny and none of theym doth light on the
ground without youre father. Then whate
soever thing god send vs let vs receyve
it yeldinge to him thankes with good

                  •
                where god seyd to Abraham:
go out of thy contrey and out of thy

welbeloved son Isaac. Nowe seyng that
we be the children of Abraham / and that
we haue obteyned helth by meane of the
saith of Abraham. As saith oure lord in. S
Iohn. If ye be the children of Abraham / 
do the workes of Abraham. And therfore
must we bere all thinges paciently / and
with good will whiche god will that we
shall suffre and bere. For if he knewe that
they were not covenable and proufitable

               :Ro. 14. finally the verey deth. For
as saint Paule saieth. whether we lyve or
dye we are alweyes the lordes. And therfore
the Christen shall not be troubled for
none suche thinges but shalbe rather ioyfull
as were thappostles whome god had
made worthy to suffre any thing for hys

                  •
               ove. For it is a sure token that thou arte
the childe of god if thou haue pacience. for
it is writen by saint.Act. 5. Luke in thactes of
thappostles that thapostles were ioyfull
that they were reputed worthy to suffre
dishonour before the world for the love of
god. And god hath promysed nothing els
to his disciples in this world but payne &
tribulacion: as Christ saieth in saint IohnIohn. 16
Ye shall wepe and lament / and the world
shall reioyce / and ageyn in the world ye shall
haue tribulacion but be of good chere / 
for I have overcome the worlde.
            And there is not a more certeyne signe
that a man shalbe dampned then when
he ledith here an yvell life & hath alweyes

prosperite. for this prosperite shalbe hys
paradice. On the cōtrary part there is not
a more certeyn signe of euerlasting helth
then when a man lyveth iustly / and hath
alway adversite: for that is it that god sendeth
vs for oure sinnes and oure purgatory:
or so to make open his glory in oure pacyence.
And therfore shall the Christen alweyes
more reioyce when he suffreth aduersite
and tribulacyon then when all thinges
comyth prosperously vnto him. For
prosperite in an evell life signifieth comō
               ly
that god hath reproved the parsone. 
                  •
               
it maketh him to forget God. But adversite
signifieth comonly that god loveth the
person: And the parson is warned by tribulacion
ād sufferaunce to call vppon god
for socoure.Hebre. 12 For as seith saint Paule him
that God loveth him doth he chastise: and
he stourgeth euery child that he receyveth
For whate is the child that the father doth
not chastise? And if ye be out of the discipline
and chastisement of the whiche all
the children of god haue byn part takers / 
ye are then bastardes and not sonnes. And
in thapocalips speaketh God and sayeth:Apo. 3
as many as I loue I rebuke and chastyse.

Also Salomon in the Proverbes saieth:
theym that the lord god loveth he rebuketh.Pro. 3
                     •
                  
               
Therfore let none be sory when tribulaciō / 
maladye / pestilence / or also the deth
it silf comith / But let him alweyes accord
his will to the will of god / and suffre
paciently & ioyfully knowing for trouth / 
that it is all the good & holy will of God
oure right good father. And let him thanke
him that it pleaseth him to make hym / 
worthy to suffre any maner trybulacyon
for his sake as dyd Iob and Thobias / ād
many other. For without doute god knoweth
whate thīg is helthfull for vs. And
he that murmureth & grudgeth ageynste
god in tribulaciō is not a Christē. For he
beleveth not that god gouerneth & entreatith
him for his helth. But whate are we
ought els thē erth in the hond of a potter?
As saith saint Paule in this maner:Ro. 9 O mā
whate arte thou that doest this murmure
ageinst god? may the pot say vnto hī that
made hī whie hast thou made me on this faciō?
Nay. And as the potter may make suche
a pot as he will of the erth so be we yn
the hōdes of god▪ & we must be cōtēt with
all that god wil do with vs▪ for we be his

we live or dye saith saint Paule.Ro. 14. For this
cause he that with a stedfast faith suffereth
and endureth paciently all thinges &
tribulacions is a christen. And this is the
faith and the stedfast stone vppon the whiche
the cristente is founded. For in this doing
we beleve ād trust stedfastly that god
is oure father and that he will not forsake
vs: albeit that nowe he do here chastise vs
for as I haue sayd there can be no more
certayn signe that god loveth the. thē whē
sorowe and tribulacion happeneth vnto
the. for all the scriptures of the newe testament
promyse vs here nothing but sorow
and sufferaunce.

Chaptre. v.
            THis must euery Christē knowe that
none syns the tyme of Adam vnto
this day hath deserved the euerlasting
life by his good workes. And that
none by his good workes shall deserve
it:Hebre. 7 as writeth saint Paule vnto the Hebrewes.
The lawe hath brought nothing vnto
perfection. wherfore all they do erre that
thinke that then they shalbe saved whē
               
they haue done many good workes. And
like wise all they that thinke that they shalbe
dampned when they have done no
good. For good workes make no mā certeyn
that he shalbe saved And he that hath
done no good is not also certeyn that he
shalbe dampned. The workes can gyve
no maner certeynte. For the Pharisey that
had done moche good whiche loked for
grete reward of god was reproved / and
despised.Luke. 
                     •
                  
                As writeth saint Luke where
the pharisey thanked god that he was not
as other were extorcioners / vniust / aduoutrers / 
nor as the publican was: and bosted
him silf of his good workes. And the publican
that had done no good and confessed
mekely his sinnes was of God receyved
vnto grace, for this cause to thintent that
euery man may knowe that god hath no
nede of oure good workes for to save vs / 
with all I will declare here first how we
be iustified and obteyne helth.
            First we must knowe that by the originall
sinne we were made subiectes and
servauntes vnto the devell / and none yn
the world mought helpe vs for all mankinde
was dettoure vnto God. And that

worse was we did not knowlege oure mysery
nor are socoure of god. Then when
there was no comforte nor meane to helpe
vs and to deliver vs ageyne from the
subiection of the devell: Oure god almightye
by his greate mercy and goodnesse of
him silf hath willingly suffred that his onely
begotten son Iesu Christ was made
mortall man for vs to thintent that by his
deth whiche he had not deserved he might
by vs ageyn and delyuer vs from eternal
deth wherunto we were all subiectes. As
writeth saint Paule saying.Ro. 5 If it be so that
by the sinne of one man (that is to sey of
Adam) deth hath reygned vppon many / 
moche more the grace of god and the gyft
of grace of one man Iesuchrist aboundeth
vppon many.Ephe. 2 And vnto the Ephesians.
Blessed be God father of oure lorde Iesu
christ whiche hath blessed vs with a spirituall
benediction by his son Christ. Thus
is this grace comen hoelly to vs from god
of his goodnesse and not by oure meryte / 
or good workes. For we dyd not knowlege
oure bondage and subiectyon nor dyd
not ones desyre to be delyvered from oure
myserye.
            
               
Then for asmoche as the devell dyd se
                  •
               
honde vppon Chryst / to whome he had
no right for bicause he had not sinned christ
hath gotten right vppon vs agaynst the
devell and hath made vs fre and delyvered
vs and we be made his heyres and all
his glory is ours: as saint Paule doth largely
declare in all his epistles. This hath
God gyven vs without oure deservyng
and we nede not to laboure for these thinges.
For we haue all this alredy. As witnessith
saynt Iohn saying:Iohn. 
                     •
                  
                Behold whate
love the father hath shewed on vs that
we shuld be called the children of God.
And in the same chapter. sayeth he.
Derely beloved nowe are we the children
of god. This helth hath god gyven to vs
willingly by hys sonne Iesu Christ.
For Iesu Christ ys bycome man to satisfie
vnto hys father for vs and to make oure
peace with hys father.Ro. 3 And as writeth
Saynt Paule vnto the Romayns / sayīg
we be iustified frely by the grace of God
and by the redempcyon whyche ys in Iesu
Christ. So ys Christ made a mediator
and a peace maker bywene God the
father and man. As sayeth saynt Paule

vnto the Hebrewes: he may make theym
safe for ever that come vnto god by hym:Hebre. 7
he is allweyes lyving for to praye for vs
Suche an hyghe prest it becometh vs to
haue whiche is holy / harmles / vndefiled
separat from sinners and made hygher thē
hevens. And by his deth it is graūted vs
that we be christen and children of God.Gala. 3.
As lyke wise teacheth saint Paule saying
Ye are all the children of God by the faith
whiche is in Iesu christ. And for asmocheas
Iesu christ is made man he is also made
oure brother. And seyng we be his bretheren
we be also heyres of his glory whiche
he hath with his father: as sayth saint
Paule vnto the Romayns. whiche hath
not spared his owne sonne:Ro. 8. but hath gyvē
him for vs all: howe shall he not also gyue
vnto vs all thinges with him.
            We be then sure that all that is Iesu
Christes is ours if we can beleve it. Some
man mought demaund. Hath god the
father willingly gyven vs all this? hath
none deserved it? No truely: None hath deserved
it. None by his deserving or good
workes hath enduced god to do this. But
he hath done it of him silf / and by his greate

mercy:Hiere. 3
                     •

In a perpetuell charite I haue loved the
And therfore haue I had compassion on

christ saieth in the gospell of saint Iohn.
God hath so loved the world that
he hath gyven his onely begotten sonne
to thintent that whosoever beleve yn
him shuld not perisshe but haue everlastīg
life. as wryteth. S. Paule. If a lawe had
byn gyven which might haue iustified the
iustice shuld haue byn truely of the lawe.Gala. 
                     •
                  
               
But the scripture hath concluded all vnder
sinne to thintent that the promyse shuld
be gyven vnto the belevers by fayth.
And vnto the Romayns. If God be for
vs who is he that may be againste vs? as
though he wold saye:Ro. 7. None. for we haue
receyved all thing of god with his sonne.
But whate thing haue we receyved? this
lybertye from the subiection of the devell
that is remission of all sinnes / that ys the
ioy and glory of the everlastinge life. And
this hath god gyven vnto vs by his sonne.
as saint Paule sayeth vnto the Hebruwes.
The bloude of Christ whiche by the
holy ghost hath offred hym silfe withoutHebre. 
                     •

from mortall workes for to serve vnto
the lyving God. And therfore we haue
no nede to laboure by oure good workes
to get euerlasting lyfe / for we haue that alredy:
we be all iustified we be all the children
of God. God hath gyven vs all thys
of him silf without oure deserving.
            Some man might say. I will also do
sumwhate to thintent that I may be so
moche the more certeyn to be saved. All
they that say so: and all they that thinke
that theyre good workes helpe eny thing
or proufit for to get the gift of saluacyon
they blaspheme ageynste God / and robbe
god of his honoure and speke ageynst the
might and goodnesse of God.Gala. 5 as wryteth
saint Paule. If ye be circumcised Christ
shall nothinge proufit you. that is to say:
if ye put eny trust in the lawe or in any
workes Christ shall not helpe you. And
yet sayeth saint Paule in that same Chaptre.
whosoever will be iustified by the lawe
is fallen out of the grace of god. Howe
may the wordes be more clere. wherfore al
they blaspheme ageynst the dyvine puissaunce
that will eny maner wey deserve

by theyre good workes. for this cause we
must do oure good workes alweys by love

               th for by Iesu
christ be we made sure of the euerlasting life / 
as it is bifore said. They that by theyre
workes will satisfie vnto god be agaynst
God / as though God were not puissaunt
ynough of him silf without the helpe of oure
werkes for to pardone vs oure sinnes / 
and as though the passion of Christ were
not vertuouse ynough without oure deservinges
for to helpe vs to come vnto heven.
Therfore (say I) we must allonly &
hoelly trust in the grace & mercy of god / &
not in oure workes or els christ shall nothing
proufit vs.
         
         
            ¶Howe that by the onely grace of God / 
and by nothing elles we be saved.
Chaptre. vi.
            NOwe might some man sey / I knowe
wel that god is mightie ynough
to save me without my workes / 
but I cā not tel whether he wil do it
if it be not that I live therwith al rightuously.
parauēture my good werkes shal enduce
hī to make me rightuous & to save me

or els he wolde not do it. All they that so
saye or thinke (as I haue said) blaspheme
against the goodnesse of god / as though
god were not of him silf mercyfull ād good
ynough / except he were first stered vnto
mercy by oure werkes.Ro. 4. Not withstōding
that saint Paule sayeth that the promesse
was not made vnto Abraham by the lawe
but by the iustice of the faith. And seyng
also that of his proper nature he is nothing
els but goodnesse and mercy / as he
hath alweyes taught and shewed whē he
was teaching in the world / for he hath never
dispysed nor left none discomforted of
eny thing that eny hath requyred him but
onely suche as wold not beleve.
            Wherfore thou must knowe ones for
all that by the onely grace of god we be saved.
And god will not that thou put thy
good workes or thy iustice with his pretending
to helpe him by thy workes / for
he will do it a lone / and will haue no maner
helpe. For he hath no nede of the coū
               sell
nor of the dede nor of the workes nor
of the iustice of any other.Ephe. 2 For saint Paule
saieth: By grace are ye saved thorowe
faith and that not of your silves for it ys

the gift of god and cometh not of workes
lest eny man shulde bost himsilf. Now were
it possible to speake it more pleynly / and
vnto the Romains:Ro. 5. Being iustified by fayth
we are at peace with god. And saynt
Iohn saieth: He is the recōciliacion for oure
sinnes.1. Iohn. The deth of Iesu christ and his
iustice be vertuous ynough for to take awey
all the sinnes of the world.
            Nowe might one demaunde whi will
god iustifie vs and so save vs of him silfe?
God doth it to thintent that he make hys
goodnesse and mercy vnto vs more clere / 
and more open.Ephe. 2 As writeth saint Paule
vnto the Ephesians: God that is riche yn

reysed vs vp and with him hath made vs
sitte in hevenly thinges thorowe Christ / 
for to shewe in tyme to come the exceding
richesse of his grace in kindnesse towarde
vs thorowe Iesus Christ. Here seest thou
by these wordes the cause whye god will
do it alone: for if god shuld iustifie vs / ād
shuld gyue helth bicause of oure workes / 

he shuld not do it by his goodnesse / but oure
workes had deserved it: and so shulde
we not nede to thanke God therfore but
mo
                  •
               ght ascribe it to oure selves: and vnto
oure workes. But saint Paule and all
the prophetes do teache vs that we be iustified
and haue gotten helth by the onely
grace of God and not by oure deservynges / 
for we haue none. And as god wyll
that we do not thanke laude or loue other
then alonely him. Also like wyse will he
not that we serche elswhere or of any other
helth but of him onely for god wilbe
oure helth and oure savioure alone / and he
will not that we serche els where comfort
but in him and of him / and not in oure silfe
nor in oure good werkes. And for this cause
thus writeth saint Paule vnto Titus.
But after that the kindnesse and loue of
oure savioure appered vnto man / not of
the dedys of rightuousnesse which we haue
wrought but of his mercy he hath saved
vs by the fonteyne of the newe birth
& with the renewing of the holy gost whiche
he shed over vs abundauntly / thorow
Iesus christ oure savioure.Titū. 3 And therfore
whosoever thīke to haue deserved the kingdome

of heven by his rightuous life / he
robbeth god of his goodnesse. for god hath
frely iustified vs of hī silf. & oure lord him
silf hath seid in the gospel of S. Ioh: None
may come vnto me except my father that
sent me drawe hī.Iohn. 6 And in an other place
without me ye cā do nothing.Iohn. 15 & god spake
by the prophete Osee: O Israel thi perdiciō
comith of thy silf / alonely of me cometh
thy helpe.Osee. 14 And saint Paule vnto the romains.Ro. 9.

            Therfore erre all they that thīke that god

of the inheritaūce of saintes in light / whiche
hath delyvered vs from the power of

kingdome of his dere sonne / in whome we
haue redempcion thorowe his bloude / that

get lest of all and are in many tymes reprobate

whiche rehersed vnto god his good
workes as though he had not knowē theym.
But if thou wilt haue the kingdome
of heven. I counsed the that thou trust nothing
in thy good workes / but that thou
be exercising thi silf after thy power in dedes
of charite and mercy toward thy christen
brother. So as oure lord teacheth yn

God resisteth alweyes the proude / 
but vnto the humble he gyveth grace.1. Pe. 5. for
god loveth moche more a sinner whyche
humbleth him silf axing mercy / then one
that thinketh that he is holy / and that he
hath done many good workes exaltynge
him silf in theym and thinkinge that God
owith to him the kingdome of heven / bycause
of his good workes. For (as I haue

seyd) God will save none for his good
workes / but he wil save vs all by his mercy:
to thintent that we shuld thanke hym
for it / and to thintent that to him alone ād
to his name may be gyven all glory preyse
and grace / and that all the worlde may
prayse and exalte the goodnesse and mercy
of him alone.Ro. 3 For saint Paule saieth that
the rightuonsnesse that cometh of god ys
declared without the fulfillinge of the lalawe
and for this cause wold God suffre
none to come into euerlasting lyfe byfore
the comyng of Iesus christ nether Abraham / 
Isaac nor David.Ro. 3 For (as saint paule
seyth (they all haue sinned and lacke the
preyse that is of valure byfore God. and
this he wolde also to thintent that bothe
they and we shuld also knowe that all they
that haue obteyned or shal opteyne helth
haue and shall opteyne it / by the deth
of Iesu christ and not by theyre rightuousnesse
or workes for if eny might haue bin
saved by his workes / Abraham and David
had come to heven byfore the comyng
of Iesu christ. But God wolde it not to
thintent that we shuld knowe that all oure
helth lyeth in the deth of Iesu Christ / 

which by his mercy he hath suffred for vs
There is none other wey for to come to everlastīg
life but by Iesu Christ crucyfied
for vs. And therfore we must put all
oure trust in God alone / we shall take all
oure comfort of God onely calling vppon
his mercy in this maner.

            So shall the christē hūble him silf & vnderstōd
of hīsilf & of his good workes.Esaie 64 for
(as saieth Esai) all oure iustice is as it were

the clothe of a womā suffering the floures.
God hath saved none by his workes
but onely by his divine grace & mercy
As teacheth saint Paule:Ephe. 
                     •
                  
                ye are saved by
grace thorowe faith & that not of your silf
And if it be by grace (as saieth saint Paule
ageyn) then is it not by the deservinge
of workes for then were grace no grace.Ro. 1
                     •
                  
               
Hereby mayst thou perceive that god wil
that oure helth come of his grace and mercy
and not of oure deserv
                  •
               nges. For if any
may deserve heven by his workes then is
it no grace or gift of god: but it is vet & wages.
And then god of him silf giveth it not
vnto vs: but we get it as for vauntes that
serve for wages. And that can be by no
meanes for saint Paule teacheth vs in many
places that we be iustified & haue obteined
helth by the grace of god & not by oure
good workes but by oure feith. for it is
a gift of god & not hyres or wages for laboure:Ephe. 
                     •
                  
               
to thintēt that we shuld not esteme
that we had saved ouresilves. for. s. Paule
saith: whē we were dede by sinne / he hath
quickened vs with christ. wherfore we
shall not glorifie ī oure silves / but ī god alone.
for god will not that we serche hī for

wages as servauntes. But he will that
we shall love him as children theyre father
and that we serve him by love without
desiringe eny thing but to please him. for
he him silf hath seid to his apostles:Iohn. 15 I call
you not nowe servauntes / but frendes.Psal. 21
And Christ hath said by the prophete to
his hevenly father I will shewe thy name
to my bretherē. And ageyn to his apostles:Mat. 23
Call ye no man father on the erth: for
ye haue one father in he
                  •
               en. And therfore
hath Iesu christ not learned vs to pray.
Oure lord whiche arte in heven:Mat. 6 but oure
father / for we be his children / and if we be
the children of god we be his heyres / as sayeth
saint Paule.Ro. 8
            
         
         
            ¶To whome the grace of god is gyuen.
Chaptre .vij.
            ONe myght axe: Is thys grace of
god gyven to every body: Nay / 
but it is gyven to all theym that
beleve. And all they that beleve in Iesu
christ in suche maner as we haue byfore declared / 
and shall all declare more pleynly they
be the children of god / as wryteth saint
Iohn in the gospell saying.Iohn. 1 Unto as many
as receyved him gave he power to be

the sonnes of god in that they beleved yn
his name. And as sayeth saint Paule. He
that comith to god must beleve that he ys
God and that he is a rewarder of theym
that seke him.Hebre. 1
                     •
                  . Therfore we haue seid that
all the newe testament doth teache vs
principally none other thing but faith and
trust in Iesu christ. and therfore the feith
is the foundacion of Christendome. For
this cause if thou wilt that the passion ād
grace of christ be to thy socoure and proufit
it behoveth that thou beleve him stedfastly
without ony maner waveringe to
thinten: that thou knowe that it is all
grace / and not deserving and that the wordes
and promyses of god be verey certein
and true. for god hath called vs his children
as saint Paule saieth: Because that ye
are sonnes god hath sent the sprite of hys
sonne into oure hertes crying Abba father
Then arte thou nowe no servaunt but a
sonne.Gala. 4 and if thou be a sonne then art thou
also heyre of god by christ / ād so be we
delyvered from oure sinnes and from the
bondage of the devell: and made heyres of
the kingdome of heven by the benefit of
Iesu christ.
            
               
He beleveth in god that putteth all his
trust and hope in god and in the iustice of
god / living after his power accordinge to
the rule of charite / having no maner hope
nor trust in the world / in his good works
or good life / but alonly in the goodnesse of
god / and in the merites of Iesu christ beleving
certeynly that god will hold to hym
that he hath promysed remission of sinnes
and certeynte of everlasting life. He that
doth so is a true christen and beleveth stedfastly
that the wordes of god must nedes
be true. Notwithstanding that according
to his workes he thinketh it a thing ympossible.
Neverthelesse he beleveth that he
shalbe saved without deservinge of any
good workes rather then the wordes of
god and all thinges that they do promyse
shuld not come to passe. As writeth saynt
Paule of Abraham which beleved rather
that his wife whiche was bareyne & out
of thage of generacyon shuld conceyve a
childe rather thē the promyse of god shuld
not be fulfilled. And by this fayth was
Abraham reputed iuste byfore God & not
by his good workes. So behoveth it that
euery christen do / albeit that it seme to him

ympossible to be saved bycause he hath done
no good / he shall neverthelesse stykke
stedfastly vnto the goodnesse and mercy of
God and vnto hys worde yn suche maner
that he doubt not yn nothyng.Lu. 2
                     •
                  
                For
Christ sayeth in Saynt Luke. Heven and
erth shall passe but my worde shall never
passe.
            Of this sayth wryteth Saynt Paule
vnto the Romayns.Ro. 10. whosoever shall call
on the name of the lord God shalbe saved.
He therfore that calleth vppon hym on
whome he beleveth not that he may helpe
hym loseth but his laboure. Therfore
thou must first beleve in hym. And then if
thou call vppon hym with suche a fayth
as we haue spoken of thou shalt be saved
Of this fayth speaketh also the prophete
Esaie (as recy
                  •
               eth Saynt Paule the apostle
yn the forseyd Chaptre) All they that
beleue yn hymshall not be ashamed. And
ageyn saint Paule.Ro. 10 If thou confesse with
thy mouth that Iesus is the lord / and that
thou beleue with a perfaict herte that
God hath reised christ frō deth thou shalt
be saved. And the word that Christ preched
first as recyteth Saint Marke was:

The tyme is full come and the kingdome
of god is evyn at honde repent and beleve
the gospell.Mar. 1 Of this faith writeth lyke
wise saint Iohn and they be the wordes
of Christ vnto Nicodemus as Moyses
lift vp the serpent in wildernesse / even so
must the sonne of man be lift vp that no
man that beleveth in him perisshe but haue
eternall life.Iohn. 3 God so loued the worlde that
he gaue his onely sonne for the entent that
none that beleve in him shuld perisshe but
shuld haue everlasting life. And a lytell after
he that beleveth in him shall not be cō
               dempned / 
and ageyn in the same chaptre.
He that beleveth on the sonne hath everlasting
life / and he that beleveth not the
sonne / shall not see life but the wrathe of
god abideth vppon him.
            By all these escriptures here maist thou
see that we be all the children of God / 
alonly thorowe faith, and this had God
lever promyse vnto vs bicause of oure faith
then bicause of oure good workes to
thintent that we shuld be so moche the more
certeyn of oure helth And therfore saith
saint Paule / by faith is the enheritaunce
gyven that it might come of grace that theRo. 4.
               
promyse be sure and stedfast to all the seade,
for if god had said whosoever will do
suche or suche workes shalbe saved / we
shuld ever haue byn īcerteyn whether we
shuld haue byn saved or not. for we shuld
never haue knowen whether we had dogood
ynough to haue deserved the lyfe eternall.
But nowe god hath promysed it
vnto vs bicause of oure faith / by hys favoure
not by oure workes / to thintent that
we be the more sure therof. For let vs
beleve stedfastly and we may knowe for
certeyn that we be the childrē of god. Not
that we haue deserved it: but bycause he
hath promysed it. And it must nedes be
that the word of god be true for this cause
if we haue perfeit trust in god and beleve
perfeitly in him we shalbe sure that
we shalbe saved. It was suche a feith that
saint Paule had when he seid:2. Ti. 
                     •
                  
                I knowe
and am sure that he to whome I haue
cōmitted and gyven my gage to kepe ys
mighty ynough to kepe it for me tyll that
day: And ageyn: I haue fought a good batayl.2. Ti. 4.
I haue fulfilled my course and haue
kept the faith / from hensforth is leyd vp
for me a crowne of rightuousnesse whiche

the lord that is a rightuous iudge shall give
me at that day: Not vnto me onely
but vnto all theym whiche love hys coming.1. Ioh. 3
And saint Iohn saieth: Derely beloved
nowe are we the sonnes of God.
And yet it hath not appered whate we
shal be we knew that whē he shal appere
we shalbe like hī for we shal see hī as he is
            This faith had also saynt Martine at
the houre of his deth when he saide vnto
the devell: whye art thou here thou bloudy
beest? thou hast nought in me / the seed
of Abraham shall receyve me.
            This suertye had likewise saint Imbrose
when one axed hym if he feared not
the deth? he answered whye shuld I feare?
seyng that we haue one so good a lord
                  •
               
            
            For this cause must we love the deth
and more desyre to dye ād to be with god
(as dyd saint Paule) then to feare the deth.Phi. 1
for Iesu christ is deede for vs to thintent
that we shuld not feare to dye. And
he hath flayne the deth and hath destroyed
the streynght of deth. as writeth saint
Paule saying:1. Cor. 15 O deth where is thy victory?
It is swalowed and brought to nought
by victory.Phi. 1 And vnto the Philippyans.

Christ is my life and deth is to me advauntage.
         
         
            ¶Howe that feith bryngeth Charyte and

               NOwe might one axe: when I

saying:1. Ti. 2 whiche hath gyven him silf a price
and raunsome for all men. Then when
I beleve: nede I not to do nothing? Nede
I not to do no good? shall I not kepe
the commaundementes of God? Herken
whate saint Paule answereth. The faith
(saith he) worketh by loue.Ga. 5 Then when
thou thus beleuest without doutīg that is
to sey that thou art the sonne of god / and
that god hath so made the grete and riche

                thīg shall I do agein to god

by love and kindenesse for all this that he

David: whate shall I yeld to god ageyn
for all that he hath gyven to me: when eny
parson speaketh thus in him silf considering
and beholding the greate goodnesse
and mercy of god / then comith and entreaseth
the loue of god in him by the fayth / 
bicause that he beleveth surely that God
hath thus made him grete and riche. And
after that the loue is thus entred and enchauffed
in the hert of the parson it maketh
him to suffre and bere all thīges & maketh
him to laboure to thinke and to do all that
he thinketh wold please god / without regarding

                  •
               ny thing but the loue of god.Cor. 13. as
sayeth saint Paule: Loue suffreth all thinges / 
loue doth nothing in vaine. and he that
hath suche a loue toward god: all that
he doth is agreable to god: Ye when he gyveth
but a drop of water for goddis sake
as writeth saint Mathewe. for loue ī god
can not sinne all that he doth is well done
For the holy goost that hath put this charite
in vs can not do evill. A
                  •
               d if of aduenture
by suche a good entent one did any evell
by errour this evell shul be pardoned

incontinent and reputed for good by
the good entent and loue that he hath towardes
god.Mat. 6. For Christ saieth in the gospell.
If thyne yie (that is to sey thyne entencion)
be simple and applying to good / 
all thy body that is to sey (all thyne operacion)
shall be lightened and good. And
saint Paule saieth:Ro. 8 we knowe that vnto
theym that loue god al thinges worke for
the best. All they that are constant in this
faith and charite be the children of god ād
please god. As witnessith saint Petre where
he speaketh in thactes of thappostles.
Of a truth I perceyve that god is not percyall / 
but in all people he that feareth hym
and worketh rightuousnesse is accepted
with him, for god nedeth not oure works
when he thus hath oure hertes albeit that
suche a loue can not be ydell.
            This loue comith in vs (as I haue seid)
by faith / when the parson beleveth surely
that he is the childe of God. It nedeth
not that suche a parsone be constreyned
to doo good workes by any commaundementes.
For the love of god dwelling yn
him can not be ydell. For loue (as sayeth
saint Paule suffreth long and is courteys1. Cor. 13.
               
loue ēvyeth not / love is not craving / swelleth
not / dealeth not dishonestly / seketh
not her owne / is not provoked to angre / 
thinketh not evell / reioyseth not in īiquite:
but reioyseth in the truth / suffreth al thing
beleveth all thinges / hopeth all thinges / 
Suche a love or charyte bryngeth a parson
to good workes / and not good works
a parsone vnto suche a love / or to suche a
faith & trust in god. These workes spring
out of feith and not feith out of these workes.
for as I haue seid feith bringeth loue
and loue bringeth good workes.
            Lyke as though there were a riche mā
with out children or heyres which might
take a poore beggar out of the strete and
make hym his heyre of his goodes. This
poore man beyng this made greate and ryche
if he wold be thankefull (as becomith
hym to be) shuld serve hys lorde or master
(whiche had thus exalted hym & made
him ryche) truely and with greate loue
Ye and if he ones might knowe the wil of
his master / he wold not deferre the doing
therof till he were commaunded: But he
wold do all thinges by and by of his owne
courage for the charyte or loue that he

hath toward his master without commaundement.
            Behold this poore man so exalted hath
not deserved by hys workes nor by hys
service that this riche man shuld so make
him his heyre / but the riche man hath made
him his heyre of hys owne goodnesse
without that the poore mā had in eny maner
wyse deserved it. And the service that
this poore man doth afterward comith
of loue and kyndnesse. For he knoweth
and beleveth surely that he is heyre of the
godes of his lord bifore that he do any service.
And for bicause that he beleveth that
the ryche man will kepe promyse wyth
hym / he beginneth to love him by the meane
of this faith. And so when he loveth
hym / he doth to him willingly and wyth
good hert / all the service he can / and fulfil 
                  ••
               leth
ioyfully his commaundementes and
all by love. And the more laboure & service
that he can do for his good master the
more grete pleasure he taketh.
            So is it of a good Christē, for whē he
was yet enemye of god by the sinne of Adam / 
he was accepted of God byfore he

                  •
               esyred it: and byfore that he had yn

eny maner wise deserved it. Thus hath
god made vs his children and heyres without
oure deserving. Then when we beleve
this stedfastly this faith bringeth loue
into oure hertes: so that we beginne to
love God by cause that he hath made vs
so greate and excellent. And when we so
love him we kepe his commaundemētes
by loue and do all thinges with good wil
As saieth Christ in saint Iohn:Iohn. 14. He that loveth
me kepeth my commaundementes.
And so kepe we all thinges and suffre all
thinges which we thinke agreable to god
and nothing is to hevy for vs, and as sayeth
saint Paule:Ro. 5 we reioyce in tribulaciō
for we knowe that tribulacion bringeth
pacience / paciēce bringeth feling / feling brī
               geth
hope and hope maketh vs not a shamed / 
bicause the love that God hath vnto
vs is shed abrode in oure hertes / by the
holy goost whiche is gyven vnto vs / whiche
love maketh all thinges light vnto vs
plesaunt / and easy to bere: so that after the
word of Christ in the gospell his yoke ys
easy and his burthen is light.Mat. 11. Act. 5
            
            This faith and love had thappostles
(as wryteth saint Luke) when they departed

from before the iudges they reioysed
that they were made worthy and able
to suffre shame and dishonoure byfore the
worlde for the love of Iesu christ. Thys
char
                  •
               te had saint Paule when he seid vnto
the Romayns.Ro. 8. Who is he that shall separate
vs from the love of god? shall tribulacion
or anguisshe / or persecucion / or hunger / 
or nakydnesse
                  •
                other parell orswerd?
we be sure that neither deth nor life nether
aungell nether rule nor thīges present nor
thinges to come / nether height nor depnesse
nether eny other creature shalbe abyll to separat
vs from goddis love which is in Iesu
christ our lord.
            But I axe you nowe wherby ys it
that thou knowest that thou are the childe
of god? by the service that thou hast done
hi? Nay. Wherby then? by the faith wher
by thou belevest the worde of god whiche
sayth that thou art the childe of god before
thou begynnest to serve hym / as wryteth
saint Paule in all his epistles. Thy
service and thy workes haue not gyvē the
the faith and trust wherby thou belevest
that thou art the childe of god and his heyre / 
for thou haddest that or thou dydest hī
               
any service. but bicause that thou belevest
stedfastly that god hath made the so grete
by this faith beginnest thou to loue hym.
And when thou lovest him so / thou doest
him all the service that thou knowest ys
agreable vnto hī. Thou

               beyst his cōmaundementes / 
alweyes humbly knoweleging

thou doest vnto God. for els as sayeth
saint Paule.Ro. 4 If oure heretage came of the
lawe / the feith were but in vayne and the
promyse of none effect.
            Behold nowe seest thou that we do not
deserve the euerlasting life by oure good
workes / for God hath promysed it vnto
vs all surely bifore that we began to do
good. wherfore thou must knowe and beleve
that good workes make none sure
that he shalbe the childe of God and hys
heyre. But contrary wise the feith & trust
that thou hast in god (wherby thou belevest
stedfastly that he ha
                  •
               h made the hys
sonne) maketh the to serve god and to kepe
his commaundementes by love▪
wherfore all they are abused (Theologyans
and doctours: that sey that certeynte
or hope procedeth out frō good workes▪
               
For contraryly / out from the certeynte &
from the feith (wherby thou belevest the
goodnesse that god hath done vnto the) comith
the good works. That is to sey whē
thou belevest / thou begynnest to love and
when thou lovest / thou doest that God
wold haue done.
         
         
            ¶Howe that we shall not serve God for
hyres or wages. Chaptre. ix.
            
               THe workes done in suche fayth
and charyte be allonely plesaūt
vnto god and worthy to be called
good workes. for they be the
workes of the holy gost that dwelleth in
vs by this faith. But they that are done
by tediousnesse & evill will / for fere of hell
or for desire of paradise be none other thīg
but shadowes of workes makīg ypochrytes.
The ende of oure good workes may
sēke nought but to please god knowlegīg
that if we do never so moche we cā neuer
do our duety. for they that for feare of hell
or for the ioyes of hevē do serve god do a
cōstreined service which god will not. Suche
people do not serve God bicause he is
theire god & theire father: but bicause he is
riche & for to haue part of his richesse, they

not god but his wayes and richesse: that
is to sey they serue for none other purpose
but to haue theyre rewardes and for to
avoide his punissions. And suche people
be as it were hyred men and waged servauntes
and are not children for the service
they do is but for wages and hyres. But
the children of god serve theyre father for
loue for they knowe the goodnesse that
god hath done to theym alredy in that they
beleue that god hath made theym hys
children and heyres.Gala. 3 For saint Paule seith
ye are all the children of god by the feith
which is in Iesu Christ: And ageyn:
forasmoche as ye be childrē god hath sent
the sprit of his sonne in to your hartes crying:Ga. 4
father father. Thou art then nowe no
servaunt but a sonne. And if thou be the
sonne thou art also heyre of god by christ
as saieth saint Paule. ye are all the children
of 
                  •
               ight and children of god.Tessa. 5 Then the
children of god (that is the true christen do
not desyre to get the heretage by theire service
for they knowe by the sure promyses
of god (whiche they do beleve) that God
of hym self hath purely and liberally gyuē
it vnto theym alredy. Is when a burgoys

hath a servaunt and a sonne. The servaunt
serueth his master and dare not offend
hym for feare of losing of his wages
whiche he attendeth for: for he serveth for
wages / and after that he hath receyved
theym he levith his master & axeth no more
of him for he demaunded nothing els
but his money which he hath receyved alredy.
The sonne of the house serveth hys
father and kepeth his commaundementes
not to haue wages but for loue that he hath
vnto hys father. For he knoweth the
goodnesse that his father hath done to him
and that he is heyre of the goodes of hys
father. And knoweth that he shall ever
dwelle in his fathers house / as saieth saint
Iohn.Iohn And therfore doth he liberally the
will of his father by cause he will not anger
him. So must euery christen serve god
and kepe hys commaundementes by true
loue and not by hope to get for his service
everlasting life or the heritage of his hevē
               ly
father but knowleging alonly that god
hath gyven him that alredy / and that he
hath made him hys heyre 
                  •
               yfore he requyred
him. So shall he serve him by love declaring

            ¶Howe that we disheret oursilves
by oure disobedience.
Chaptre. x.
            NOwe must euery mā know that
alonly they that by suche love serue
God be the children of god his
heyres and shalbe saved. For he that gyveth
not thankes to God and loveth hym
not of this facyon for the goodnesse that
god of hym silf hath willingly done vnto
him is cause that he is not the child of god
and maketh him silf vnworthye of all the
promyses of God.
            Lyke as though there were a ma
                  •
                that
had gotten some grete rychesse by his laboure
& that he had .ij. sonnes / The. ij. sonnes

                vnto thē / for thei be

                he is naturelly son

               nd
heyre to the goodes as well as his other

brother / but he disheriteth him silf by
his evill life.
            So are all parsones the childrē of god / &
bought ageyn by Iesu Christ but they
that rebell ageinst god / and obey not vnto
his commaundementes disheryt theym silves
ād theym silves because of theyre dā
               pnacyon.
God wold willingly haue saved
theym / for he did promyse to theym
(emong other) the heritage of his kingdome
and had made theim his children / but
they dampne theym silves. They are the
children of God / as concerning goddis behalf / 
but they are alweyes dampned bicause
of theyre disobedience.
            Ye some tyme god calleth suche people
his frēdes / not that they be so / but bicause
thei mought haue bin so.Mat. 2 As he said vnto
Iudas / My frēd whie art thou come hither?Mat. 2
And vnto hī that came vnto the wedīges / 
my frēde how art thou entred here
not hauīg the weddīg garmēt. Behold he
is called frēde & yet neverthelesse he suffreth
hī to be cast into darknesse. he had bī the
frēd of god if he wold haue cōsented to the
wil of god.1 Iohn Saint Iohn saieth. There is
now mani an̄christes / thei wēt out frō vs

were not of vs / for if they had byn of vs
they had bydden with vs. So be all people
the children of god / but there be many
that make theym silves vnworthy ād depart
theym silves from god.
            The other sonne that abideth with his
father is a sonne / and abydeth a sonne and
heyre bicause he is obeisaunt vnto his father.
He hath not deserved by his good lyfe
and obedience the possessyon ād goodes
of his father / but he hath onely byn well
ware that he hath not lost theym by disobediēce:
For the father may sey. Dere son
it is true that thou hast kept to the best of
thy power my commaundementes / notwithst
                  •
               nding
thy goodnesse had never made
the riche yf I had not gotten it. Then
lyke wise all though that we kepe the cō
               maundementes
of god never so streytly it
shuld profit vs nothing if it were not that
Iesu christ had obteyned for vs the lyfe
eternall byfore of his hevynly father by
his deth. Oure goodnesse or iustice shulde
profit vs nothing if Iesus christ had not
laboured for vs. For (as saieth saint Paule)
The lawe hath brought nothing vnto
perfection.Hebr. 7 The Iues kept the cōmaundementes

that Iesu Christ must first dye for theym
Lykewyse can we not be saved by oure

For if by oure workes we may got helth

                  •
               hen must we nedes say that Christ is dede
in vayne. As saieth saint Paule. Ye if

Isaac / Iacob / David and many other Iu

the natiuyte of Iesu Christ / for they
kept better the commaundementes of god
then we do. But god will do it alone to
thintent that none glorifie or bost him silf
therof and that to him alone and to none
other he gyven all honour and glory for
ever Amen.
            For (as wryteth saynt Paule) The scripture
concludeth al thinges vnder sinne
that the promys by the feyth of Iesus
Christ shuld be gyven vnto theym that
beleve.Ga. 3 For this cause when the parsone
knoweth surely that god hath made hym
childe of the everlasting lyfe / by hys deth
byfore he had deserved it / he will do agayne
to god all the service that he can thinke / 

and all by love aud kindnesse shewing
that he will not be vnkind / not to get eny
thing of godbut
bycause he is his good father / 
and that he hath receyved al thinges
of him. For we haue nowe alredy al that
wherfore we must serve god. For he hath
made vs his children / and his heyres / 
while we were his enimyes / and byfore
that we knewe him as we haue many tymes
byfore saied. And hereyn lyeth the deserving
of the christen faith / that thou beleve
certeynly that thou art the child of god
and that thou kepest his commaundementes
bicause thou knowest and belevest stedfastly
that he hath so made the riche & greate / 
and that thou servest him by this faith
as a good childe his father / For the childe
dou
                  •
               teth not / but beleveth stedfastly that
he shall haue the substaunce of his father / 
and bycause he beleveth it stedfastly he laboureth
for to entreteyne it. So shalt thou
beleve without doubting eny thing that
thou art enheryter of heven. And therfore
shalt thou do thy diligence to kepe that herytage
to the honour of thy father.
            Thou shalt be ware that thou anger him
not but thou shalt thanke him oft bycause

he hath gyven the thys hevenly herytage.
            Behold nowe seist thou well bifore thine
yien howe moche we are bound to thā
               ke / 
prayse and serve god. and to kepe hys
commaundementes / and to kepe vs from

by verey love.

theves that suffred on the

& thei be thei that knowlege thē silves pore

did the poore publican that durst not lyft
vp hys yies toward heven / for they knowe
that they haue not kept the commaū
               demētes
of god so streytly as thei were bound.
They perceyue also that though
thei thīke to kepe thē never so well they
fele theim silves failing alweyes in detraction

                  •
               n hastinesse in anger / in idell wordes

in infidelite ād in lakke of loue / albeit that
suche folke do moche goodyet
theyre conscience is not content and in rest but as cō
               cerning
theym silves euer in sorowe. For
they knowe that they must appere byfore
the rightuous iudge / bifore whose face (as
sayeth the Psalmist) shall none lyving be
iustified / if we shuld be iudged after oure
deservinges.Psal. 142 And therfore come they and
cast theym silves prostrate byfore the mercy
of god and sey with the thefe on the right
syde.Lu. 23 Lorde haue mynd on me when
thou comest into thy kīgdome. Thou hast
commāunded me many thinges and I perceyue
in my silf that I am frayle and cā
               not
entierly kepe thy commaundementes
though I loke never so well therto. Neverthelesse
I knowe that thou nedest not
my good workes. Seing it is so that thou
hast so moche loved me that thou woldest
suffer deth for me / when I dyd not
yet knowe the / and was yet thyne enemye
I haue trust vnto the my most mercyfull
god that thou wilt not suffre hym to periss
he for whome thou hast shed thy bloude.
For I knowe that thou art a lord almightye
that mayest all thinges in heven

and in erth. And I knowlege and worship
the / & am certeyn that thou wilt not
dampne me. Albeit that I haue not deserved
heven by my good workes. I knowe
and beleve that thou hast satisfied for
me whē thou dydest suffre deth on the crosse.
Thou hast bought me agayn with thy
precyous bloude / and I am thyne / the devell
hath no ryght in me. Neverthelesse
yf thou wylt dampne me o mercyfull god
thou mayest well do it and ryghtuously / 
for I am thyne / and thou mayst do wyth
me all that thou wilt. I am thy creature.
Thy wyll be fulfilled yn erth as yn heven.Mat. 6
Yet alweyes to thintent that thy dolorouse
passyon be not lost in me I praye
the o my most mercyfull lord Iesu chryst / 
that thou wilt receyve me into grace / as
thou hast done the good these I knowe
that I am not worthye / and that I haue
not deserved yt. But to thintent that thy
greate mercy may be alweyes the more
manyfest / vnto the augmentacyon of thy
glory / I requyre the o God most pnissaunt
that thou wilt not put me a bak out
of thy syghte. For thy onely passyon ys
myghty ynough for to save me / wythwithout

my good workes. For if I 
                  •
               ought
deserve the life euerlastīg by my good
workes it shuld seme that thou haddest
suffered thy passion in vayne and that thou
haddest dyed on the crosse in vayne.
Seing therfore that thou art surely deed
for me and for all the worlde / not for thy
silf: whye shuld I then be lost o gracyous
Iesus christ? Save thou me / for thou art
all good / and mayst save me / for thou mayst
all thinges. Wherfore I knowe no remedye
but to come to thy grete mercy. and
I prostrate at thy fete requyre of the pardon
of all my sinnes. All they that of an
entier hert do thus trust in God / and trust
stedfastly that god will save theym / it shall
come vnto theym accordinge to theyre
feyth. And this is the most certeynte and
the most sure wey for to come to heven &
vnto the lyfe eternall / that euery one forsake
him silf and put all in the hond of god / 
alweyes doing his best to kepe the commaundementes
of God / and to lyve accordīg
to the teaching of the gospell / and altogyther
distrusting of him silf.
            The other that be signified by the thefe
on the lyfte honde are they that put all

theyre trust in theyre good workes. Thei
goo daily to the churche: they kepe & halowe
all the festfull dayes: they fast oft they
here masse daily: And when they must dye
they trust in theyre good workes / & thinke
that god oweth to theym the kingdom
of heven & that they theym silves haue deserved
it. These maner of people be sonest
dampned for they knowlege not that god
hath satisfied for theym / but make to theym
goddes of the workes of theyre hondes
counting therby that they haue deserved
heven, for that thing is euery mannes
god wherin he putteth his trust. This ys
one of the grettest errours that is in christē
               dome.
for if a man might save him silf by
his good workes Christ were deed in vayne:
As saieth saint Paul. Saint Iohn baptist / 
Abrahā / Isaac / ād Iacob / with many
other patriarkes have lyved moche more
holily then ever we shall lyve.Ga. 2 Yet coude
they never by theyre good workes come
to hevē. It was nedefull that christ shuld
first come to suffer deth for them that his
passion shuld sa
                  •
               e theym / not theyre workes / 
but the feith and trust that they had
yn 
                  •
                Goddis promyses / wherby they

beleved that Iesu Christ shuld come / and
shuld deliver theym?
            But I do not sey these wordes that
the good workes done in feyth shuld be evill.
No: I do counsell all the world to do
many good workes / principally the workes
of loue and mercy toward theyre neyghboures / 
yn socouring theym in all theyre
necessites onely for the loue and honoure
of god / without seching any other thing
and that he shuld so laboure frely & with
a ioyous hart to obey vnto the commaundementes
of God and counsell of the gospell / 
doing the workes comprysed in the
holy scripture / and not theym whiche the
covitousnesse of the Pharysees have devysed.
            But to do these workes and to thinke
to deserve everlasting lyfe and so to put
his trust in theym / is to lyve as do nowe
at this-day the Iues ād verey Idolatres.
For God will have the hole hart ād will
not that it be fixed on ony other thingbut
in hym alone. Ye he willeth that all that
we do in this lyfe / shalbe none other thing
but a token of kindnesse and giving of thā
               kes
of that we haue receyved of hym. for

if we haue stedfast faith and trust in hym
alone / we haue nowe receyved ād be sure
of that that suche tedious and wery workers
wold get / as we haue seid bifore ād
will sey more pleynly. And all suche scripulous
doers of good workes and therin
seking theyre helth and-trusting in theym
that thinke they shalbe saved when they
haue slayne noman / and when they have
drawen noman to sinne / and theruppon
putting theyre trust / be like vnto the pharisey
of whome Christ speaketh in the gospell
whiche rehersed his workes for to haue
prayse and reproved the poore humble
publican knowleging his faute and axing
pardon.Lu. 18
            
            It were better for the a thousand fold
that thou / haddest byn a sinner and never
done good dede / and that thou knowlege
thyne offences and evill life vnto god axing
mercy with good hert lamenting thy
sinnes: then to haue done suche good workes
and in theym to put thy trust thinkinge
that therfore God were bounde
vnto the. There is nothing whiche (after
the maner of speaking) byndeth God but
ferme and stedfast feith and trust in him &

his promyses. for god requyreth not principally
oure good workes / for he nedeth
theym not: but he desyreth oure hartes ād
all oure intencion to seke in all thinges no
thing but his honour: And that we trust
not in oure workes / but (forsaking oure
silves) all hoelly in him and not in oure deservinges.
For we can shewe vnto god
no gretter honour then feith and trust yn
him / for whosoever doth that / he confesseth
that god is true / good / mighty / and mercyfull.
And when we sinne it is not the worse
vnto god. we mynisshe not his glory by
oure sinnes for his glory cā nether be augmented
nor mynisshed forasmoche as it is
infinite. And for bycause that we can do
no maner hurt or annoysaunce vnto God
by oure sinnes therfore is he lightly appaised
this stonding that with an entier hert
without ony fayning we knowlege oure
defaute and demaunde humbly pardon.
And likewise when we do any good we
do not encrease his glory by oure workes
for god abideth alweyes one. All the daū
               ger
that there is in oure synne is the evyll
example that we gyve to oure neyghbour
in that we hurt him therby dispising the

good councell of oure good god whiche he
hath givē vs in his holy cōmaūdemētes / 
for bicause we be vnkind ageinst the grete
grace that he hath done vnto vs / which is
a thing horrible & worthy of eternall punisshemēt
bicause that it is infinite & eternall
(the holy cōmaundemēt) ageinst whiche
we haue offended. But bicause his proper
nature is good & mercyfull he pardoneth
all these that confesse him to be suche.
Therfore loveth god better a sinnar repenting
& axing pardone of his sinnes then he
doth a worker of good workes proudely
bosting him silf & tru
                  •
               ling in theym. For
(as it is said) God hath loved better the
publicā then the pharesey & hath shewed
more love vnto the poore opē sinners then
to the phareseys & ypochristes to whome it
semed that they had fulfilled the cōmaundemētes
of god / & that god coude nothyng
demaund of theym.
            For they reproved Iesu christ that he
was frende of the sinners & that he ete amōg
theim.Mat. 9. Oure lord demaūdeth nothing
but the hert and when he hath the herte / 
he regardeth not whether we fast / pray / 
or here masse / or whether we bere blewe

or gray. For all suche outward thī
               ges
be indifferent bifore god. When oure
hartes be ruled in God according to the
doctrine of the gospell / it is all one whate
thing we do / for we haue alweyes love / 
whiche teacheth vs whate thing we must
do / or leve vndone / for love doth nothing
in vayne.
            For this cause an humble hart not abyding
vppon his good workes though
he do theym: but putting all his hope and
trust in god and founding him silf vppon
his goodnesse / grace / and mercy / belevyng
stedfastly that god hath all satisfied for vs
and that of him silf he hath iustified vs &
gyuen vs helth / doth purely and liberally
without demaunding eny wages all the
service and all the good he can alweyes
knowleging him silfe to be dettour vnto
god and axing grace. Suche an hert is onely
plesaunt vnto god.
            Some might nowe sey. I beleve wel
all this that I am the childe of God / and
I must serve god by love and kindnesse / 
in knowleging onely by my service the
godnesse that he hath done vnto me but
whate shall I do for the better / how shall

I shewe vnto god my kyndnesse and loue?
Albeit that we have oft touched thys
mater byfore / yet we will declare yn the
Chaptre folowing more pleynly the thinges
that shall be nedefull to thys purpose.
         
         
            ¶Of good workes and by whate meane
they be most pleasing to God.
Chaptre .xij.
            
               FOrasmoche as I haue moche
spoken of the feith and trust yn
god to thintent that the evill ād
perverse (whiche interprete and
take all thinges to the worse and corrupt
theym) shall not sey that I do lerne and
counceyle you to do no good workes I
will nowe shewe you whate thinges ye
shall do.
            I haue many tymes seyd that fayth
bringeth Charyte / and charite good workes.
For if thy feith induce the not to do
good workes: then hast thou not the right
fayth. Thou doest but onely thinke that
thou hast it. For saint Iames sayeth that
faith without workes is dede in it silf.Ia. 2 He
feith not that it is lytell or feble but that it
is deed. And that that is deed is not. Therore

when thou art not moved by feith vnto
the love of god / and by the love of god
vnto good workes / thou hast not the feyth / 
but the feith is deed in the. for the sprite
of god that by feyth comith into our hertes
to styre vp loue can not be ydell. Euery
one doth as moche as he beleveth / and
loveth as moche as he hopeth.Iohn. 3 As wryteth
Saint Iohn / he that hath this hope
that he is the sonne of god purifyeth hym
silf as he is pure. He seith not he that purifyeth
him silf hath this hope. for the hope
must come byfore / proceding from the feith
as it behoveth that the tre must first be
good whiche must bring forth good frute.
Thē it behoveth to know first that ye are
the children of God and afterward to laboure.
            But whate shall we do? we shall do
and lyve so with oure christen bretheren / 
as Christ hath lived and done with vs that
is to sey as Iesu christ hath offred him
silf to vs and for vs so must we present &
give oure silves as it were a Christ for to
serve theym / and to socoure vnto theire nede.Phi. 2.
As saieth Saint Paule: Let the same
mynde be in you the which was in Christ

Iesu / which being in the shape of god ād
thought it no robberi to be equal with god
Neuerthelesse he made him silf of no reputaciō
& toke on him the shape of a servaūt
ād all for our proufit. And so must we helpe
serve & comfort one an other as Iesu
christ hath done with vs. we may not seke
oure owne proufit avaūtage or honoure
but al thīges profitable vnto our neighbour
alweyes mīdfull to procure the honoure
of god & that in al thīges we helpe oure
christē brother, for so warneth vs. S. paule
that none seke his owne profit / but his
neyghboures & that all that we do be vnto
the honoure of God. we must set byfore
vs the lyfe of Iesu Christ as a rule of
all thing that is expedient for vs to do / or
to leve vndone. we must take payne to folowe
hym in mekenesse / in love / in swetnesse / 
and in compassyon. And to lyve so
with oure neyghboure as Iesus christ hath
lyved with vs.
            For Iesu Christ was not borne for
hym silf / nor hath not lived here for hī silf / 
but for vs. He sought not his owne honoure
but his hevēly fathers Likewise shalt
thou not seke that is proufitable vnto the
but 
                  •
               ovenable vnto thi neighbour. As teacheth

vs saint Paul in al his epistles & namely
in the first vnto the Corīthiēs I seke
                  
                     •
                  or. 10
not (saieth he) that that is necessary & proufitable
vnto me but that that is proufitable
to many to thintent that they shuld be saved.Ephe. 4
And vnto the Ephesians. He that
robbed let him robbe no more but laboure
rather with his hondes and that is good / 
to thintent that he haue wherof to gyve
to him that hath nede.Ga. 6 And vnto the Gaiathiens.
Bere (sayeth he) eyther of you others
charges and burdons & so shall yon
fulfill the lawe of god.
            And for bicause that we speke nowe
of good workes. It must be knowen that
we must do some workes for our silves &
some for oure christen bretheren / but all for
the love and honour of god. Theym that
we shall do for oure silves teacheth vsEol. 3
saint Paule seying that we must mortyfie
in vs all evill desires / and all carnall operacyons
as vnclennesse covityze / wrathe / 
blasphemye / detraction pryde and other lyke
vices.Ro. 6 And vnto the Romayns. That
sinne reygne not in your mortall b
                  •
               dy / that
is to sey / albeit that we cā not lyve without
the mocyon of suche evill desyres we

shall not suffre thē to rule in vs but shall
mortyfie theym in resisting theym.
            Whate we shuld do for oure Christen
bretheren teacheth vs like wise saint Paule
sayng. Serve ye one an other by love &
bere ye one an others burthen. For christ
commaundeth vs to exercyse the workes
of mercy wherof he shall hold his iudgement.
All other workes that men do at this
day in the churches be rather found by
auarice then commaunded of god / except
the prayers whiche may in no wise be done
to get money / but alonely by loue yn
praying one for an other.
            Behold nowe seest thou well howe
grete occasyon thou hast to do good. For
thou hast alweyes occasion to mortyfie
thine evill desires to serve thyne neyghboure / 
to comfort hym / to helpe hym / with
worke / with worde / with counceyl / with
exhortacyon / and by other semblable meanes / 
In suche loue towardes oure neyghboure
for the loue of God lyeth all the lawe
and the prophetes (as sayeth Christ).
Ye and all the verey Christente / and nat
in fasting / keping of halydayes / watching
praying and synging long prayers / dayly

and all day hering of masses / setting vp of
candels / runnyng on pilgremages / and other
suche thinges / whiche aswell the ypochrites / 
proude people / envious / and subiectes
to all wikked affections doo: Ye ād
many tymes enforce theym silf more there
vnto then the good christen. But so to serve
and socoure the one the other by verey
love can none do but they that haue true
faith and the verey love of god. And whosoever
so loveth his christen brother he is
alweyes ioyfull in his conscience. For he
knoweth surely that he is the child of god
and that God is his good father / and is
well content in his courage of all that god
sendeth vnto him. But he that hath not
this love is alweyes sory / full of anguisshe
and woteth not whate to do to deserve
more / he fasteth / he kepeth halydayes / 
nowe of one saint / nowe of an other. He seyth
his prayers nowe bifore one altre / nowe
bifore an other. He renneth on pilgremage
nowe here nowe there and can never
come vnto the rest and quyet of his cō
               science.
For suche workes make no man
sure / but make rather ypochrites trustyng
in theyre workes.
            
               
But the verey faithfull cleveth to god / 
for he knoweth that he may never satisfie
nor do ynough to deserve the everlasting
life. And therfore he putteth hys trust yn
god & beleveth stedfastly that he hath satisfied
for vs / & that he hath iustifyed vs.
And therfore it is all one to hī whate thīg
he do so that he please him & exercyse charyte
to his neyghbour for the love of god
for he knoweth that God demaundeth
nothing but the hert ād that he regardeth
not howe we doo the worke so that yt be
according to the teachīg of the gospell whiche
commaundeth but charyte. And so comith
he by feyth and trust in God vnto
rest and quyet of hert and conscience and
is well cōtent to dye whē it pleaseth god
         
         
            ¶Of .iiij. maner of feythes after the
holy scripture and whiche
is the Christen feyth.
Chaptre .xiij.
            
               THis present Chapitre (bycause
I haue moche spoken of faith / &
that scarcely of a thousand one
knoweth not this feith) teacheth
of how many maner feithes there is made
mēciō in the holy scripture / not as do now

the doctours whiche have founde many
maner of feythes. I will onely speke of
iiij. maner of feithes whiche are most comunely
foūde in the holy scripture. The first
faith is this whiche the marchauntes hold
one to an other and feithfull frendes / wherby
they kepe promyse and fidelite the one
to the other:Eccle. 2
                     •
                   
                  
                     •
                  nd. 27 wherof speketh the wise saying:
possesse or kepe feith with thy frende / 
in his povertye: to thintent that in his welth
thou mayst be ioyfull. And ageyn he
that discloseth the secret of his frende / loseth
his faith. And in the Proverbes: He
that gyveth his faith for a straunger shall
be vexed with evell. And this is the faith
wherof the worldly people complaine seying
there is no feith in the worlde.
            The seconde feith is when we beleve
that a thing is to come / and suche thinges
as we here or rede: as we beleve that Rome
is a Cytie in Italye / or that Cartage
was destroyed of the Romayns / and this
we beleve although we haue not sene yt.
Also we beleve that Iesu Christ hath he
relyved on erth and that he hath preached
and that he is d
                  •
               ed for vs / and that he hath
done many other thinges. when we beleve

these thinges after the story we beleve
that this is oure christen faith / The simple
people aloneli doth not beleve this but
also many doctours in Theologye which
are taken for wise. Ye the devell hath also
this faith / as sayeth saint Iames: The
devels beleve and tremble.Ia. 2. for (as we haue
seyd byfore) the devell beleveth that
god is god / and that Iesus Christ hath
here preached / that he was deed / buryed &
rysen. This must we also beleve / but yet
this is not the faith wherof speaketh the
gospell and saint Paule.
            The third faith is that we beleve that
god may all thinges / and that he is rightuous / 
good and holye. This faith haue
also the devels and Iudas had it also / ād
other disciples that did miracles in the name
of Iesus but they were therfore never
the better. for when they bosted theym silves
and were ioyfull that by theyre faith
they expulsed the devils in the name of
Iesus.Lu. 10 Iesus Christ hath reproved them
saying: Ioy not you that the spretes be
vnder your power / but reioyce bicause youre
names be writen in heven.1. Cor. 1
                     •
                  
                Of this fayth
writeth saint Paule vnto the Corinthians

saying: If that I had all feith so
that I coude move mountaignes oute of
theyre places / and yet had no love I were
nothing.
            The .iiij. faith is oure Christen fayth / 
wherof so moche speake Iesu christ / saynt
Paule and saint Iohn / and sey that it ys
the foundacion of christendome. And this
is the feith wherof I speake in this boke
None hath this faith but they that put all
theyre trust / hope comfort / refuge and fynally
all theire helth in god alone serching
all these thinges in him and loking for thē
of him / and not of theyre deservinges or
good workes. Of this feith speaketh saint
Paul saying: whosoever call on the name
of god shalbe saved.Ro. 10 And the prophete Ieremye / 
Blessed is that man that trusteth
in the lord god.Iere. 17 And Christ in the Gospell
To thinient that none that beleve in him
shuld periss he but shuld haue everlasting
life.Iohn. 3 And in the boke called Paralipomenō
Beleve in your lord God and you shalbe
assured and without thought.Pa. 20 Beleve his
Prophetes and all happy thinges shal come
vnto you. And almost all the Psalmes
all the prophetes and all the leves of the

holy Byble teache vs that we must beleve
and hope in God by a sted fast fayth.
wherof speaketh so moche Saynt Paule
the apostle / and whiche he prayseth so moche
in all hys epistles. And (as we haue
abundauntly sayd in the Chaptres byfore)
none may comprehend thys fayth / 
but he that considereth whate was the fayth
of Abraham: As wryteth saynt Paule
vnto the Galathyans saying: Abraham
beleved God and yt ys rekened to hym
for ryghtuousnesse.Ga. 
                     •
                  
                For by hys fayth hath
he obteyned that he ys called oure father
and we be called hys children yn the
holye scripture / that ys to sey / we be the
childern of the fayth. For by the meane
of oure fayth we be saved / as Abraham
was iustified by his fayth and hath gotten
by hys fayth that all they that shall
haue suche fayth may lyke wyse be iustyfyed.
For this cause whosoever hath
not the fayth of Abraham / nothing can
come vnto hym of that whiche Abraham
beleved. That ys to say / when
God ys not thy hope and thy comforte / 
when thou abydest not wyth a

stedfast trust vppon God when thou art
not redy to suffer and endure all thinges / 
namely also the deth for the loue and honour
of god: And also to lose all that thou
hast in the world thou art not the childe of
Abraham. For Abraham was redy to all
thinges wherunto god wold send hym.
Suche was Iob when he sayed:Iob. 13 Albeit
that he kill me I will put my trust in him
And the wise saieth.Pro. 12 Whatsoever thing come
to the rightuous let him not sorowe.
And saint Pa
                  •
               le saieth who shall separat
vs from the love of Iesu Christ?Ro .8. shall tribulacion
persecucion 
                  •
               werd or deth? And
as saint Petre saieth:1. Pet. 3. who is he that may
hurte you if ye be haunters and folowers
of goodnesse. For all that ever comyth vnto
the when thou hast this feith be it of mā
or of the devell all comyth to thy proufit.
As saieth saint Paule vnto the Romains
To theym that love God all thinges be
helping and avauncement to good.Ro. 8.
            
            And therfore pray we alweyes that the
will of god be done. For as he is not here
come (as he seyd him silf) to do his will / Mat. 6.
but the will of his hevenly father / So shallIohn. 5
not the good Christen desyre that hys

owne will be done / but the will of God.
And therfore shalt thou bere al thinges paciently
as did Abraham with a stedfast feyth
knowing surely that god will not forsake
the for god is thy father and thou art
his childe. And it behoveth that he do
with the what him pleaseth. For seyng
that he is all good he will nothing but thine
helth.
            None can have suche a feyth if he haue
not therwith the love of god. And he that
hath the loue of god / hath fulfilled the lawe
for all the scriptures teache vs none other
thing but that we loue god with all
oure hartes and oure neyghbour as oure
silf / as it is writen in saint Mathewe.Mat. 22. None
is a true christen but he that hath this
loue. All other be rather ypochrites then
Christen. For all good workes which be
not done by charyte / and of good will are
all synne byfore God as saieth saint Austyn:
He that doth good ageynst his will / 
he doth evill albeit that that that he doth
be good. For all that I do ageynst my
will I hate it. And when I hate the commaundement
I hate also him that hath cō
               maunded
it. And as long as the parsone

ys suche he may not be rightuous▪ for none
may be rightuous but he that kepeth &
fulfilleth the commaundementes of God
by charyte / and with a ioyfull hart. And
this is a singular grace of god. And therfore
may none be proude of it / for he cā not
haue it of him silf. So hath a man nothing
of him silf wherwith he may exalt him silf
For without God can we do nothing.Iohn. 15
As Christ him silf sayeth / wit out me cā
ye do nothing / No not ones haue of your
silf one good thought as sayeth saint Paule.1. Cor. 4
whate hast thou that thou hast nor receyved
wherfore there is no wey more sure
to come to everlasting life then to humble
him silf byfore God / and to pray hym
humbly of mercy nothing trusting in hys
good workes / but with a ferme trust forsaking
him silf to knowlege alweyes to
god his imperfection. For we can come to
nothing by oure good workes if we put
eny trust in theym. For they are nothing
eis but sinne / and stinking byfore God / 
when God helpeth vs not by hys grace.Esai. 64
As saieth the prophete Esaie. We are all
made vnclene and all oure iustice is as yt
were a clothe of a womā that suffreth the

fluxe of bloude.
            And therfore I can never merveyle
ynough that many of the religyous parsones
wolde make other parttakers of thyre
good workes / by bretheryeldes and
fraternytees / seyng that Christ saieth yn
the Gospell: After that ye haue done all
that to you ys commaunded / say ye / we
be vnproufitable servauntes / we haue done
but oure duetye. For none can do to
moche. None doth more then he ys bound
to do / but onely Iesu Christ whyche1. Pet. 2.
onely (as sayeth Saynt Petre the apostle
yn his .ij. epistle) Never dyd synne
nether was there deceyte found yn hys
mouth) hath done that he was not bound
to do (And as sayeth the Prophete
Esaye) hath taken vppon hum all oure
languores.Csa. 53 And all oure sorowes dyd he
beare / he was wounded for oure inyquytees / 
he was beten for oure offences / and
by hys strype spottes were we made hole.
            His iustice was onely parfait iustice for
he hath done that he was not boūd to do.
But we of our silves whē we do our best
yet can not oure iustice be parfeyt when

after oure advice we do more then we are
bounde to do yet be we vnrightuous and
if we will be rightuous so must goddes
rightuousnes make vs rightuous. for as
sayeth saint Pa
                  •
               le / Christ of god to vs is
made wisdome iustice sanctificacyon and
redempcion to thintent that (as it is wryten)
He that rei
                  •
               yseth shuld reioyce in the
lord.1. Cor. 1 Saint Paule also teacheth vs yn all
his epistles that Iesus Christ is oure iustice
and that by him we shalbe saved ād
by none other.
            Nowe seest thou well / that none can do
to moche. For of him silf none can do ynough:
and that we must take oure comfort
of the satisfaction of Iesus Christ. Then
whye will some sell vnto vs theyre merytes
aud good workes and make vs parttakers
of theym: And if it be not
that suche ypochristes forsake theyre trusting
vppon there good workes and that
they lerne for to trust vppon the iustice ād
satisfaction of Christ they theym sylves
shall never be saved. For the Pharesey
had done many good workes but bycause
that he stode well yn hys owne conceyte
gloryfyed and bosted hym sylf therof / 

therfore he was forsaken of God.
         
         
            ¶In whate thing lyeth the
Christendome. Chaptre
.xiiij.
            
               TKen lyeth the verey Christianyte
in this thing / that thou do all
thing that Charyte proceding
from thy faith iudgeth to be agreable
vnto god. And whē thou hast all done
with the lest evill that thou canst / that
thou iudge thy silfe yet an vnproufitable
servaunt / and that by all thy good workes
thou hast yet deserved nothing / or yf
there be eny thing well done that it apartayneth
to god albeit that by his goodnesse
he will reward it and that he so reward
the goodnesse that he hath done himsilf by
his holy sprite beyng in vs. And therfore
haue we nothing but that that comyth of
god vppon whome we must abyde (for
I haue often sayed) Christ is oure iustice
that is to sey Christ hath satisfied for vs / 
not to thintent that we shuld not satisfye
but bycause we can not satisfye. And whē
one vnderstondeth this he seeth well howe
he shuld humble him silf byfore God / 
and in whome he shal seke his helth. And

when we thus distrust in ur silves of oure
good workes we shall forsake our silf
and stikke all holly to god with a stedfast
faith and parfait trust. And so doyng we
make force vnto the kingdome of heven.
            And this is it that God requyreth of
vs and then he holdeth to vs hys promyse
and he iustifieth vs when we dye with
suche a trust not for oure workes / but for
hys holy name: For he hath promysed vs
that we shall be his children. So brought
he the children of Israell into the lond of
promission / not by theyre meryte (for they
were many tyme rebelles / and murmured
ageynst hym) but to fulfyll hys promyse.
For he had promysed it to Abrahā / 
Isaac and Iacob.
            So shall not the Christen distrust albeit
he fynde no good in hym sylf / nor yn
his owne vertue / but he shall yeld hym
sylf hoelly to the mercy of god and axe pardon
of his imperfection wyth a perfayt
trust consydering howe grete love Christ
hath shewed vnto hym. And thus doyng
he ge

                  •
               h an hope and trust yn the goodnesse
of God / and beleveth stedfastly that
his synnes are forgyven not by his good

workes (for when they be compared vnto
the goodnesse requyred of God there
ys no comparyson) but by Iesu Christ
to whome he putteth his trust. For Iesu
Christ possessith the kingdome of heven / 
by double ryght.
            First for bycause he is the sonne of God
and verey enheryter of his Royalme.
            Secundly bycause he hath gotten hyt by
his passyon and deth. Of this secunde right
he hath no nede / and therfore he gyveth
it to all theym that beleve and trust
yn hym and yn hys promyses.
            For as God the father loveth Christ he
loveth likewise all theym that love him &
beleve in him.
            So there shall none discomfort hī silfe
when he shall dye but he must beleve surely
that he shalbe saved. And albeit that
one have not deserved by his good works
yet neverthelesse he must beleve it bicause
of the promyse of god. for god hath promysed
it to all theym that beleve it. And if we
beleve it he owith hyt vnto vs bycause
of hys promesse and bycause that he ys
true.
            
               
But if God had promysed heven vnto
vs bycause of oure workes we shuld
ever be vnsure of oure helth for we shuld
never knowe howe moche nor howe lōg
we must laboure to be saved and shuld be
ever in thought that we had done to litell
and that more is we shuld never dye ioyfully.
But god wold assure vs of heven / 
by his promesse to thintent we shuld be
certeyn and sure: For he is the truthe that
can not lye. And also to thintent that we
shuld haue trust ād hope in him / Notwithstonding
that after the gretnesse and multitude
of oure synnes it seme to vs a thing
impossible yet alweyes we shall beleve it
without ony doubt bicause of his sure
promesse. And whosoever knowyth
thys he may ioyfully
dye and abyde the iudgement
of God whyche
els were yntollerabill.
         
         
            ¶Howe that we shall not sorowe
for feare of deth.
Chaptre .xv.
            
               
               THe helth of a Christen lyeth
not in this life or in that
that one lyveth longe yn
this world / but rather yn
the deth. For we can not
be saved but by deth. Therfore
the deth in him silf is not yvill but is
rather to be desyred. As did saint Paule
saint Martyne saint Austyn and many other
saintes whiche desired al the deth for
in this lyfe there is no proufit / but alwey
to sinne more and more / and alweyes vnredy
to dye.
            Therfore thou shalt diligently studye
and exercise thy silf in this present boke / 
ād in the faith wherof I haue moche spoken
of ād then forsaking thy silf entyerly
thou shalt trust vnto the grace mercy and
good will of god alweyes rather desiring
to dye and to be with god then to lyve here
ony longer. This shall thy sprite desyre.
for the flesshe can not desyre suche thinges.
And so shalt thou holde thy silf stedfastly
vnto god beleving that thou art his
childe and that he is thy father & that thou
belongest to him.
            For God hath bought the ageyn and

hath made the his child and his heyre whē
thou were yet hys enymye. And if he haue
bought the when thou knewest hym
not howe moche more will he nowe take
the to mercy when thou knowest hym / 
and when thou axest mercy with a stedfast
fayth and trust in hym. And bycause
a man can not lyve here without synne
therfore he can never satisfye vnto God
for hys synnes. And for this cause shall
the Christen willingly yeld hym silf vnto
the deth for the love of God: As Iesus
Christ hath done for vs. And by suche a
willing deth which is taken with a good
will by suche fayth and trust / and also by
the love that we have to God all synnes
are clerely defeated and put awey. For
none can do more greate penaunce then
to dye wyllingly for to fulfill the will of
God.
            Therfore thou shalt not be sory for deth / 
but thou shalt forsake willingly and
with a ioyfull hert all thy goodes and all
thy frendes for to obey god. They that die
with suche a courage and suche a trust yn
god it is a certeyn signe that they be saved
And to thintent that none shuld feare or

be discomfort by deth / Christ is first deed
him silf and hath takē awey the power of
deth. None shall haue horror of the deth / 
if he haue this feith for it is nowe none other
thing but a dore and entre wherby
one goith from this lyfe tēporall vnto the
life eternall. For christ saieth by the mouth
of the prophete Osee.Osee. 13 1. Cor. 15 O deth I wilbe
thy deth. And saint Paule saieth. Deth
where is thy victory.
            Wherfore yt is moche to be rebuked
the folisshe custume and maner of wepyng
bewaylyng and takyng of sorowe for the
deed as though we had no maner of hope
or beleve on the other lyfe. Let the
paynems wepe and wayle which haue no
hope of the euerlastyng lyfe. I mervayle
that we be so moche ynfideles seyng
that seint Paul teacheth vs not to be
sory for oure frendes deed saying vnto the
Thessalonyans: My bretheren we wyll
not that ye be ignoraunt of theym that slepe
that ys to sey of theym that be deed to1. Tessa. 4
thintent ye shulde not be sory as are other
that have no hope. Behold Saynt Paule
calleth the deth none other thyng but a
slepe from the whyche Iesu Christ shall

wake vs at the day of iudgement. And yf
we haue suche a feith / as is that wherof
I haue nowe spoken of we shall be nothing
sory but rather ioyfull when eny
dyeth. Whosoever is sory for suche thing
he synneth. For he is sory that the will of
god is done. Then let none be sory therfore
for it is but all folye and infidelite.
            Thou shalt not ordeyne where thou
wilt be buryed or whate stone thou wylt
haue on thy tombe for it is all pryde and
vaynglory and proufiteth nothing / ye yt
is grete synne bifore god. For it is all one
bifore god if thou be buryed in the churche
or in the churcheyard or yn any other place.
And all the pompes and ceremonyes
wherwith the deed are buryed is more institute
for the proufyt and advauntage of
the lyving / then to help the deed. For they
proufit or helpe nothing at all vnto the
deed.
            The best preparacyon vnto deth ys to
love nothing in this world / to set his hert
on none erthly thing: but so to entreate ād
vse all temporall thinges that one may be
alweyes redy to forsake theym ād to loue
better to be with god then here.
            
               
wilt thou nowe knowe who dyeth helthfully
as ferre as man may haue knowlege.
Me semyth after the scripture that
when a man or a woman hath loving cō
               versacion
with his neyghboure / or if they
be maryed to gyther in an holy love / glad
to here talke of god / giving willingli after
theyre power for goddis sake / and are not
sory or discomforted for the losse of theyre
goodes / or of any other adversite willingly
comforting the desolate and dieth in a
stedfast faith and with good will it is
to be thought that suche a parsonne shuld
be saved.
            Nowe forbicause I haue moche spoken
of the faith and howe we be the children
of god I will write howe all
estates shuld lyve / and of every
estate alone a doctryne
after the Gospell and
epistles of. S. Paule.
And first of
monkes ād
nonnes.
         
         
            ¶Of the life of Monkes whate it
was yn tymes passed.
Chaptre .xvi.
            
               
               IN tymes passed there were no
holyer parsones then monkes.
And all they that wold lyve according
to the gospell were wont
to gyve theym silves vnto that life bycause
they had a more gretter occasyon ād
help to leade a good lyfe / then with theym
of the world. A parsone mought better kepe
his symplicite / chastyte / sobryete / humilyte
and other vertues in such assemble of
holy parsones then he coud do among the
seculers and worldly whiche sought but
thinges carnall. So was then the lyfe of
monkes the fontaygne of christendome.
But thou must know that the monkes of
that tyme were all other then they of this
present tyme. They made no vowes no
                  •
               
promyses as they do nowe. None was
then constreyned to chastite or to other vertues
ageynst his will. They were subiect
and obeysaunt vnto the commaundement
of theyre Abbot willingly as though god
had commaunded theym. For theyre
superyours commaunded theym nothing
but the commaundementes of God and of
the Gospell.
            And bycause I may not reherse the

lyfe of all Monkes I wyll speke here
of .iiij. maner of Monkes / to thyntent that
ye may knowe how the life of monkes is
chaunged.
            The first monkes was Helyas & Helizeus / 
the sonnes of Ionadab / the sonnes
of the prophetes / saynt Iohn Baptist / &
other lyke. They were parsones lyvyng
yn abstynence / yn wyldernesse. But
the lyfe of theym hath no maner similytude
vnto the life of oure monkes nowe a
dayes.
            Not long after that oure savioure christ
is ascended vnto heven / ys there come an
other sect of Monkes / of whome wryteth
Pi
                  ••
               lo and Eusebius. These monkes had
theyre begynning of the disciples of saynt
Marke. with theym dwelled wymen ād
lyued to gyther separat from the people
yn sobryete / chastyte and love. And
they lauded God with reding of the psalmes / 
with fastinges and prayers: And lyved
hoelly after the life whiche thappostles
had first enterprysed emong whome
all thinges were comon.Acto. 4 As wryteth
Saynt Luke yn thactes of thappostles.
            
               
Many have folowed the life of these mo
                  •
               
               kes
here as saint Effrem / saint Machayre / 
saint Hierome / saint Heliodore / and many
other holy parsones that then were in
the world as a man may perceyve in the
bokes of saint Iohn Chrysostome.
            Of suche life was also saynt Martyne
with his bretheren. They were not ydell
but writing of bokes and labouring with
theyre hondes for to get theyre expences.
They made no vowes nor profession.
Every one mought eate fast & reade whē
he wolde like as did the seculers. They came
many tymes to gyther to communyon
and prayer. They had no certeyn masses / 
nor houres to syng dayly. And when yt
was noyous vnto theym they mought avoyde
out of the company / for they were
not constreyned there to abyde by any professyon.
And when a Bisshop or an herdman
dyed they toke custumably one of these
monkes for a newe Bisshop and herdman / 
for they were then holy and lettered
parsones.
            After theym came the thyrde secte of
monkes / of the whiche was saint Benet / 
Montanus / Gregory / and other monkes / 

of the ordre of saint Benet. In that tyme
was the life of monkes sum whate charged
with a certeyn nombre of Psalmes / 
with certeyn prayers / with one certeyn
habite and ordre and with other ceremonyes.
Neverthelesse saint Benet dyd not
so charge his ordre / but submitted all vnto
the discrecyon of the Abbot to dispence chaunge
and do all thinges accordinge as he
shuld thinke it best convenient after the tyme.
And bicause they were men of holye life
the 
                  •
               ytesins toke of theym to theyre pastores
& bisshopes. So came it afterward
to passe that the princes and grete parsonages
haue had favoure ād love vnto the
cloysters / and haue gyven theym moche
goodes and possessions / and haue founded
newe monasteryes / so that they be thus
multiplied in the worlde / as thou mayst
see. And bicause that to moche goodes ād
possessions haue be gyven vnto thē theyre
good discipline and life is by lytell and
lytel brought to nought and corrupted by
rychesse. So that they have enterprysed
to make sumpluous bnyldinges / costly vestmentes / 
and haue begonne to eate and
drynke delyca
                  •
               ly / haue bought precyous

vessels / chalices / and other ornamentes in
theyre churches. So haue they enterprysed
to lyve / not as monkes but as lordes
By these thinges here is coled the spryte
and love of God. Thus loving the sprite
they haue taken the flesshe ordeyning all
theyre holynesse yn foreyn / and outward
thinges / and ceremonyes / as in reding
theyre houres / in singing / in kne
                  ••
               g
in habytes and many other ceremonyes.
But humilite / contemptibilite / sobriete / pacyens
and povertie they haue forgetten.
And by suche meanes is the life of monkes
come vnto voluptuousnesse and vnto
all vanyte by thabundaunce of richesse.
Thus haue they begonne to be ydell / and
wold not get theyre expences by laboure
of theyre hondes / as it was ordeyned at
the beginning. Thus by ydelnesse are thei
come vnto all evell and perversite and by
grete hepes be they fled out of theyre cloysters
Monkes and Nonnes. Then
was it ordeyned (as it semith) that bifore
saint Bernardes tyme the monkes did make
professyon.
            After that the life of monkes was so
corrupted came saint Bernard to cloyster

and then were the monkes refourmed.
Then did they ageyn diligently take theyre
astate and began ageyn to charge theyre
ordre with profession and promesse and
haue made many statutes after the whiche
they mought live / and wherby they
might compell men therto for the willing
sprite was clere extinct in theym.
            After this is comen the .iiij. secte of
monkes. As Norbertus / saint Dominyk
saint Fraunceys. And of theym are nowe
comen many sectes / as the observau
                  •
               tes / 
freres minors / Collettes / and Mar
                  ••
               ās
Saint Dominyk hath byn as fertill as
saint Fraunceys. And thus be the cloysters
and monkes multiplied without nō
               bre.
But the gretter that the nombre of mō
               kes
and nonnes hath byn the gretelyer hath
vertue and charite ben minisshed for they
haue begonne to make divysions and
partes the one ageinst the other for to knowe
whiche of theyre ordres were most holy
and better then other and many other
folyes.
            After this haue the mōkes gottē popes
and cardynals of theyre relygion. And
also they haue purchased and gotten to

the despyte and contempte one religyon of
an other many privileges / pardons and
auctoritees to make cōfrayries for the seculers
whome thy make parttakers of theyre
good workes as though: they dyd more
then they are bounde to do. Notwithstonding
that Christ him silf sayeth in the
gospell:Lu. 17 After that ye haue done all that
to you is commaunded: yet sey ye: we be
vnproufitable servauntes we haue done
but that whiche we were bound to do.
            Thus are the cloysters and monkes
multiplied / and all charyte among theym
mynysshed. In tymes passed was the lyfe
of monkes a departing from the world / 
and nowe they are called monkes whiche
in the myddes of the world by ād sell / iudge / 
drynk / eate and be conversaunt like seculers / 
and yet will still be called monkes
or racher religious. They do the better to
be called religyous then monkes after the
life that they lede nowe. for monkes after
the greke worde signyfieth solytary or lyving
alone as they were wont to lyve byfore
tymes when theyre life was good ād
holye. But religyous after the la
                  •
               yne ys
bonde and subiect. For whate is now the

life of the religious but a supersticious subiection
vnto certeyn vayne ceremonyes.
Therfore they may nowe by good reason
be called religious that is to sey captyves
imprysoned in a ceremoniall life ād all Indaicall / 
forasmoche as they kepe not theyre
ordre liberally / and willingly / but for
the most part by constreynt. But there intent
is not to be called religyous sor thys
cause. For this worde religious betokeneth
sometyme / holy and gyven to the servise
of god. And therfore they wolde so be
called entending to be taken more holyer
then other. Albeit that thappostell sey: If
eny man thinke that he is sum whate whē
in dede he is nothing / the same deceyveth
him silf in his imaginacion.
            Alweyes in old tymereyned all vertue
emong the religious. They haunte
                  •
               
not the worldly people ād therfore might
they well be called monkes / that is to sey / 
solitaryes living alone and also religious
that is to sey holye and bound vnto all
vertue. But nowe ye shall finde no where
no gretter eaters / banqueters / drinkers
(I dare not sey drūkardes) chidinges nor
envy thē emong theym. They thinke that

when they kepe theyre rule outwardly in
habite / kneling / becking / singing / reding / 
fasting / seying of masse / ād in other semblable
ceremonyes / that they be then saintes
and vertuous / albeit that all these thinges
thus done without the sprite and fre will
be nothing els bifore god but supersticion
pryde and ypochrisie.
            Thus do they dayly encrease theyre
supersticious ceremonyes trusting therun
to bicause they haue not the same feyth &
sprite that the religious had in tymes passed.
Beforetymes the 
                  •
               ove of God stered
theym to do suche thinges. Nowe they
do it all of a necessite as though they coude
not be saved without suche thinges / making
to theym ydols and Goddes of the
workes of theyre hondes. Then howe
is it nowe a religious lyfe? I se nothing
wherfore one shuld entre ynto religyon.
         
         
            ¶Whether the life of a Monke
be better then the lyfe of a
comon Eytesyn.
Chaptre
.xvij.
            
               
               THe life of monkes as it is
nowe vsed in the worlde
is none other thing but a
secte and theryn lyeth no
more holynesse then in the
life of a good housholder.
wherfore the state that the mōkes become
to nowe a dayes is moche to be playned.
And if thou wilt knowe that I sey truth
cōpare the life of a good honsholder vnto
the life of a good monke / & behold whiche
agreeth most vnto the doctrine of the gospell.
The monke is obeysaunt vnto hys
Abbot / Pryour or warden. The housholder
vnto his pastor or herdman in that it
pleasith him to commaund him in fastinges
holydayes and suche like and that many
tymes more willingly then the monke
to his Abbot.
            The monke promyseth povertye but
he never wanteth as seith Saynt Barnard.
He is fedde and nourisshed of the
goodes of other gayned by the laboure
of other. He gyveth to none but receyveth
every where. The housholder
liveth not of almesse as doth the monke or

frere but gayneth his lyving with the labour
of his hondes / ye he giveth almesse
according to his power. So is better herin
the housholder then the religious:
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   20 For
Christ him silf saieth that it is more blessed
to give then to receive.
            The thirde thing that the monke promiseth
is chas
                  •
               ite / neverthelesse the state of
matrimonye pleaseth god also / for he himsilf
hath institute it. The monke promisyth
to kepe the rule of a man. The housholder
is content with the promise that he hath
made at the font of baptesme so that he
may kepe it well. For the good life lieth
not in moche promising / but in kepīg wel
that whiche one hath promised. The monke
reioyseth bicause saint Fraunceys or
saint Dommike is his superiour. The housholder
holdeth god for his superiour.
The monke hath the rule of a man. The
housholder the rule of god / that is to say / 
the gospell. Then whie will the Monke
holde him silf more holy then the comon
housholder? God is egally like nighe vnto
all theym that love him with all theire
hert and lyve according to the gospell 
                  •
                be
he monke or chanone / reguler or seculer.
            
               
The Abit of Monkes nor theyre ceremonyes
can not helpe theim when their hert
is not good / likewise as the seculer abit cā
not hurte the seculer man when the herte
is spirituall. For the perfection of Christē
               dome
lyeth not in mete or drinke or in other
outward workes / as is fasting / praing
with the mouth / watching / reding / synging / 
making obeysaunce with the hede / 
kneling or in eny other outward thing semblable.
As testifieth saint Paule vnto the
Romains / saying: The kingdome of god
is nother mete nor drinke / but it is rightuousnesse / 
peace / and ioy in the holy goost.
If thy hart and entent seche none other
thing but the honour and will of God / if
thou reioyse that thou maist do and suffer
all thing for the love of god then art thou
sure that thou lovest God and that he loveth
the.
            This let every religious k
                  •
               owe that
he may not thinke that he shalbe iustified
by his outward workes / or that he is eny
thing better then the seculer man: As at
this day (god amend it) we se that many
religious esteme theym silves so holye / as
though they alone were christen. And herof

many tymes the seculers are cause whiche
playne theyre life when they behold
the life of the religious. They prayse the
state of religion bicause they regard onely
the outward workes and pleyne that god
hath not called theym to suche a life. whē
the religious here this they glorifie heryn
trust in theyre workes and thinke that it
is even so and that they be more holy thē
the other.
            This is the most daungerous temptacyon
that a religious may haue for by
this temptacyon they beginne many tymes
to trust and abyde vppō theyre good
workes notwithstonding that they be often
done ageynst theyre will whiche can
never be good. As at this day we se howe
many monkes and nonnes lyve in theyre
cloysters ageynst their will: And all that
they do procedeth from an hart constreyned
and not voluntary. And out dare th
               
                  •
               y
not go for shame bicause they haue otherw
                  •
               se
promysed. And they curse oftymes
all evill to theym that haue counceyled
theym and brought theym into that religyon / 
aud wolde fayne that theyre cloyster
were bu
                  •
               ned. And so be they never

content in theyre hart nether can finde eny
rest of conscience and be then moche ferther
from god then they were whē they were
seculers. Suche people oftymes do many
evelles toward theym silves by impacience
and rebellion ageinst god. They do nothing
by. love that they haue to god or bycause
that they beleve theym silves to be
the childrē of god but onely by constreynt
and ageynst theyre will. And when they
must dye they trust and stikke vppon suche
workes by theim done ageynst theyre
hartes and by constraynt of theyre ordre
and thinke even thus.
            Behold dere lord: my life hath byn to
me hard and bitter: I haue oftymes had
evill will: I haue alweyes abiden in my
Cloyster / I haue kept myn ordre / I haue
valiantly fought vnto the ende / gyve me
nowe the crowne of glorye / and the everlasting
lyfe. In all the worlde ys
there not a more daungerous synne then
this perversyte and ypochrisye.
            It were better for suche people to voyde
from theyre cloyster: For synners
knowyng theyre synnes and requyryng
pardone and grace be receyved

vnto grace where as suche ypochrites are
reproved of god: As we may sein the gospell
where god received vnto grace Marye
Magdaleine / saint Mathew / the good
theef and meny other open sinnars: But
he hath lest the scribes and phariseys in theyre
blyndnesse whiche trusted on theyre
workes.
            Ye fathers and mothers behold well
whate ye do when ye put your children in
to religion: For ye are causes of all theyre
sinnes. And it suffiseth theim not to lyve
alone in suche abusion b
                  •
               t they teache it
theim silves vnto other / whome they write
in theire confraynes and make thē participant
of theire good workes which procede
often from an evill willed sprite whiche
can never be good bifore god for God
will no constreined service. Nether is there
any worke agreable vnto god but suche
as procede from faith / charite and out
of a willing hart. And if God wold haue
suche a constreyned service he wold constreyne
the devels to pray moche to syng / 
moche to watche moche and to do suche other
thinges.
            But god will none of oure workes / 

when he hath not oure hertes. And all the
workes that we do daily be agreabill vnto
god if with all oure hartes we love hī / 
beleve and trust in him. And all the workes
done without suche faith and loue be
sinne and dampnabill bifore god / ād if we

open sinnar and to knowlege thy misdoing
bifore god as did the publican then so
for to trust vnto thy workes as though
god for theim did owe vnto the the kingdome
of heven.

to hold a promyse whiche is contrarie
vnto his helth: as did Iepte and Herode
whiche had byn better to breke theyre
othes then to holde theire promyses. For
none may promise nor holde a thing that
is cōtrary vnto hys helth. S. Fraunceis
and saint Dominike had lever that thou
were saved in keping the gospel then dāpned
trusting vppon thy workes. And it is
better to be shamed here bifore the worlde
then bifore god.
            
               
But whate is it that thou hast promysed
when thou madest thy profession? hast
thou promised that thou wilt not live after
the promise that thou hast made at thy
baptesme? Tho
                  •
                saiest nay / But therfore
saiest thou I am entred into religion for

then from whens thou camest thou
maist alweyes sey I am come hyther to
amend my lyfe. And I finde that I waxe
daily worse: therfore I will goo there I
may amend my life and serve God with
more grete rest of conscience. Therfore I
tell the that it is better to live well in the
world then yll in the monasterie & to trust
vppon thy good workes.
            But thou must thinke not to leve

the cloister to haue libertie and carnall pleasure
but onely to serve God more frely
as saieth Saint Paule. Give not youre
libertie an occasion vnto the flesshe. And
none can give the better knowlege herofGa. 5.
then thine ownr conscience when thou axest
it counceil for it deceyveth none but saith
alwey manifestly the trouth.
            The world hath likewise his daungiers
and his perilles and it is impossible
to live in the world without sinne.
Therfore when the religious seith that
he may be saved in his cloister /

without synne / and lyve according

entred into the cloister they here of none other

outward workes / as reding singing / watching
fasting and other like ceremonies.
Thei know none other thing but that the
summe of all perfection and helth resteth

haue the principall part of all perfection &
that they are sure to be saved when with
grete vnlust and tediousnesse they haue accomplisshed
and observed these outward
thinges And bicause they thinke thus thei

of helth then they were at theyre entre.
For they haue nought gotten there
but a good estimacyon of theym silf of theyr
good workes supersticion and ypochrisye.
            They haue not yet ones tasted the sobriete
and lytell estymacyon that the spirituall
parson bereth in his hert of him silf.
for they abide alweys in the flesshe and
in the lettre of theyre rule and of the commaundementes.
And they do nought by
love nor with good hert. And as long

as they kepe thus theyre ordre they are
reproved of God with the Pharesey yn
the .xviij. Chaptre of Saint Luke.Lu. 18
            
            For if the lawe of Moyses and the Ceremonyes
whiche God him silfe did ordeyne
might iustifie nor save none (as
wryteth Saint Paule the Apostle yn all
his epistles) howe moche lesse may a monke
be iustified by his rule and ceremonyes
whiche be institute by men. wherfore
we must serche all in the hert and in the
sprite wherby we may be iustified.
            For the outward workes whiche we do
without the sprite be sumtyme called
flesshe by Christ in the Gospell.Iohn. 
                     •
                  .
            
            Suche flesshe proufiteth nothing: it is the
sprite that quykeneth as Christ saieth.
            That is to sey: All outward and forayne
thinges seme they never so holy yf yt
procede not from the sprite fulfylled with
fayth and love. That is to sey: if it be not
done by Charyte and love ioyfully by
the mocyon of fayth and trust that we
have to God. All suche thing seme it never
so holy or haue it never so goodly apparaunce
proufyteth nothing but rather
hurteth and maketh an ypochryte. For

seing that god is a sprite he lovith nothing
but that whiche procedeth from the sprite
as he him silf saieth in the gospell.
            Saint Paule ostymes calleth suche
outward workes elementes that is to seyGa. 4
Commencementes and entrees into christendome:
as though he wold sey that suche
thinges are ordined and institute for

christianite: As the children of the scole lerne
first theyre.Col. 2 A. B. C. He warneth vs
also that we suffer not oure silves to be deceyved
& that we serve not nor abide subiectes
to suche elementes / but willeth that
we shuld procede vnto the sprite. For whate
proufit shuld a scoler hane to abide all
his life in his. A. B. C. & lerne. no ferther?
No more proufit bring the workes without
the sprite and feith. Moreover oure
saviour Christ calleth theym mannes constitucions
saying.Mat. 15 They honour me in vayne
teching doctrines and commaundementes
of men.1. Tim. 4 Saint Paule also calleth them
bodily exercitacion / that is to sey thinges
wherby oure body is onely exercised / busyed
and letted to do worse. They of thē
silves proufit nothing vnto oure soules:

For he saieth / exercitaciō or bodily labour
is litell thing proufitable / but mekenesse
proufiteth to all th
                  •
               nges. And this is bicause
that we do it with the body onely &
that therby oure hert and sprite is not tourned
to god. Suche outward workes are
moche mocked of the prophete Esaye / 
where he speketh in the parsone of god in
this maner:Esa. 
                     •
                  
                Offre me no more sacrifice:
Sence to me is abhominacion: I will no
more suffre the festes of the newe mone / 
nor of the sabbat / nor other festes: My soule
hath hated youre calendes and solempnitees.
And ageyn: Heven is my seate / the
erthe is the fotestole of my fete:Esa. 66 whate is
the house that thou cāst bild to me? And
whiche is the place of my rest? My hond
hath made all these thinges saieth the lord
God.
            But wherunto shall I take regarde
but vnto the pore and contrite sprite and
vnto the fearer of my wordes. He that maketh
sacrifice of an oxe as he that slewe a
man. He that killeth a shepe as he that brayned
a dogge he that offreth oblacion as
he that offered the bloude of a hogge. He
that remembreth the eusence as he that

blissed an ydoll. They haue chosen all these

                  •
               ere paciently and with a ioyfull hart all
that god sendeth: these thinges can none
do but he that is all holly given vnto god
They that be suche be onely verey religious
byfore god. For onely suche do fulfill
there rule. For they do observe it and kepe
it ioyfully / and with a will fre & good.
But otherwyse when one doth all by constreynt
and tediousnesse it is but a small
comfort.
            But that there be nowe so fewe religious
having the verey feling of the sprite / 
this is for none other cause but (as I haue
seid bifore) forbicause that they ētre not
with suche a courage & entent as they shuld
do and that they be not enstructed as it
aperteyneth.
            Therfore whosoever will entre ynt
                  •
               
religion let him be ware aboue all thinges
that he entre not vppon thintencion to deserve
the kingdome of heven by his watchinges / 
fastinges / abstinences / prayers / 
singinges / redinges / and other thinges lyke.
For if thintent be suche / he trusteth
yn hys workes / and becometh an ypochrite.

And the more he doth of suche workes
the more great ypochriste he becomyth
And so abideth he alweyes a merchaunte
with god for he serveth for wages. But
if thou wilt entre into religion thou must
do it for the love of God bicause god hath
made vs his children for to thanke him ageyn
and to fle the synne whiche reyneth
emong the worldly. For he that doeth thus
he thinketh that he can never do service
ynough vnto god for that he hath receyved
alredy: for loue knoweth no measure.
He laboureth not for to get the eternall lyfe
as the merchaunt for his wages / but onely
to give thankes of the goodnesse that
god hath done vnto him alredy bycause
that he beleveth and knoweth of trouth
that he is the childe of God and his heyre.
            And therfore when eny hath the feith
wherof we haue bifore spoken he is to be
praysed that by thankfulnesse doth separate
him silf from the worlde for to fle the daungyers
therof. For the worlde hath a thousand
occasyons to synne / principally for
yong people. Wherfore this is not a thing
to be dispraysed that a parson yelde him in
a good religion to amend his lyfe. But if

one fynde nowe in the Monasteryes more
debates / drinkinges / banquettes / pompes / 
hatred / envye and ypochrysye then in
the worlde it were moche better to abyde
out / ye or if one be entred to voyde out rather
then to lerne there to haunt suche life.
For one must go thider to amend his life / 
not to waxe worse.
            But thou mayst saye: I haue made
profession and promesse: I must abide. I
haue seid bifore that none is bounde to holde / 
ye that none ought to hold eny promyse
that is contrary vnto his helth. Herken
to this that saint Paule sayeth:2. Tessa. 3 We commaunde
you bretheren by the name of Iesu
Christ that ye withdrawe your silves
from every brother that walketh inordinatly
and not after the institucion whiche
ye receyved of vs. And ageyn: If he that
is called a brother emong you be a fornicatour
or covitous or a worshippper of images1. Cor. 5
or a rayler or a dronkard or an extorcyonar / 
wyth hym that ys suche see that
ye eate not. And in an other place: God
hath not called vs to lyve in strife and discencion
but in peace and love.
         
         
            
            ¶Osparentes that will put theyre
children into religion.
Chaptre
.xix.
            
               HEre must we warne the parentes
that they be ware to put theire
children into religion without
advice whiche they do often bicause
they seche more theyre owne proufit
then the helth of theyre children. For some
do it bicause they haue many children / 
and to thintent that they may mary the other
the more richely they put one or .ij. hauing
some bodily imperfection into religiō
Some also do it to haue honour by theyre
children bicause they be made monkes prestes
or prelates. Other do it by hope to be
holpe and socoured of theyre children.
            Behold howe that by suche meanes
there be so fewe that entre into relygyon
with suche int
                  •
               ncion as I haue seid aboue.
Hit is not to be preysed but gretely to
be dispreysed when by suche occasion eny
entreth into religion. Therfore shulde the
parentes se first whether theyre children
were enclyned therunto or not / and whether
they dyd desire it or not
                  •
                and for whate

cause they desired it. for if they be not
enclined therunto whye wilt thou lese thē
as though none mought be saved yn the
worlde?
            Howe dyd men bifore that monkes
came into the world? And why were not
thappostles mōkes? Ye why were ye not
monkes your silves that wolde so haue
your children? God (as sayeth Saint
Paule the apostle) loketh on no mannes
parson whether he be monke or seculer
man or woman / nobill or ignobill / But he
onely is agreabill vnto God that loveth
him with all his hert be he housholder
or preste / religious or lay yt ys all one to
him. And as Saynt Peter saieth in thactes
of thappostles.Acto. 10 There is no respect
of parsones bifore God.
            And in these thinges are manye tymes
moche giltye the religious that with
fayre wordes drawe yought vnto theyre
cloysters.
            Some tymes the children theym silves
because when they se the religyous syng / 
rede / pray / watche / knele / avale theyre
hedes and do suche lyke thynges they
esteme that to do suche thinges ys an

holy life. And get a will to do likewise.
            And when they haue byn there a yere they
repent that ever they there entred: for
they haue not the sprite that may comfort
theym / and to avoyde they are asshamed / 
and so make theyre profession ageynst theire
will. And even as they began with a
cold courage / so abode they comunely cold
and chaunged f
                  •
               om god. Wherfore it were
well done to absteyne him silfe from making
of suche profession vnto thage of .xxx
yeres / as biforetyme none was sacred a
prest bifore thage of .xxx. yeres in whiche
tyme one might prove him silf whether he
might kepe his rule or not. for we see many
yong people promesse chastite but few
can kepe it.
         
         
            ¶Of the life of Nonnes and
Chanonesses. Chaptre
.xx.
            
               ONe may se nowe a dayes many
monasteryes of Nonnes in the
whiche they syng and rede moche.
And this I merveyle at
from whence comith theyre synging. For
seing they vnderstond not whate they syng
I can not tell whate proufit it comith

to.1. Cor. 14 For saint Paule defendeth to syng yn
the churche (that is to sey ī thassēble of the
christen) but in a tongue that all may vnderstond.
Then the synging of Nonnes / 
can not be agreabill vnto God seing that
they do not vnderstōd it. No maner spirituall
ioy can they take therby nor none amendement
but do all by constreynt of theyre
rule and ageynst theyre hert many tymes
seching nothing els but vayne glorye
Moche better were it for theym to rede theyre
houres in a langage that they vnderstode.
for when the sprite is not adressed
vnto god the synging or reding proufiteth
nothing. for if synging without vnderstō
               ding
plesed God the birdes / lutes / herpes
and other instrumentes shuld moche please
god. Then when eny singeth without
vnderstonding it proufyteth him litell and
therfore it were moche better that the Nō
               nes
and other religious did reade and sing
theyre houres and theyre psaulter in their
comune langage. Paula and Eustochium
and also other ladyes of whome writeth
saint Hierom did reade in theyre tyme theire
service in the latyn tōgue but that was
bicause they did well vnderstond it. And

here
                  •
               y is it nowe come to passe that oure
Nonnes singe and reade in latyn and most
for vaine glory bicause they vnderstond it
not. They thinke that the latyn tongue soundeth
more plesauntly bifore the world.
Nowe is there a thing in the life of the nō
               nes
moche to be dispreysed and that whiche
is contrary to the Gospell / hit is that
they are so sumptuously clothed and appareyld.
It was the custume of old tyme
(whiche I do not approve) that suche
religious wymen went bareheded and bare
nekked and so came to churche. This
maner hath the bisshoppes wisely reproved
and chaunged / and haue ordeyned that
they shuld come to churche theyre hedes
covered like other wymen. Thus
when eny yong woman promysed chastite
the bisshoppe covered her hede and her
nekke to thintent that they shuld not be
seen and that none shuld couvite her. And
bicause there were then no monasteries suche
virgins kept theym silves in the houses
of theyre parentes and went not out
but with theyre parentes and that onely
for to goo to masse or to the sermon / or to
visit the martyres in pryson.
            
               
One might lightly knowe them by the clothe
that they bare about theyre hedes and
nekkes.
            After this Marcella and Paula did enterpryse
to bilde a monastery at Rome for
that suche virgyns did not lyve without
daunger in the houses of theyre parentes.
Thus hath the cloisters of Nonnes takē
theyre beginning whiche were wo
                  •
               t to
get theyre expences by the laboure of theyre
hondes. They sang not as do Nonnes
nowe a dayes but red psalmes working.
Thus served they God in all obedience / 
chastite / laboure simplicite / and mekenesse / 
Theyre rayment was simple to dispyse
the world. Theyre hedes were covered
to thintent that they might see noman and
noman theym. But nowe (God amend
it) all is tourned to pryde in suche maner
of blasing facyon and costly yn all theyre
appareill and lyving whiche was gyven
theym in token of sobriete / chastite / and
mekenesse so that I can not see whate holynesse
there is in the Nonnes lyving as
it is nowe vsed in the worlde.
            It is more agreabill vnto the worlde then
vnto god. For simplicite contemptibilyte / 

po
                  •
               ertie and humilite whiche god requireth
is nowe bannisshed and reproved.
All is tourned into pryde excesse and costly
apparell as though in these thinnges
lay parpayt spiritualtye and holynesse of
religyon.

and of theyre lyfe. Chaptre
.xxi.
            
               There be also divers cloisters
of Sisters whole life semeth
to be more according to
the gospell / For to labour
with theyre hondes and to
helpe one an other by love
is a christen life. And saint Paule bosteth
him silf in his epistles that he hath gotten
his expences in the laboure of his hondes
exorting vs strongly to do likewise. As
vnto the Tessalonians / we haue not (saieth
he) eaten oure brede for nought and
without getting of it. And heryn is better
the life of sisters then of the nonnes for they
are alweyes diligent in theyre labour
as in spynning / knetting / wesshing / and other
like occupacyons. So shuld all parsones
do. for to be ydell and to be, worthe

moche is impossible. And (as said saint Ierome)
there is nothing worse in a good
purpose then idelnesse. And therfore they
of Egipt wold receive none to be a monke
if he were not redy to gayne his expences
in labouring. Saint Austyne holdeth thē
for heretikes that sey that religious shuld
not laboure.
            But whie are all the religious at this

they are become so riche that they will no

to ete and drinke dilicatly / to haue all maner
of case and yet to abide in goodnesse / 
is a thing impossible. wherfore when the
monasteryes shalbe empouerisshed ageyn
the monkes will beginne to laboure with
theyre hondes / and then will the religious
waxe better. For bodely laboure is commaunded
to all parsones by the comma

that he that laboureth not shulde not

                     •
                  ssa. Hereby may ye se wherby it cometh
that the religious and prestes be so corrupted.
This is by none other cause but

that they be ydell and haue to moche
good wherby all humylite and simplesse / 
that was yn Iesus Christ and his appostles
yn theym ys holly perysshed and quē
               ched.
But yet is there an unperfection emong
these Sisters moche to be dispreysed / 
it is that they laboure to make to sumptuous
and pompous edyfices / monasteryes
and chapelles / wilbe easyly lodged / 
and are to supersticyous yn garnysshing
with grete cost there chapelles and aulters
makīg sumptuous aulter tables aulter
clothes courteyns and other thinges
lyke whiche is all nothing but pryde pompe
and concupiscēce of the yien. As sayth
saint Iohan.Iohn. 2. And albeyt that some do it / 
of a good entent thinking by suche thinges
to do grete service vnto god / yet is it
all nought els but abomynacyon byfore
hym / he setteth not by suche thinges. As
witnessith the prophete Esaie.Esa.

And this knowe ye my dere sisters ād

lak of chastite vayne and ydell woordes / 
gloutony dishoneste sloughtfulnesse

shall the woman love or hate that that
is yn the man. The man shall reprove
his wise by good maner when she shall
make eny faute without hating of her having
alweis pacyence with her as with a
frayle vessell / as teacheth saint Petre. When
suche a good and holye love is bytwene

the hede and the woman the lesse. The wife
shall willingly serve her husbond as
her lorde.Ephe. 5. The man shal love hys wife
and honour her as his owne body. For
although the man be the hede he may not
therfore suppresse and dispise his wife but
he must dyligently defend her and kept

her from ewill as his owne body / he shall
more enforce hym silf / that his wife love
hym / thē that she feare hym. He must love
her as god hath loved vs while we were
yet hys enemyes and yet enfect with oure
synnes. So shal the husbond love his wife / 
albeit that she be foule or difforme / he
shal not be hard or cruel vnto her but shal
support her pacyentli and shall warne her
swetely. For if thou be hede whye wilt
thou hurt or dispise thy body / that is to
sey thy wife.
            The man shall defende warne teache and
conduyte his wife / taking hede that she
clothe not her silf to sumptuously and pō
               pousely
and that she were no Ievelles / 
for veyne glory. For wymen be naturally
gyven vnto suche folyes vnto braguery
and pryde. It is not expedient that a
christen woman shuld appareill her outwardly
as do the paymems for scarcely
is she the wife of one man alone that
so costly doth appareil her silf outwardly
aboue her astate. Also they that do
so gyve vnto many occasion of evill desires.
And seing thou hast a husbond
whye wilt thou go so to please other.

Herin shall the man be the hede and lorde
over the woman and shall defende suche
superfluite and vaine glory in his wife.
He shall teche her and exhort her that she
do her diligence to please by vertue and holy
conversacion and not by Iewelles and
costly appareil. For with suche thinges
do the most folisshe wymē of all garnisshe
theym silves.
            Therfore shall the husbond take hede
that the wife kepe measure herm. Then
shall the wife obey vnto her husbond as
vnto her so vereygne / and shall love hym
as her owne body shall honour and feare
him as her lord. For so was Sara subiect
vnto her husbond Abraham and she called
him her lord
                  •
               
               1. Pe. 3. as writeth saint Petre.
So did Monyca the mother of saint Austyn
honour her husbond. And when he
was wrothe or dronken she tempted him
not / but after that it was passed she warned
hym of yt by swete wordes. So
shuld all good wymen do vnto theyre husbondes.
            Thus shall there be no sensuall or carnall
love in the state of mariage but a godly
and a spirituall. Then shall both man &

wife helpe the one other for to get theire
expences. The woman shall take care
for that that must be done within the house
and the man without. For suche a life
is moche plesaunt vnto god / as it is wryten
in Eccles
                  •
               astes in this maner. In thre

                  5 The concord
of bretheren / the love of thy neyghboure / 
and the man and wife well agreing togither
emong theym silves. Suche a life in
mariage is pleasaunt vnto god for he hym
silf did institute mariage in paradise.
            The man shall alweyes attribute somewhate
vnto the woman for she is a frayle
vessell. They shall live sumtyme also
in chastite with one purpose and accord to
thintent they may fast and pray.
            It is also alweyes best that in mariage
the like take the like. For if a poore mā
take a riche or nobill woman / she wold be
the hede / and that is ageynst the teaching
of saint Paule. And if the poore maydon
take a riche and nobill husbond she is not
felowe to h
                  •
               m norlsady of the house / but a
servaunt for he knowelegith her not for
his wife / but holdeth her as his servaunt

and drugge: And this is like wise ageynst
the theching of saint Paule. For by suche
meane the woman hath not gotten an husbond
but a tyraunt and a violent lord. Nether
was Eve made of the fete of Adam / 
but of his syde. Neverthelesse when the riche
is ioyned in maryage with the poore / 
and love well the one the other after such
maner as I have seyd so that the man be
alweyes the hede and that he dispyse not
his wife it is a christen life be they riche or
poore / nobill or vnnoble. For in this mater
the will of god is more to be considered
then povertye or richesse.

            Thou must take hede to whate vices

So behoveth it that a good father / 
and mother consyder dilygently to whate

thing theyre children are most enclyned &
to conduyte and warne theym theryn.
The parentes ought also to be ware that
they be not to hard and rigorous vnto
theyre children to thintent they make thē
not rebelles disobedient and fugityues ād
then rynne they awey vacabundes by the
cuntrey as many do. They shulde cause
theym to lerne an occupacion wherunto
they shuld haue most courage and apte intent
whiche shuld be laufull without fraude
and wherby they might honestly get
theyre expences in tyme coming. This shulde
be done in tyme bifore they be gyven
to the scoles for we se comonly that clerkes
will put theym silves to no craft but
become men of warre. And although that
thou be riche thou shalt alweyes make thi

            And if by ony chaunce they come to povertye

if it happon not vnto theym yet shall they

alweyes do sum whate that they thereby
may the better helpe the pore for after the
scripture none may be ydell. For laboure
is a penaunce enioyned vnto all the worlde / 
not of man but of god / after that Abā
had sinned. And he that laboureth not shuld
not eate after the scripture. Moreover
at the festfull dayes thou shalt bring the
children to the churche to here the sermonGene. 3 2. Tessa. 3
And when they shalbe comen home thou
shalt are theym whate they haue kept yn
memory of the sermon. Then shalt thou
admonest theym to lyve well and to put
all theyre hope and trust in God rather to
die then to do eny thing that is ageinst the
will of god.
            Thou shalt also teche theym the christen
faith after the naner aboue declared / 
exhorting theim to pacience / charite and hope
in god. And principally thou shalt lerne
theym the contentes of the prayer of oure
saviour Christ called▪ the Pater noster / 
and that in theyre moder tongue / that ys
to sey / howe they haue an other father in
heven of whome they must loke for all goodnesse
and without whome one can haue
no goodnesse. And howe that we may

seke nothing in al this life / in all oure workes
and in all oure ententes but the honour
of this hevenly father. And howe they
must desire that this father wolde governe
all that we do or desire. And howe that
we must submyt all to his holy will.
            And howe that his will can be but good /

not God yn thy hert thou shalt fynd him
no where. The parentes can do not
gretter service to God / then to teache and
lerne well theyre children.
            
               For herin lyeth grete vertue. Hereby may
one please god singulerly. Ye parentes also
be ware that ye give not to moche money
to your children. And that that ye give
theym take hede howe they spende it
and wheruppon. And when they bringe
eny thing home that is not yours / or yf
that they report any newes of detraction / 
ye must sharply reprove theim. And whē
thou wilt do any almesse bifore thy house
thou shalt do it by thy childrē to thintēt
that they may lerne to serve the poore.
            And when they have strived the one ageinst
the other thou shalt cause theym to come
forth in the evening to axe the one the
other mercy and forgivenesse. And likewise
shall they do whē they haue offended or
angred theyre parentes. Thou-must be
well ware that thy childe growe not vp
into partinacite / rebellion / or incredulyte:
And that he be no fighter nor striver. and
when thou herest thy child swere / curse / 
strive / fight / lye or speke eny foule wordes
or sing eny rybaud songes thou shalt reprove
him sharply. The parentes shall alweyes
laboure that theyre children shall
rather feare theym for love and reverence

then for pnisshement and feare. For children
that obey vnto theyre parentes for feare
of beting they feare theym no lenger thē
the stripes and beting endureth. As all they
that serve god for feare of peynes they
serve him no longer then the peynes or tribulacion
endureth. And after that they be
delivered they retourne ageyn to their old
sinnes. But the children that feare theyre
parentes by dilection abide alweyes obedient
by that same dilection. The parentes
must be well ware that they strive
not the one ageinst the other / that they
swere not and that they speke none inordinate
or dishonest wordes / principally bifore
theyre children / for when they lerne eny
vnhappinesse in youthe they shall with
grete difficultie leve it in theire age.
            Ye may never shewe your silf sorowfull / 
waile nor make compleynt bifore your
children for losse of erthly goodes or bicause
ye haue not good gaines. For when
they here you plaine for suche thinges thei
get a desire and a love of temporall thinges
so that they take pleasure in nothing
els but in temporall richesse / and have sorowe
of nothing but for the losse of suche

thinges for they lerne it of theyre parētes
The childe foloweth nothing so moche as
that whiche he seeth his father mother ād
other frendes do.
            Finally thou must marke verey diligently
whether they haue desire or will
to be maryed at the state of mariage or not
And as ye perceive it so must you incontynent
helpe theym and care for theym that
they may make a good manage. As
Abrahā was carefull for his sonne Isaac
And forbicause that the parentes be many
tymes not carefull in suche case it comyth
to passe that so fewe come chast to the state
of maryage / that theyre children be often
deceyved and that they haue shame dishonour
and sorowe of theyre children. And
this is most the faute of the parentes whiche
be more carefull for the bodyes of theire
children then for theyre soules. And
therfore they will in no wise that theyre
children be poore but seke rather to mary
theym richely then helthfully / ād axe more
for temporall goodes then after vertue
good maners and goodes spirituall. And
for to make theym haue good tymes they
make theym many tymes prestes or relygious.

And so for to provide theym of the
case of theyre bodyes they are oftymes cause
of the everlasting payne of theyre soules.
For none ought to be brought in vnto
the state of prysthod / except he be first
chosen to some office in the congregacyon
and that bycause that we mought se whate
lyfe that he ledith. This thyng compleyneth

parentes were not carefull for him in this
mater.

highe riche or noble linage: but also bicause
that he hath made him to be borne in suche
astate that he is fayne to get his brede

with his laboure. For that is the life of a
verey christen. But he shall not put hys
trust therin at tall as though he were therfore
better then an other. for albeit that yn
this mater he kepe the commaundement of
God: It ys possyble that he kepyth yt
not yn other thynges / wherfore we must
alweyes be verey studyous to abide in humylite.
            God myght nourisshe vs without oure
laboure as he nourisshed the .v. thousand
persones in the wildernesse and might kepe
vs well without having so many occupaciōs
in the world. But he hath so ordeyned
it for to entreteyne & to move charyte
emong the christen / bicause that the one hath
nede of the socoure of the other / as the
baker of the brewer and likewise the brewer
of the baker and so of other occupacions / 
to thintent that we shulde so serve &
ayde the one the other by love / ād that we
shulde not be idell. And therfore shall
the housholder and every craftes man do
hys laboure diligently and ioyfully yn tourning
all his laboure to the honoure of
God / beleving that in doing his businesse
by suche a good intencion he serveth god &

that his laboure pleaseth god and that by
Iesus Christ in whome he beleveth and
trusteth. All were it so that ye knowe that
ye shulde dye that day ye shall abide at
your laboure surely beleving that your laboure
is plesaunt vnto god. Thou shalt
thinke that thou maist not do thy laboure
for covense / for to waxe riche / for to eate &
drinke delicatly or for to haue good tymes
For when thou labourest with suche an
intent thy labour is not acceptable to god / 
but is grete offence. And if percase thou
waxe riche without care therfore thou shalt
thanke god / and vse it to his honoure
but thou shalt not laboure principally to
be ryche. Nether shalt thou reioyse of thy
richesse. Nether if thou be pore thou shalt
not therfore be sory / but shalt do thy laboure
truely recommending all to the will of
god that he make the poore or ryche after
that he knoweth to be helthfull vnto the.
Thou shalt not be a bringer vp of newe
facyoned garnementes for hereby is the
people many tymes enduced vnto sinne &
vnto the losing of grete expences lost yn
waste. But thou maist say: If I will haue
it / an other shall make it: and then am I

not fynder of the newe facyon. I tell th
                  •
               
ageyn that none shall make it / for if thou
woldest not make it nor none other / it wolde
abide vnmade well ynough. For thys
is not taught for one or .ij. but for all the
worlde.
            Thou shalt not d
                  •
               spende thy goodes
vnproufitably in making sumptuous buildinges
or bying of costly housholde for
vaine glory or in making to precyous clothes / 
or in delicate metes or drinkes. For
all that thou doest thus spende outragiously / 
thou robbest it from god and frō the
poore. Thou maist not abuse thy goodes
as thou wilt: for god hath lent theym vnto
the for to vse theym in all reason / & for
to socoure the poore with theym: As teacheth
saint Paule. Thou shalt clothe the
eate and drinke after the most resonabill custume
of the cuntrey where thou dwellest
and after the maner of thinhabitaūtes the
it. For this mayst thou do after the Gospell.
Thou maist never lye / swere / nor do
nothing that god hath defended for to get
temporall goodes. Thou shalt not count
at evenyng howe moche money thou hast
gained / but howe moche thou hast prou
                  •
               ised

in goodnesse and vertue / and howe moche
goodnesse thou hast lost in that dayes
iourney.
            Thou shalt not vexe or greve by iustice
or otherwise the pore that owe vnto the
for thou maist not do it without sinne.
            As Christ saieth in the gospell.Mat. 5 Resist not
(saieth he) vnto the evill. But whosoever
streke the on the right cheke tourne to
him the other. And he that will drawe the
parforce into right and take awey from
the thy cote give hīthy gowne also. And
he that constreyneth the to go a myle with
him / go with him twayne. Give to hym
that axeth the. And f
                  •
               e not from hī that desireth
to borowe of the. Also it is sayde
more in the same chapter: Love your enemyes
do good to theym that hate you. for
if ye love thē (saieth he) that loue you whate
grete thinge do you: do not the nethen
even the same. Moreover Saint Paule
vnto the Romayns.Ro. 12 Blisse theym that
persecute you / Blisse theym / but curse
theym not. And ageyn: Yeld not evill for
evil circumspectly brynging forth that ys
honest in the sight of all men / And if it be
possible as moche as is in you to lyve yn

peace with all men not revenging youre
silf my welbeloved / but give place vnto
wrath.Hebre. 10 For it is writen: To me be the
vengeaunce / and I will rendre it sayeth
the lord God. And if thyne enemye be
hongry gyve him to eate. And if he be thursty
gyve him drinke. Be not overcome
with evill / but overcome the evill wyth
good.1. Pe. Saint Petre saieth also. None shall
yelde evill for evill nor curse for curse.
            These wordes and other lyke seme to
meane (ye they will) that the good Christen
shall not defende theym silfe by iustice
in no maner for eny maner wrong that
they suffer of the evill but shuld recomend
all vnto the good will of God / whyche
shall defende theym and rule all thynges
for the best / and more holsomely and ryghtuously
then all the iudges of the worlde.
But of this mater will we speke
in the Chaptre of two maner governementes.
            Thou shalt oftymes lift vp thy harte
and thought to God as thou doest thy
laboure / and shalt sey to hym a short
prayer / doyng thy busynesse wyth a
good wyll / and wyth a ioyfull hart.
            
               
or god hath enioyned the that laboure yn
paradise in Abam for a penaunce.Gene. 3 Phi. 4 Be alweyes
ioyfull in the lord / and mery wyth
thy wife servauntes and manye. Herafter
wil we tell how the housholder shall live
with his servauntes / and how he shall be
obedient vnto hys prince in paying hys
taxes fystenes subsidies or suche other semblable
demaundes.

               HE that is riche and liveth of his
rentes ought first to knowe that
he may not vse nor spend his
goodes as he will: for he is but
a kepar and a dispensatour therof. For
god hath not given the that richesse for to
spende it ontragiously in mete and drinke
or in costly bildinges and pompous clothiges
for vaine glory or to hasard it at dyse / 
and at other gamyng. But thy goodes
belong as well vnto the poore as vnto the
For God hath sent the rychesse ynto the
worlde as well for the poore as for the reche.
For they must lyve all aswell the one

as the other.
            The riche be none other thing but dispensatours
and dystributers of the goodes
of God / as the lordes of this worlde
have theyre dispensatours. And therfore
when thou spendest thy goodes outragiously
in etyng and drynking and other excesse
thou shalt yelde accompt byfore god
at the day of iudgement. For the riche
man of whome speketh Christ in the gospell / 
was dampned for none other thyng
but bicause that he was not mercyfull ād
that he lyved evill of hys rychesse beyng
an yll dispensatour.Lu. 1
                     •
                  
                Wherfore it behoveth
that every body be circumspect howe he
spende. For all that folke spende so without
necessyte is robbed from the poore. for
saint Paule saieth: when we haue oure fode
and wherewith to cover vs let vs be
contented. Oure nature is content with
litell. And they that live so in pleasure taking
all theyre ease are not Christen. for
they devoure that which belongeth to the
pore whiche are theyre bretheren and mē
               bres
of one body. This let the paynyms
do that vse suche voluptuousnesse plesaunce
honoure and worldly vanite bicause

they haue no hope of a beter life. The
christen shall not love his temporall goodes
but shall vse theym to ministre vnto
his necessitees and vnto his neyghboures
ever giving thankes vnto God to whome
all belongeth. And the richer that thou
art the more care shalt thou take / for to
the is given more to kepe then vnto many
other. The richesses be not evill / for Abraham
Isaac Iacob Iob and David were
ryche but evill vsing of richesse is evill.
            Of suche riche speketh Saint Iames yn
this maner:I
                     •
                  . 5. Go to ye riche / wepe ye / wayling
vppon your miseryes / whiche shall come
vppon you. And Christ in the gospell:
wo be to you riche that haue here youre
consolacion.Lu. 6. And in another place: Truely
(saieth he) I tell you that the riche shal
with difficultye entre into the kingdome
of heven:Hat .19. And I tell you ageyn: It is more easy
for a camell to passe thorowe the yie
of a nedell then a ryche man into the kingdome
of heven.
            Therfore let the riche take hede theyr
richesse be not there everlasting life: & that
they haue not an other thīg after their deth
As had the riche of whome speaketh oure

riche & was cloted with purpure & silke &
did eate & drinke daily costly meates & drī
               kes:
ād there was a certeyn begger called
Lazarus lying at his gatefull of sores desiring
to be fedde with the cromes that fill
from the bourde of the ryche / but the dogges
came and likked his sores. It happened
that the begger dyed and was borne
with angels into the bosom of Abraham / 
the riche also dyed and was buryed in hell
And lyfting vp his yies when. he was in
his tormentes he sawe Abraham a ferre
of and Lazarus in his bosom / and he cryed
and sayed: Father Abraham haue mercy
on me 
                  •
               nd send Lazarus that he may
put the ende of his finger into the water to
cole my tongue / for I am tormēed in this
flamme. And Abraham said vnto him / Sō
               ne
remembre that thou hast receyved thy
goodes in thy life / and Lazarus evill therfore
he hath nowe consolacion ād thou art
tormented. Thus gyveth God many tymes
to theym that shall not be heyres of
the everlasting life the richesse and prosperite
of this worlde / and payeth theym ther
with.
            
               
Therfore shall not the riche be proude
of his richesse: but shal be alweyes in care
fearing lest god shuld paye him in this
worlde ād that he shall haue noue other
thyng.Tim.

Commaunde (saieth he) vnto the riche
of this worlde that they be not proude
mynded and that they trust not in vncerteyn
richesse but in the living god whiche
giveth vs all thinges abundauntly to

workes / to be made redy to distribute that
they may willingly haue feloweship in those
thinges bisding to theym silf a good foundaciō
in tyme couring that they may set
hond on the everlasting life. And a lytell
bifore: They (saieth he) that will be riche
fall of tymes in temptacion and in the snare
of the devell / and into many vnproufitable
and noyons desires the whiche tumble
a man into destruction and perdicyon:
for the rote of all evill is co vitize / the whiche

into many sorowes. And many other places
there are in the holy scripture the whiche

shulde strongly feare the riche and gyve
grete consolacion vnto the poore. for let
all the riche knowe that when they socoure
not the pore with theyr richesse they do
as grete sinne as though they robbed eny body.
            For god hath not given theym the richesse
for to bost & bragge therwith and to
make grete chere nether to make theym silves
lordes but to thintent that they shuld
be servauntes of all the worlde / & to helpe
all pore parsones / as are poore virgins / or
yong wymē at thestate of mariage to thintent
they come not to dishonour / & the pore
yong people to lerne an occupaciō: And
so to give lend and socoure one an other.

that the swerd of iustice shuld be for

            Then thirdly for to vnderstond thys
well we must fyrst knowe that there

are: 
                  •
               wo sortes of people in the worlde.
The first belong vnto the kingdome of
god. The other to the kingdome of the
worlde. They that belong vnto the kingdome
of God be all true faythfull people
in Iesus Christ and vnder him.
            For Christ is king and lord in the kingdome
of God / As techeth vs the secunde
Psalme / and also all the olde and newe testamēt.
He came also in to the worlde to begyn
and to lest vp the kingdome of god in
the worlde. Therfore saide he to Pylate:
My kingdome is not of this worlde.
            And whosoever is of the trouth hereth
my voice.Iohn. 18 And in saint Marke sayeth he
that the tyme is fulfilled and the kingdome
of God shall approche.Mar. 1. And in Saynt
Mathewe sayeth he.Mat. 16. Seche first the kingdome
of God. He calleth the Gospell a gospell
of the kingdome of god / bycause the
Gospell teacheth / governeth and kepeth / 
the same kingdome. Then they that are
stedfast in the faithe & in the love of god yf
they obey vnto his cōmaūdemētes have
nought to do with the swerd of iustice nor
of the seculer power to make theym rightuous.
And yf all the worlde

were true and verey Christen (that is to
sey) veri feithfull there nede no governoure
king lord sworde nor iustice. For wherto
shulde they sarve seyng that all true
christē shulde haue the holy goost whiche
governeth and teacheth theym to do no
wronge / to love all the world / to suffre / 
and endure the evell and iniurye of all the
worlde willingly and ioyfully / ye also the
deth. And where as all persones are content
willingly to suffre wrong and iniurye.
And where as there is none that doth
wronge nor iniurye / but where as all persones
do ryght / there is no dyscord hatred
envie nor other discencion. And there nedeth
no ryght nor punycyon.
            Wherfore it were īpossible that the swerd
of iustice shuld haue ought to do emong
the verey true christen / seyng they do moche
more of theym silves then eny man cā
               commaunde
theym or then eny lawe or
worldly doctrine can teche theym. As
sayth saīt Paule vnto Timoth. vnto the
ryghtuous there is no lawe sette / but vnto
the vnryghtuous.1. Tim. 
                     •
                  . And this is thus bicause
that the iugement and ryght of a verey
true christen fordereth and avaunceth

more then all other ryghtes ād lawes: for
it procedeth from the holy goost whiche
possesseth and inhabiteth the hart of a verey
christen. But the vnryghtuous do
ryght to no man / therfore they haue nede
of ryght and of lawes wherby they be taught
and constreyned to do well. A good
tree nedeth not that one teche hym to bryng
forth good frute for his nature gyveth
it without ony reching. Likewise are all
the verey true christen natured by the holy
goost and saith that they do all thinges
well and as it aperteyneth more then eny
man can commaunde theym by all the cō
               maundementes
in the worlde. And for
theym silves haue they no nede nether of
lawe nether of ryght.
            But some man myght axe whye then
hath god gyvē vnto men so many commaundementes / 
yn the olde and newe testament?
I answerethe. Saint Paule seith
as it is sayde byfore vnto the ryghtuous
there is set no lawe: but to the vnrightuous
that is to sey to theym that are not
yet true christē. And forbicause that none
is true and verey christē or good of nature / 
but be all synnars and evill: As witnesseth

the prophete sayng: God hath loked
from heven vppon the children of mē
that he mought se if there be eny vnderstondingPsat. 
                     •
                  3. Rom. 3.
or seching god. All are fallen and
are become abhominable there is none that
doeth good no not one. Therfore god refreyneth
the malice of the people by the lawe
that they dare not accomplisshe hit outwardly
by worke and dede according to
theyre evill will.
            Mereover saint Paule gyveth vnto
the lawe an other office / that is that it letneth
vs to knowe oure synnes / by the
whiche knowelege a man is made meke / 
and yeldeth hym silf to the faith / and
vnto the mercy and grace of god as is bifore
seyde.
            Fourthly all they that be not yet christen
belong vnto the kingdome of the worlde
and be vnder the lawe. In this nombre
are all the evill christen whiche seke nought
elles but all worldly pleasure and are
called christen but they are not so.
            Seyng then that there be so fewe good
Christen and so many evill people god
hath gyven vnto the same evill out of the
Christen astate and out of his kingdome

an other regyment and governaunce / and
hath put theym vnder the swerde that is
to sey vnder the seculer power and cyvill
ryght to thintent that they may not accō
               plisshe
theyre malice when they wolde As
a myschevous wylde best is tyed with
chaynes and bondes that he may nether
bite nor stryke after his nature albeit that
he wolde saine accōplisshe hys evel nature
whiche is not nedefull vnto a gentill tame
best / for without the cheynes and without
bondes he doth noue evill to no man.
            If it were not thus (bicause that there be
many m
                  •
                evill persones yn the worlde thē
good / ād that the good do not resist evill)
the one wolde devoure and put the other
to destruction / yn suche facyon that none
shulde be abill to kepe nether wife nor children
nether yet be abill to maynteyn hym
silf. And by suche meane shulde the worlde
yn contynuaunce become wast ād with
out inhabitauntes. For this cause hath
god ordyned these .ij. governemētes. The
spirituall the whiche maketh christen and
good persones by the holy gost vnder the
king of that kingdome Iesus christ. And
the seculer gouernaunce the whiche 
                  ••
               ostreyneth

the evell parsones to kepe outward
peace and to be tame ageynst theyre
will.Rom. Thus teacheth vs saint Paule / to
vnderstond the swerd and seculer instice
saying the prynces / are not to be feared to
theym that be good but vnto theym that
be evill.
            Nowe if eny man wold governe the
world (that is to sey the evill) only after
the gospell and cause to cease all worldly
lawe and iustice saying that they are baptised
and christen to whome the swerde
of iustice nedeth not. Unto theym may be
answered. Hit is of a truth that the true
christen haue no nede of ryght nor of the
swerde for theyre iustifying. But do your
dyligence to fulfill the worlde with true
christen bifore that you governe theym
christenly ād after the gospell whiche shal
be verey hard for you to do. For the worlde
is all gyven to synne and starcely can
they abide good christen. They are not all
christen that are baptised and called christen.
Therfore it is not possible vnto the
worlde to observe and kepe a comon christen
governaunce / namely also yn the iuddes
of a grete comonte / for the evill are alweys

more yn nombre then the good feithfull.
For this cause to governe a cuntrey
after the gospell without the swerde of iustice
is as though a man wolde put togyther
yn a stable / heries wolves lyons shepe
and other lyke / and to suffre all these
bestes to be conversaunt togyther the one
with the other / howe long I pray you
shuld they haue peace to gyther the one
with the other? Ye howe long shuld the
poore shepe lyve / we therfore must nedes
haue here bothe these governementes.
            The spirituall or eva
                  •
               gelye all bicause
it iustifieth ād bryngeth helth. The other
bicause it entreteyneth and holdeth peace
The one is not sufficient in the worlde
without the other. For without the spirituall
governement of Iesus christ can none
be saved nor iustified bifore god by the
worldly regyment. So may ye perceyve
that the rule or governemēt of christ hath
not lordship over all persones. For the
true christē be alweys lesse yn nombre ād
be yn the middes among the not christen / 
as a rose emong the thornes. Then where
as the worldly governaunce reyneth every
where alone / there can be none other

thīg but ypocrysye. For without having
the holy goost yn the hert can none be made
ryghtuous nor saved. Lykewyse where
the spirituall governaunce reyneth every
where alone / there is perversite vnbrydeled
ād vnbound redy for to accōplisshe
all malice for the worlde cā not vnderstōd
the spirituall governaunce bicause that it
fyghteth onely by the swerde of the spryte / 
whiche is the worde of god. And vseth
none other swerde. Nowe seest thou well
whate the wordes of onre savioure christ
meane (whiche we haue recyted bifore) where
he sayeth that the christē shall drawe
nomā yn to iustice / and that they shall not
resist evill. He speketh that onely of hys
dere christē / the whiche alone take it ynto
theyre hartes ād also do it alone for so are
thy enolyned ād disposed by vertue of the
holy gost workīg yn theyre hartes that
they do harme to nomā but suffer willīglī
evell & wrong of every mā. Then if all
the worlde were suche christē all persones
wolde kepe egally this peassible cōma
                  •
               n
demētes / & all thing wold they do accordīg
therūto. But nowe because thy be not
christen the word of god entreth not ynto

theyre hertes / nor they do not according
ther vnto and therfore they apperteyne
vnto the other seculer governaunce wher
by the not christen be constreyned to kepe
peace outwardly / and to do none evill.
            For this cause hath not Iesus christ 
                  •
               orne
the swerde nor ordined it yn hys spirituall
kingdome / for he is king over all the
true christen / ad governeth without swerde
and without ony outward lawe onely
by the holy goost working inwardly yn
the hert of man. And albeit that god hath
orde

                belongeth not vnto hys kingdome / 
yn the whiche kingdome there are none
but suche as be good ād iust. And for this
cause mought not david bilde the tempel

vsed the swerde / not that he had done evill
or vnryghtuousnesse / but bicause he
myght not yn this thing be a figure ofEphe. 5.
Christ whiche shuld haue a kingdome peasible
and without swerde. But god commaunded
to solomon whiche had a peasible
kingdome to bilde the temple / for Salomon
is as moche to saye as peasible by

               tet that
he shulde not dispyse the puissaunce / and
that he wolde not gyve theym occasion to
be offended / but gave theym exēple of obedience.
As he hym silf teached yn .v. chapter
of saynt Mathewe.Math. 5. Where he seyeth
that the christen shall not resist evill nor
sue any man at the law
                  •
               . He forbiddeth
not to be subiect and to serve theym

               uissaunte.
But the lesse nede that thou hast vnto
it for thy silf the more shall thou conferme
thy silf therunto. Thou shalt serve theryn
theym whiche haue yet nede and are
not so stedfast yn theyre feith as thou art
ād that onely by charite supporting theym
yn theyre ynfirmyte as Christ hath supported
vs / and hath made hym silf conformable
vnto vs. For albeyt that by the
stedfastnesse of thy fayth and love that
thou hast vnto god thou hast no nede that
eny man shuld punysshe thyne enemye bicause
that thou wilt suffer wrong willingly
for the love of Christ. Thy neyboure
hath alweys nede bicause he is yet feble

and therfore thou shalt helpe hym / to him
tent that he may haue peace and that hys
enemye may be refrayned and let that he
hurt hym not: whiche can not be so done
if the temporall power be not had yn honour
and feare. Oure saviour Christ-sayeth
not thou shalt not serve or shalt not be
subiect vnto the temporall puissaunce / but
he sayeth. Thou shalt not resist evill. As
thought he wolde saye: Maynteyne thy
life so that thou be pacyent that thou haue
no nede of the lawe of ryght nor of the
temporall puissaunce for to revenge the.
But cōtrary wyse be profitable vnto the
weke / and feble multitude yn serving
theym and helping theym by obeying the
temporall puissaunce. I wold that thou
sholdest be so worthy and nobill to haue
no nede of the seculer ryght / but that that
ryght shulde haue nede of the to helpe to
maynteyn hyt.
            Thus to vse the seculer puissaunce shulde
be a grete worke of charite wherby a
parsone is gyven hoelly to the service of
hys neygbour / and seketh not to defende
hys owne life honour or goodes / but seketh
meanes onely to be proufitable vnto

hys neyghbour. As wryteth Saint Paule
vnto the Corinthiens saying. Charyte
seketh not that is hys owne / & this shalt

For faint Paule wryteth yu hys first epistle
vnto the Chrinthiens. Oure fathers
haue all eten one spirituall mete / and haue
all dronke one spirituall drynke:1. Cor. 01. They
drōke of the spirituall stone that folowed
theym / truely the stone was christe. That
is to sey they had the same spryte ād feith
yn christ that we haue for they beleved
then that christ was for to come to redeme
theyme / as we beleve nowe that he is come
and hath redemed vs. Aud so were
they christen as well as we. Wherfore
seyng that they thus vsed alweys the tē
               porall
swerde from the begynnyng of the
worlde vnto the comyng of christ for to
depresse the outwarde malice of thoffenders / 
likewise may also the christen do vnto
the ende of the worlde. For the tyme
and outward chaunge make no difference
emong the christen. The olde testament
is not so cessed that we nede yn no maner
wise to kepe it / or that he doth evill that
observeth every part therof. But it is so
ceased that yn some thinges and some tymes
it is indifferēt / and yn some thinges
and some tyme it is of necessite to do it or
to leve it.
            
               
Hit is not nowe nedefull to kepe it yn all
poyntes eny more vnder payne of dampnacion
as it was then. But we must kepe it
onely there where brotherly love requyreth
it / As when saint Paule circumsised

            ¶Of men of warre and of the warre
whether the Christen may warre
without synne an informacyon
after the Gospell.
Chaptre
.xxix.
            
               THe men of warre haue nothing
in the gospell for the
gospell knoweth no mē of
warre nor the warre but onely
peace. Albeit that many
doctoures sey that the
men of warre is a thing resonable & good
bicause of the wordes of saint Iohn baptist
who as (writeth saint Luke in the gospell)
answered vnto the men of warre ax
               
                  •
               ing
him whate thing they shulde do to be
saved that they shuld hurte nomā but shulde
be contented with theire wages. By
these wordes will the doctours and / Theologyens
saye that the men of warre may
warre pill and do evill without synne.
But they vnderstond not the wordes of
saint Iohn.
            ye must vnderstond that the teching of
saint Iohn brought noman vnto full perfectiō.
It did but onely make redy the hert

of man vnto god and vnto the teaching o
                  •
               
Iesu christ. He rebuked the most grettes
                  •
               
euilles by his preaching. He did but onely
teche the beginning of rightuousnesse / a
                  •
               
though he wolde haue seyed: If I shuld
all ar
                  •
               once forbid you to warre / ye migh
                  •
               
not yet for your wekenesse suffer it 
                  •
                nor ye
                  •
               
might not leve
                  •
               t all sodeynly. But beginne
first to 
                  •
               eue the most grettest evill as to
do hurt and outrage vnto other / as to burne / 
to kill / to pill and so forth. And be alweyes
content with your wages.
            So was saint Iohn Baptist none other
thing but as a man that abateth and
cutteth of from a pece of timber the most
gretest knotres. He doth it not to thintent
that it shulde abide so. But whē the knottes
and warres be cut of then comith a better
master carpenter that planeth it & maketh
it more smothe with a large fine rabot.
Likewise did saint Iohn by his preaching / 
he did but onely abate and cut of
the grete knottes / that is to sey / the grete
sinnes. And yet they were not clene taken
away 
                  •
               nd cut of till an other better master
workman came after and 
                  •
               ut them of with
his fine rabot. And therfore was he nothing

els but a voyte crying in the deserte
whiche cryed:Esa. 40 Make redy the wey of the
lorde: make 
                  ••
               reyght his fete pathes.
            He was not the light as saieth saint Iohn
the Evaungelist. He coude not pardone
oure sinnes / for he was not Christ.Iohn. 1
            
            He was but onely a voyce a foregoar and
a shewer whiche made redy the wey ageinst
the coming of Christ.
            And for this cause did Saint Iohn sende
his disciples to Iesu Christ / when he
shulde die to thintent that they might lerne
the full perfection of him. For he had
but onely made them redy for to come vnto
christ. for this cause & reason it is al manifest
that saint Iohn hath not preised the
warre by these wordes / but hath rather
forboden it: As teacheth all the gospell. for
as it is a thing evill agreing that the hōde
fight ageinst the hede / So is it a thing as
evell agreing and grete sinne that one
Christen warre ageinst the other.Ro. 12 For
we are all bretheren and membres of one
body / the body is Christe / whiche in all
his life preached peace and concorde to all
theim that he taught.
            Saynt Iohn in his fyrst epistle saieth:1. Ioh. 4
               
He that hateth his brother is an homicide
We may hate noman / we must love oure
enemyes / we must pray for theym and do
good vnto theym that persecute vs. How
can it then be possible after the gospell that
we may warre without sinne? wherin so
many people lose theyre livis and wherby
so many parsones come to wildenesse ryot
and evill life. There be textes in the canon
lawe that suffre some warres. But the reehing
of Christ forbiddeth all warres.
            It is a thing horrible and daungerous
for body and soule to enterpryse & move
a warre. For all malice reyneth in tyme
of warre. Neverthelesse when a cuntrey
is invaded or a towne beseged & whē
the comon peace is troubled / and grete violence
is done vnto the subiectes: the lord
of that cuntrey ys bounde by brotherly
love to helpe hys subiectes / and to defende
theym to punysshe the evyll / and to
put hys lyfe yn ieoperdy for hys subiectes.
            But he must alweyes beware that he
do it not to revenge his owne wronge / or
for to enlarge his londe and lordship / but
onely to defende his subiectes. And so may

he vse the horrible businesse of the warre / 
charitably and christenly.
            But if it were possible to agre for golde
or silver / he is bounde to do it. For the
life of a chrilren is more worth then all the
richesse of the worlde.
            A lorde shall thinke alweyes that there
is a king aboue him in heve bifore who
me all parsones shall yeld accompte at the
last day of iugement ye of the lest workes
and thoughtes that he shall do / be he king
or Emperour / 
                  〈…〉
                / nobill
or ignoble / yong or olde.
            We rede that the people of Israell did
warre many tymes but theire warres were1. Co. 10
but all figures / As saieth saint Paule.
wherfore it betokeneth to vs that we shal
likewise fight not the one ageynst the other / 
but ageynst oure silves / that

ageynst pryde wrath covitize /

for temporall rewardes. For thou mayst

God.
            Therfore thou shalt do thy laboure diligently
and ioyfully / not as though thou
didest sarve a man / but as though thou didest
serve God / as truely thou doest.
            For so doeth saint Paul teche the writing
to the Ephesians where he saieth:Ephe. Servauntes
obey vnto youre carnall mastres / 
with feare and trembling in ynnocency of
your hartes as vnto Iesu christ / not with
service in the yie 
                  •
               ight as men pleasers / 
but as the servauntes of Christ doing the
will of god with all your hartes with good
will / even as though ye served the lord
and not men.
            Remembre also that whatesoever good
eny man doth / that shall he receyve ageynCol. 3
of the lorde whether he be bonde or fre,
and ageyn vnto the Colossians. Servauntes
(saieth he) obey vnto your bodily mastres
in all thinges / not with yie service as
mē plesers / but in simplicite or ynnocency
of hert fearing the lord god. Do all that
ye do with a good will / as though ye dyd

men / knowing that ye shall receive of the
lord the reward of enherifaunce for ye vo
serve the lord Christ. But he that doth
wrong shall receyve for the wrong that
he hath done: for there is no respect of parsones.1. Pe. 
                     •
                  
               
And also saint Petre saieth in hys
first epistle. Servauntes be subiect in all
feare vnto your lordes not onely vnto the
good and courteys / but also though they
be froward. For it comith of grace if a mā
for conscience toward God endure griefe
suffering wrongfully. For whate preyse
is it if when ye be beten for your fautes ye
take it paciently? But and if when ye do
well ye suffer wrong and take it paciently / then
are ye grete thank worthy byfore
god. Therfore thou shalt in all thinges haue
god alweyes bifore thyne yies and not
the men whome thou servest outwardly.
As did Paule the bisshoppe whiche put hī
               silf
into the service of the lordes for the sonne
of a widowe. And bicause that he had
given all his goodes for the will of God.
He gaue also him silf into service for the love
of God / for to deliver the sonne of the
wydowe.
            Be not sory that thy mastre both not

suffre the to go to the churche to here masse
For thou mayst please god aswell in doyng
thy worke by suche a good intent as
though thou were in the churche whē thou
belevest: but thou must do thy laboure
in suche a faith as is bifore sayd. God regardeth
not whate thing we do or in whate
place we be: but of whate courage ād in
whate feith we do it.
            The servauntes shall take good hede
that they anger not theyre maystre or mastresse.
And when it shall so happon that
then incontinent they axe theym forgy venesse.
He shall alweys honoure his mastre
bering his hasty wordes / keping him silfe
that he do not rebell and answer spitefully
vnto his master.Gen For thou art bounde to
support him and to gyve place vnto hym
As the aungell taught vnto Agar the servaunt

mastresse as it is writen in the .xvi. chaptre
of Geneūs where the aungell came vnto
her and sayde: Go and tourne toward thy
lady and humble thy silf vnder her honde
So shulde the servaunt humble him stife
vnder his lord / and when he hath angred
him / to appayse him ageyn with humble

demeanure and obedience. So did Saint
Paule make agremēt bitwixt Onesimus
and Philemon from whome he was fled

and membres of one body (that is)
of Iesus Christ wherfore thou shalt not

or vnreasonable: but thou shalt vse
theym as membres of thine owne body
For Christ is oure hede / and we all to gyther
be his body / & every one of vs by him

woman / lord or servaunt / riche or pore: as

like asses / not like men / nor like theyre owne

exhorteth you to entrete your servauntes
with all swetenesse. Ye masters (saieth he)
shewe the same love & dilection vnto your
servauntes that they shewe vnto you / absteyning
your silf from threteninges remē

And there is no respect of persones bifore
him. And vnto the Colossians: ye masters
do vnto your servauntes that whicheCol. 1
is iust ād egall remembring that ye haue
also a master in heven. Neverthelesse
although the mastres be rigorous & hard
yet I counceile (with Saint Petre in his
first epistle) all servauntes that they take
all that theire masters & mastresses ley vnto
theire charge paciently / & that for the love
of god / if it be not so that they commaunde
